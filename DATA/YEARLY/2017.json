Background\n[1] Ms. Linda Mills filed a complaint with the Commission dated March 16, 2015. She alleges Bell Mobility Inc. (\u201cBell\u201d) discriminated against her on the grounds of her physical and cognitive disabilities, pursuant to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the \u201cAct\u201d). She claims Bell refused to provide her with same-day activation service for a new cellular phone she needed on July 11, 2014, unless she appeared in person to be visually identified at one of Bell\u2019s retail stores to purchase the phone. At that time, Ms. Mills was primarily bedridden due to ongoing chemotherapy and was not to go out except in emergencies as her immune system was at risk.\n[2] The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) was requested by the Commission to initiate an inquiry into the complaint on January 14, 2016, pursuant to section 44(3)(a) of the Act.\n[3] A hearing was held in London, Ontario from the 12th to the 18th of October, 2016. At the hearing, Ms. Mills attended and testified as a witness on her own behalf and her son, Mr. Ian Philp, also testified as a witness for her. Mr. Philp is a lawyer who works in New York from where he testified by Skype. Ms. Ikram Warsame, counsel for the Commission, also attended the hearing to represent the public interest. While Ms. Mills put several questions to the witnesses and made closing submissions, it was Ms. Warsame who examined Ms. Mills and her son, cross-examined Bell\u2019s witnesses and made opening and closing submissions for the Commission. Three employees testified on behalf Bell: Mr. Serdar Yavuz, Senior Manager, Credit and Collections; Ms. Rosanna Caporuscio, Senior Manager, Customer Care; and, Mr. Lawrence Lau, Director, Business Process.\n[4] I found all of the witnesses who testified in this case to be forthright, and credible. Additionally, I found Ms. Mills to be both courageous and inspirational. Finally, I am grateful for the cooperation and excellent work in this case by Ms. Warsame and Bell\u2019s counsel, Mr. VanDyk.\n[5] For the reasons that follow, I find Ms. Mills\u2019 complaint is substantiated.\nII. Applicable provisions of the Act\n[6] Sections 2, 3(1), 5, 15(1)(g), 15(2), 53(2)(a) and (e), 53(3) and 53(4) of the Act are applicable in this case and provide as follows:\n2 The purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.\n3 (1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.\n\u2026\n5 It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\n(a) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\n(b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n\u2026\n15 (1) It is not a discriminatory practice if\u2026\n(g) in the circumstances described in section 5 or 6, an individual is denied any goods, services, facilities or accommodation or access thereto or occupancy of any commercial premises or residential accommodation or is a victim of any adverse differentiation and there is bona fide justification for that denial or differentiation.\n(2) For any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) to be considered to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement and for any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(g) to be considered to have a bona fide justification, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost.\n\u2026\n53 (2) If at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may, subject to section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice and include in the order any of the following terms that the member or panel considers appropriate:\n(a) that the person cease the discriminatory practice and take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in future, including\n(i) the adoption of a special program, plan or arrangement referred to in subsection 16(1), or\n(ii) making an application for approval and implementing a plan under section 17;\n\u2026\n(e) that the person compensate the victim, by an amount not exceeding twenty thousand dollars, for any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n(3) In addition to any order under subsection (2), the member or panel may order the person to pay such compensation not exceeding twenty thousand dollars to the victim as the member or panel may determine if the member or panel finds that the person is engaging or has engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly.\n(4) Subject to the rules made under section 48.9, an order to pay compensation under this section may include an award of interest at a rate and for a period that the member or panel considers appropriate.\nIII. Facts\nA. Ms. Mills\u2019 health and disability\n[7] The parties either agreed with or did not contest the facts concerning Ms. Mills\u2019 health and disability and the events that took place on July 11, 2014.\n[8] Ms. Mills became ill and was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in December of 2013. At the time, she was working as a school Principal. She underwent unsuccessful abdominal surgery to remove the cancer in January 2014. As a result of a biopsy of the tumor, it was determined that she had acute lymphoblastic leukemia rather than pancreatic cancer. After a two week period of recovery from the surgery, she commenced an inpatient phased chemotherapy program for the leukemia in February of 2014. However, the effects of the strong dosages of this therapy caused her to have a stroke, followed by seizures between March 12th and 14th that almost caused her death. Following the seizures, she needed assistance to breathe and was placed in intensive care. She has no recollection for about 10 days of that dark period of her life. Fortunately, she survived and was then sent for rehabilitation from the stroke and seizures. She also resumed her chemotherapy at 50 per cent of the dosage she had previously received.\n[9] As a result of the stroke and seizures, Ms. Mills was initially paralyzed on her whole right side and could not speak. After seven weeks of rehabilitation in Toronto, she was cleared to go back home to London for further recovery, physiotherapy and chemotherapy in May of 2014. After she returned home to London, she was still in a severely weakened state both physically and mentally. As a result of the chemotherapy and her illnesses, her weight decreased from her pre-surgery weight of 150 pounds to just over 100 pounds in July and 97 pounds in November of 2014. She was medically certified as disabled with a negative prognosis, including a proposed 3 year chemotherapy treatment plan. She was approved for permanent long term disability benefits and did not return to work when the next school year started in September of 2014. In November of 2014 she was hospitalized again for 3 weeks as a result of her deteriorated health condition and lack of protein caused by the chemotherapy.\nB. The events of July 11, 2014\n[10] The events giving rise to this case occurred on July 11, 2014. At that time, Ms. Mills was completely bed ridden at home in a very weak condition both physically and mentally. She could not walk on her own and had significant cognitive and immune system deficiencies as a result of her stroke, seizures, leukemia and the chemotherapy. She was then still partially paralyzed and could not speak properly or go to the bathroom by herself. She was unable to focus or concentrate properly as a result of the stroke and seizures and suffered from aphasia and apraxia. She had orders from her doctor not to go out except in emergencies as she was too weak and her immune system was at risk. Physiotherapy was given to her at home and she only left home for chemotherapy and then only with a wheelchair and with the help of others.\n[11] She needed a new cellular phone as the phone she had from her employer needed to be returned as she was not going back to work. She wanted to be able to have the new cellular phone available in case she needed to contact her family or medical help when she was alone. As such, she made arrangements with her son, Mr. Philp, on a planned visit from him on July 11, 2014, to have him go to a store for her and pick up a new cellular phone and set up the phone so she could use it on the same-day.\n[12] Mr. Philp was her \u201cgo to\u201d person for technical matters, like setting up a cell phone, especially given her state of health as it existed on July 11, 2014. According to Ms. Mills, she could not possibly have programmed a cellular phone herself given her cognitive deficiencies as they existed at that time and she could not have safely gone to a store to pick up the phone given her physical and health restrictions.\n[13] Ms. Mills has been a loyal customer of Bell Canada for over 42 years for various residential services including internet, fax, television and land line phone service that she was satisfied with and always paid for in full and on time. Bell Canada had her address, phone number and credit history as a result of her being a long-time customer. On July 11, 2014, Mr. Philp contacted Bell by phone from his mother\u2019s residence on three occasions to try to make arrangements to buy and pick up a new cell phone for her by bringing all her required identification to a retail store and have the phone activated that day so that he could bring it back to her and set it up for use while he was visiting her. He was not able to make those arrangements as he was told by Bell representatives who he spoke with that, despite her disabilities, if his mother wanted to purchase, obtain and activate a new cell phone that day, she would have to appear in-person at a retail store as Bell had a policy requiring in-person attendance at the store for same-day activation by the person buying the phone.\n[14] Mr. Philp fully advised the Bell representatives that he spoke with on that day about his mother\u2019s physical and mental condition, and inability to attend in-person due to her health and disabilities. He explained that it was not that she was unwilling to attend in person, rather that she was unable through no fault or choice of her own to attend in person at a store. He also explained that she could not program the phone herself without him and that he was visiting only that day. He told the Bell representatives that attending in-person at a store was contrary to his mother\u2019s doctor\u2019s orders and prejudicial to her health.\n[15] He also told the Bell representatives that he was willing to bring in all of the identification required, including a government approved photo of her, such as a passport, and a credit card. She did not have a driver\u2019s licence then as it had been revoked as a result of her disability and medical condition. He further suggested to the Bell representatives that they access her long and excellent credit history with Bell Canada to confirm her identity and capacity to pay. He also offered to put her on the telephone to verify that she was there and willing to have him act for her. He also offered to bring in a Power of Attorney that she had signed in his favour several years earlier, and that was still valid, authorizing him to act for her. He also offered to take the contract for the purchase of the phone back to her at her residence to be signed by her and bring it back to the store after which they could call her at her home phone and speak to her to verify her identity. None of these offers by Mr. Philp were acceptable to the Bell representatives he spoke with that day.\n[16] In the end, the Bell representatives advised Mr. Philp that there was no room for discretion or accommodation in Bell\u2019s rule that, if his mother wanted to buy a new cell phone and have it activated for herself on the same day, she had to attend in person at a retail store--even in her disabled condition. They did suggest that she could go online or phone a toll free number from home and order a phone with a credit card showing her residential address; and, the phone would be delivered by courier within a few days at the residential address given. While other in-store options were available, the Bell representatives did not advise Mr. Philp of these options. Those additional options are discussed below at paragraphs 33 and 34.\n[17] Finally, as Ms. Mills felt that she needed a new cellular phone that day, and was frankly angered, she decided to get out of bed and get dressed with the help of her son and go to a Bell store in a shopping mall in London. She bought the new cellular phone on a postpaid basis and had it activated that day after being identified with picture ID and a credit card in the store and signing a contract. It was an arduous and dangerous thing for her to do in her condition, but she felt she had no choice given she wanted it activated that day so her son could help her start using it while he was visiting her. It took her over an hour to get ready and be driven to the mall and moved by wheelchair into the store in order to get the phone and be visually identified in the store. Once in the store, the process took no more than 5 minutes. She testified that the store employees were kind to her when she was there and she felt that they were embarrassed to see her there then, bald from chemotherapy, in a wheelchair, weighing around 100 pounds and having to identify herself in-person in that condition, despite her and her son\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to try to avoid such a scene.\n[18] Later that day, with her son\u2019s help, Ms. Mills emailed a letter of complaint to Bell Canada Customer Service explaining what had occurred. She asked Bell to change its policy to allow disabled people, who cannot attend in-person at a store and need same-day cellular phone activation, to be able to obtain that service like other able bodied Canadians. She testified that she sent the email that day, but never received a response from Bell.\n[19] Once she felt better in March of 2015, Ms. Mills filed the complaint in this matter. According to Ms. Mills, she did not file the complaint for herself, as she had already obtained the new cellular phone she needed on July 11, 2014. Rather, she sent the email and filed the complaint for other people who were disabled, ill and alone and not able to move around their residence, or get to a store themselves; and, need a cellular phone handy to keep them in touch with family and medical help without waiting for a phone to be delivered several days later. In Ms. Mills\u2019 opinion, she was more fortunate than many disabled Canadians as she had the resources and the help of family to be able to get the new cellular phone she needed on July 11, 2014. In her view, a cell phone is a \u201clife line\u201d for her and many disabled people, particularly in emergencies when they are bed ridden and without someone to care for them.\nC. Bell Mobility and its Retail Activation Standards\n[20] BCE Inc. is a publicly traded holding company that is Canada\u2019s largest communications company and one of the largest companies in Canada by market capitalization, revenues and net income, all of which is in the billions of dollars annually. One of its main assets is Bell Canada which is Canada\u2019s largest telecommunications company. Bell Mobility is a subsidiary of Bell Canada and sells mobile communication devices such as cellular phones and cellular voice and data usage plans to consumers and businesses across Canada.\n[21] Bell has several hundred corporate-owned retail stores across Canada. The stores employ 350 managers and 2,200 front-line, non-management employees (commonly referred to as \u201cSales Representatives\u201d). In the retail stores, Sales Representatives sell Bell\u2019s services and products, including new cellular phones, to the public and assist with the activation of new accounts.\n[22] Cellular phones can either be purchased in a retail store outright (prepaid) or subsidized by Bell over a two year contract (postpaid). They can also be purchased online or over the phone. The vast majority (99%) of Bell\u2019s customers choose to attend at retail stores to buy, activate and receive their new cell phones the same day, rather than purchase online or over the phone.\n[23] With a two year postpaid contract, the customer whose name is on the account pays the cost of the phone, as well as ongoing usage costs, over the two year term rather than prepaying all costs upfront. Currently, a cell phone may cost as much as $1400 for the latest and best model. A customer can buy up to 10 devices postpaid and when doing so, after signing the contract, will leave the store with the devices fully activated for use and a promise to pay over the term of the contract.\n[24] Because of the nature of the mobile device market, where an individual can agree to pay for the devices on a subsidized basis and then walk out of the retail store with one or more activated devices, Bell is a target for fraud by individuals seeking to commit identity theft fraud and profit by activating mobile devices and plans in the name of other people. This occurs thousands of times each year, resulting in losses to Bell (and in some cases to fraud victims, and finance\/insurance companies) of millions of dollars annually. The specific incidence and monetary statistics of fraud that were presented at the hearing are not included in this decision as agreed to, but they represent between 1 and 2 percent of activations and several millions of dollars lost annually. The statistics presented by Bell did not identify the losses that were directly attributable to identify theft fraud, as opposed to any other type of fraud.\n[25] Identity fraud can occur in various ways, including stolen identification documents, forged identification documents (that today can be \u201cdoctored\u201d in very sophisticated ways digitally and otherwise even with government ID), or paying customers for their identification documents with no intention of paying for the device or the services. In identity theft fraud, the fraudster is leaving the store with the activated device and, in addition to the subsidy on the device, the fraudster is likely using a stolen credit card to pay for any upfront cost of the device. The device can then be used by the fraudster or sold to someone else. Furthermore, the cellular phone has a SIM card inside that can be taken out and sold, and\/or used by someone else, resulting in unauthorized data and long distance charges that can run to the tens of thousands of dollars before being detected and shut down.\n[26] The victim of the fraud whose identification or identity has been stolen pays for the devices and services before the fraud is detected by Bell or reported. It can take up to 3 or 4 months before the situation is corrected. These victims are put in the difficult position of demonstrating to Bell that they were the victim of a crime and that they did not actually activate the device or services. Credit ratings can be impacted because of this. Credit card companies and insurers may also end up being on the hook for losses and, as mentioned above, Bell as well.\n[27] In order to prevent this type of fraud and protect members of the public from identity theft fraud, Bell has put in place retail fraud policies which, it submits, are consistent with industry standards. These policies are found in its Retail Activation Standards and require that any person activating a new cellular phone, without exception, must appear in-person, show government photo identification and pass a credit check before they are permitted to enter into a postpaid contract, activate an account for the cellular phone and leave the store with the phone. Bell accepts a valid Driver\u2019s License, Canadian passport, Canadian Citizenship Card, Indian Status Identity Card or an official Provincial Photo ID. These pieces of identification have various hallmarks of authenticity that make them difficult to forge: they can be read by ID scanners and they represent that, before issuing them, the government has taken appropriate steps to verify the identity of the person holding the ID. According to Bell, these same standards are applied similarly by all of its competitors in the market it operates in.\n[28] Bell Sales Representatives are trained to follow, without any discretion or exception, the Retail Activation Standards and not deviate from them even in cases involving disabled people like Ms. Mills. This is because of the threat of fraud and the potential monetary losses from the fraud that may be incurred by Bell (and possibly the fraud victim, credit companies and insurance companies, as the case may be). Potential fraud is the sole reason for the standard requiring the person buying a new cellular phone on a postpaid basis to attend at a retail store in person to be visually identified by a sales representative.\n[29] The Bell Sales Representatives are not trained for exceptions like the use of Powers of Attorney, which are handled offsite, over a number of days, by a small centralized group of highly trained and very experienced service agents. This is because Powers of Attorney have none of the hallmarks of authenticity that government issued identification has. Moreover, according to Bell, its sales workforce at its retail stores has a high turnover rate, resulting in heightened chance of errors being made if Sales Representatives have the opportunity to use discretion to make exceptions to rules.\n[30] There was no evidence adduced by Bell as to how much it would cost to provide accommodation for disabled persons from its rule requiring in-person attendance at retail stores for visual inspection to purchase a new cellular phone on a postpaid basis in cases like Ms. Mills\u2019; or, whether such accommodation would increase the incidence or cost of fraud. Nor was there any evidence given by Bell that it ever looked into the possibility of accommodation from its rule for Ms. Mills in this case; that it ever considered making any changes to its rule in this regard to accommodate disabled people; or, that it ever turned its mind to an assessment of the potential costs and implications of doing so in order to accommodate disabled people by relaxing or changing its rule for them. Also, the evidence was that Bell does not have policies for or provide training to its Sales Representatives in human rights or its obligations under the Act.\n[31] It was suggested by Mr. Philp that the disabled group of people his mother was part of that needed to be accommodated would likely be very small and the costs likely very low, given the statistics provided by Bell about the annual numbers of activations and fraud costs. Mr. Philp testified that he felt that even if there was a chance of fraud, the costs would be extremely minimal in the big picture for Bell and would be akin to the costs of providing other types of accommodation for physically disabled people, such as access ramps that are seen to be an acceptable cost of doing business in Canada.\n[32] According to Bell, if a customer wishes to purchase and activate a new postpaid cellular phone, but is unable or unwilling to visit a retail store in-person to be visually identified with proper identification, they may do so online or over the phone. Bell does not require visual identification for over the phone or online orders, because the phone will be shipped to the address on the credit card given. Bell is further protected from fraud in online and phone activations because it can track the transaction with other information made available to it, including telephone numbers and IP addresses.\n[33] However, if the customer is purchasing the new cell phone either by phone or on line, the new cell phone will not be delivered until several days after it is ordered. As mentioned above, instead of waiting days for a new phone to be delivered after ordering it online or over the phone, 99% of Bell\u2019s customers choose to buy their new cellular phones in retail stores where they can pick them up there, post pay, and have them activated on the same day after signing a contract. While the online and phone purchase ordering alternatives were offered by Bell as an option to Ms. Mills on July 11, 2014, she was not willing to do this because the phone would not have been delivered or activated that day that she needed it.\n[34] As mentioned above, Bell also had two other options that were not presented to Ms. Mills on July 11, 2014 that allow a customer who is unable or unwilling to visit a retail store in person to be able to acquire and activate a new cell phone on the same day without attending at the store in-person to be visually identified. The first such option is for the customer to prepay the entire retail cost of the phone and also a certain amount of usage (data or calling minutes) in advance through another person who attends on their behalf at the store. However, Ms. Mills submits this option is only feasible if the customer has the means to cover the prepaid costs of the phone. That is, this option imposes a financial burden on customers who cannot attend in-store that is not imposed on other customers. Again, the vast majority of Bell\u2019s customers, whether disabled or not, opt to purchase their cellular phone on a postpaid basis, with same-day activation.\n[35] The second option is for another individual to attend at the retail store in person to purchase and activate the cell phone that day in their name but, thereafter, to transfer the account and device into the name of the customer who is unable or unwilling to attend at the store. However, again, the device must be prepaid in order to be able to transfer it. Under this option, Ms. Mills submits not only must the customer have the means to cover the prepaid costs of the phone, but it also assumes they can find someone who is willing and able to obtain the phone in their name and take on the payment responsibility pending the transfer process being completed.\n[36] As previously stated, neither of these last two options were provided by Bell to Ms. Mills or her son on July 11, 2014. In fact, they were not presented to Ms. Mills until just before the start of the hearing and were only made into a Bell policy in August of 2016 after the hearing dates were set and not that long before the hearing commenced. In any event, as indicated above, Ms. Mills and her son both testified that these options do not address the issue of substantively equal treatment for disabled people who want to have same-day activation of new cell phone purchases, on a postpaid basis, without having to prepay the cost or find and rely on someone else who is willing and able to obtain the phone in their name and take on the payment responsibility pending the transfer of responsibility process being completed.\nIV. Analysis\nA. Legal Framework\n[37] Disabled individuals should have an opportunity equal with all other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices (see s. 2 of the Act). A company that provides a service customarily available to the general public, cannot deny or deny access to the service, or differentiate adversely in relation to any individual, based on disability (see s. 5 of the Act).\n[38] In the adjudication of human rights complaints before the Tribunal, a complainant has the burden of proof of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is \u201c\u2026one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent\u201d. [1] In this case, under section 5 of the Act, Ms. Mills must establish that 1) she has or had a disability; 2) that she was denied a service or was adversely differentiated against in the provision of a service customarily made available by Bell to the general public; and, 3) that her disability was a factor, though not necessarily the sole or only factor, in that denial or adverse treatment. [2]\n[39] A respondent may avoid an adverse finding by calling evidence to show its action is not discriminatory or by establishing a statutory defense that justifies the discrimination. In this case, Bell argues its Retail Activation Standards had no adverse impact on the complainant. Alternatively, it submits the application of its Retail Activation Standards are not discriminatory because reasonable alternative accommodations were available and removing the standards would constitute an undue hardship given the additional risk of fraud and identity theft to Bell and the public.\n[40] With regard to Bell\u2019s undue hardship argument, section 15(1)(g) of the Act provides that it is not a discriminatory practice if there is a bona fide justification for any denial or adverse differentiation in services. Section 15(2) of the Act further provides that, to be considered to have a bona fide justification, Bell must establish that accommodation of Ms. Mills\u2019 needs would impose an undue hardship on it, considering health, safety and cost. To establish a bona fide justification and corresponding undue hardship, the parties agree that Bell must, on a balance of probabilities, prove that [3] :\nit adopted the standard for a purpose or goal that is rationally connected to the function being performed;\nit adopted the standard in good faith, in the belief that it is necessary for the fulfillment of the purpose or goal; and\nthe standard is reasonably necessary to accomplish its purpose or goal, in the sense that the defendant cannot accommodate persons with the characteristics of the claimant without incurring undue hardship.\n[41] Establishing a bona fide justification for a prima facie violation of human rights legislation requires a respondent to show that it has made every possible accommodation short of undue hardship. [4] That is, \u201c[i]f a reasonable alternative exists to burdening members of a group with a given rule, that rule will not be bona fide\u201d. [5]\n[42] Again, disability related needs attract accommodative protection for the disabled under the law. The concept of reasonable accommodation recognizes \u201cthe right of persons with disabilities to the same access as those without disabilities\u201d. [6] That access is generally not achieved by simply providing alternatives or treating everyone the same. Substantive equality may require that positive steps be taken to ensure that disadvantaged groups benefit equally from services offered to the general public. [7] That is, \u201c[u]ndue hardship implies that there may necessarily be some hardship in accommodating someone\u2019s disability, but unless that hardship imposes an undue or unreasonable burden, it yields to the need to accommodate\u201d. [8]\n[43] Finally, if a complaint is substantiated, an order can be made against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice. Otherwise, if the complaint is not substantiated, it is dismissed (see s. 53 of the Act).\nB. Issues\n[44] Based on the legal framework outlined above, the issues to be determined in this case are as follows:\nHas Ms. Mills met her burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination, on the basis of a disability, pursuant to section 5 of the Act?\nIf Ms. Mills has proven a prima facie case of discrimination, has Bell established a bona fide justification for its prima facie discriminatory practice, on the basis of sections 15(1)(g) and 15(2) of the Act?\nIf Bell cannot establish a bona fide justification, should an order be made against it?\nC. Positions of the parties\n(i) Ms. Mills and the Commission\u2019s position\n[45] According to Ms. Mills and the Commission, a prima facie case has been established on the evidence adduced. Bell subjected Ms. Mills to adverse or negative treatment in respect of a service customarily available to the public, namely same-day activation of a new cellular phone purchased on a subsidized postpaid basis. It did not accommodate her when it knew that she was prevented by her physical and cognitive disabilities from attending at a retail store to be visually inspected before obtaining the cellular phone.\n[46] Same-day activation service in the purchase of a new subsidized cellular phone is the service customarily available to the general public that is not provided to physically disabled, bedridden individuals, like Ms. Mills. This is because of the requirement that customers attend at retail stores in-person to be visually identified before purchasing the new cellular phone on a postpaid basis--a requirement that disabled individuals like Ms. Mills are unable (rather than being unwilling) to comply with. Accordingly, the service customarily made available by Bell to the general public is not simply the provision of access to its services and products as argued by Bell. Rather, it is same-day activation for the purchase of postpaid new cellular phones, like other Canadians are able to obtain, as they are able to attend in person at a retail store to be visually identified, unlike disabled people like Ms. Mills. Reasonable accommodation for disabled people like Ms. Mills is necessary to eliminate the inequity in providing the service of same-day phone activation. None was provided in this case, in spite of there being no tangible evidence that it would have been impossible for Bell to do so without suffering undue hardship.\n[47] Online and over the phone purchase ordering alternatives do not provide Ms. Mills and other disabled Canadians, who cannot leave their homes due to a disability, with the needed same-day activation service of a new postpaid subsidized cellular phone like other Canadians are able to obtain by attending in-person at a retail store. This is because shipping and delivering these orders takes a number of days to occur.\n[48] Moreover, prepaying for a new cellular phone in order to obtain same-day service is not substantively equal to the service that most other Canadians enjoy when purchasing a new cellular phone on a postpaid subsidized basis. But for her disabilities preventing her from attending in-person at a store to be visually identified, Ms. Mills could have access to same-day postpaid service like other customers of Bell. It was not her choice or preference to be disabled and unable to access the service by personal attendance at a store on the day she needed the cellular phone. Her ultimate attendance at the store on July 11, 2014, when all other suggestions by her and her son were refused by Bell, was undertaken only at great risk and difficulty to her. This would not be possible for many other disabled persons who do not have a son, friend or family member to help them leave their bed and take them to the store.\n[49] Ms. Mills and the Commission further argue that Bell has failed to meet the legal test established in Grismer for a bona fide justification defense, and provided no tangible evidence that accommodating Ms. Mills and other disabled persons like her would be impossible without suffering undue hardship. Moreover, despite the fact that Bell adopted its Retail Activation Standards in good faith to try to abate fraud, it made no attempt to come up with a viable alternative to its rule requiring in-store personal identification to try to accommodate Ms. Mills\u2019 disability when it knew she could not attend at a store. Hence, Bell had no idea whether any accommodation alternative to the rule would cause it undue hardship. In this regard, the Commission points out that Bell admitted that it did not train its employees in human rights to address the needs of the disabled.\n[50] Bell failed to consider various alternatives to its Retail Activation Standards that would help disabled people, who are prevented by their disabilities from attending in-person for visual inspections at a store, to purchase a new cellular phone on a postpaid subsidized basis and obtain and activate the phone on the same day. These alternatives may also help to prevent fraud and include various different types of better and faster ID checking and credit checking; technologies such as \u201cSkyping\u201d or \u201cFacetiming\u201d with disabled customers allowing them to be visually inspected; training in store Sales Representatives to be able to take ID from a representative of the disabled, home bound, person as a guarantor or by way of Power of Attorney; and, same-day home courier service for phone and online orders within larger centres, as is currently being worked on by Bell.\n[51] Finally, Ms. Mills and the Commission submit that Bell did not provide evidence of a single case of fraud committed by an individual who opened an account on behalf of another customer, despite the evidence establishing that it allows anyone to order and activate a phone on behalf of a customer online or over the phone.\n(ii) Bell\u2019s position\n[52] According to Bell, the application of the Retail Activation Standards to Ms. Mills had no adverse impact on her. She was able to go to a retail store on July 11, 2014, in-person, and purchase and receive a new activated cellular phone on a postpaid subsidized basis. Furthermore, there were a number of additional options available to her that did not require her to go to a retail store in-person on that day in order to purchase a device and activate an account. One of these options was purchasing the phone from her home, online or over the phone, and having it shipped directly to her door. While this would not have resulted in her getting the phone on the same day, the expectation of same-day delivery is not reasonable. It is in the nature of a personal preference related to Ms. Mills\u2019 personal choice to have her son program the phone that day and is not a service or a disability-related need protected by the Act. Ms. Mills already had an activated cellular phone from her employer that she could have used on the day in question and until her son or someone else programmed a new phone delivered to her house several days after ordering it online or by phone.\n[53] The service being offered by Bell is its products and services that are available to all Canadians, whether disabled or not, on the same basis with various alternatives to access. A delivery time on the same day as the purchase of one of its products, such as a new cellular phone, is not the service but is rather a choice or personal preference. Delivery time for a cellular phone a couple of days after, rather than on the same day of purchase, is a consequence of a choice by the customer of the alternative he or she chooses to receive the product, whether disabled or not. The personal or preferred choice of Ms. Mills in the case at hand was brought about by her desire to have her son available on the day in question and not because of any disability related reason. The service that she would have got had she used any of the alternatives would not have been a diminished service. It would have been the same service offered to an able bodied person who made the same choice.\n[54] Alternatively, Bell argues that, if there was an adverse impact to Ms. Mills by the use of the Retail Activation Standards rule requiring in-person attendance at a retail store to purchase and have a cellular phone activated that day, and plan usage on a postpaid basis, the rule meets the three part Grismer test. Hence, the burden of proving the existence of a bona fide justification has been met by Bell.\n[55] With respect to the first part of the test, the Retail Activation Standards are clearly rationally connected to the objective of preventing fraud through identity theft. The evidence showed that the most reliable means of preventing fraud in the mobile device market is to ensure that the person walking out of the retail store with a device and a SIM card is the same person who will be responsible for paying the costs of the account.\n[56] With respect to the second part of the test, there is no evidence to suggest that the standard was adopted in bad faith for anything but its stated purpose, which is to combat fraud and potential fraud. Bell believes this standard is necessary to prevent fraud in the retail setting. It is applied neutrally to everyone seeking to purchase and activate a device on a postpaid subsidized basis. In other settings where there is little risk of fraud, such as online and telephone sales, Bell applies other standards as appropriate in the circumstances.\n[57] With respect to the third part of the test, when Ms. Mills\u2019 preferred accommodation of relaxing the standard increases the risk of fraud and identity theft to Bell and the public, and there are several reasonable alternatives available to her, it would be undue hardship to require Bell to relax its standard. Various reasonable alternatives, such ordering a phone online or over the phone, or prepaying the cost of the phone, are available. While none of them relax the standard, as preferred by Ms. Mills, they are applied equally to all persons and they provide a high level of service. The increased risk, with all of the attendant costs of relaxing the standard as preferred by Ms. Mills, in a competitive world where all of Bell\u2019s competitors have the same standard, would create undue hardship for Bell.\n[58] A disabled individual like Ms. Mills claiming accommodation does not have a claim or entitlement to their preferred form of accommodation if other reasonable accommodation is available. She must accept a reasonable alternative accommodation that meets her disability-related needs even if it may not be the preferred or most convenient one. In this case the accommodation alternatives offered were reasonable and she did have another cellular phone available to her on the day in question and its return was not imminent.\n[59] There may be financial consequences to Ms. Mills of a reasonable disability accommodation, but that does not render it unreasonable or discriminatory. The financial consequences of not being able to purchase a postpaid subsidized cellular phone and have it activated on the same day, as a result of not being able to attend at the store in-person to be identified visually (ie. foregoing the potential subsidy), is not a disadvantage related to disability, and it is not one that is remedied under human rights law.\n[60] In sum, Bell submits that the one thing that Ms. Mills is insisting on, which is relaxing the Retail Activation Standards when a disabled person requests it, is the one thing that cannot be done by Bell without causing undue hardship. The point of undue hardship is reached when reasonable means of accommodation are exhausted, as in this case, and only unreasonable and impractical options remain. The accommodation requested by Ms. Mills is an unreasonable accommodation as it increases the risk of fraud to Bell and of identity theft to the public.\nD. Prima facie case established\n[61] I find Ms. Mills has met her burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination under section 5 of the Act, on the facts of this case as outlined above, for the following reasons:\nClearly Ms. Mills was disabled and her disability prevented her from attending at a store in-person to be visually identified on the day in question, without risking her health and safety.Her inability to attend in-person at a store without risking her health and safety was not some sort of personal preference or choice.It was the sad and unfortunate consequence and reality of her physical and mental disabilities.\nRegardless of Ms. Mills\u2019 reasons for wanting a cellular phone on the day in question or the availability of her other cellular phone, Bell offers the benefit of cellular phones for purchase by the public on a postpaid subsidized basis and with same-day activation. In fact, this purchase option is the preference of the vast majority of Bell\u2019s customers versus other purchasing options offered by Bell, such as ordering it on the phone or online and waiting days for it to be delivered; or, prepaying for it and foregoing the subsidy.In the circumstances of this case, the option to purchase a cellular phone on a postpaid basis, with same-day activation, is the essential nature of the benefit or service offered by Bell to the general public [9] . Ensuring disabled customers can access this benefit or service, on the same basis as all other customers, is part and parcel of making the service customarily available to the general public.\nUnfortunately, this benefit or service is denied to customers who are incapable of attending at a retail store to be visually identified in accordance with Bell\u2019s Retail Activation Standards. The alternatives made available by Bell to customers who are unable to attend at a store to purchase the phone in-person do not offer the same benefit or service: a postpaid cellular phone with same-day activation.\nIn the circumstances of this case, Ms. Mills had to risk her health and safety to be able to access the benefits of a postpaid cellular phone with same-day activation. Contrary to Bell\u2019s submissions, I find the fact that Ms. Mills did ultimately attend in-person at the store had a negative impact on her as it caused her great difficulty, was dangerous to her health and contrary to the medical advice of her doctor.Her attendance at the store was only made possible with the help of her son and was an act of desperation, frustration and anger brought about by Bell\u2019s adherence to its Retail Activation Standards.\nTherefore, Ms. Mills was adversely impacted by Bell only offering postpaid cellular phones, with same-day activation, for purchase in-store only; and, Ms. Mills\u2019 disability was a factor in her having to assume risks to her health and safety to ultimately be able to access the benefit of a postpaid cellular phone with same-day activation. While the Retail Activation Standards apply to all individuals, it has an adverse effect on those who cannot attend a Bell store in-person; or, those who may be able to attend, but with great difficulty and risk to their health, like Ms. Mills. Ms. Mills cannot benefit equally from Bell\u2019s provision, to the general public, of postpaid cellular phones with same-day activation.\nAs such, Ms. Mills was adversely differentiated against in the provision of a service by Bell within the meaning of section 5 of the Act.\n[62] For these reasons, I find Ms. Mills has established a prima facie case.\nE. Bona fide justification not established\n[63] I find Bell has not met its burden of proving that the events in this case are non-discriminatory, in that it had a bona fide justification for its policy or rule (of requiring individuals to appear in-person at a retail store to be visually identified before purchasing a cellular phone on a postpaid basis and have it activated the same day); and, that accommodating the needs of individuals like Ms. Mills would impose an undue hardship on Bell pursuant to sections 15(1)(g) and 15(2) of the Act.\n[64] Ms. Mills and the Commission did not dispute that the first two parts of the Grismer test are met by Bell in the sense that the Retail Activation Standard rule (requiring a person\u2019s attendance at a store for visual identification before purchasing a cellular phone on a postpaid subsidized contract and having it activated the same day) was adopted in good faith, in the belief that it was necessary for the purpose or goal of preventing identity fraud, and that it is rationally connected to the function of preventing that fraud. I agree. The real issue in this case relates to the third part of the test regarding \u201cundue hardship\u201d, as the parties have opposite positions on whether Bell has attained that threshold.\n[65] In Via, Abella J reviewed the law on the scope of the duty to accommodate and the meaning of undue hardship and affirmed that undue hardship can be established where:\n\u2026a standard or barrier is \u201creasonably necessary\u201d insofar as there is a \u201csufficient risk\u201d that a legitimate objective like safety would be threatened enough to warrant the maintenance of the discriminatory standard (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Borough of Etobicoke, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 202); where \u201csuch steps as may be reasonable to accommodate without undue interference in the operation of the employer\u2019s business and without undue expense to the employer\u201d have been taken (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at p. 555); where no reasonable alternatives are available (Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970); where only \u201creasonable limits\u201d are imposed on the exercise of a right (Eldridge, at para. 79); and, more recently, where an employer or service provider shows \u201cthat it could not have done anything else reasonable or practical to avoid the negative impact on the individual\u201d (Meiorin, at para. 38). The point of undue hardship is reached when reasonable means of accommodation are exhausted and only unreasonable or impracticable options for accommodation remain. [10]\n[66] I find Bell has failed to establish the third part of the Grismer test. It failed to produce any evidence that it assessed the cost or feasibility of any measures that could accommodate persons like Ms. Mills and whether those measures would result in undue hardship. This is likely a result of Bell\u2019s strict adherence to its Retail Activation Standards and its approach to this case generally.\n[67] As set forth in paragraphs 62(2) and (3), Bell wrongly concluded that the alternatives it offered to Ms. Mills provided her with the same level of service offered to the rest of its customers. Aside from those alternatives, no further alternatives were examined by Bell, such as those referred to in paragraph 50, to determine whether they could accommodate Ms. Mills\u2019 disability and provide her with a postpaid cellular phone with same-day activation without having her appear in-store and without Bell suffering undue hardship. Instead, it wrongly concluded that any alternatives proposed to its Retail Activation Standards were simply personal preferences of Ms. Mills, rather than a human rights issue that arises as part and parcel of the service it customarily makes available to the rest of the public. This incorrect conclusion was based upon Bell\u2019s characterization of the \u201cservice\u201d at issue in this case which, according to Bell, is the availability to all of its products and services; and, that all its services and products were available to be accessed through the alternatives it offered to Ms. Mills.\n[68] The alternatives Bell offered Ms. Mills do not provide her with substantive equity vis a vis the service Bell offers to the rest of its customers. The Federal Court\u2019s decision in Jodhan [11] is instructive on this point. In that case, the Court found that the fact that a visually impaired individual could have obtained the same government information available online by other means (phone, in person or by mail) did not reasonably accommodate the disabled person. The Court found that by failing to make government information and services on the internet accessible to visually impaired Canadians, the government denied the individual equal access to government services. Paragraphs 170, 172 and 174 of Jodhan are instructive to the main issue in this case:\n[170] In reviewing the Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence on reasonable accommodation, it is clear that these alternatives do not constitute substantively equal treatment. For example, in Via Rail, the proposed accommodation of thinner wheelchairs and employee assistance for the disabled was not substantively equal treatment. The new Via Rail cars had to be designed so that the disabled could use their own wheelchairs on the railcar. Similarly the websites must be designed so they are accessible. In Eldridge, deaf individuals who generally communicated using sign language had to be able to communicate at hospitals when obtaining medical services and the hospitals had to provide sign language interpretation services. Other forms of communication, such as by writing, were not a reasonable alternative.\n\u2026\n[172] In the case at bar, for a blind person to rely on telephoning a government number is not substantive equality with a sighted person who can obtain the same information and services online. First, there is the frustration of trying to reach a government number. Second, there is a loss of independence and dignity when having to rely on a sighted person to provide the information and services which the blind person could obtain online if the website was accessible. Third, the loss of freedom and instantaneous responses is significant. Fourth, there is evidence before the Court of how unreliable government information is when being mailed.\n\u2026\n[174] Based on the jurisprudence, the use of alternative channels is not a reasonable accommodation unless the respondent proved that it is not technically feasible to implement the CLF Standard or it would be so expensive that it would cause undue hardship in the context of a section 1 of the Charter defence. (Emphasis added)\n[69] Without ever considering possible alternatives for accommodation to its Retail Activation Standards, such as to ones referred to in paragraph 50, Bell could not have made a determination of whether putting them into place would have increased the risk of fraud and costs related thereto; affected its competitiveness in the market place; or, generally, imposed an undue hardship. As previously noted, there was no tangible evidence produced by Bell of the cost or feasibility of putting such alternatives into place.\n[70] For these reasons, I find Bell has not satisfied the third part of the Grismer test and, therefore, has not advanced a bona fide justification to the prima facie discrimination suffered by Ms. Mills.\nV. Complaint substantiated\n[71] For the foregoing reasons, I find Ms. Mills\u2019 complaint has been substantiated.\nVI. Order\n[72] Having found the complaint to be substantiated, I may make an order against Bell pursuant to section 53(2) of the Act.\nA. Positions of the parties\n(i) Ms. Mills and the Commission\u2019s position\n[73] Under section 53(2)(a) of the Act, the Commission asks the Tribunal to order that Bell take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to prevent the same or similar discriminatory practices from occurring in the future. Without limiting the generality of this request, the Commission submits that the following sorts of measures are warranted:\na. An order requiring Bell to adopt an accommodation policy for its wireless customers, in consultation with the Commission, in order to accommodate disabled customers who require same-day activation service for new cellular phones purchased on a postpaid basis but cannot appear in-person at a retail store due to a disability. To that end, Bell should ensure that its same-day activation service is available, in this regard, to customers who cannot appear in person at a retail store due to a disability.\nMs. Mills also offered the following \u201cSuggestions for Potential Policy Changes to Accommodate Disabled Persons Unable to Go to a Bell Mobility Outlet\u201d:\n\u00b7 Have an agent bring the required ID to a store for verification and then deliver the cell phone to the verified address that day by taxi, courier or a designated Bell Mobility employee.\n\u00b7 Use some type of video link, such as Skype, Facetime, etc. to verify that the ID brought in by the agent matches and actually belongs to the person wanting the account and that the agent is following the disabled person\u2019s directions.\n\u00b7 Limit the agent opening an account under these circumstances to one phone thus limiting Bell Mobility\u2019s exposure. Other units could be added later if needed once the account is in good standing.\n\u00b7 If possible, put a cap on the amount of money charged to that account until the account is confirmed as being in good standing.\n\u00b7 Put a flag in the account until it is confirmed that the account is in good standing.\n\u00b7 If the disabled person has a home phone and\/or email account, use one or both of those to give the disabled person a unique password that he\/she could use to confirm the authenticity of the person\u2019s agent in a phone conversation with a Bell Mobility outlet employee.\n\u00b7 In the case of a person who already uses other Bell services (home phone, internet, TV) have some internal process to allow at least some Bell Mobility employees to access this information to verify the disabled person\u2019s address and account history.\nb. An order requiring Bell Mobility to retain an external expert to provide training on accommodation to its retail and all other employees involved in making decisions about access to wireless services and products. The training should include discrimination prevention and Bells accommodation obligation as a service provider under the Act.\n[74] Ms. Mills and the Commission also request an order for pain and suffering pursuant to section 53(2)(e) of the Act in the amount of $20,000; and, an order for special compensation for willful and reckless discrimination, pursuant to section 53(3) of the Act, in the amount of $20,000. They submit that there was pain and suffering as a result of Ms. Mills having to go to a retail store when she was very ill and, thereby, she was subjected to a loss of dignity. Furthermore, Bell knew she was disabled and could not attend in-person without great difficulty and risk. Bell willfully continued to refuse her requests for reasonable accommodation for 27 months up to the hearing, putting her to additional strain and anxiety. Ms. Mills testified that her case was never about the money but that maximum awards should be applied in this case, not to punish Bell, but to remind it of its obligations under the Act and to send a clear message to get its attention that this discriminatory conduct needs to be prevented in the future to protect other disabled people, like Ms. Mills, who do not have the same resources.\n[75] Finally, the Commission has requested an award of interest on any compensation awarded pursuant to section 53(4) of the Act.\n(ii) Bell\u2019s position\n[76] According to Bell, this case does not warrant an award of compensation. The evidence showed no pain and suffering as a result of the application of the Retail Activation Standards. Ms. Mills received the phone on the day she wanted it. There was no aggravation of her condition on the day in question or following that date. Bell has the right to seek full adjudication of the complaint and to provide a full defence thereto and to follow the process under the Act: however long it takes to follow the process. Furthermore, compensation in excess of $10,000 for pain and suffering is not usually awarded by the Tribunal and any such order should reflect the difference in seriousness between this case and other cases where such awards were made. Finally, the Retail Activation Standards were adopted by Bell in good faith to prevent fraud to it and the public, and not out of willful or reckless conduct. Therefore, any award of special compensation should not be greater than $5000.\nB. Measures to redress and prevent the discriminatory practice\n[77] I find the orders sought by Ms. Mills and the Commission under section 53(2)(a) of the Act are justified on the facts of this case.\n[78] There needs to be a modification to Bell\u2019s Retail Activation Standards to ensure disabled people, in the same position as Ms. Mills found herself in on July 11, 2014, can purchase a cellular phone on a postpaid basis and obtain it on the same day without having to appear in a retail store to be identified in-person at risk to their health and safety. The various suggestions to accomplish this referred to in paragraphs 50 and 73, as well as any others that are reasonable and feasible, need to be considered by Bell and the Commission.\n[79] According to Mr. Lau, Bell is currently working on a same-day delivery solution for all persons using its online and phone ordering options that will not require visual identification for postpaid orders. If such an option was available on July 11, 2014, there would not likely have been a complaint in this matter. If it becomes available in the future, it would likely solve similar problems encountered by other disabled people who cannot get to a store to be visually identified and need a cellular phone that day for emergencies, but want to pay on a postpaid basis and have their phones activated on the same day as the vast majority of Bell\u2019s other customers are able to do.\n[80] With this in mind, within six months of the date of this decision, and in consultation with the Commission, Bell shall modify its Retail Activation Standards to redress the discriminatory practice found in this decision and prevent it from occurring in the future. Namely, Bell must ensure individuals like Ms. Mills have substantively equal access to the benefit of purchasing a postpaid cellular phone with same-day activation. Thereafter, the modified Retail Activation Standards shall be submitted to me for approval as I will retain jurisdiction over this matter for that purpose.\n[81] With respect to the training order sought, Bell has admitted that it has lacked training for its employees in human rights obligations under the Act. Therefore, I find that this remedy is justified and, hopefully, will help Bell avoid situations in the future like the one that occurred in this case. Within a year of the date of this decision, and in consultation with the Commission, Bell shall train those employees who are involved in the development and application of the Retail Activation Standards on (1) the purpose of the Act and the human rights obligations arising therefrom; (2) the reason for the modifications to its Retail Activation Standards arising from this decision; and, (3) the modifications to its Retail Activation Standards arising from this decision.\nC. Compensation for pain and suffering\n[82] With respect to the compensation sought for pain and suffering, Ms. Mills seeks $20,000 as a result of the discriminatory practice. This is the maximum amount of compensation the Tribunal can award under paragraph 53(2)(e) of the Act. The Tribunal only awards the maximum amount in the most egregious of circumstances: where the extent and duration of the complainant\u2019s suffering as a result of the discriminatory practice warrants the full amount.\n[83] I find Ms. Mills was exposed to pain and suffering as described in paragraph 75. However, I agree with Bell that any award of compensation must be related to the discriminatory practice and not the litigation of the complaint through the process under the Act. Unfortunately, the complaint and hearing process under the Act can take some time. Having considered the evidence and arguments of the parties on this issue, I feel that an award of $10,000 is appropriate under the circumstances pursuant to section 53(2)(e) of the Act.\nD. Special compensation for wilful or reckless discrimination\n[84] Section 53(3) of the Act is a punitive provision intended to provide a deterrent and discourage those who deliberately discriminate. A finding of wilfulness requires the discriminatory act and the infringement of the person\u2019s rights under the Act is intentional. Recklessness usually denotes acts that disregard or show indifference for the consequences such that the conduct is done wantonly or heedlessly [12] . Again, $20,000 is the maximum amount that can be awarded under section 53(3) of the Act and the Tribunal generally reserves the maximum award for the very worst cases.\n[85] Bell is an iconic and excellent company that is well managed and usually cares about its customers, including disabled Canadians. One needs only to watch television these days to see its commitment to helping Canadians understand and deal with problems related to mental health to know that this is a socially responsible company. Unfortunately, in this case it slipped in its obligations. I\u2019m sure it will come up with an acceptable modification to its Retail Activation Standards to deal with the problem presented by the circumstances in this case and that were probably never contemplated by it. As such, I decline to order compensation under section 53(3) of the Act.\nE. Interest\n[86] Section 53(4) of the Act allows me to include an award of interest on an order to pay compensation and I so order.\n[87] Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) provides any award of interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis at the Bank Rate (monthly series) established by the Bank of Canada; and, shall accrue from the date on which the discriminatory practice occurred, until the date of payment of the award of compensation. As such, Ms. Mills\u2019 award of $10,000 shall include an award of interest calculated pursuant to Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) and shall accrue from July 11, 2014 until the date of the payment of the award of compensation.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Ulyatt\nTable of Contents\nI. Background 1\nA. Issues Respecting Written Notes 5\nB. Evidence of Specific Witnesses 6\nI. Background\n[1] This Motion brought by the Complainant, Chris Hughes for the right to call reply evidence with respect to newly presented evidence after his testimony was completed and with respect to evidence that was called by the Respondent that he could not have anticipated when he gave his direct evidence.\n[2] In support of his position the Complainant filed an Affidavit affirmed on the 17th day of January, 2017. This document sets forth the issues relating to evidence tendered by exhibits by the Respondent\u2019s witnesses and testimony at the hearing by the Respondent\u2019s witnesses.\n[3] The Complainant sets forth in his Affidavit that the hearing before this Tribunal which commenced on June 15, 2015 which continued on and off for May, June, October and November, 2016. The Complainant\u2019s evidence was completed on May 20, 2016 save for a minor issue which Mr. Hughes was recalled on June 20, 2016 following two witnesses for the Complainant, Levan Turner and Eric Christou.\n[4] The Complainant\u2019s issues arose with respect to the introduction of handwritten notes concerning the Public Service Commission proceedings dated October 12, 2005 and February 15, 2006 which were produced on June 13, 2016 and set forth eleven issues which were raised in these notes (Complainant\u2019s Factum paragraph 5(i)). Secondly, the Complainant takes issue with production of additional notes dated February 6, 2006 and August 29, 2006 before the Public Service Commission and were produced on October 18, 2016 (Complainant\u2019s Factum paragraph 5(i)(ii)).\n[5] The second area of complaint arises out of evidence given by the Respondent\u2019s witnesses during the course of the hearing.\n[6] The witnesses who the Complainant wishes to give reply evidence to are in respect of the following individuals:\nBarb Lennax: there are two issues with respect to her evidence identified at page 2 of the Notice of Motion and at pages 125 and 126 of the Complainant\u2019s Factum (Section 6(b)(i)(ii)(iii)).\nRobert Farrell and Catherine Black: there is one issue with respect to his or her evidence identified at page 2 of the Notice of Motion 6(c)(i)(ii)(iii) and at pages, 126 and 127 of the Complainant\u2019s Factum.\nMark Northcote: there is one issue with respect to his evidence identified at page 3 of the Notice of Motion page 6(d) and at page 27 of the Complainant\u2019s Factum.\nRobert Farrell: there are three issues with respect to his evidence identified at page 3, 6(e)(i)(ii)(iii) of the Notice of Motion and at page 128 of the Complainant\u2019s Factum.\nCatherine Black: there is one issue with respect to her evidence at page 5 of the Notice of Motion 6(f) and at page 129 of the Complainant\u2019s Factum.\nHolly Stoner: there is one issue with respect to her evidence at page 5 of the Notice of Motion 6(g) and at page 129 of the Complainant\u2019s Factum 6(f).\n[7] Counsel for the Complainant and the Respondent did agree that the principle authorities by the Complainant cite in the Complainant\u2019s Factum the governing principles with respect to reply evidence.\nR v. Campbell (1977), 17 OR (2d) 673 (ONCA) at 17-18, CMR, Tab 11\nR v. Chaulk, [1990] 3 SCR 1303 at para 118, CMR, Tab 9\nR v. GP (1996), 31 OR (3d) 504 (ONCA) at 8, CMR, Tab 12\n[8] Also the Canadian Human Rights Act Section 50(1) and 50(3c) states:\nConduct of inquiry\n50 (1) After due notice to the Commission, the complainant, the person against whom the complaint was made and, at the discretion of the member or panel conducting the inquiry, any other interested party, the member or panel shall inquire into the complaint and shall give all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations.\n(3) In relation to a hearing of the inquiry, the member or panel may\n(a) in the same manner and to the same extent as a superior court of record, summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give oral or written evidence on oath and to produce any documents and things that the member or panel considers necessary for the full hearing and consideration of the complaint;\n(b) administer oaths;\n(c) subject to subsections (4) and (5), receive and accept any evidence and other information, whether on oath or by affidavit or otherwise, that the member or panel sees fit, whether or not that evidence or information is or would be admissible in a court of law;\n(d) lengthen or shorten any time limit established by the rules of procedure; and\n(e) decide any procedural or evidentiary question arising during the hearing.\n[emphasis added]\n[9] The Complainant filed his materials and Notice of Motion, Affidavit and supporting documents. The Respondent filed a Reply in response and the Reply was followed by the Complainant. Oral omissions by counsel were made in Victoria on March 7, 2017.\n[10] In the present case the parties, whilst agreeing in principle as to the law, take a different view as to the facts at hand and how it ought to be applied. Thus it is not surprising that the cases referred support both positions and were argued in such a manner.\n[11] The Complainant argues that the matters raised were after the Complainant had closed his case or it was evidence not anticipated by the Complainant, or that the evidence took on a greater significance as a result of the Respondent\u2019s witness\u2019s evidence.\n[12] The Respondent disagrees with the Complainant\u2019s characterization and submits that the evidence was not complicated and ought to have been anticipated, and that the intent of the request to reply to evidence of the Complainant is only to reinforce the Complainant\u2019s testimony, and the evidence submitted by the Respondent\u2019s witnesses did not take on additional significance.\n[13] Counsel for the Complainant argued that a Tribunal must be keenly aware of the \u201csubtle scent\u201d of discrimination and the Complainant\u2019s counsel stated in his reply factum page 4 \u201cAt every stage of the analysis, including the respondent\u2019s explanation, the Tribunal must carefully consider the entire circumstances of the complaint for the \u201csubtle scent\u201d of discrimination.\u201d\n[14] Furthermore the Respondent states that the reply evidence is not a right but is a limited discretionary opportunity.\n[15] The present matter before the Tribunal arose of complaint filed by the Complainant on July 9, 2008 and on December 19, 2011. The matters referred to the Tribunal on June 27, 2012 as a result of the referral to the Tribunal this matter have been motions respecting disclosure, redaction of documents, numerous Case Management Conference Calls and adjournments of the hearing based upon late disclosure. Ultimately there has been approximately six weeks of evidence.\n[16] At present it appears the Respondent only has one witness to complete and once this witness has completed her testimony the case is completed subject to any reply evidence and ultimate arguments.\n[17] What is concerning is that the parties did not fully address disclosure with respect to what was in their domain or what ought to have been in possession of the other party. As a result of the request by the Complainant the Respondent did produce PSC notes of October 12, 2005, February 15, 2006, February 6, 2006 and August 29, 2007. This documentation was completed after the Complainant had finished giving his testimony but prior to closing his case.\n[18] It is well settled that a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal is not bound by the strict rules of evidence but is bound by the concept of fairness. The case of Shoppa v. Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare 2001 CHRD 20) (Tab 8 of the Complainant\u2019s Motion Record) adopts Barnasky v. Human Resources and Development Canada:\nThe Canadian Human Rights Act makes it clear that the Tribunal is not bound by the strict rules of evidence. The Tribunal is, however, bound by principles of fairness. It is these principles of fairness to all of the parties which forms the scope and admissibility of reply evidence.\nThe Respondent should not be prejudiced by the late introduction of evidence which only confirms or supports the Complainant and Commission\u2019s case. Fairness to the Respondent requires that the Complainant call her evidence or call the evidence she seeks to rely on to provide her case in the initial presentation of that case so that the Respondent can fully respond to it.\nThe Complainant is entitled to adduce further evidence in reply to respond to new matters or defences raised by the opposing party and which the Complainant could not have reasonably anticipated.\n[19] The issues presently before the Tribunal are difficult and are compounded by the fact that matters commenced in June, 2015 and all the transcripts of the proceedings are not available. However, any further delay would be unacceptable.\n[20] In considering the law respecting reply evidence as submitted, the authority under the Canadian Human Rights Act not be bound by the strict rules of evidence and applying the doctrine of fairness of parties it is ordered:\nA. Issues Respecting Written Notes\n[21] Handwritten notes concerning the Public Service Commission proceedings:\nOn June 13, 2016, the Respondent produced notes dated October 12, 2005, and February 15, 2006, taken by its representatives during the Public Service Commission proceedings; and\nOn October 18, 2016, the Respondent produced additional notes taken by its representatives at Public Service Commission proceedings dated February 6, 2006, and August 29, 2006.\n[22] The Complainant will be allowed to give reply evidence with respect to matters raised in the Complainant\u2019s Notice of Motion. It is being so allowed because the notes were produced late in the proceedings and were documents which ought to have been produced to the Complainant prior to his evidence.\n[23] Counsel will be directed in examining the Complainant that the issues to be addressed by the Complainant shall be done by way of direct questions and not open ended statements. The Complainant and his Counsel are directed and will be reminded at hearing that this will not be an opportunity to expand theories of the case or lengthy versions of evidence not related to specific points.\nB. Evidence of Specific Witnesses\na. Barb Lennax\n[24] Matters identified as 6(b)(i)(ii) of the Notice of Motion at page 125 of the Complainant\u2019s factum will not be subject to reply evidence as a tests respecting reply evidence have not been met and it is noted that there was extensive evidence by the Complainant on these matters before the Tribunal.\n[25] With respect to issue 6(b)(i)(ii) the document being the decision of The Public Service Commission will be tendered by consent as an Exhibit.\nb. Robert Farrell and Catherine Black\n6(c) Testimony of Robert Farrell and Catherine Black identified as section 6(c) of the Complainant\u2019s Motion and at page 126 of the Complainant\u2019s factum being has not met the standard to justify reply evidence in this matter. There was considerable evidence both on direct examination and cross-examination with respect to these issues.\nc. Mark Northcote\nMr. Northcote\u2019s evidence identified at 6(d) of the Notice of Motion will be subject to reply evidence as the Tribunal had previously made the decision on same.\nd. Robert Farrell\nMr. Farrell\u2019s evidence identified at 6(e)(i)(ii) has not met the threshold for reply evidence and this matter was actually covered in direct cross-examination. Therefore reply evidence is not allowed.\ne. Catherine Black\nMs. Black\u2019s evidence 6(f)(i) of the Notice of Motion has not met the threshold for reply evidence and accordingly will not be allowed.\nf. Holly Stoner\nMs. Stoner\u2019s evidence 6(c)(i) of the Notice of Motion has not met the threshold for reply evidence with respect to this issue and therefore reply evidence will not be allowed.\n[26] The hearing dates resuming the week of April 24, 2017 are confirmed and any further motions will be heard at the commencement of the hearing.\nSigned by\nGeorge E.

Background 1\nII. Positions of the parties on the motion 2\nIII. Law and analysis 5\nIV. Ruling and order 9\nI. Background\n[1] This is a ruling on a motion filed by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) on April 4, 2017. By this motion, the Commission seeks full disclosure of potentially relevant information by the respondent, Videotron G.P. (Videotron or the respondent) and, more specifically, disclosure of the contact information of five candidates who received job offers for positions 13-1004 and 14-1004 in 2014. On April 5, 2017, Jean-Marc Malenfant (Mr. Malenfant or the complainant) filed a similar motion. Videotron filed its submissions on April 12, 2017, and objects to the motions.\n[2] In 2014, Videotron posted two offers of employment for positions as sales and after-sales service consultants, in Gatineau (13-1004 and 14-1004). The complainant applied for these two positions but was screened out by Videotron at the preliminary stage of the hiring process. Mr. Malenfant filed a complaint with the Commission under sections 7 and 8 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA or the Act) claiming that Videotron had discriminated against him in matters related to employment, by reason of his age.\n[3] During the process of disclosing potentially relevant documents, several documents, including the resum\u00e9s of the candidates hired by Videotron for positions 13-1004 and 14-1004, were exchanged between the parties. However, the candidates\u2019 contact information was not released by Videotron, given the personal and confidential nature of this information. The Commission and Mr. Malenfant wish to summon five candidates who received job offers for positions 13-1004 and 14-1004 so that they can testify at the hearing. The names of the five candidates appear in the complainant\u2019s list of witnesses, sent to the parties and the Tribunal on January 16, 2017. Videotron objects to providing the contact information of said candidates.\n[4] The issue is whether the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal should order Videotron to disclose the information requested by the Commission and the complainant.\n[5] The Tribunal has read the submissions of each party, and for the reasons given in detail in the paragraphs that follow, the Tribunal orders Videotron to disclose the unredacted resum\u00e9s of the five candidates hired by the respondent who are identified by the complainant in his list of witnesses dated January 16, 2017.\nII. Positions of the parties on the motion\nA. The Commission\n[6] The Commission argues that the Tribunal has the necessary authority to order Videotron to disclose the contact information of the five candidates in question. In coming to this conclusion, the Tribunal has summarized the main arguments made by the Commission in its written submissions as follows.\n[7] The Commission states that the parties are entitled to make full answer and defence and consequently have the right to appear and present evidence that is relevant to their case. The parties must disclose any documents or information, favourable or unfavourable that is potentially relevant to the matter in dispute.\n[8] The Commission argues that the threshold for relevance is low, and the Tribunal has tended to favour disclosing information rather than not disclosing it. The party seeking disclosure must show that there is a connection between the elements to be proven and the documents or information requested.\n[9] The Commission further submits that there is a significant distinction between the production of relevant documents and information and their admissibility at the hearing. At the production stage, only relevance need be established. Relevance must relate to a fact, issue, or form of relief.\n[10] In its submissions, the Commission proposes that the Tribunal review the complaint to establish the relevance of the documents or information. It states that the candidates\u2019 testimony is necessary, particularly with regard to their skills, their ages and the hiring process. As this is an employment complaint involving discrimination based on age, a comparative study between Mr. Malenfant and the candidates selected by Videotron is necessary.\n[11] The Commission argues that the violation of privacy raised by the respondent is not a ground for not disclosing the candidates\u2019 contact information. Potentially relevant documents must be disclosed and, in a litigation context, are subject to an implied undertaking of confidentiality or may be subject to any other order deemed appropriate to ensure confidentiality.\n[12] Finally, the Commission submits that the candidates\u2019 contact information is necessary to summon them as witnesses to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. It argues that the failure to disclose this information deprives it, as well as the complainant, of the opportunity to present the Tribunal with a case to meet. The Commission therefore asks that the Tribunal order the respondent to disclose the contact information (addresses and telephone numbers) of the five candidates selected.\nB. The complainant\n[13] Mr. Malenfant has brought a motion similar to that of the Commission. He asks that the Tribunal order the respondent to disclose the contact information of the five candidates selected. The Tribunal can sum up Mr. Malenfant\u2019s main arguments as follows.\n[14] In his written submissions, the complainant states that he has in large part adopted the Commission\u2019s submissions. He adds that the candidates\u2019 testimony is essential to establishing a prima facie case of discrimination and conducting a comparative analysis of the skills, work experience and age of each candidate. Mr. Malenfant also argues that there is a direct connection between the age of an individual and the experience and skills acquired over years of work.\n[15] The complainant submits that there is no violation of the candidates\u2019 privacy if their contact information is disclosed and that the rules of confidentiality already apply in a litigation context. He states, moreover, that where the circumstances warrant it, the Tribunal has the authority to order more specific rules regarding the confidentiality of the information.\n[16] Mr. Malenfant argues that in order to present a full and complete case to the Tribunal, he must have access to the contact information of the candidates selected. In his view, non-disclosure will prevent him from meeting his burden of proof.\nC. The respondent\n[17] As for Videotron, it objects to the disclosure of the personal contact information of the five candidates who received job offers for positions 13-1004 and 14-1004. The Tribunal has summarized the respondent\u2019s main arguments as follows.\n[18] First of all, Videotron submits that it is not necessary to disclose the contact information and that the moving parties (the Commission and Mr. Malenfant) have not substantiated the necessity of disclosing this information.\n[19] Videotron states that the information on the candidates is already in the Tribunal record and that it is not necessary to hear the testimony of third parties to the dispute. It argues that the candidates\u2019 resum\u00e9s were disclosed, such that all parties and the Tribunal have the same information that it itself held and used to make its decision in its hiring process.\n[20] The respondent argues that the confirmation of the candidates\u2019 skills and ages, in 2014, does not justify a violation of the privacy of said candidates, nor does the potential probative value to be given to this evidence. There must be a rational connection between the requested documents and the issues, and the information must therefore have probable relevance without, however, being speculative or oppressive. Videotron submits that the question to be asked is whether the requested information is necessary for the party seeking disclosure to be able to prepare its arguments for presentation to the Tribunal.\n[21] Videotron notes that there are several steps in its hiring process. The first step in its hiring process is a resum\u00e9 review. It submits that Mr. Malenfant was not invited to take part in the second step of the process, a telephone interview. Accordingly, the comparative analysis should be carried out in the same context, that is, a comparison of the candidates\u2019 resum\u00e9s. According to Videotron, what the other candidates experienced in the later steps of the process is not relevant. As Mr. Malenfant was not invited to those subsequent steps, the testimony of these candidates on this subject does not relate to a fact, issue or form of relief sought.\n[22] Videotron also mentions that the evidence must be presented in an efficient manner and that proceedings before the Tribunal must be conducted as expeditiously as possible. In its view, allowing the irrelevant testimony would prolong the hearing by at least three days.\n[23] Finally, the respondent states that the right to privacy and the confidentiality of information is an aspect that must be assessed in the context of a request for disclosure. As the candidates are strangers to the proceeding, have no interest in it, are still employees of the company and will have to testify against it, these aspects must be taken into account when deciding the motion.\n[24] Videotron reiterates that it does not object to a full disclosure of the candidates\u2019 information, only to an unnecessary disclosure. According to Videotron, the moving parties have not demonstrated the necessity and relevance of the five candidates\u2019 testimony, and disclosure would constitute an unwarranted violation of the right to privacy of these third parties.\nIII. Law and analysis\n[25] Each party has a right to a full hearing. In this regard, the CHRA provides as follows at subsection 50(1):\n50(1) After due notice to the Commission, the complainant, the person against whom the complaint was made and, at the discretion of the member or panel conducting the inquiry, any other interested party, the member or panel shall inquire into the complaint and shall give all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations. [Emphasis added.]\n[26] This right includes the right to the disclosure of relevant evidence in the possession or care of the opposing party (Guay v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2004 CHRT 34, para. 40). The Rules of Procedure of the Canadian Human Right Tribunal (the Rules) provide as follows in Rule 6(1), and more specifically at paragraphs (d) and (e):\n6(1) Within the time fixed by the Panel, each party shall serve and file a Statement of Particulars setting out,\n. . .\n(d) a list of all documents in the party\u2019s possession, for which no privilege is claimed, that relate to a fact, issue, or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule;\n(e) a list of all documents in the party\u2019s possession, for which privilege is claimed, that relate to a fact, issue or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule;\n. . .\n[Emphasis added.]\n[27] Regarding disclosure, the Tribunal has already ruled several times that the guiding principle is probable or possible relevance (Bushey v. Sharma, 2003 CHRT 5 and Hughes v. Transport Canada, 2012 CHRT 26. See in the alternative Guay, supra; Day v. Department of National Defence and Hortie, 2002 CanLII 61833; Warman v. Bahr, 2006 CHRT 18; Seeley v. Canadian National Railway Company, 2013 CHRT 18). The Tribunal notes that the parties have an obligation to disclose potentially relevant documents in their possession (Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 42, para. 17).\n[28] To show that the documents or information is relevant, the moving party must demonstrate that there is a rational connection between those documents or information and the issues in the case (Warman, supra, para. 6. See for example Guay, supra, para. 42; Hughes, supra, para. 28; Seeley, supra, para. 6). Relevance is determined on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the issues raised in each case (Warman, supra, para. 9. See also Seeley, supra, para. 6). The Tribunal notes that the threshold for arguable relevance is low and the tendency is now towards more, rather than less disclosure (Warman, supra, para. 6. See also Rai v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2013 CHRT 36, para. 18). Of course, the disclosure must not be speculative or amount to a fishing expedition (Guay, supra, para. 43).\n[29] The Tribunal notes that the production of documents stage is different from the stage of their admissibility in evidence at the hearing. Accordingly, relevance is a distinct concept. As Member Michel Doucet stated in Telecommunications Employees Association of Manitoba Inc. v. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 CHRT 28 (hereafter TEAM), at para. 4:\n[4] . . . The production of documents is subject to the test of arguable relevance, not a particularly high bar to meet. There must be some relevance between the information or document sought and the issue in dispute. There can be no doubt that it is in the public interest to ensure that all relevant evidence is available in a proceeding such as this one. A party is entitled to get information or documents that are or could be arguably relevant to the proceedings. This does not mean that these documents or this information will be admitted in evidence or that significant weight will be afforded to them.\n[30] That being said, I have considered the parties\u2019 arguments and come to the conclusion that the testimony of the five candidates identified by the complainant in his list of witnesses dated January 16, 2017, is potentially relevant to the case.\n[31] It is important to note, as Tribunal Chairperson, David L. Thomas, correctly pointed out in Siddoo v. International Longshoremen\u2019s and Warehousemen\u2019s Union, Local 502, 2015 CHRT 21, at para. 29, that:\n[29] The Tribunal has recognized the difficulty in proving allegations of discrimination by way of direct evidence. As was noted in Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company, 1988 CanLII 108 (CHRT) [Basi]: \u201cdiscrimination is not a practise which one would expect to see displayed overtly. In fact, rarely are there cases where one can show by direct evidence that discrimination is purposely practised.\u201d Rather, one must consider all of the circumstances to determine if there exists what was described in the Basi case as the \u201csubtle scent of discrimination.\u201d\n[32] It is in this same vein that I come to the conclusion that the testimony of these five candidates could potentially be relevant. The burden would be a heavy one, for complainants, if they had to show direct evidence of discrimination in every case. The subtle scent of discrimination may rise from the circumstances, taken as a whole. The complainant must still have the chance to present evidence regarding these circumstances. As the Commission states at paragraphs 19 and 20 of its submissions, the candidates will have to be heard on subjects [translation] \u201cincluding, but not limited to\u201d their age, their skills, and their resum\u00e9, but also regarding the hiring process [emphasis added]. The circumstances in which the respondent\u2019s hiring process was conducted could potentially be relevant. In his statement of facts, taken as a whole, the complainant too expresses this same idea regarding Videotron\u2019s selection process, which according to his interpretation voluntarily sets forth its preferences for younger candidates. In this respect, he draws a connection, at paragraphs 19 to 22 of his statement, between discrimination based on section 8 (advertising for employment applications) and discrimination based on section 7 (refusal to employ) of the CHRA. He expresses the idea that the reasons for refusal are tainted by assumptions or are merely pretexts for refusing to hire him. In addition, Mr. Malenfant cites O\u2019Malley v. Simpson-Sears, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, which sets out the concept of indirect effects of discrimination. Clearly, the complainant is raising issues regarding the hiring process and the circumstances surrounding it.\n[33] I do not agree with Videotron\u2019s statement at paragraph 23 of its submissions that the candidates\u2019 testimony on the hiring process or other information not presented in their resum\u00e9s is entirely irrelevant to the case. I note that the threshold for potential relevance, at this stage, is low, particularly since relevance need only be potential or probable.\n[34] It is clear that the parties do not agree on the issue before the Tribunal, that is, the disclosure of the contact information of the five candidates selected, nor do they agree on the relevance of the testimony of the five candidates selected. The production of documents and admissibility in evidence at the hearing are separate stages. I find that it would be premature at this stage, and without having been able to hear the evidence at the hearing, to deny disclosure of the contact information of said candidates and immediately draw a conclusion by stating that the candidates\u2019 testimony is not relevant to the case. If the respondent wishes to make submissions regarding relevance at the hearing, it will be open to it to do so. Otherwise, the prejudice to the Commission and in particular to the complainant should this request be denied at this stage could be considerable and have repercussions on the merits of the case.\n[35] Regarding the confidentiality of personal information and the privacy of the five candidates selected, I can understand Videotron\u2019s arguments. Nevertheless, it is also \u201cin the public interest to ensure that all relevant evidence is available in a proceeding such as this one\u201d (TEAM, supra, para. 4). Other measures, as suggested by the Commission, at paragraph 21, and the complainant, at paragraph 11, in their respective submissions, may be taken to protect as much as possible the candidates\u2019 personal information. At this stage, no formal request for a confidentiality order has been made by the parties. They could, in due course, make such a request if they deem it necessary. I would also point out to the parties that other measures could be taken at the hearing to minimize, to the extent possible, the disclosure of the candidates\u2019 personal information.\n[36] Finally, I would remind the parties that the duty to disclose the documents concerns documents in their possession. Accordingly, the duty does not extend to creating documents for disclosure (Gaucher, supra, para. 17). Therefore, as the contact information exists and can be found in the resum\u00e9s of the five candidates selected, I will order Videotron to provide the resum\u00e9s without the contact information being redacted.\nIV. Ruling and order\n[37] For these reasons, I order that Videotron provide the other parties with the resum\u00e9s of the five candidates selected for positions 13-1004 and 14-1004, in 2014, and identified in the complainant\u2019s list of witnesses dated January 16, 2017, at paragraph 4 therein, without their contact information being redacted.\nSigned by\nGabriel Gaudreault\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nMay 4, 2017\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal Files:\nT2131\/0516\nStyle of Cause:\nJean-Marc Malenfant v.

What are the rules surrounding the filing of documents in support of the Statement of Particulars? 4\nIV. Conclusion 5\nI. Complaint and motion\n[1] On November 30, 2012, Serge Lafreni\u00e8re (the Complainant) filed a complaint under the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) against Via Rail Canada Inc. (the Respondent).\n[2] On August 22, 2016, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission), after investigation, referred the complaint filed by the Complainant to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) for inquiry under section 7 of the CHRA.\n[3] In essence, the Complainant alleges that he was treated differently and that he had unfairly accumulated penalty points in his disciplinary file, all of which led to his dismissal on October 5, 2012. The ground of discrimination alleged in his file and accepted by the Tribunal is disability.\n[4] On March 30, 2017, the Tribunal rendered ruling 2017 CHRT 9 on a motion to strike filed by the Respondent. The Tribunal requested that the Complainant, after receiving an email from him while the decision was under deliberation, file a motion to amend his Statement of Particulars if he deemed it appropriate.\n[5] A motion to amend was filed on April 10, 2017, and written submissions from all parties were received by the Tribunal on April 27, 2017.\nII. Issues\n[6] The Tribunal has identified the following issues arising from the filing of the Complainant\u2019s motion to amend his Statement of Particulars:\na) Do the facts raised by the Complainant in his motion justify an amendment of his Statement of Particulars?\nb) What are the rules surrounding the filing of documents in support of the Statement of Particulars?\nIII. Analysis\nA. Do the facts raised by the Complainant in his motion justify an amendment of his Statement of Particulars?\n[7] The Complainant has the responsibility of convincing the Tribunal that the new facts that he is bringing to the Tribunal\u2019s attention can be used for more than providing context. To do so, he must make allegations claiming that the unfair treatment to which he refers is based on a disability.\n[8] The Tribunal reiterates the CHRA provision raised in this case:\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[Emphasis mine]\n[9] The need to argue a nexus with a prohibited ground of discrimination is therefore provided for in the very terms of section 7 of the CHRA.\n[10] It is apparent from the Complainant\u2019s written submissions that new facts have instead been raised to explain his disability or provide context. Once again, the Complainant stated that he is trying to establish that his disability was caused by repeated actions from the Respondent.\n[11] The Complainant claims in his motion to amend that he has had a disability since 2010. Included with his motion, he filed documents to support his claim. The Tribunal does not object to his disability period being extended. However, merely arguing for an extended period does not give rise to an allegation that the unfair treatment allegedly experienced by the Complainant during his period of disability occurred because he had the disability.\n[12] To argue an allegation of a discriminatory practice under the CHRA regarding an impugned action or decision, the Complainant must at least indicate in his Statement of Particulars that, in his opinion, his disability was a factor in that action or decision.\n[13] At paragraphs 15 and 16 of his motion to amend, the Complainant does not make this connection. Instead, he claims that the results of the hiring competition were perhaps an explanation of his condition: [translation] \u201cthe Complainant did not attempt to explain the cause of his disability by discussing the injustice he suffered . . . after hearing all of the harm the Complainant suffered. . . this finding will be evident.\u201d\n[14] Stating that the impugned actions or decisions occurred [translation] \u201cduring his period of disability\u201d does not satisfy the requirement of making a link between the prohibited ground of discrimination and the adverse impact. Therefore, these allegations (paras. 4 to 9 of the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars) can only serve as contextual elements.\n[15] Like the Tribunal mentioned in its decision of March 30, 2017, what is relevant for the Tribunal is whether a prohibited ground of discrimination under the CHRA, in this case, disability, was a factor in the disciplinary action and dismissal decisions made by the Respondent during the alleged period of disability [Emphasis mine] (Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61, para. 33).\n[16] In other words, were the actions taken in regard to the Complainant during his alleged period of disability discriminatory because they did not take his disability into account or, alternatively, were they discriminatory because they conveyed prejudices in relation to his disability? Anything that concerns the cause of the disability, as described by the Complainant, is irrelevant.\n[17] Consequently, the Complainant does not have to establish the cause of his disability before the Tribunal. He must, however, demonstrate that he had a disability when the impugned actions under the CHRA (disciplinary action and dismissal) were taken.\n[18] Thus, the Complainant\u2019s motion to amend is not actually one\u2014the Complainant is instead adding information that could be used for context with respect to the complaint and the claims of the Complainant.\n[19] Furthermore, the Complainant discusses issues in his motion that can only be disposed of after all of the evidence has been filed and heard at the hearing. When faced with a motion to amend a Statement of Particulars, the Tribunal does not review the truthfulness, credibility or accuracy of the allegations made. That deliberation will take place only at the conclusion of the inquiry into the matter.\n[20] The Tribunal therefore agrees with the Respondent\u2019s conclusion in its response to the Complainant\u2019s motion to amend. The fact that the Complainant alleges that he had a disability for a period of time is not sufficient to indicate that all actions taken by the Respondent during that period were discriminatory.\nB. What are the rules surrounding the filing of documents in support of the Statement of Particulars?\n[21] The Complainant included, with his motion to amend, medical documents that support his claim that he has had a disability since at least June 2010. The Respondent also filed documents in its response to the Complainant\u2019s motion, including his attendance report.\n[22] It is true that Rule 6(1)(d) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure can be confusing to the extent that it requires parties to list the various documents in their possession that relate to the case.\n[23] However, Rule 6(4) specifies that documents identified in accordance with Rule 6(1)(d) shall not be filed with the Registry [Emphasis mine]. Instead, the documents are to be provided to all other parties involved in the case (Complainant, Respondent and Commission). They are not to be filed with the Tribunal during the pre-hearing disclosure period.\n[24] The filing of documents in evidence (as exhibits) is done only at the hearing in accordance with paragraph 50(3)(c) and subsections 50(4) and 50(5) of the CHRA.\nIV. Conclusion\n[25] For all of these reasons, the Tribunal reiterates its findings from its decision of March 31, 2017, on the motion to strike, and finds that the Complainant\u2019s motion to amend must be dismissed.\n[26] The parties must comply with the Tribunal\u2019s findings. Any reference to the incidents described in paragraphs 4 to 9, 10 to 18 (excluding the part on the medical note) and 39 to 53 of the Complainant\u2019s Statements of Particulars may be used at the hearing to provide context if the Complainant so desires, but not to establish the Respondent\u2019s responsibility.\n[27] Paragraphs 19 to 26 and 27 to 38, which were the subject of the motion to strike and concern disciplinary action taken during or around the alleged period of disability, and all other paragraphs in the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars that were not the subject of the motion to strike, are relevant and will be heard by the Tribunal; the Complainant will have to establish them, and the Respondent will have to provide reply evidence.\n[28] The medical documents attached to the Complainant\u2019s motion to amend, and the document included by the Respondent in its response to the motion, may be provided to the other parties, but they will not be part of the evidence on the record unless presented at the hearing and received by the Member in accordance with paragraph 50(3)(c) of the CHRA. The other parties will then have the opportunity to object to their admissibility, where applicable.\nSigned by\nAnie Perrault\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nMay\n12, 2017\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT2162\/3616\nStyle of Cause:\nSerge Lafreni\u00e8re v.

Pannu\nTable of Contents\nI. Background 1\nII. Law 1\nIII. Analysis and Decision 2\nI. Background\n[1] The Complainant has filed a Motion requesting full disclosure of the Respondent\u2019s Project Information Forms (PIFs) for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2013 and March 2014. These PIFs are Band documents which contain project descriptions, amounts spent, completion dates and Band priorities. The Complainant submits that this information is relevant because it would establish, to some extent, which tasks and projects were prioritized and completed by the Band during the time in question of the Complaint.\n[2] The Respondent submits that some of the information sought has already been provided. It states that Band office employees have searched their records and cannot find the PIFs requested. They believe that if the PIFs were in the Band office, they were removed by Band members during a takeover of the Band office, and contend they no longer have possession of them. The Respondent further submits that the request is a fishing expedition asking for information which is not relevant to the Complaint.\n[3] The Canadian Human Rights Commission agrees with the Complainant\u2019s arguments that the documents requested will help clarify the factual matrix surrounding the replacement of the water tank at Band Home 1502 and the installation of the wheelchair ramp at Band Home 1502, and the Complainant\u2019s request for repairs to the wheelchair ramp to make it suitable for use. The documents would provide information which will assist the Tribunal in establishing which other projects were prioritized and completed during the period of time which gave rise to the Complaint. They are therefore relevant to allow the Tribunal to examine the Respondent\u2019s explanations and defenses in this matter, including the question of undue hardship.\nII. Law\n[4] There must be a rational connection between documents and issues (arguable relevance). The request for information must not be speculative or amount to a fishing expedition and the documents should be identified with reasonable particularity (Guay v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2004 CHRT 34, at paras. 42-44).\n[5] A party must show not that the evidence is relevant in the traditional sense, but that disclosure of a document will be useful, is appropriate, is likely to contribute to advancing the debate and is based on an acceptable objective that he or she seeks to attain in the case, and that the document is related to the dispute (C.E.P.U. v. Bell Canada, 2005 CHRT 34, at para. 11).\n[6] While the threshold for arguable relevance is low, and the tendency now is toward more disclosure, the nexus between the issues to be proven and the requested material must nonetheless be demonstrated (Warman v. Bahr, 2006 CHRT 18, at paras. 6-7, 9).\n[7] Parties before the Tribunal must be given a full and ample opportunity to present their cases. To be given this opportunity, parties require, among other things, the disclosure of arguably relevant information in the possession or care of the opposing party prior to the hearing of the matter. Along with the facts and issues presented by the parties, the disclosure of arguably relevant information allows each party to know the case it is up against and, therefore, adequately prepare for the hearing. For that reason, if there is a rational connection between a document and the facts, issues or forms of relief identified by the parties in the matter, it should be disclosed (Yaffa v. Air Canada, 2014 CHRT 22, at para. 3).\nIII. Analysis and Decision\n[8] The Complainant\u2019s Motion for disclosure passes the threshold for arguable relevance and the requested information should be disclosed. There is a rational connection between the information requested and the facts and issues identified by the parties. The request cannot be characterized as a fishing expedition as the information to be disclosed would provide the parties with a full and ample opportunity to present their cases.\n[9] I acknowledge that the Respondent claims the said information may no longer be in its possession. However, copies of such material might be obtained from the relevant federal government departments. Exercising my discretion within the purpose of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04), I make the following decision:\nThe Respondent will exercise its best efforts to provide the information sought in the Complainant\u2019s Motion, including requesting such material from the federal government if such material is not in its possession.\nThe Respondent will provide this information to the parties within four (4) weeks of the date of this decision.\nThe parties will participate in a Case Management Conference Call (CMCC) to be scheduled by the Tribunal to discuss disclosure, procedural and any other issues prior to the hearing.\nSigned by\nAlex G.

Orders 44\nI. Motions for immediate relief related to Jordan\u2019s Principle\n[1] Jordan River Anderson of the Norway House Cree Nation was born with a serious medical condition. Because of a lack of available medical services in his community, Jordan\u2019s family turned to provincial child welfare care in order for him to get the medical treatment he needed. After spending the first two years of his life in hospital, Jordan could have gone to a specialized foster home close to his medical facilities in Winnipeg. However, for two years, Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (\u201cINAC\u201d), Health Canada and the Province of Manitoba argued over who should pay for Jordan\u2019s foster home costs. Ultimately, Jordan remained in hospital until he passed away, at the age of five, having spent his entire life in hospital.\n[2] In recognition of Jordan, Jordan\u2019s Principle provides that where a government service is available to all other children, but a jurisdictional dispute regarding services to a First Nations child arises between Canada, a province, a territory, or between government departments, the government department of first contact pays for the service and can seek reimbursement from the other government or department after the child has received the service. It is a child-first principle meant to prevent First Nations children from being denied essential public services or experiencing delays in receiving them. On December 12, 2007, the House of Commons unanimously passed a motion that the government should immediately adopt a child-first principle, based on Jordan's Principle, to resolve jurisdictional disputes involving the care of First Nations children.\n[3] The Complainants and Interested Parties (with the exception of Amnesty International) have each brought motions challenging, among other things, Canada\u2019s implementation of Jordan\u2019s Principle in relation to this Panel\u2019s decision and orders in First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada), 2016 CHRT 2 (\u201cthe Decision\u201d). Canada and the Commission filed submissions in response to the motions. The motions were heard from March 22 to 24, 2017 in Ottawa. As with the hearing on the merits, the hearing of these motions was broadcasted on the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network.\n[4] This ruling deals specifically with allegations of non-compliance and related requests for further orders with respect to Jordan\u2019s Principle. Other aspects of the parties\u2019 motions not dealt with in this ruling will be determined as part of a separate ruling.\nII. Findings and orders with respect to Jordan\u2019s Principle to date\n[5] In the Decision, this Panel found Canada\u2019s definition and implementation of Jordan\u2019s Principle to be narrow and inadequate, resulting in service gaps, delays and denials for First Nations children. Delays were inherently built into the process for dealing with potential Jordan\u2019s Principle cases. Furthermore, the Canada\u2019s approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle cases was aimed solely at inter-governmental disputes between the federal and provincial government in situations where a child had multiple disabilities, as opposed to all jurisdictional disputes (including between federal government departments) involving all First Nations children (not just those with multiple disabilities). As a result, INAC was ordered to immediately implement the full meaning and scope of Jordan's Principle (see the Decision at paras. 379-382, 458 and 481). The Decision and related orders were not challenged by way of judicial review.\n[6] Three months following the Decision, INAC and Health Canada indicated that they began discussions on the process for expanding the definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle, improving its implementation and identifying other partners who should be involved in this process. They anticipated it would take 12 months to engage First Nations, the provinces and territories in these discussions and develop options for changes to Jordan\u2019s Principle.\n[7] In a subsequent ruling (2016 CHRT 10), this Panel specified that its order was to immediately implement the full meaning and scope of Jordan\u2019s Principle, not immediately start discussions to review the definition in the long-term. We noted there was already a workable definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle, which was adopted by the House of Commons, and saw no reason why that definition could not be implemented immediately. INAC was ordered to immediately consider Jordan\u2019s Principle as including all jurisdictional disputes (including disputes between federal government departments) and involving all First Nations children (not only those children with multiple disabilities). The Panel further indicated that the government organization that is first contacted should pay for the service without the need for policy review or case conferencing before funding is provided (see 2016 CHRT 10 at paras. 30-34). Again, the ruling and related orders were not challenged by way of judicial review.\n[8] Thereafter, INAC indicated that it took the following steps to implement the Panel\u2019s order:\n\u00b7 It corrected its interpretation of Jordan\u2019s Principle by eliminating the requirement that the First Nations child on reserve must have multiple disabilities that require multiple service providers;\n\u00b7 It corrected its interpretation of Jordan\u2019s Principle to apply to all jurisdictional disputes and now includes those between federal government departments;\n\u00b7 Services for any Jordan\u2019s Principle case will not be delayed due to case conferencing or policy review; and\n\u00b7 Working level committees comprised of Health Canada and INAC officials, Director Generals and Assistant Deputy Ministers will provide oversight and will guide the implementation of the new application of Jordan\u2019s Principle and provide for an appeals function.\n[9] It also stated it would engage in discussions with First Nations, the provinces and the Yukon on a long-term strategy. Furthermore, INAC indicated it would provide an annual report on Jordan\u2019s Principle, including the number of cases tracked and the amount of funding spent to address specific cases. INAC also updated its website to reflect the changes above, including posting contact information for individuals encountering a Jordan\u2019s Principle case.\n[10] While the Panel was pleased with these changes and investments in working towards enacting the full meaning and scope of Jordan\u2019s Principle, it still had some outstanding questions with respect to consultation and full implementation. In 2016 CHRT 16, the Panel requested further information from INAC with respect to its consultations on Jordan\u2019s Principle and the process for dealing with Jordan\u2019s Principle cases. Further, INAC was ordered to provide all First Nations and First Nations Child and Family Services Agencies (\u201cFNCFS Agencies\u201d) with the names and contact information of the Jordan\u2019s Principle focal points in all regions.\n[11] Finally, the Panel noted that INAC\u2019s new formulation of Jordan\u2019s Principle once again appeared to be more restrictive than formulated by the House of Commons. That is, INAC was restricting the application of the principle to \u201cFirst Nations children on reserve\u201d (as opposed to all First Nations children) and to First Nations children with \u201cdisabilities and those who present with a discrete, short-term issue for which there is a critical need for health and social supports.\u201d The Panel ordered INAC to immediately apply Jordan\u2019s Principle to all First Nations children, not only to those residing on reserve. In order for the Panel to assess the full impact of INAC\u2019s formulation of Jordan\u2019s Principle, it also ordered INAC to explain why it formulated its definition of the principle as only being applicable to First Nations children with \u201cdisabilities and those who present with a discrete, short-term issue for which there is a critical need for health and social supports\u201d (see 2016 CHRT 16 at paras. 107-120). This third ruling was also not challenged by way of judicial review.\nIII. Canada\u2019s further actions in relation to Jordan\u2019s Principle\n[12] In response to the present motions, Canada states that its definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle now applies to all First Nations children and is not limited to those residing on reserve or normally resident on reserve. It also applies to all jurisdictional disputes, including those between federal government departments.\n[13] According to Canada, its revised interpretation of Jordan\u2019s Principle aims to ensure that anytime a need for a publicly-funded health, education or social care service or support for a First Nations child is identified, it will be met. Any jurisdictional issues that might arise will be dealt with after ensuring the need is met. New processes have been created so that the services needed for any Jordan's Principle case are not delayed due to case conferencing or policy review. Urgent cases are addressed within 12 hours; other cases within 5 business days; and, complex cases which require follow-up or consultation with others within 7 business days.\n[14] Canada states it has also taken the necessary steps to ensure the requisite funding and human resources are available to implement the expanded definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle. In this regard, it has undertaken new policy initiatives to improve health and social service needs for First Nations children. According to Canada, the Child-First Initiative (the \u201cCFI\u201d) supports the expanded application of Jordan\u2019s Principle by providing mechanisms for Canada to prevent or resolve jurisdictional disputes and gaps, before they occur. Canada submits the CFI identifies First Nations children at risk, through enhanced service coordination, and provides a source of funds to meet children\u2019s needs in cases where those needs cannot be met through existing publically available programs. Canada also points to the 2016\/17 First Nations and Inuit Health Branch regional operation plan as supporting the correct interpretation of the application of Jordan\u2019s Principle. That plan calls for $64 million for First Nations mental health programs and services in Ontario, in addition to regular mental health programs.\n[15] In addition, Canada submits that it is also focusing on enhancing its communication efforts to ensure its First Nations partners are informed of the new approach, aware of new resources available and given an opportunity to get involved and share their views.\n[16] Finally, Canada states that while Jordan\u2019s Principle cannot fund everything, firm lines regarding what is recoverable are not being drawn. Any publicly-funded service that is available to other Canadian children is eligible under Jordan\u2019s Principle and has been covered when brought forward.\nIV. Analysis\n[17] The Complainants and the Interested Parties believe Canada has failed to comply with the Panel\u2019s orders to date, or certain aspects of those orders. Generally, each of their respective submissions focused on a different aspect of the complaint and made requests for immediate relief orders related to that focus. Based on statements made in their submissions and at the hearing, the Complainants and the Interested Parties are generally supportive of each other\u2019s positions and requested orders.\n[18] The Commission believes that, despite a number of positive and encouraging developments, Canada is not yet in full compliance with this Panel\u2019s orders and, therefore, it is open to the Panel to provide additional clarification and\/or guidance with respect to its orders.\n[19] With respect to Jordan\u2019s Principle, the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada (the \u201cCaring Society\u201d) and the Commission request that additional orders be made in relation to the definition of the principle, the dissemination of that definition to the public and stakeholders, and the process for dealing with Jordan\u2019s Principle cases and the tracking of those cases.\n[20] The Assembly of First Nations (the \u201cAFN\u201d) was originally concerned about its lack of involvement in Health Canada\u2019s Jordan\u2019s Principle activities given it has an Engagement Protocol with the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch. Health Canada has since invited the AFN to co-chair a working group on Jordan\u2019s Principle, which the AFN accepted. The AFN\u2019s submissions echo many of the concerns raised by the Caring Society and the Commission in terms of the definition and process surrounding Jordan\u2019s Principle.\n[21] The Chiefs of Ontario\u2019s (the \u201cCOO\u201d) and the Nishnawbe Aski Nation\u2019s (the \u201cNAN\u201d) submissions with respect to Jordan\u2019s Principle focus mainly on the provision of mental health services under the Memorandum of Agreement Respecting Welfare Programs for Indians (\u201cthe 1965 Agreement\u201d) in Ontario. While this ruling will deal with Jordan\u2019s Principle generally, specific issues with respect to the 1965 Agreement, along with other requests, will be dealt with in a separate ruling.\n[22] In addition, the Panel highlights that NAN\u2019s motion had also sought a \u201cChoose Life\u201d order that Jordan\u2019s Principle funding be granted to any Indigenous community that files a proposal identifying children and youth at risk of suicide. Health Canada has since committed to establishing a Choose Life Working Group with NAN aimed at establishing a concrete, simplified process for communities to apply for Child-First Initiative (Jordan\u2019s Principle) funding. As such, and at NAN\u2019s request, the Panel adjourned the request for a \u201cChoose Life\u201d order (see 2017 CHRT 7).\nA. Legal arguments\n(i) Burden of proof and compliance\n[23] In general, and in deciding all aspects of the motions now before the Panel, the Caring Society and the AFN submit that Canada bears the burden of demonstrating to the Tribunal that it has complied with the orders for immediate relief made to date. Canada is in possession of the necessary information to show whether the immediate relief ordered by the Tribunal has been provided. Furthermore, it would be unjust, having proved that Canada has discriminated against First Nations children and their families in a systemic way, to bear a \u201cburden of proof\u201d to show that discrimination is continuing in the absence of further orders.\n[24] In the absence of evidence clearly demonstrating that Canada has fully addressed the immediate relief items ordered by the Tribunal, the Complainants and the Interested Parties have, among other things, asked the Tribunal to find that Canada continues to discriminate, that it has not complied with the Panel\u2019s orders to date, and, in some cases, asked that the Tribunal issue an order declaring Canada non-compliant.\n[25] The Commission submits that, where the Tribunal has retained jurisdiction to facilitate implementation of an order, and a dispute subsequently arises, it is open to the Tribunal to reconvene the hearing to: (i) make findings about whether a party has complied with the terms of the original order, and (ii) clarify and supplement the original order, if further direction is needed to address the discriminatory practice identified in the original order. In its view, despite a number of positive and encouraging developments, Canada has not yet brought itself into full compliance with the Tribunal\u2019s rulings regarding Jordan\u2019s Principle. It is therefore open to the Tribunal to provide additional clarification and\/or guidance.\n[26] Canada submits that there is no established legal test governing a motion for non-compliance before this Tribunal. The test to be met on this motion must accordingly be derived from the general principles that guide human rights law. According to Canada, the law is clear that the moving parties have the legal burden to prove their allegations on a balance of probabilities: in this case, allegations of non-compliance. In Canada\u2019s view, the moving parties have not met their burden and, therefore, their motions should be dismissed. In any event, Canada states it has complied with the Tribunal\u2019s orders.\n[27] Once it is established that discrimination or a loss has been suffered, the Tribunal must consider whether an order is appropriate (see s. 53(2) of the Canadian Human Rights Act [\u201cthe Act\u201d]). In this regard, the Tribunal has the duty to assess the need for orders on the material before it; or, it can refer the issue back to the parties to prepare better evidence on what an appropriate order should be (see Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canada (Attorney General), 2010 FC 1135 at paras. 61 and 67, aff\u2019d 2011 FCA 202 [\u201cWalden\u201d]). In determining the present motions, this is the situation in which the Panel finds itself.\n[28] In the Decision, while the Panel made general orders to cease the discriminatory practice and take measures to redress and prevent it, it also explained that it required further clarification from the parties on the relief sought, including how immediate and long-term reforms can best be implemented on a practical, meaningful and effective basis (see para. 483). Indeed, while the Panel was able to further elaborate upon its orders in its subsequent rulings based upon additional information provided by the parties, the Panel continued to retain jurisdiction over the matter pending further reporting from the parties, mainly from Canada (see 2016 CHRT 10 and 2016 CHRT 16). That is to say that, as opposed to determining the merits of a complaint, the Tribunal\u2019s determination of appropriate remedies is less about an onus being on a particular party to prove certain facts, and more about gathering the necessary information to craft meaningful and effective orders that address the discriminatory practices identified.\n[29] Consistent with this approach, and as this Panel has previously stated, the aim in making an order under section 53 of the Act is to eliminate and prevent discrimination. On a principled and reasoned basis, in consideration of the particular circumstances of the case and the evidence presented, the Tribunal must ensure its remedial orders are effective in promoting the rights protected by the Act and meaningful in vindicating any loss suffered by the victim of discrimination. However, constructing effective and meaningful remedies to resolve a complex dispute, as is the situation in this case, is an intricate task and may require ongoing supervision (see 2016 CHRT 10 at paras. 13-15 and 36).\n[30] It is for these reasons that, absent a gap in the evidentiary record, the Panel does not consider the question of burden of proof to be a material issue in determining the present motions. As the Federal Court of Appeal stated in Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 268, at paragraph 42 (\u201cChopra\u201d), \u201c[t]he question of onus only arises when it is necessary to decide who should bear the consequence of a gap in the evidentiary record such that the trier of fact cannot make a particular finding.\u201d While discrete issues regarding the burden of proof may arise in the context of determining motions like the ones presently before the Panel, where the evidentiary record allows the Panel to draw conclusions of fact which are supported by the evidence, the question of who had the onus of proving a given fact is immaterial.\n[31] In the same vein, the Panel\u2019s role in ruling upon the present motions is not to make declarations of compliance or non-compliance per se. Rather, in line with the remedial principles outlined above, the Panel\u2019s purpose in crafting orders for immediate relief and in retaining jurisdiction to oversee their implementation is to ensure that as many of the adverse impacts and denials of services identified in the Decision are temporarily addressed while INAC\u2019s First Nations child welfare programing is being reformed. That said, in crafting any further orders to immediately redress or prevent the discrimination identified in the Decision, it is necessary for the Panel to examine the actions Canada has taken to date in implementing the Panel\u2019s orders and it may make findings as to whether those actions are or are not in compliance with those orders.\n[32] As the Federal Court of Canada stated in Grover v. Canada (National Research Council) (1994), 24 CHRR D\/390 (FC) at para. 32, \u201c[o]ften it may be more desirable for the Tribunal to provide guidelines in order to allow the parties to work out between themselves the details of the [order], rather than to have an unworkable order forced upon them by the Tribunal.\u201d This statement is in line with the Panel\u2019s approach to remedies to date in this matter. In order to facilitate the immediate implementation of the general remedies ordered in the Decision, the Panel has requested additional information from the parties, monitored Canada\u2019s implementation of its orders and, through its subsequent rulings, provided additional guidance to the parties and issued a number of additional orders based on the detailed findings and reasoning already included in the Decision.\n[33] While that approach has yielded some results, it has now been over a year since the Decision and these proceedings have yet to advance past the provision of immediate relief. The Complainants, the Commission and the Interested Parties want to see meaningful change for First Nations children and families and want to ensure Canada is implementing that change at the first reasonable occasion. The Panel shares their desire for meaningful and expeditious change. The present motions are a means to test Canada\u2019s assertion that it is doing so and, where necessary, to further assist the Panel in crafting effective and meaningful orders.\n[34] This is the context in which the present motions have been filed. The Tribunal\u2019s remedial discretion must be exercised reasonably, in consideration of this particular context and the evidence presented through these motions. That evidence includes Canada\u2019s approach to compliance with respect to the Panel\u2019s orders to date, which evidence can be used by the Panel to make findings and to determine the motions of the parties.\n(ii) Separation of powers\n[35] In crafting further orders, Canada urges the Tribunal to bear in mind general principles regarding the appropriate separation of powers. That is, the Tribunal should leave the precise method of remedying the breach to the body charged with responsibility for implementing the order. According to Canada, the Tribunal would exceed its authority if it were to make orders resulting in it taking over the detailed management and coordination of the reform currently being undertaken.\n[36] Canada submits deference must be afforded to allow it to exercise its role in the development and implementation of policy and the spending of public funds. Absent statutory authority or a challenge on constitutional grounds, courts and tribunals do not have the institutional jurisdiction to interfere with the allocation of public funds or the development of public policy. To the extent the Tribunal is being asked to make additional remedial orders that would require it to dictate policies or authorize the spending of public funds, Canada contends those requests should be denied as they would exceed the Tribunal' s jurisdiction.\n[37] Canada\u2019s separation of powers argument lacks specificity. Aside from one specific order requested by the Caring Society, which the Panel will address in a separate ruling, Canada has not pointed to any other orders requested by the other parties to which this argument would apply. For the purposes of this ruling, it has not identified any requested orders related to Jordan\u2019s Principle that may offend the separation of powers. In any event, as explained in the reasons below, any further orders made by the Panel are based on the findings and orders in the Decision and subsequent rulings, which Canada has accepted; the evidence presented on these motions; and, the Panel\u2019s powers under section 53(2) of the Act. In performing this analysis, Canada\u2019s generalized separation of powers argument is not particularly helpful.\nB. Further orders requested\n(i) Definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle\n[38] Despite Canada\u2019s assurances that its definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle now applies to all First Nations children, regardless of their condition or place of residency, the Caring Society submits that government officials have been promulgating a restrictive definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle that still focuses on children with disabilities or with a critical short-term condition requiring heath or social services. The Caring Society adds that INAC has yet to undertake a review of past Jordan\u2019s Principle cases where services were denied. While Health Canada is engaged in a process of looking at past Jordan\u2019s Principle cases where services were denied, the Caring Society and the AFN are unclear about the number of years into the past this process is considering.\n[39] Moreover, the Caring Society is concerned that the definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle is limited to children as defined by provincial legislation. In some provinces, a child is defined as being under the age of 16. Such an approach is unacceptable to the Caring Society because Jordan\u2019s Principle is not restricted to services provided under a province\u2019s child and family services legislation. Similarly, the Caring Society submits that Jordan\u2019s Principle requires an outcome-based, and not process-based, approach to access to services. That is, the provincial\/territorial normative standard of care is an inadequate measure when designing programs and initiatives to provide substantive equality to First Nations children.\n[40] The Commission generally agrees with the Caring Society that the Tribunal should provide additional guidance by clarifying the exact definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle that is to be applied, going forward, to redress the discriminatory practices identified in the Decision. Considering the rulings already made by the Panel to date, the Commission suggested certain key principles that any definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle must include.\n[41] While Canada has done some work to implement Jordan\u2019s Principle since the Decision, it still has not implemented its full meaning and scope. As mentioned above, in 2016 CHRT 16, the Panel indicated that a definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle that applies to First Nations children with \u201cdisabilities and those who present with a discrete, short-term issue for which there is a critical need for health and social supports\u201d appeared to be more restrictive than formulated by Parliament. Following the Panel\u2019s request for further information, and pursuant to the evidence presented in the course of these motions, the Panel can now confirm that Canada has indeed been applying a narrow definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle that is not in compliance with the Panel\u2019s previous orders.\n[42] Canada put forward three witnesses in response to the motions of the Complainants and the Interested Parties:\n\u00b7 Ms. Robin Buckland, Executive Director of the Office of Primary Health Care within Health Canada\u2019s First Nations and Inuit Health Branch;\n\u00b7 Ms. Cassandra Lang, Director, Children and Families, in the Children and Families Branch at INAC; and,\n\u00b7 Ms. Lee Cranton, Director, Northern Operations in Ontario Region within Health Canada\u2019s First Nations and Inuit Health Branch.\n[43] Each of these three witnesses swore an affidavit and was cross-examined thereon by the other parties, all of which was put before the Panel in the context of these motions. Generally, the three witnesses presented similar testimonial evidence in support of Canada\u2019s position. However, as the Panel will explain in the pages that follow and with a primary focus on the evidence of Ms. Buckland, their testimony in relation to Jordan\u2019s Principle was not corroborated by the bulk of the documentary evidence emanating from Canada and dated over the last year since the Decision.\n[44] Ms. Buckland is the federal government official responsible for implementing Jordan\u2019s Principle. She has been involved in doing so since the Decision\u2019s release (see Gillespie Reporting Services, transcript of Cross-Examination of Robin Buckland, Ottawa, Vol. I at p. 15, lines 21-23 [Transcript of Cross-Examination of Ms. Buckland]).\n[45] In her affidavit, Ms. Buckland states that the previous restrictions found in the definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle have now been eliminated, including the requirement that First Nations children must have multiple disabilities that require multiple service providers or that they must reside on reserve. Despite this, she states that families are often not coming forward to request support. In this regard, she indicates proactive efforts in partnership with service delivery organizations on the ground will need to continue and that Canada has commenced various engagement activities to help facilitate the broader application of Jordan\u2019s Principle (see affidavit of Ms. Robin Buckland, January 25, 2017, at paras. 3, 16-17).\n[46] Ms. Buckland further explained that the current definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle, which applies to First Nations children with \u201cdisabilities and those who present with a discrete, short-term issue for which there is a critical need for health and social supports\u201d, was to focus efforts on the most vulnerable children:\n[I]t's more about looking for the highest area of need and, and trying to focus our efforts.\nTranscript of Cross-Examination of Ms. Buckland at p. 17, lines 12-13.\n[A] child living on reserve with an interim, a condition or short-term condition or a disability affecting their activities of daily living was a focus of our efforts, was and is a focus of our efforts in terms of Jordan's Principle.\nTranscript of Cross-Examination of Ms. Buckland at p. 39 lines, 17-21.\nWhenever you're working on a complex health issue, you always take a multi-modal approach to it. There's always different angles from which you need to be able to address the problem if you are going to make a difference. The focus on First Nations children on reserve with a disability or a short-term condition with -- that affects their activities of daily living is an effort, is our effort to try to get at a segment of the population, a subset of the population where we feel there is an opportunity to make -- where we feel there is the greatest need and where we feel there is an opportunity to make the greatest difference.\nSo I think as I said earlier, we were -- it was unfortunate that our communications in the beginning did not -- were not properly prefaced, indicating that Jordan's Principle applies to all First Nations children.\nTranscript of Cross-Examination of Ms. Buckland at p. 40, lines 10-25.\nWe're trying to focus, we're trying to start somewhere and trying to -- where are we likely to find the greatest number of jurisdictional disputes.\nTranscript of Cross-Examination of Ms. Buckland at p. 41, lines 4-6.\nChildren with disability or critical interim need is, is a particular focus. Jordan`s Principle, as I mentioned just moments ago, applies to all first nations kids and who have an unmet need in terms of health and social needs.\nTranscript of Cross-Examination of Ms. Buckland at p. 275, lines 19-23.\n[47] As the Caring Society points out at paragraph 24 of its December 16, 2016 submissions, the Decision found Canada\u2019s similarly narrow definition and approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle to have contributed to service gaps, delays and denials for First Nations children on reserve. Specifically, the evidence before the Panel in determining the Decision indicated Health Canada and INAC\u2019s approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle focused mainly on \u201cinter-governmental disputes in situations where a child has multiple disabilities requiring services from multiple service providers\u201d (see Decision at paras. 350-382). Indeed, the Panel specifically highlighted gaps in services to children beyond those with multiples disabilities. For example, an INAC document referenced in the Decision, entitled INAC and Health Canada First Nation Programs: Gaps in Service Delivery to First Nation Children and Families in BC Region, indicates that these gaps non-exhaustively include mental health services, medical equipment, travel for medical appointments, food replacement, addictions services, dental services and medications (see Decision at paras. 368-373).\n[48] As the Panel also highlighted in the Decision, the Federal Court likewise found Health Canada and INAC\u2019s focused approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle to be narrow and the finding that the principle was not engaged with respect to Jeremy Meawasige, a teenager with multiple disabilities and high care needs, to be unreasonable (see Pictou Landing Band Council v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 FC 342 [\u201cPictou Landing\u201d]).\n[49] The justification advanced by Ms. Buckland for the focused approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle is the same one advanced by Canada in the past and underscored by the Panel in the Decision (see paras. 359 and 368-369). Specifically, in a Health Canada PowerPoint presentation from 2011, entitled Update on Jordan\u2019s Principle: The Federal Government Response (Exhibit R-14, Tab 39 at p. 6), Canada indicated:\nThis slide presents an overview of the federal response to Jordan\u2019s Principle. We acknowledge that there are differing views regarding Jordan\u2019s Principle. The federal response endeavors to ensure that the needs of the most vulnerable children at risk of having services disrupted as a result of jurisdictional disputes are met.\n[\u2026]\nThe Government of Canada\u2019s focus is on children with multiple disabilities requiring services from multiple service providers whose quality of life will be negatively impacted by jurisdictional disputes. These are children who are the most vulnerable \u2013 children like Jordan.\n[50] Despite the findings in the Decision, Canada has repeated its pattern of conduct and narrow focus with respect to Jordan\u2019s Principle. In February 2016, a few weeks after the release of the Decision, Canada considered various new definitions of Jordan\u2019s Principle. Those new definitions and their implications are found in a document entitled The Way Forward for the Federal Response to Jordan\u2019s Principle \u2013 Proposed Definitions, dated February 11, 2016 (Exhibits to the Cross-Examination of Ms. Cassandra Lang on her affidavit dated January 25, 2017, February 7-8, 2017, at tab 4):\nProposed Definition Options\nKey Elements and Considerations\nOption One:\nJordan\u2019s Principle is a child-first approach to address the needs of First Nation children assessed as having disabilities\/special needs by ensuring cross jurisdictional issues to not disrupt, delay or prevent a child from accessing services. Under Jordan\u2019s Principle, in the event that there is a dispute over payment of services between or within governments, First Nation children living on reserve (or ordinarily on reserve) will receive required social and health supports comparable to the standard of care set by the province (normative standard). The agency of first contact will pay for the services until there is a resolution.\nKey Elements\nSimilar to the criteria and scope as original JP response but broader than original definition (which was limited to \u201cchildren with multiple disabilities requiring services from multiple service providers), this approach maintains a focus on children with special needs.\nBroadens the definition of jurisdictional dispute to include intergovernmental disputes (not just federal\/provincial) this responds\nConsiderations:\nMay draw criticism due the continued focus on special needs (while broader) as the original JP response.\nMaintaining the notion of comparability to provincial resources may not address the criticism of the Tribunal regarding the need to ensure substantive equality in the provision of services.\nThe focus on a dispute does not account for potential gaps in services where no jurisdiction is providing the required services.\nOption Two:\nJordan\u2019s Principle is a child-first approach to address the assessed needs of First Nation children by ensuring cross jurisdictional issues to not disrupt, delay or prevent a child from accessing services. Under Jordan\u2019s Principle, in the event that there is a dispute over payment of services between or within governments, First Nation children living on reserve (or ordinarily on reserve) will receive required social and health supports comparable to the standard of care set by the province (normative standard). The agency of first contact will pay for the services until there is a resolution.\nKey Elements:\nSimilar to Option One with the exception of broadening the scope to include all First Nation children on reserve rather than limited to special needs.\nMaintains original focus on:\njurisdictional disputes\nnormative standards set by province (with a modification to move away from specific reference to geographical comparability\nConsiderations:\nResponds to the key direction of the Tribunal by broadening the scope beyond children with special needs. However, the broader scope may also dilute the focus on some of the most vulnerable children.\nMay have significant resources implications and may go beyond current policy authorities and\/or program mandates.\nOption Three:\nJordan\u2019s Principle is a child-first approach to address the assessed needs of First Nation c children by ensuring cross jurisdictional issues to not disrupt delay or prevent a child from accessing services. In the event that there is a dispute over payment of services between or within governments, First Nation children will receive required social and health supports. The agency of first contact will pay for the services until there is a resolution.\nKey Elements:\nBroader scope \u2013 does not limit the response to First Nation children living on reserve.\nA dispute between governments or within government is still required in order to trigger JP.\nConsiderations:\nThe inclusion of all First Nation children may have far reaching resource implications and will require additional policy and program mandates.\nThe continued focus on instances where there is a dispute may limit the ability for JP to respond to gaps in service (where no jurisdiction is providing the required service).\nOption Four:\nJordan\u2019s Principle is a child-first approach to address the assessed needs of First Nation children by ensuring cross jurisdictional issues to not disrupt, delay or prevent a child from accessing services. Under Jordan\u2019s Principle, First Nation children will receive required social and health supports. The issue of payment will be resolved by the government involved, the agency of first contact will pay for the services until there is a resolution.\nKey Elements:\nA very broad application of the principle that includes all First Nation children and does not require an identified jurisdictional dispute in order to trigger JP.\nConsiderations:\nConsiderable resource and policy and program implications\nGoes beyond the Tribunal recommendations and has implications for federal mandate given that there are gaps in services that are not currently funded by any level of government.\nProvinces may react to federal definition as it may put additional financial pressures on partners involved\n[51] The Panel finds The Way Forward for the Federal Response to Jordan\u2019s Principle \u2013 Proposed Definitions document relevant and reliable. Not only is it an internal government document filed into evidence but, similar to the August 2012 presentation entitled First Nations Child and Family Services Program (FNCFS) The Way Forward discussed in the Decision (see at paras. 292-302), it presents options that inform government decision making. As The Way Forward for the Federal Response to Jordan\u2019s Principle \u2013 Proposed Definitions document specifies:\nThe definitions and\/or principles described above represent a menu of possible options (not mutually exclusive) that the federal government could draw from to meet the Tribunal\u2019s order to cease applying a narrow definition of Jordan's Principle and take measures to implement its full meaning and scope.\n[52] Ultimately, it was \u201coption one\u201d that was selected for implementation, an option that The Way Forward for the Federal Response to Jordan\u2019s Principle \u2013 Proposed Definitions document considers to not be fully responsive to the Tribunal\u2019s order. As the Caring Society and the Commission highlight in their submissions and the Panel confirmed in its review of the documents on record, including those referenced at pages 59-60 of the Caring Society\u2019s February 28, 2017 submissions, this definition and approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle was recently presented internally and externally to a number of organizations and First Nations in the following terms:\nFirst Nations children living on reserve with a disability or a short-term condition.\nFirst Nations children living on reserve with a disability or a short-term condition requiring health or social services.\nFirst Nations children with a disability or a critical short-term health or social service need living on reserve, or who ordinarily reside on reserve.\nFirst Nation child with a disability or a discrete condition that requires services or supports that cannot be addressed within existing authorities.\nFirst Nation children living on reserve with an ongoing disability affecting their activities of daily living, as well as those who have a short term issue for which there is a critical need for health or social supports.\nFirst Nations children living on reserve and in the Yukon who have a disability or an interim critical condition affecting their activities of daily living have access to health and social services comparable to children living off reserve.\nFirst Nations children with a disability or interim critical condition living on reserve have access to needed health and social services within the normative standard of care in their province\/territory of residence.\n[53] These iterations of Jordan\u2019s Principle do not capture all First Nations children. Instead, as stated by the Caring Society at paragraph 15 of its December 16, 2016 submissions, they capture \u201c\u2026varying subsets of First Nations children with disabilities or short-term conditions.\u201d Notwithstanding the above, Ms. Buckland indicates that Canada still meant for Jordan\u2019s Principle to apply to all First Nations children and that the fact the definition does not reflect all First Nations children is a communications issue and not a narrow application of the principle.\n[54] The Panel does not accept this explanation. Ms. Buckland\u2019s assertion is not supported by the preponderance of evidence presented on this motion, which includes various charts, communication documents, and even extracts from INAC\u2019s website.\n[55] A significant example is The Way Forward for the Federal Response to Jordan\u2019s Principle \u2013 Proposed Definitions document referred to above. The consideration of each of the four options indicates that the definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle adopted by Canada was a calculated, analyzed and informed policy choice based on financial impacts and potential risks rather than on the needs or the best interests of First Nations children, which Jordan\u2019s Principle is meant to protect and should be the goal of Canada\u2019s programming (see Decision at para. 482).\n[56] Another example is a letter dated January 19, 2017, addressed to Ontario First Nation Chiefs and Council Members, entitled Attention: Ontario First Nation Chiefs and Council Members, Subject: Update-Jordan\u2019s Principle- Responding to the needs of First Nations children (Answers to requests of Lee Cranton, March 7, 2017, at tab 13). In the letter, the Ontario Regional Executive for the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch announces the implementation of a new initiative designed to address the health and social needs of First Nations children with \u201c\u2026an ongoing disability affecting their daily living, or for those with a short-term issue where there is a critical need for health or social services.\u201d The letter comes almost a year after the Decision, nearly 9 months after the April 2016 ruling and, more significantly, after the Panel indicated in its September 2016 ruling that Health Canada and INAC\u2019s definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle appeared to be overly narrow and not in line with the Panel\u2019s previous findings and orders.\n[57] A Health Canada presentation entitled Jordan\u2019s Principle \u2013 Child First Initiative presented on September 15, 2016 to the Non-Insured Health Benefits Committee, and on October 6, 2016 to the Innu Round Table, indicates that the new approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle, restricted to children with disabilities or critical interim conditions living on reserve, will continue up to 2019 (see September 15, 2016 presentation at Exhibits to the cross-examination of Robin Buckland on her affidavit dated January 25, 2017, February 6-7, 2017, tab 5, at pp. 4-5; and, October 6, 2016 presentation at Affidavit of Cassandra Lang, January 25, 2017, Exhibit 2, Annex I, at pp. 4-5). At page 5, the presentation provides a \u201cThen and Now\u201d table comparing Canada\u2019s approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle from 2008-2016 to that in 2016-2019:\n2008-2016\n2016-2019\nDispute-based, triggered after declaration of a dispute over payment for services within Canada, or between Canada and a province\nNeeds-based, child-first approach to ensure access to services without delay or disruption due to jurisdictional gaps.\nFirst Nations child living on reserve or ordinarily resident on reserve\nStill First Nations child on reserve or ordinarily resident on reserve\nAre within the age range of \u201cchildren\u201d as defined in their province\/territory of residence\nChild assessed with:\nmultiple disabilities requiring multiple providers\nChildren assessed with needing health and\/or social supports because of:\na disability affecting activities of daily living; OR\nan interim critical condition affecting activities of daily living\nChild required services comparable to provincial normative standards of care for children off-reserve in a similar geographic location\nChild requires services comparable to provincial normative standards of care, AND requests BEYOND the normative standard will be considered on a case-by-case basis\n[58] The Jordan\u2019s Principle \u2013 Child First Initiative presentation specifies that the goal of the new approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle is \u201c\u2026to help ensure that children living on reserve with a disability or interim critical condition have equitable access to health and social services comparable to children living off reserve\u201d (at p. 6). At page 8, the October 6, 2016 presentation goes on to provide a \u201cJP Fund \u2013 Eligibility Determination Checklist\u201d which asks questions such as: is the request for a child as defined by provincial law? Does the child live on reserve or ordinarily lives on reserve? Does the child have a disability that impacts his\/her activities of daily living at home, school or within the community, or has an interim critical condition requiring health or social services or supports? Does the request fall within the normative standard of care of the province or territory of residence?\n[59] These presentations are meant to inform and guide individuals on how Canada is implementing Jordan\u2019s Principle. In another similar example, in a letter dated August 8, 2016, addressed to all First Nations and Inuit Health Branch and Band employed nurses in Alberta, with the subject line \u201cGovernment of Canada\u2019s New Approach to Implementing Jordan\u2019s Principle\u201d (see Affidavit of Cassandra Lang, January 25, 2017, Exhibit 2, Annex I at p.2), the Director of Nursing for the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch, Alberta Region, writes:\nPlease read the information below\/attached to orientate yourself to the new approach.\nThere will be further details coming to help guide your assistance with these clients.\nAs part of your regular work, if you see or are approached about a First Nations child with disabilities (short-term or long term) that may not be receiving the needed health or social services normally provided to a child off-reserve please contact FNIHB-AB.\n[60] The letter attaches a guide illustrating the process to be followed in assessing a potential Jordan\u2019s Principle case. Despite the case-by-case analysis stated in other presentations for situations falling outside the eligibility criteria, the process indicated in the chart for nurses steers those cases away from the application of Jordan\u2019s Principle. The first question in the chart is: \u201cDoes the child have needs related to a disability or a short term health issue that are not being met?\u201d If the answer is \u2018no\u2019, the chart indicates that the \u201cClient\/Family should access regular programming.\u201d If the answer to this first question is \u2018yes\u2019, then the next question is: \u201cAre there programs on reserve, or easily accessed off reserve, that could meet those needs?\u201d If the answer to this second question is \u2018no\u2019, the chart directs the nurses to: \u201cGather the related information and send to the JP focal point (JPFP) (See Contacts).\u201d If the answer to the second question is \u2018yes\u2019, the nurse can \u201c\u2026make these referrals as they normally would i.e. Home Care, NIHB, PCN services.\u201d\n[61] At the time of Ms. Buckland\u2019s cross-examination, in February 2017, INAC\u2019s website continued to espouse the narrow definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle:\nThe Government of Canada\u2019s new approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle is a child-first approach that addresses in a timely manner the needs of First Nations children living on reserve with a disability or a short-term condition.\n\u201cFact Sheet: Jordan's Principle - Addressing the Needs of First Nations Children\u201d, Government of Canada (February 4, 2017), Exhibits to the cross-examination of Robin Buckland on her affidavit dated January 25, 2017, February 6-7, 2017, at tab 7; see also Transcript of Cross-Examination of Ms. Buckland at pp.43-45.\n[62] Canada submits that it has now removed any restrictions in its definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle. However, only one document submitted prior to Ms. Buckland\u2019s cross-examination supports this point. A November 2016 presentation to the \u201cADM Oversight Steering Committee\u201d states: \u201cJordan\u2019s Principle (JP) reflects a commitment to ensure all First Nations children receive access to services available to other Canadian children, in a timely manner\u201d [Health Canada, Jordan\u2019s Principle: Engaging with partners to design long-term approach, presentation dated November 2016 (Affidavit of Robin Buckland, January 25, 2017, Exhibit H, at p. 2)]. It goes on to indicate that Health Canada and INAC are implementing a child-first approach, \u201caddressing specific needs of children on a case-by-case basis.\u201d When compared to other presentations submitted into evidence, as outlined above, it does not appear that this presentation was widely communicated, within or outside government. It is also unclear that the principles enunciated therein have been implemented.\n[63] Two other documents could be said to support Canada\u2019s assertion that it has now removed any restrictions in its definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle. Both those documents were submitted following Ms. Buckland\u2019s cross-examination and in answer to requests from the other parties.\n[64] The first document is another presentation, dated December 21, 2016. It indicates, among other things, that Jordan\u2019s Principle applies to all First Nations children, that the Government of Canada recognizes that First Nations on reserve face greater difficulty in accessing Federal\/Provincial\/Territorial supports, and, that Canada is focused on the most vulnerable children \u2013 those with a disability or critical short-term condition (see Health Canada, Improving Access to Health and Social Services for First Nations Children, presentation dated December 21, 2016 (Answers to requests of Robin Buckland, March 7, 2017, tab 3B, at pp. 2 and 5). The presentation does not specify who it was presented to and, again, when compared to other presentations submitted into evidence, it does not appear to have been widely distributed or communicated, if at all.\n[65] The other document contains notes from a \u201cFebruary 10th\u201d meeting with regional executives (see Answers to requests of Robin Buckland, March 7, 2017, at tab 3A). It states:\nUpdate on JP\napplies to all FN children, not just on reserve\nJP not limited to short term needs and disabilities\nall FN children, all disputes, all needs\neach order from CHRT has clarified our responsibilities\nfocus was on disability because of greatest need and access issues and likelihood of jurisdictional disputes\ncomms tools and key messages \u2013 getting these out\nwill be asked to go back to all stakeholders and clarify our directions\n[\u2026]\nNext Steps\nwill follow up with written lines which will say:\no all FN children, on and off reserve\no all jurisdictional disputes e.g. between departments\no not limited to children with disabilities or short term critical needs\n[66] Based on the wording of the notes, it is clear that they came from a meeting in February 2017: \u201capplies to all FN children, not just on reserve\u201d (this requirement was clarified in September 2016 in 2016 CHRT 16); \u201ceach order from CHRT has clarified our responsibilities\u201d (only one order in February 2016); and, \u201cfocus was on disability because of greatest need and access issues and likelihood of jurisdictional disputes\u201d (this more detailed \u201cfocus\u201d characterization only arises following Ms. Buckland\u2019s cross-examination). Again, when compared to the other evidence, the definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle discussed at this meeting does not appear to have been widely distributed or communicated, if at all, and it is also unclear that the principles enunciated therein have now been implemented.\n[67] Accordingly, the Panel finds the evidence presented on this motion establishes that Canada\u2019s definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle does not fully address the findings in the Decision and is not sufficiently responsive to the previous orders of this Panel. While Canada has indeed broadened its application of Jordan\u2019s Principle since the Decision and removed some of the previous restrictions it had on the use of the principle, it nevertheless continues to narrow the application of the principle to certain First Nations children.\n[68] Presumably, while Canada could have implemented the actual definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle, as ordered by the Panel, and at the same time implemented a method to focus on the urgent needs of certain children, that was not the course of action taken by Canada. Having a broad definition does not exclude the possibility of having a process to deal with some children on a more urgent basis. However, there is a distinction between, on the one hand, having an inclusive definition and then attributing priorities in terms of urgencies and, on the other hand, limiting the definition with the result of excluding individuals for the sake of focusing on more vulnerable cases.\n[69] Furthermore, the emphasis on the \u201cnormative standard of care\u201d or \u201ccomparable\u201d services in many of the iterations of Jordan\u2019s Principle above does not answer the findings in the Decision with respect to substantive equality and the need for culturally appropriate services (see Decision at para. 465). The normative standard of care should be used to establish the minimal level of service only. To ensure substantive equality and the provision of culturally appropriate services, the needs of each individual child must be considered and evaluated, including taking into account any needs that stem from historical disadvantage and the lack of on-reserve and\/or surrounding services (see Decision at paras. 399-427).\n[70] In this regard, the normative standard of care in a particular province may help to identify some gaps in services to First Nations children. It is also a good indicator of the services that any child should receive, whether First Nations or not. For example, in the hearing on the merits, the Panel heard that Health Canada will only pay for one medical device out of three and, if it is a wheelchair, it is paid for once every five years. The normative standard of care generally provides for all three devices to be paid for (see Decision at para. 366 and Jordan\u2019s Principle Dispute Resolution Preliminary Report (Terms of Reference Officials Working Group, May 2009), Exhibit HR-13, tab 302). This example highlights the gap and flawed rationale contributing to Health Canada\u2019s policy, which does not take into account a child\u2019s growth over five years.\n[71] However, the normative standard may also fail to identify gaps in services to First Nations children, regardless of whether a particular service is offered to other Canadian children. As The Way Forward for the Federal Response to Jordan\u2019s Principle \u2013 Proposed Definitions document identifies above, under the \u201cConsiderations\u201d for \u201cOption One\u201d: \u201cThe focus on a dispute [over payment of services between or within governments] does not account for potential gaps in services where no jurisdiction is providing the required services.\u201d\n[72] This potential gap in services was highlighted in the Pictou Landing case mentioned above and in the Decision. Where a provincial policy excluded a severely handicapped First Nations teenager from receiving home care services simply because he lived on reserve, the Federal Court determined that Jordan\u2019s Principle existed precisely to address the situation (see Pictou Landing at paras. 96-97). Furthermore, First Nations children may need additional services that other Canadians do not, as the Panel explained in the Decision at paragraphs 421-422:\n[421] In her own recent comprehensive research assessing the health and well-being of First Nations people living on reserve, Dr. Bombay found that children of Residential School survivors reported greater adverse childhood experiences and greater traumas in adulthood, all of which appeared to contribute to greater depressive symptoms in Residential School offspring (see Annex, ex. 53 at p. 373; see also Transcript Vol. 40 at pp. 69, 71).\n[422] Dr. Bombay\u2019s evidence helps inform the child and family services needs of Aboriginal peoples. Generally, it reinforces the higher level of need for those services on-reserves. By focusing on bringing children into care, the FNCFS Program, corresponding funding formulas and other related provincial\/territorial agreements perpetuate the damage done by Residential Schools rather than attempting to address past harms. The history of Residential Schools and the intergenerational trauma it has caused is another reason - on top of some of the other underlying risk factors affecting Aboriginal children and families such as poverty and poor infrastructure - that exemplify the additional need of First Nations people to receive adequate child and family services, including least disruptive measures and, especially, services that are culturally appropriate.\n[73] Therefore, the fact that it is considered an \u201cexception\u201d to go beyond the normative standard of care is concerning given the findings in the Decision, which findings Canada accepted and did not challenge. The discrimination found in the Decision is in part caused by the way in which health and social programs, policies and funding formulas are designed and operate, and the lack of coordination amongst them. The aim of these programs, policies and funding should be to address the needs for First Nations children and families. There should be better coordination between federal government departments to ensure that they address those needs and do not result in adverse impacts or service delays and denials for First Nations. Over the past year, the Panel has given Canada much flexibility in terms of remedying the discrimination found in the Decision. Reform was ordered. However, based on the evidence presented on this motion regarding Jordan\u2019s Principle, Canada seems to want to continue proffering similar policies and practices to those that were found to be discriminatory. Any new programs, policies, practices or funding implemented by Canada should be informed by previous shortfalls and should not simply be an expansion of previous practices that did not work and resulted in discrimination. They should be meaningful and effective in redressing and preventing discrimination.\n[74] Canada\u2019s narrow interpretation of Jordan\u2019s Principle, coupled with a lack of coordination amongst its programs to First Nations children and families (as will be discussed in the next section), along with an emphasis on existing policies and avoiding the potential high costs of services, is not the approach that is required to remedy discrimination. Rather, decisions must be made in the best interest of the children. While the Ministers of Health and Indigenous Affairs have expressed their support for the best interest of children, the information emanating from Health Canada and INAC, as highlighted in this ruling, does not follow through on what the Ministers have expressed.\n[75] Overall, the Panel finds that Canada is not in full compliance with the previous Jordan\u2019s Principle orders in this matter. It tailored its documentation, communications and resources to follow its broadened, but still overly narrow, definition and application of Jordan\u2019s Principle. Presenting a criterion-based definition, without mentioning that it is solely a focus, does not capture all First Nations children under Jordan\u2019s Principle. Furthermore, emphasizing the normative standard of care does not ensure substantive equality for First Nations children and families. This is especially problematic given the fact that Canada has admittedly encountered challenges in identifying children who meet the requirements of Jordan\u2019s Principle and in getting parents to come forward to identify children who have unmet needs (see Transcript of Cross-Examination of Ms. Buckland at p. 43, lines 1-8).\n[76] On this last point, the evidence indicates and the Panel wishes to highlight that any funding set aside to address Jordan\u2019s Principle cases that is not spent in a given year cannot be carried over into the next year. It is set and has to be spent on Jordan\u2019s Principle cases or it is returned to the consolidated revenue fund of Canada. In this regard, from July 2016 to February 2017, only approximately $12 million or a little over 15% of the $76.6 million budgeted for Jordan\u2019s Principle in 2016-2017 had been spent, $8 million of which was for respite care services in Manitoba [see \u201cJordan\u2019s Principle - Child First initiative\u201d, presentation to the Non-Insured Health Benefits Committee, September 15, 2016 (Exhibits to the cross-examination of Robin Buckland on her affidavit dated January 25, 2017, February 6-7, 2017, tab 5, at p. 10); \u201cJordan\u2019s Principle, Health Canada and INAC 2016-17 Dashboard, Service Access Resolution Funding\u201d, valid as of January 11, 2017 (Affidavit of Robin Buckland, January 25, 2017, Exhibit A); \u201cMemorandum to Senior Assistant Deputy Minister, Requests for Funding for Respite Care and Allied Services under Jordan\u2019s Principle\u201d, October 3, 2016 (Affidavit of Robin Buckland, January 25, 2017, Exhibit B, at p. 2); \u201cMemorandum to Senior Assistant Deputy Minister, Request for Funding in Manitoba Region for Specialized Therapy Services Under Jordan\u2019s Principle\u201d, December 9, 2016 (Affidavit of Robin Buckland, January 25, 2017, Exhibit B, at p. 2); and, \u201c2016-17 JP-CFI Allocation by Region\u201d (Answers to requests of Robin Buckland, March 7, 2017, at tab 9)].\n[77] Canada\u2019s current approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle is similar to the strategy it employed from 2009-2012 and as described in paragraph 356 of the Decision. During that time, Canada allocated $11 million to fund Jordan\u2019s Principle. The funds were provided annually, in $3 million increments. No Jordan\u2019s Principle cases were identified and the funds were never accessed and lapsed. The Panel determined it was Health Canada and INAC\u2019s narrow interpretation of Jordan\u2019s Principle that resulted in there being no cases meeting the criteria for Jordan\u2019s Principle (see Decision at paras. 379-382).\n[78] Despite Jordan\u2019s Principle being an effective means by which to immediately address some of the shortcomings in the provision of child and family services to First Nations identified in the Decision while a comprehensive reform is undertaken, Canada\u2019s approach to the principle risks perpetuating the discrimination and service gaps identified in the Decision, especially with respect to allocating dedicated funds and resources to address some of these issues (see Decision at para. 356). In this sense, the evidence shows that Canada\u2019s funding of $382 million over three years for Jordan\u2019s Principle is not an investment that covers the broad definition ordered by the Panel in the Decision and subsequent rulings. Similar to Canada\u2019s past practice, it is a yearly pool of funding that expires if not accessed. Also, it is tailored to be responsive to the narrow definition Canada selected and, as specifically mentioned in Canada\u2019s own documents, this fund only covers First Nations children on reserve. Now, with a broadening of the definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle and the expiration of some of the funding, resources to address Jordan\u2019s Principle may become scarce [see \u201cFirst Nations and Inuit Health Branch, Regional Executive Forum, Record of Discussion and Decisions\u201d, August 9, 2016 (Answers to requests of Robin Buckland, March 7, 2017, at tab 3A)].\n[79] Again, the Panel recognizes that Canada made some efforts to implement Jordan\u2019s Principle and had a short time frame within which to do so following this Panel\u2019s ruling in April 2016. However, the same cannot be said for the numerous months following the April ruling, especially following the September 2016 ruling and up to the time of the hearing of these motions in March 2017. That said, the Panel believes Canada wants to comply with the Decision and related orders and has communicated as much [for example, see \u201cFact Sheet: Jordan\u2019s Principle - Addressing the Needs of First Nations Children\u201d (Answers to requests of Robin Buckland, March 7, 2017, at tab 3A); and, \u201cFNIHB SMC-P&P, Record of Decisions\u201d, May 18, 2016 (Answers to Requests of Robin Buckland, March 7, 2017, at tab 5, p. 1)].\n[80] Despite this, nearly one year since the April 2016 ruling and over a year since the Decision, Canada continues to restrict the full meaning and intent of Jordan\u2019s Principle. The Panel finds Canada is not in full compliance with the previous Jordan\u2019s Principle orders in this matter. There is a need for further orders from this Panel, pursuant to section 53(2)(a) and (b) of the Act, to ensure the full meaning and scope of Jordan\u2019s Principle is implemented by Canada. In this regard, to redress Canada\u2019s previous discriminatory practices, the Panel notes that there are no restrictions that it is aware of that would stop individuals who were previously denied funding under Jordan\u2019s Principle, or who would now be considered to fall within the application of Jordan\u2019s Principle, from now coming forward and submitting or resubmitting their request. In fact, as highlighted by the Caring Society, considering Canada\u2019s previously narrow application of Jordan\u2019s Principle from at least 2009 to present, it would be appropriate and reasonable for Canada to review previous requests for funding that were denied, whether made pursuant to Jordan\u2019s Principle or otherwise, to ensure compliance with the correct application of Jordan\u2019s Principle ordered in this ruling.\n[81] All the Panel\u2019s orders with respect to the implementation of the full meaning and scope of Jordan\u2019s Principle are detailed in the \u201cOrder\u201d section below, under \u201cDefinition of Jordan\u2019s Principle.\n(ii) Changes to the processing and tracking of Jordan\u2019s Principle cases\n[82] Canada believes its new processes ensure any Jordan\u2019s Principle case is not delayed due to case conferencing or policy review. As mentioned above, it alleges urgent cases are addressed within 12 hours, while other cases are addressed within 5 business days, and complex cases which require follow-up or consultation with others are addressed within 7 business days.\n[83] The Caring Society submits that Canada\u2019s revised processes for dealing with Jordan\u2019s Principle cases still impose delays. The AFN shares the Caring Society\u2019s view that the arm of government first contacted still does not address the matter directly by funding the service and seeking reimbursement afterwards as is required by Jordan\u2019s Principle. In this regard, Canada\u2019s service standards relate to the lapse of time for a decision to be made and not the time it takes for the services to be actually provided to a child. Therefore, Canada should be required to confirm to the Tribunal that its process has been modified so that the government organization that is first contacted pays for the service without the need for policy review or case conferencing before funding is provided.\n[84] Also, the Caring Society points out that Canada lacks a transparent and independent mechanism for a family or service provider to appeal a Jordan\u2019s Principle case. While a family of a child can request an appeal, there are no appeal procedures described or provided, no timelines for the appeal process and no assurance that written reasons will be provided.\n[85] Furthermore, the Caring Society submits that Canada is not formally tracking the number of Jordan\u2019s Principle cases that are denied or in progress. It is also not measuring its performance against its stated timelines for resolving Jordan\u2019s Principle cases. In this regard, the AFN highlights that Jordan\u2019s Principle is meant to cover gaps in federal funding to First Nations children; however, Canada has not yet developed an internal understanding of what those gaps are.\n[86] The Commission agrees with the Caring Society\u2019s request that Canada immediately: (i) cease imposing service delays due to policy review or case conferencing, and (ii) implement reliable systems to ensure the identification of Jordan\u2019s Principle cases. However, there are arguably multiple different methods of compliance. Therefore, the Tribunal should simply set a specific deadline by which the required procedures should be put in place, and require that Canada report to the parties at that time on the means chosen.\n[87] Aside from some answers from its witnesses, Canada did not specifically address the submissions with respect to the first contact principle, appeal mechanisms or tracking.\n[88] As highlighted in the Panel\u2019s last ruling in this matter (2017 CHRT 7), in January 2017, two twelve-year-old children tragically took their own lives in Wapekeka First Nation (\u201cWapekeka\u201d), a NAN community. Before the loss of these children, Wapekeka had alerted the federal government, through Health Canada, to concerns about a suicide pact amongst a group of young children and youth. This information was contained in a detailed July 2016 proposal aimed at seeking funding for an in-community mental health team as a preventative measure.\n[89] The Wapekeka proposal was left unaddressed by Canada for several months with a reactive response coming only after the two youths committed suicide. The media response from Health Canada was that it acknowledged it had received the July 2016 proposal in September 2016; however, it came at an \u201cawkward time in the federal funding cycle\u2019\u2019 (see affidavit of Dr. Michael Kirlew, January 27, 2017, at para. 16).\n[90] While Canada provided assistance once the Wapekeka suicides occurred, the flaws in the Jordan\u2019s Principle process left any chance of preventing the Wapekeka tragedy unaddressed and the tragic events only triggered a reactive response to then provide services. On a positive note, as mentioned above, Health Canada has since committed to establishing a Choose Life Working Group with the NAN, aimed at establishing a concrete, simplified process for communities to apply for Child-First Initiative (Jordan\u2019s Principle) funding. Nevertheless, the tragic events in Wapekeka highlight the need for a shift in process coordination around Jordan\u2019s Principle.\n[91] Ms. Buckland acknowledged that the Wapekeka proposal identified a gap in services and that Jordan\u2019s Principle funds could have been allocated to address that gap. Despite this, and the fact that it was a life or death situation, Ms. Buckland indicated that because it was a group request, it would be processed like any other group request and go forward for the Assistant Deputy Minister\u2019s signature. In the end, she suggested it would have likely taken a period of two weeks to address the Wapekeka proposal (see Transcript of Cross-Examination of Ms. Buckland at p. 174, lines 19-21; p. 175, lines 1-4; p. 180, lines 1-9; and, p. 182, lines 11-16).\n[92] If a proposal such as Wapekeka\u2019s cannot be dealt with expeditiously, how are other requests being addressed? While Canada has provided detailed timelines for how it is addressing Jordan\u2019s Principle requests, the evidence shows these processes were newly created shortly after Ms. Buckland\u2019s cross-examination. There is no indication that these timelines existed prior to February 2017. Rather, the evidence suggests a built-in delay was part of the process, as there was no clarity surrounding what the process actually was [see \u201cJordan\u2019s Principle, ADM Executive Oversight Committee, Record of Decisions\u201d, September 2, 2016 (Affidavit of Robin Buckland, January 25, 2017, Exhibit F, at p. 3); see also Transcript of Cross-Examination of Ms. Buckland at p. 82, lines 1-12].\n[93] More significantly, Ms. Buckland\u2019s comments suggest the focus of Canada\u2019s Jordan\u2019s Principle processing remains on Canada\u2019s administrative needs rather than the seriousness of the requests, the need to act expeditiously and, most importantly, the needs and best interest of children. It is clear that the arm of the federal government first contacted still does not address the matter directly by funding the service and, thereafter, seeking reimbursement as is required by Jordan\u2019s Principle. The Panel finds Canada\u2019s new Jordan\u2019s Principle process to be very similar to the old one, except for a few additions. In developing this new process, there does not appear to have been much consideration given to the shortcomings of the previous process.\n[94] The timelines imposed on First Nations children and families in attempting to access Jordan\u2019s Principle funding give the government time to navigate between its own services and programs similar to what the Panel found to be problematic in the Decision. According to Ms. Buckland, a Jordan\u2019s Principle case comes to Canada\u2019s attention through the local Jordan\u2019s Principle focal point, which receives the intake form and then sends it to headquarters. The case is then evaluated by staff at headquarters, who first evaluate the case to determine if an existing program within Health Canada or INAC will pay for the service requested. It is unclear how long this intake and initial evaluation can take.\n[95] For example, the Panel was provided with an exchange of emails between Health Canada and a First Nations mother looking for assistance in busing her son with severe cerebral palsy to an off-reserve service centre with a program for special needs children (Exhibits to the cross-examination of Robin Buckland on her affidavit dated January 25, 2017, February 6-7, 2017, at tab 12). Following the initial request and an exchange of further information on January 19 and 20, 2017, Health Canada provided an update to the mother on January 27, 2017 indicating that it is working with INAC to determine if their education program could address the request. The mother wrote to Health Canada on February 3, 2017 requesting a further update from Health Canada because she had yet to hear back for them. Two weeks after receiving the initial request, Canada was still trying to navigate between its own services and programs. When presented with this case under cross-examination, Ms. Buckland indicated \u201cSo I guess there's additional work to be done and, and I'm not sure that I have a better answer for it than that\u201d (Transcript of Cross-Examination of Ms. Buckland at p. 82, lines 10-12).\n[96] Where an existing program cannot resolve the service need, headquarters staff will then determine whether the case can be determined at the staff level, the Executive Director level, or the Assistant Deputy Minister level. It is only at this point that Canada\u2019s timelines come into play (urgent cases addressed within 12 hours, other cases within 5 business days, and complex cases within 7 business days). Even then, the evidence indicates these timelines were not fully implemented at the time of Ms. Buckland\u2019s cross-examination. A draft flow chart entitled \u201cJordan\u2019s Principle Approval Process\u201d, dated February 20, 2017, and provided following Ms. Buckland\u2019s cross-examination, is marked as being in draft format (Answers to requests of Robin Buckland, March 7, 2017, at tab 11). As Ms. Buckland indicated in her cross-examination, the process is still being refined (see Transcript of Cross-Examination of Ms. Buckland at p. 119, lines 13-19).\n[97] The evidence indicates, and Ms. Buckland testified as much, that access to Jordan\u2019s Principle funding is a last resort (see Transcript of Cross-Examination of Ms. Buckland at p. 51, lines 3-9; pp. 65-67; p. 72, lines 6-21; and, pp. 76-78). The new Jordan\u2019s Principle process outlined above is very similar to the one used in the past, which the Panel found to be contributing to delays, gaps and denials of essential health and social services to First Nations children and families. Ultimately, this process factored into the Panel\u2019s findings of discrimination (see Decision at paras. 356-358, 365, 379-382, and 391).\n[98] The new process still imposes delays due to exchanges among federal government departments, whether it is called case conferencing, policy review or service navigation. As the Panel found in the Decision, this added layer of administration is counterintuitive to a principle designed to address exactly those issues, which result in delays, disruptions and\/or denials of goods or services for First Nations children. Pursuant to Jordan\u2019s Principle, once a service need is determined to exist, the government should pay for the service and determine reimbursement afterwards. In practical terms, this means that the delay in the process to evaluate the case to determine if an existing program within Health Canada or INAC will pay for the service should be eliminated. This administrative hurdle or delay, and the clear lack of coordination amongst federal programing to First Nations children and families, should be borne by Canada and not put on the shoulders of First Nations children and families in need of service.\n[99] Jordan\u2019s Principle requires that there be a direct evaluation of need at the focal point or headquarters stage and that a decision be made expeditiously. Access to Jordan\u2019s Principle funding should be a priority, not a last resort. In this regard, no specific explanation was provided for why most cases will take an average of 5 business days to process. Given urgent cases can be processed within 12 hours, it is reasonable to assume that Canada can process most Jordan\u2019s Principle cases within a similar timeframe and shall be ordered to do so.\n[100] For appeals, there is no formal process. In her affidavit, Ms. Buckland indicated that \u201cCanada is implementing an approval and appeal process to review all requests in a timely manner\u201d (Affidavit of Robin Buckland, January 25, 2017, at para. 11). Under cross-examination, she indicated that the appeals process is still being refined but currently consists of a family notifying the local Jordan\u2019s Principle focal point of the desire to appeal and that, thereafter, the case is referred to her for review at the Assistant Deputy Minister level (see Transcript of Cross-Examination of Ms. Buckland at p. 117, line 3, to p. 119, lines 3-19).\n[101] In another draft flow chart entitled \u201cJordan\u2019s Principle Appeal Process\u201d, again in draft format and subject to further refinement, dated February 20, 2017 and provided following Ms. Buckland\u2019s cross-examination, a few additional details regarding the appeals process are elaborated upon (see Answers to requests of Robin Buckland, March 7, 2017, at tab 11; and, Transcript of Cross-Examination of Ms. Buckland at p. 117, line 3, to p. 119, line 19). Under \u201cGuiding Principles\u201d it mentions, among other things, that \u201c[d]ecisions are consistently applied, and based on impartial judgement\u201d, that the \u201c[p]rocess is open, available to the public, and easily understandable\u201d, and that \u201c[d]ecisions are made within a reasonable time period, without delay, and in keeping with established service standards of Jordan\u2019s Principle.\u201d\n[102] However, it is unclear how these principles are incorporated into the actual appeals process. All that is described in the flow chart is that the regional Jordan\u2019s Principle focal point receives the request to appeal; the focal point then sends the request with any new or additional information for review to Health Canada\u2019s Senior Assistant Deputy Minister, First Nations and Inuit Health Branch and\/or INAC\u2019s Assistant Deputy Minister, Education and Social Development Programs and Partnership. If the appeal is denied, the client is provided a rationale. No timelines are mentioned in the chart and no other information on the appeals process is found in the documentary record.\n[103] In terms of the Jordan\u2019s Principle process overall, the Panel finds there is a clear need for improvement to ensure the principle is meeting the needs of First Nations children and addressing the discrimination found in the Decision. Pursuant to section 53(2)(a) of the Act, the Panel orders Canada to ensure its processes surrounding Jordan\u2019s Principle implement the standards detailed in the \u201cOrders\u201d section below, under \u201cProcessing and tracking of Jordan\u2019s Principle cases.\u201d In addition, Canada should turn its mind to the establishment of an independent appeals process with decision-makers who are Indigenous health professionals and social workers.\n[104] In terms of tracking Jordan\u2019s Principle cases, there was little evidence to suggest Canada is formally doing so beyond a very basic level. As Ms. Buckland put it, tracking \u201c\u2026definitely needs to be augmented to further track with better detail\u201d (Transcript of Cross-Examination of Ms. Buckland at p. 96, line 25, to p. 97, line; see also p. 72, line 22, to p. 73, line 22; p. 92, lines 12-15; and, p. 97, line 10, to p. 98, line 2). A November 2016 presentation to the Assistant Deputy Minister Oversight Steering Committee, entitled \u201cJordan\u2019s Principle: Engaging with partners to design long-term approach\u201d (Affidavit of Robin Buckland, January 25, 2017, Exhibit H), indicates under \u201cActivities & Timelines\u201d at page 6 that from Fall 2016 to Winter 2017 a data collection tool will be rolled out for use by INAC and Health Canada Service Coordinators and Jordan\u2019s Principle focal points. However, in light of the narrow definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle that was being used by Canada, as discussed above, it is likely that any current tracking of cases may not capture all potential Jordan\u2019s Principle case, gaps in services and all First Nations children.\n[105] With regard to the AFN\u2019s submission that Canada has not yet developed an internal understanding of what the gaps in federal funding to First Nations children are, the Panel notes that the Jordan\u2019s Principle \u2013 Child First Initiative presentation, presented to the Innu Round Table on October 6, 2016 (Affidavit of Cassandra Lang, January 25, 2017, Exhibit 2, Annex I), under \u201cImplementation Points\u201d at page 12, states: \u201cConducting a province by province gap analysis of health and social services for on-reserve children with disabilities\u201d (see also Health Canada, Jordan\u2019s Principle \u2013 Child First Initiative, presentation dated October 12, 2016 (Affidavit of Cassandra Lang, January 25, 2017, Exhibit 2, Annex I, at p. 12).\n[106] There are no timelines indicated for when this analysis will be completed and, based on the Panel\u2019s reasoning above regarding Canada\u2019s definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle, the analysis will need to be broadened beyond \u201con-reserve children with disabilities.\u201d The information that is collected must reflect the actual number of children in need of services and the actual gaps in those services in order to be reliable in informing future actions.\n[107] Therefore, the Panel orders Canada to track and collect data on Jordan\u2019s Principle cases pursuant to the definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle ordered in this ruling. In order to ensure Jordan\u2019s Principle is being implemented correctly by Canada, the Panel agrees with the Caring Society that Canada should be formally tracking the number of Jordan\u2019s Principle cases that are approved, denied or in progress. Additionally, performance measures should be tracked in terms of stated timelines for resolving Jordan\u2019s Principle cases and in providing approved services. Consequently, pursuant to section 53(2)(a) of the Act, the Panel makes the remaining orders detailed in the \u201cOrder\u201d section below, under \u201cProcessing and tracking of Jordan\u2019s Principle cases.\u201d\n(iii) Publicizing the compliant definition and approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle\n[108] Given Canada has disseminated a narrow definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle, the Caring Society requests that Canada be required to proactively, and in writing, correct the record with any person, organization or government who received, or could be in receipt of flawed material on Jordan\u2019s Principle. Relatedly, the Caring Society asks that Canada revisit any funding agreements or other arrangements already concluded to ensure that they reflect the full and proper scope and implementation of Jordan\u2019s Principle.\n[109] The Caring Society is also concerned that Canada has failed to take any formal measures to ensure that all staff are aware, understand and have the tools and resources necessary to implement the findings in the Decision related to Jordan\u2019s Principle, along with the subsequent rulings and orders issued by the Panel in this regard.\n[110] The Commission agrees that it would be appropriate for the Tribunal to supplement its initial order by directing Canada to take specific steps, within fixed timeframes, to adequately inform government officials, FNCFS Agencies and the general public about its compliant approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle. It adds that the Caring Society and the other parties to this complaint have invaluable expertise to contribute to any discussion about how best to educate the public about Jordan\u2019s Principle. Together, they can help to ensure that any public relations material contains up-to-date, reliable and first-hand information from those who work daily in delivering child welfare and other services to First Nations children. Therefore, the Commission asks that it, the Caring Society, the AFN and the Interested Parties be consulted by Canada on the distribution of any public education materials.\n[111] Canada submits it is focusing on enhancing its communication efforts to ensure its First Nations partners are informed of the new approach, aware of new resources available to support First Nations children, and given an opportunity to get involved and share their views. It adds that, with Canada\u2019s initial work to reform its approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle complete, there is now greater room for engagement with the parties to this matter and other stakeholders regarding the impact of Canada\u2019s changes. According to Canada, reform is an evolving process, and one that it acknowledges will benefit from engagement moving forward.\n[112] In light of the evidence and findings with respect to the definition and processing of Jordan\u2019s Principle cases, the Panel finds there is a clear need for Canada to go back to its employees, the organizations it works with and its First Nation partners to inform them of the correct definition and processes surrounding Jordan\u2019s Principle. As stated previously, the multiple presentations made by Canada to date included a restricted definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle and its processes surrounding the principle have recently been changed and will continue to be changed following this ruling. Canada\u2019s previous definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle led to families not coming forward with potential cases and urgent cases not being considered as Jordan\u2019s Principle cases. Canada admittedly had difficulties identifying applicable children. A corrected definition and process surrounding Jordan\u2019s Principle warrants new publicity and education to public, employees, applicable organizations and all First Nation partners. INAC and Health Canada\u2019s websites would be a prominent and reasonable place to begin this publicity. Also, given the hearing of this complaint and the present motions was broadcasted on APTN, the Panel\u2019s believes this would also be an important and reasonable place to publicize the corrected definition and process surrounding Jordan\u2019s Principle.\n[113] In doing so, there is no doubt that the Commission should be consulted. It has been actively involved in pursuing this case for over a decade and played a central role in leading the majority of the evidence at the hearing of the merits of the complaint. Furthermore, section 53(2)(a) of the Act specifically provides that the Panel can order that \u201c\u2026the person cease the discriminatory practice and take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures\u2026\u201d (emphasis added).\n[114] However, aside from the Commission, the Act and applicable case law suggest the Tribunal does not have the power to order consultation with other parties (see Canada (Attorney General) v. Johnstone, 2013 FC 113 at paras. 164-169 [Johnstone]). Nevertheless, in the circumstances of this case, the Panel agrees that the Caring Society and other parties to this complaint have invaluable expertise to contribute to any discussion about how best to educate the public, especially First Nations peoples, about Jordan\u2019s Principle.\n[115] A number of important considerations lead to this conclusion. Primarily, the Act must be interpreted in light of its purpose, which is to give effect to the principle that:\n[A]ll individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices.\n[116] The individuals affected by the Decision and subsequent orders, and who are looking for an opportunity equal to other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have, are First Nations children. This was not the situation in Johnstone. As canvassed in the Decision, the relationship between Canada and Aboriginal peoples is trust-like, rather than adversarial, and the contemporary recognition and affirmation of Aboriginal rights must be defined in light of this historic relationship (see Decision at para. 93, citing R. v. Sparrow, [1990] 1 SCR 1075, at page 1108). It is well established that in all its dealings with Aboriginal peoples, the Crown must act honourably (see Decision at para. 89, citing Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests), 2004 SCC 73, at para. 16). This requires Canada to treat Aboriginal peoples fairly and honourably, and there is a special fiduciary relationship between the Crown and Aboriginal peoples (see Decision at paras. 91-95). The Crown also has a constitutional duty to consult Indigenous peoples on decisions that affect them and those consultations must be meaningful (see 2016 CHRT 16 at para. 10). The unique position that Aboriginal peoples occupy in Canada is recognized in section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 and section 25 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. With respect to the Act, when section 67 was repealed in 2008, Parliament confirmed in section 1.1 of An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act, S.C. 2008, c. 30, that:\nFor greater certainty, the repeal of section 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act shall not be construed so as to abrogate or derogate from the protection provided for existing aboriginal or treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada by the recognition and affirmation of those rights in section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n[117] This case is about the provision of child welfare services to First Nations children and families. This is an area that directly affects the fundamental rights of First Nations children, families and communities and is inextricably linked to the concept of the best interest of the child: a legal principle of paramount importance in both Canadian and international law (see Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v. Canada (Attorney General), 2004 SCC 4 at para. 9; and, Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 SCR 817 at para. 75 [Baker]). As stated in the Decision at paragraph 346, in reference to Professor Nicholas Bala:\n[L]eading Canadian precedents, federal and provincial statutes and international treaties are all premised on the principle that decisions about children should be based on an assessment of their best interests. This is a central concept for those who are involved in making decisions about children, not only for judges and lawyers, but for also assessors and mediators.\n[118] To ensure Aboriginal rights and the best interests of First Nations children are respected in this case, the Panel believes the governance organizations representing those rights and interests, representing those children and families affected by the Decision and who are professionals in the area of First Nations child welfare, such as the Complainants and the Interested Parties, should be consulted on how best to educate the public, especially First Nations peoples, about Jordan\u2019s Principle. This consultation will also ensure a level of cultural appropriateness to the education plan and materials.\n[119] This consultation is also reasonable based on Canada\u2019s submissions and actions in this matter. Canada has stressed consultation with First Nations peoples and organizations since the Decision (see for example Respondent\u2019s Factum, March 14, 2017, at paras. 36 and 39). It has also recognized the AFN and the Caring Society as key partners in the reform of its policies and programs. The AFN has been participating in the Executive Oversight Committee since July 2016. Dr. Cindy Blackstock, the Executive Director of the Caring Society, was also invited by the Minister of Health to participate in the Executive Oversight Committee [see Affidavit of Robin Buckland, January 25, 2017, at paras. 17-18; \u201cJordan\u2019s Principle, ADM Executive Oversight Committee, Record of Decisions\u201d, September 2, 2016 (Affidavit of Robin Buckland, January 25, 2017, Exhibit F, p. 2); Letter from The Honourable Jane Philpott, Minster of Health, to Dr. Cindy Blackstock, Executive Director, First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada (December 22, 2016) (Affidavit of Robin Buckland, January 25, 2017, Exhibit G); Health Canada, Jordan\u2019s Principle: Engaging with partners to design long-term approach, presentation dated November 2016 (Affidavit of Robin Buckland, January 25, 2017, Exhibit H, at pp. 3-7); \u201cFirst Nations and Inuit Health Branch, Regional Executive Forum, Record of Discussion and Decisions\u201d, August 9, 2016 (Answers to requests of Robin Buckland, March 7, 2017, at tab 3A); and, \u201cFNIHB SMC-P&P, Record of Decisions\u201d, September 14, 2016 (Answers to Requests of Robin Buckland, March 7, 2017, tab 5, p. 2)].\n[120] Canada is committed to working with child and family services agencies, front-line service providers, First Nations organizations, leadership and communities, the Complainants, and the provinces and territories, on steps towards program reform and meaningful change for children and families (see 2016 CHRT 10 at para. 6). The Panel supports this commitment and an order to consult with the Complainants and the Interested Parties on how best to educate the public, especially First Nations peoples, about Jordan\u2019s Principle essentially reinforces what is already partially occurring in this matter. The Panel wants to ensure this commitment to partnership continues and is improved in a meaningful way by formalizing it in an order. Therefore, pursuant to section 53(2)(a) of the Act, the Panel makes the orders detailed in the \u201cOrder\u201d section below, under \u201cPublicizing the compliant definition and approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle.\u201d\n(iv) Future reporting\n[121] The Caring Society requests that, moving forward, Canada produce its compliance reports in the form of an affidavit and that a timeline be established very early on in the process to allow for cross-examination of the affiants, followed by the filing of written arguments and oral submissions. Exchanging evidence and having the opportunity to cross-examine makes the remedial process more transparent. The AFN is supportive of the Caring Society\u2019s request for future reporting, while the COO has made a similar request with respect to the orders it is requesting.\n[122] The Commission takes no position on this request, other than to suggest that if such an order is to be granted, the Tribunal should include specifics about: (i) the metrics that are to be reported upon, (ii) the specific intervals at which reports are to be provided, and (iii) the length of time for which the reporting obligation is to continue.\n[123] The Caring Society\u2019s proposed process for future reporting is similar to the process employed to hear and determine the present motions. The Panel found this process efficient and found the use of affidavit evidence, and having that evidence tested under cross-examination, was of great assistance to the Panel in determining the issues put before it.\n[124] However, moving forward, the Panel would prefer that the cross-examination of affiants occur in a hearing before the Panel and be governed by the Tribunal process. In the present motions, the cross-examination occurred outside the Tribunal process, without the Panel present, and with a transcript of the evidence presented to the Panel afterwards for its consideration. This resulted in two issues. First, a dispute arose as to whether a party has an obligation, in the context of a cross-examination on an affidavit, to give undertakings to make inquiries and provide answers to which the affiant does not know the answers. Second, the Panel did not have the ability to ask its own questions to the witnesses.\n[125] On the first issue, the NAN made requests for undertakings regarding Canada\u2019s refusal to fund the Wapekeka proposal for a mental health service team based within the community. Canada refused to provide undertakings because, in its view, the affiant answered the NAN\u2019s questions to the best of her ability, while other questions sought information that fell outside the scope of her employment. Furthermore, Canada states there is no legal obligation to provide undertakings during a cross-examination on an affidavit. The NAN submitted arguments and case law to the contrary and requested that the witness appear before the Panel to complete her evidence.\n[126] The Panel refused this request because it was more akin to a discovery request in a civil action than to a cross-examination of a witness during a Tribunal hearing. While section 48.9(2) of the Act empowers the Chairperson to make rules governing discovery proceedings before the Tribunal, no such rules have been made thus far. Rather, parties before the Tribunal have an obligation to disclose and produce arguably relevant documents throughout the Tribunal\u2019s proceedings [see Rules 6(1)(d) and (e); and, Rule 6(5) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04)]. The purpose of disclosure is to divulge the case a party intends to make, which in turn allows each party to effectively prepare and present its respective case. The question is whether the information sought is arguably relevant and necessary for the party to prepare its case before the Tribunal.\n[127] While the information sought by the NAN is arguably relevant to the issues raised in its amended motion, and is highly important for the families and communities who lost their children, it did not prevent the NAN from making its case on its motion.\n[128] The information was also not determinative for the Panel in order to make findings on the NAN\u2019s motion. The Tribunal was able to draw inferences from the affiant\u2019s inability to answer the NAN\u2019s questions. That is, with respect to the issues raised in the NAN\u2019s motion, the NAN\u2019s questioning was sufficient to shed light on the need for more rigorous processes surrounding access to Jordan\u2019s Principle funding to ensure the Wapekeka proposal situation is not repeated.\n[129] In all fairness, while the Panel agreed to have the parties cross-examine affiants outside of the Tribunal\u2019s hearing process, no process with respect to undertakings was specifically agreed to by the parties or the Panel. Moving forward, if the Panel is present during cross-examinations, it can deal with these types of issues right away, without the need for further submissions or rulings.\n[130] On the second issue, the Panel would like the opportunity to ask questions to the witnesses, should it have any. The advantage of having a cross-examination occur before the Panel is that it allows the Panel to efficiently ask its questions, without the need to recall a witness, while also allowing the parties the opportunity to ask additional questions arising out of those asked by the Panel.\n[131] Therefore, future reporting by Canada in this matter will be supported by an affidavit or affidavits attesting to the information found in the report. Timelines will be established to allow for cross-examination of the affiants before the Panel, followed by the filing of written arguments and, if necessary, oral submissions. In any future reporting in this matter, the Panel will keep in mind the Commission\u2019s suggestion that it include specifics about: (i) the metrics that are to be reported upon, (ii) the specific intervals at which reports are to be provided, and (iii) the length of time for which the reporting obligation is to continue.\n[132] Pursuant to the above and to section 53(2)(a) of the Act, the Panel retains jurisdiction over the above orders until it is assured that they are fully implemented. Canada is ordered to serve and file a report and affidavit materials detailing its compliance with each of those orders, pursuant to the process outlined in the \u201cOrder\u201d section below, under \u201cRetention of jurisdiction and reporting.\u201d\nV. Orders\n[133] The orders made in this ruling are to be read in conjunction with the findings above, along with the findings and orders in the Decision and previous rulings (2016 CHRT 2, 2016 CHRT 10 and 2016 CHRT 16). Separating the orders from the reasoning leading to them will not assist in implementing the orders in an effective and meaningful way that ensures the essential needs of First Nations children are met and discrimination is eliminated.\n[134] Specific timelines for the implementation of each of the Panel\u2019s orders are indicated below to ensure a clear understanding of the Panel\u2019s expectations and to avoid misinterpretation issues that have occurred previously in this matter (such as with the term \u201cimmediately\u201d).\n[135] Pursuant to the above, the Panel\u2019s orders are:\n1. Definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle\nA. As of the date of this ruling, Canada shall cease relying upon and perpetuating definitions of Jordan\u2019s Principle that are not in compliance with the Panel\u2019s orders in 2016 CHRT 2, 2016 CHRT 10, 2016 CHRT 16 and in this ruling.\nB. As of the date of this ruling, Canada\u2019s definition and application of Jordan\u2019s Principle shall be based on the following key principles:\ni. Jordan\u2019s Principle is a child-first principle that applies equally to all First Nations children, whether resident on or off reserve. It is not limited to First Nations children with disabilities, or those with discrete short-term issues creating critical needs for health and social supports or affecting their activities of daily living.\nii. Jordan\u2019s Principle addresses the needs of First Nations children by ensuring there are no gaps in government services to them. It can address, for example, but is not limited to, gaps in such services as mental health, special education, dental, physical therapy, speech therapy, medical equipment and physiotherapy.\niii. When a government service is available to all other children, the government department of first contact will pay for the service to a First Nations child, without engaging in case conferring, policy review, service navigation or any other similar administrative procedure before funding is provided. Once the service is provided, the government department of first contact can seek reimbursement from another department\/government;\niv. When a government service is not necessarily available to all other children or is beyond the normative standard of care, the government department of first contact will still evaluate the individual needs of the child to determine if the requested service should be provided to ensure substantive equality in the provision of services to the child, to ensure culturally appropriate services to the child and\/or to safeguard the best interests of the child. Where such services are to be provided, the government department of first contact will pay for the provision of the services to the First Nations child, without engaging in case conferring, policy review, service navigation or any other similar administrative procedure before funding is provided. Once the service is provided, the government department of first contact can seek reimbursement from another department\/government.\nv. While Jordan\u2019s Principle can apply to jurisdictional disputes between governments (i.e., between federal, provincial or territorial governments) and to jurisdictional disputes between departments within the same government, a dispute amongst government departments or between governments is not a necessary requirement for the application of Jordan\u2019s Principle.\nC. Canada shall not use or distribute a definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle that in any way restricts or narrows the principles enunciated in order 1(b).\nD. Canada shall review previous requests for funding that were denied, whether made pursuant to Jordan\u2019s Principle or otherwise, dating from April 1st, 2009, to ensure compliance with the above principles. Canada shall complete this review by November 1st, 2017.\n2. Processing and tracking of Jordan\u2019s Principle cases\nA. Canada shall develop or modify its processes surrounding Jordan\u2019s Principle to ensure the following standards are implemented by June 28, 2017:\ni. The government department of first contact will evaluate the individual needs of a child requesting services under Jordan\u2019s Principle or that could be considered a case under Jordan\u2019s Principle.\nii. The initial evaluation and a determination of the request shall be made within 12-48 hours of its receipt.\niii. Canada shall cease imposing service delays due case conferring, policy review, service navigation or any other similar administrative procedure before funding is provided.\niv. If the request is granted, the government department that is first contacted shall pay for the service without engaging in case conferring, policy review, service navigation or any other similar administrative procedure before funding is provided; and\nv. If the request is denied, the government department of first contact shall inform the applicant, in writing, of his or her right to appeal the decision, the process for doing so, the information to be provided by the applicant, the timeline within which Canada will determine the appeal, and that a rationale will be provided in writing if the appeal is denied.\nB. By June 28, 2017 Canada shall implement reliable internal systems and processes to ensure that all possible Jordan\u2019s Principle cases are identified and addressed, including those where the reporter does not know if the case is a Jordan\u2019s Principle case.\nC. By July 27, 2017 Canada shall develop reliable internal systems to track: the number of Jordan\u2019s Principle applications it receives or that could be considered as a case under Jordan\u2019s Principle, the reason for the application and the service requested, the progression of each case, the result of the application (granted or denied) with applicable reasons, and the timelines for resolving each case, including when the service was actually provided.\nD. Canada shall provide a report and affidavit materials to this Panel on November 15, 2017 and every 6 months following the implementation of the internal systems outlined above, which details its tracking of Jordan\u2019s Principle cases. The need for any further reporting pursuant to this order shall be revisited on May 25, 2018.\n3. Publicizing the compliant definition and approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle\nA. By June 09, 2017 Canada shall post a clear link to information on Jordan`s Principle, including the compliant definition, on the home pages of both INAC and Health Canada.\nB. By June 28, 2017, Canada shall post a bilingual (French and English) televised announcement on the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, providing details of the compliant definition and process for Jordan\u2019s Principle.\nC. By June 09, 2017, Canada shall contact all stakeholders who received communications regarding Jordan\u2019s Principle since January 26, 2016 and advise them in writing of the findings and orders in this ruling.\nD. By July 27, 2017, Canada shall revisit any agreements concluded with third-party organizations to provide services under the Child First Initiative\u2019s Service Coordination Function, and make any changes necessary to reflect the proper definition and scope of Jordan\u2019s Principle ordered in this ruling.\nE. By July 27, 2017, Canada shall fund and consult with the Complainants, Commission and the Interested Parties to develop training and public education materials relating to Jordan\u2019s Principle (including on the Decision and subsequent rulings), and ensure their proper distribution to the public, Jordan\u2019s Principle focal points, members of the Executive Oversight Committee, managers involved in the application of Jordan\u2019s Principle\/Child First Initiative, First Nations communities and child welfare agencies and any other applicable stakeholders.\n4. Retention of jurisdiction and reporting\nA. The Panel retains jurisdiction over the above orders to ensure that they are effectively and meaningfully implemented and to further refine or clarify its orders if necessary. The Panel will continue to retain jurisdiction over these orders until May 25, 2018 when it will revisit the need to retain jurisdiction beyond that date.\nB. Canada is ordered to serve and file a report and affidavit materials detailing its compliance with each of the above orders by November 15, 2017.\nC. The Complainants and the Interested Parties shall provide a written response to Canada\u2019s report by November 29, 2017, and shall indicate: (1) whether they wish to cross-examine Canada\u2019s affiant(s), and (2) whether further orders are requested from the Panel.\nD. Canada may provide a reply, if any, by December 6, 2017.\nE. Any schedule for cross-examining Canada\u2019s affiant(s) and\/or any future reporting shall be considered by the Panel following the parties\u2019 submissions with respect to Orders 4(C) and 4(D).\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nPanel Chairperson\nEdward P.

Lustig\nOutline\nI. Procedure to be followed on reconsideration 1\nII. Background 1\nIII. Positions of the parties 4\nA. Mr. Turner\u2019s position 4\nB. CBSA\u2019s position 6\nIV. Analysis 8\nV. Ruling 12\nI. Procedure to be followed on reconsideration\n[1] This case has now returned to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \"Tribunal\") for a third hearing. This ruling is to determine the procedure to be followed in reconsidering this matter.\nII. Background\n[2] Mr. Turner originally filed his Complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \"Commission\") on February 8, 2005. He alleges the Canadian Border Services Agency (the \"CBSA\") discriminated against him contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the \"Act\") on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, age and the perceived disability of obesity. The allegations stem from two CBSA job competitions in 2003 and 2004.\n[3] On August 24, 2007, the Commission requested the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the Complaint, pursuant to section 44(3)(a) of the Act.\n[4] A hearing was held by the former Chair of the Tribunal, J. Grant Sinclair, for 10 days in Victoria starting on November 17, 2008. At the hearing, the Tribunal heard oral evidence from a number of witnesses, and received documentary evidence and closing oral submissions. A decision in the case was rendered by Member Sinclair on June 10, 2010 wherein he held that the Complaint was not substantiated (see Turner v. Canada Border Services Agency, 2010 CHRT 15) [\"Decision 1\"]).\n[5] Decision 1 was judicially reviewed by the Federal Court (the \"FC\"). In its decision on June 24, 2011, the FC dismissed the application for judicial review (see Turner v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 FC 767).\n[6] The FC's decision was appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal (the \"FCA\"). In its decision on May 30, 2012, the FCA allowed the appeal and set aside the FC's decision. In its decision, the FCA concluded that the Tribunal had failed in Decision 1 to consider one of Mr. Turner\u2019s alleged grounds of discrimination \u0336 perceived disability due to weight. The FCA referred the Complaint back to the Tribunal for a new determination by a different member so that it could take into account Mr. Turner\u2019s submissions on perceived disability and the way in which that ground may have intersected with the other grounds alleged (see Turner v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FCA 159).\n[7] Following the FCA's decision respecting Decision 1, at a Case Management Conference call with former Member Wallace Craig, who was then assigned to the case, the parties agreed that the new determination would not be by way of a hearing de novo but instead would involve Member Craig reviewing the record in Decision 1, including the submissions and exhibits filed by the parties and the transcripts of the hearing. In addition, Member Craig decided to allow supplemental closing arguments to be made by the parties at a hearing, which occurred in Victoria over two days in November of 2013.\n[8] A decision was rendered by Member Craig on March 7, 2014 based on the record in Decision 1. Member Craig's decision was that the Complaint was substantiated (see Turner v. Canada Border Services Agency, 2014 CHRT 10) [\"Decision 2\"]).\n[9] A separate decision on remedies was rendered by Member Craig on May 7, 2015 (see Turner v. Canada Border Services Agency, 2015 CHRT 10).\n[10] Decision 2 was judicially reviewed by the FC. In its decision on October 26, 2015, the FC allowed the application for judicial review and directed that the matter be returned to another tribunal to reconsider the matter (see Canada (Attorney General) v. Turner, 2015 FC 1209). At paragraphs 52 and 53 of its decision, the FC stated as follows:\n[52] Based on these issues, I find that the second tribunal\u2019s assessment of the evidence and its conclusion that Mr. Turner had made out a case of discrimination \u2013 by having been denied employment opportunities because of his age, race, and a perceived disability of obesity \u2013 was unreasonable.\nVII. Conclusion and Disposition\n[53] The tribunal\u2019s findings are not supported by the evidence that was before it. Therefore, its conclusion that Mr. Turner had established a case of discrimination did not fall within the range of defensible outcomes based on the facts and the law. Accordingly, I must allow this application for judicial review and order another tribunal to reconsider the matter.\n[11] The FC's decision was appealed to the FCA. In its decision on January 6, 2017, the FCA dismissed the appeal (see Turner v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 FCA 2). At paragraphs 56 and 70-72, the FCA stated as follows:\n[56] I accept the view of the respondent that the Tribunal\u2019s findings as to the credibility of witnesses are due less deference than credibility findings are usually given because the Tribunal based its decision on the transcript alone without the advantage of hearing the witnesses directly and was therefore not in a position to assess their demeanour. There is no disagreement that, in an ideal world, the Tribunal should have been able to hear the witnesses afresh. The respondent, at the hearing, suggested that the Tribunal could have called witnesses if it had any doubts. I must reject that argument since the parties agreed that the extensive record would be adequate for the purposes of reconsideration. Indeed, the transcript of the parties\u2019 Case Management Conference demonstrates that both parties and the Tribunal were aware of the difficulties raised by reconsideration on the record alone. That being said, the Tribunal was required to base its credibility findings on the evidence.\n[\u2026]\n[70] Those errors convince me that the Tribunal\u2019s decision is not supported by the record. I conclude that the Tribunal substituted its assessment of the appellant\u2019s qualifications for that of the selection board\u2019s when it held that the appellant had been discriminated against. It is apparent when reading the Tribunal\u2019s decision that it disagreed with the criteria used by the selection boards and made a fundamental error in concluding that the first part of the Shakes test had been met based, in part, on a concession that was never made by the respondent (Tribunal\u2019s decision at paragraphs 168, 189, 195, 212, and 220).\n[71] I must also point out that, in my view, there is no basis for the adverse credibility findings made by the Tribunal in regards to the respondent\u2019s witnesses, particularly Mr. Tarnawski (Tribunal\u2019s decision at paragraphs 181, 189, 228 and 233) and Mr. Baird (idem at paragraphs 135, 141, 149, 152, 252, and 253) and certainly no justification for the pejorative adjectives employed. Having reviewed the transcript, it is clear that the Tribunal\u2019s credibility findings are not supported by the record.\nV. Conclusion\n[72] For all these reasons, I conclude that the Tribunal\u2019s decision does not fall within a range of defensible outcomes based on the facts and the law. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\n[12] At a Case Management Conference Call with me on March 20, 2017, the parties could not agree on a procedure to be followed for the reconsideration of the matter as ordered by the Federal Courts in their decisions respecting Decision 2. I allowed the parties to make written submissions setting out their positions regarding the procedure to be followed on the reconsideration. The parties provided written submissions setting out their positions.\nIII. Positions of the parties\nA. Mr. Turner\u2019s position\n[13] Mr. Turner\u2019s position is that there is no basis to justify proceeding with a de novo hearing of the Complaint. Instead, the Tribunal ought to reconsider the matter by reviewing the record from Decision 1 as Member Craig did in Decision 2. In addition, however, Mr. Turner also wants the Tribunal in its reconsideration to hold a \"partial de novo hearing\" to receive new evidence that has come to light. As well, the parties should be entitled to make oral submissions before the Tribunal.\n[14] The Complainant makes the following arguments in support of his position:\nThe FCA has now directed the Tribunal to reconsider the matter and to determine the procedure to be followed. The Tribunal is \"master of its own procedure\". By not issuing an order for a hearing de novo as requested by the CBSA, it can be implied that the FCA did not expect the Tribunal to hold an entire hearing de novo and that to do so would be inconsistent with the FCA's decision.\nIt is not open to the Tribunal to proceed by way of an entire hearing de novo since Member Craig previously decided that a de novo hearing was unnecessary, with the concurrence of the CBSA, and nothing has occurred since Decision 2 to change that approach. The concurrence by the CBSA to this approach is specifically noted in the FCA's decision as supporting the adequacy of the existing record for the purpose of reconsideration. Moreover, such an exercise would unnecessarily delay matters and add various costs as it is estimated to take about 3 weeks for a hearing de novo, whereas oral submissions would only take 2 days (the Complainant has not specifically provided an estimated time period for the \"partial de novo hearing\" he is seeking).\nIt makes no sense to ignore the transcripts of the hearing in Decision 1 that was held in 2008 and 2009 and now hear oral evidence that would be less reliable and, therefore, potentially prejudicial given the lengthy passage of time.\nDifficulties would arise if oral evidence given by witnesses at a hearing de novo was inconsistent with their evidence from the original hearing. Further difficulties would arise as a result of the absence of a key CBSA witness who gave evidence at the original hearing, but now is not expected to be able to testify at a new hearing for personal reasons.\nThere is no legal requirement for a de novo hearing. None of the \"traditional reasons\" that might require a hearing de novo are present here (i.e. bias or violation of procedural fairness or unresolved issues of fact).\nThere are arguably relevant documents pertaining to the selection processes in this case which were not produced prior to the original hearing that Mr. Turner intends to request production of. It is a requirement of natural justice to allow either party to rely upon such evidence given that the matter has been sent back for reconsideration and the Tribunal is bound to consider it. Further, there may be other gaps in the evidence known to the parties which Mr. Turner maintains would be appropriate for further testimony, subject to the parties' right to object and the Tribunal's ruling.\nB. CBSA\u2019s position\n[15] The position of the CBSA is that the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness require that this case, in its entirety, be reheard de novo.\n[16] The CBSA makes the following arguments in support of its position:\nThe reasons for the decision of the FCA with respect to Decision 1 and the reasons for the decision of the FCA with respect to Decision 2 are profoundly different and the CBSA\u2019s position regarding the procedure to now be followed by the Tribunal for reconsideration is related to this difference.\nWith respect to Decision 1, the FCA returned the matter to the Tribunal for a new determination on the basis that Member Sinclair's reasons were silent as to one of the prescribed grounds (perceived disability, obesity) and its intersection with other grounds, but Member Sinclair had presided over a 10 day oral hearing and had the opportunity to fully assess the demeanor of the witnesses. For this reason, the CBSA agreed with the determination of Decision 2 to be carried out on the basis of a review of the record alone.\nWith respect to Decision 2, the FCA upheld the FC's decision to return the matter to the Tribunal to reconsider the matter on the basis that Member Craig's reasons were unreasonable in that he made fundamental errors in his findings of fact and made adverse credibility findings that had no support on the record. The FCA noted that Member Craig based his decision on the evidence in the transcripts without hearing the witnesses testimony directly and was therefore not in a position to assess their demeanor. The FCA opined that \"There is no disagreement that, in an ideal world, the Tribunal should have been able to hear the witnesses afresh\" (2017 FCA 2 at para. 56).\nUnlike the situation before Member Craig in Decision 2, in the case at hand, the parties have not agreed on a procedure for reconsideration by the Tribunal going forward. The lack of consent by the CBSA to the Tribunal basing its current reconsideration on a review of the record, rather than a hearing de novo, is based on the differences between Decision 1 and Decision 2. In the Federal Court's decision regarding Decision 2, Member Craig's decision was held to be unreasonable based on errors of fact and credibility, grounded in evidence in the transcripts, without hearing witnesses testify directly.\nAbsent unanimous consent of the parties to a hearing on the basis of all or part of the existing record, the audi alteram partem rule -- \"he or she who hears must decide\" -- requires that a de novo hearing be held in the matter. The CBSA has not waived this right. Its right to procedural fairness and natural justice would be prejudiced without a full de novo hearing where the Tribunal is able to directly hear the witnesses testify and has the opportunity to assess their demeanor and credibility.\nThe CBSA strongly disagrees with the assertions made by Mr. Turner in his submissions that \"for whatever reason\" the CBSA did not meet its disclosure obligations \"before the prior hearing\" and that there is new evidence to be disclosed by the CBSA in a \"partial de novo hearing\".\nThe CBSA recognizes the need to reduce costs and delays by agreeing with Mr. Turner in good faith on facts not in dispute and testimony and documentary evidence that is not contentious and does not need to be introduced in the same manner as it was before Member Sinclair. The CBSA confirms that one of its witnesses will not be able to testify at the new hearing because of personal reasons and that a determination will need to be made as to how to receive his evidence, if at all.\nIV. Analysis\n[17] I do not consider CBSA\u2019s consent to using the previous record for the purposes of determining Decision 2 now binds it in some way to again use the previous record as the present means of reconsideration. Nor do I consider that the FCA has inferred that the record before Member Craig is adequate for a reconsideration in this case based on its comment about the CBSA\u2019s previous concurrence. In my opinion, the FCA at paragraph 56 of 2017 FCA 2 quoted above was simply rejecting an argument made before it by the CBSA that Member Craig could have heard oral evidence if he had wanted. It simply pointed out that the parties had agreed that, for the purpose of the hearing by Member Craig, the record was adequate. Nothing in the decision suggests to me that the FCA also reached the conclusion that the procedure followed by Member Craig was the best way for him to proceed. If anything, this paragraph can also be read to mean the opposite.\n[18] Further, I do not agree with Mr. Turner\u2019s suggestion that, by not specifying that a hearing de novo now be held by the Tribunal as the means for reconsidering the matter, the FCA impliedly concluded that a hearing de novo is not now the appropriate means to proceed with the reconsideration or that Mr. Turner\u2019s proposed procedure is more appropriate. It can equally be argued that, by not specifying that a review of the record be the means by which the Tribunal now conduct the reconsideration, the FCA impliedly did not agree with such a procedure being followed, especially given its comments in paragraph 56 of 2017 FCA 2 about known \"difficulties\" in proceeding that way and the advantages of being able to \"hear witnesses afresh.\"\n[19] What we know, without the need to imply anything, is that the FCA did not specify a means of procedure for the current reconsideration and consequently has left it to the Tribunal to decide. In deciding on a means of procedure, the Tribunal, first and foremost, has a duty to act fairly.\n[20] The duty of fairness provides that parties affected by a decision should have \"...the opportunity to present their case fully and fairly, and have decisions affecting their rights, interests, or privileges made using a fair, impartial and open process, appropriate to the statutory, institutional, and social context of the decision\" (see Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 SCR 817 at para. 28 [\u201cBaker\u201d]).\n[21] Indeed, section 50(1) of the Act provides:\nAfter due notice to the Commission, the complainant, the person against whom the complaint was made and, at the discretion of the member or panel conducting the inquiry, any other interested party, the member or panel shall inquire into the complaint and shall give all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations.\nFurther, section 48.9(1) of the Act provides that \"[p]roceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\"\n[22] An aspect of the duty of procedural fairness is the principle that she or he who decides the case must actually hear the case. That is, as a general rule, procedural fairness requires decision-makers to hear all the evidence as well as all the arguments presented by the parties (see Iwa v. Consolidated-Bathurst Packaging Ltd., [1990] 1 SCR 282 at p. 329 [\u201cConsolidated-Bathurst]\u201d). As the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada put it in Consolidated-Bathurst at page 335:\nIn every decision, panel members must determine what the facts are, what legal standards apply to those facts and, finally, they must assess the evidence in accordance with these legal standards [\u2026] The determination and assessment of facts are delicate tasks which turn on the credibility of the witnesses and an overall evaluation of the relevancy of all the information presented as evidence. As a general rule, these tasks cannot be properly performed by persons who have not heard all the evidence and the rules of natural justice do not allow such persons to vote on the result.\n[23] While a decision-maker must hear all the evidence and arguments of the parties, the manner in which that hearing takes place is another question. That is, the existence of a duty of fairness does not determine what procedural requirements will be applicable in a given set of circumstances. The context of each case must be considered in order to determine the content of the duty of procedural fairness (see Baker at para. 21).\n[24] In this regard, the Tribunal does not have to hold a full oral evidentiary hearing in order to decide substantive issues coming before it (see Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FC 445 at paras. 115-158 [\u201cFirst Nations Child and Family Caring Society\u201d]; and, Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada Post Corp., 2004 FC 81 at paras. 5-20). As the FC put it in First Nations Child and Family Caring Society at paragraphs 128 and 148-149:\n[128] It is, therefore, properly part of the Tribunal\u2019s adjudicative role to identify an appropriate procedure to secure the just, fair and expeditious determination of each complaint coming before it. The nature of that procedure may vary from case to case, depending on the type of issues involved.\n[\u2026]\n[148] In every case, the Tribunal will have to consider the facts and issues raised by the complaint before it, and will have to identify the appropriate procedure to be followed so as to secure as informal and expeditious a hearing process as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\n[149] However, the process adopted by the Tribunal will have to be fair, and will always have to afford each of the parties \u201ca full and ample opportunity to appear[,] \u2026 present evidence and make representations\u201d in relation to the matter in dispute.\n[25] This reasoning is in line with the characterization of the duty of procedural fairness in Baker and also with the reasoning of a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in Prassad v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1989] 1 SCR 560, wherein at pages 568-569 it stated that:\nAs a general rule, these tribunals are considered to be masters of their own house. In the absence of specific rules laid down by statute or regulation, they control their own procedures subject to the proviso that they comply with the rules of fairness and, where they exercise judicial or quasi-judicial function, the rules of natural justice.\n[26] That said, the issue of credibility and conflicting evidence supports the need to hear witnesses in person. On this issue, the Supreme Court of Canada stated in Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1985] 1 SCR 177, at paragraph 59:\nI should note, however, that even if hearings based on written submissions are consistent with the principles of fundamental justice for some purposes, they will not be satisfactory for all purposes. In particular, I am of the view that where a serious issue of credibility is involved, fundamental justice requires that credibility be determined on the basis of an oral hearing. Appellate courts are well aware of the inherent weakness of written transcripts where questions of credibility are at stake and thus are extremely loath to review the findings of tribunals which have had the benefit of hearing the testimony of witnesses in person: see Stein v. The Ship \"Kathy K\", 1975 CanLII 146 (SCC), [1976] 2 S.C.R. 802, at pp. 806\u201108 (per Ritchie J.) I find it difficult to conceive of a situation in which compliance with fundamental justice could be achieved by a tribunal making significant findings of credibility solely on the basis of written submissions.\n[27] In the context of human rights proceedings, the FC also espoused a similar view, stating in First Nations Child and Family Caring Society at paragraph 141:\n[141] Most human rights cases are highly dependent on their individual facts and those facts are often hotly contested. As a result, many cases involve serious issues of credibility. While it is open to the Tribunal to receive evidence by way of affidavit, the more contested the facts and the greater the issues of credibility, the less appropriate this will be. Such cases may well require a full hearing on their merits, including viva voce evidence in chief and cross-examinations held in the presence of a Tribunal member.\n[28] In this case, I must weigh both fairness and expediency in ruling upon this motion. There are valid arguments for both procedures proposed by the parties. On balance, however, I believe it is more fair and expeditious to proceed by way of a complete hearing de novo, because:\nBoth parties do not consent to using the record from the previous oral hearing before Member Sinclair, as they did before Member Craig. I know of no case where the Tribunal has refused to hold a hearing de novo on reconsideration when a party has asked for one.\nThere are issues of credibility and conflicting evidence in this matter. There is a greater chance for me to avoid the difficulties that Member Craig had by actually seeing and hearing witnesses in person and being able to ask them questions myself. Any issues with the reliability or inconsistency of evidence given by witnesses at the de novo hearing with the evidence from the original hearing are best addressed if and when those issues arise. At that point, the Tribunal and the parties will be in a better position to assess the actual situation.\nThe time it would take me to properly read the transcripts and thoroughly review the record from the previous hearing must be considered. It is unlikely that there would be a meaningful time savings in reviewing the previous record given Mr. Turner\u2019s request for a \"partial de novo hearing\" that might itself add time and confusion to the proceedings.\nMoreover, I expect the parties to act in good faith to reduce the time and expense of the hearing by agreeing on facts and documents that are not contentious and taking such other steps as are necessary and available to streamline matters.\nV. Ruling\n[29] For these reasons, the procedure for the reconsideration of this matter will be by way of a hearing de novo.\n[30] Issues with respect to new evidence, disclosure and the use of the transcript from the previous hearing in the upcoming hearing de novo, shall be discussed at a future Case Management Conference Call.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Thomas\nTable of Contents\nI. Introduction 1\nII. The Law 2\nIII. Positions of the Parties 2\nIV. Decision 4\nI. Introduction\n[1] This is a ruling on a motion dated April 3, 2017, by Olena Stetskevych, who seeks interested party status in the inquiry into the complaint of Amir Attaran against Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (formerly Citizenship and Immigration Canada) (\u201cIRCC\u201d). The motion is brought under Rule 3 of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure for an Order under Rule 8(1) to grant her interested party status so she may make written and oral submissions at the hearing.\n[2] Mr. Attaran\u2019s complaint against IRCC was filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCHRC\u201d or the \u201cCommission\u201d) on July 28, 2010. The complaint alleged that the significant delay in processing sponsorship applications for parents and grandparents, compared to other categories under the Family Class (as defined in the Regulations to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27), was discriminatory, contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (the \u201cAct\u201d).\n[3] On February 22, 2012, the Commission decided that an inquiry into the complaint was not warranted. Mr. Attaran made an application to the Federal Court for a judicial review of the Commission\u2019s refusal to refer the complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d). The Federal Court dismissed his application and Mr. Attaran then appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal (\u201cFCA\u201d).\n[4] On February 3, 2015, the FCA allowed the appeal and referred the complaint back to the CHRC, finding that it had not adequately addressed the issue of IRCC\u2019s bona fide justification (Attaran v. Canada (A.G.), 2015 FCA 37).\n[5] Pursuant to section 44(3)(a) of the Act, on September 6, 2016, the Commission requested the Tribunal Chairperson to institute an inquiry into Mr. Attaran\u2019s complaint.\n[6] The parties to this matter have submitted their Statements of Particulars (SOPs) but dates for the hearing have not yet been set.\n[7] Like Mr. Attaran, Ms. Stetskevych also sponsored her parents for immigration to Canada. She alleges she has suffered set-backs in the process and believes she has also received discriminatory treatment from IRCC. Ms. Stetskevych disputes certain aspects of the Respondent\u2019s SOP and alleges that she has suffered even more than Mr. Attaran.\nII. The Law\n[8] Section 50 of the Act gives the Tribunal discretion to grant interested party status. The onus is on the applicant to demonstrate how its expertise will be of assistance in the determination of the issues before the Tribunal. Interested party status will not be granted if it does not add significantly to the legal positions of the parties representing a similar viewpoint: Schnell v. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc., [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 14 at para. 6 (C.H.R.T.) (QL); Nkwazi v. Canada (Correctional Service), 2000 CanLII 28883 (C.H.R.T.), para. 23 (QL); Warman v. Lemire, 2006 C.H.R.T. 8 at para. 18.\n[9] Rule 8 of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure states:\n8(1) Anyone who is not a party, and who wishes to be recognized by the Panel as an interested party in respect of an inquiry, may bring a motion for an order granting interested party status.\n8(2) A motion under 8(1) shall comply with the requirements of Rule 3 and shall specify the extent of the desired participation in the inquiry.\n[10] Ms. Stetskevych has specified, in accordance with Rule 8(2), that she would like to be afforded the opportunity to make written and oral submissions to the Tribunal.\nIII. Positions of the Parties\n[11] In her motion at paragraph 11, Ms. Stetskevych states that her \u201c\u2026experience and her participation in the case will add to the legal position of the Complaint and will help more clearly demonstrate the Respondent\u2019s adverse and differential treatment of parents to be sponsored to Canada, compared to other family members.\u201d\n[12] Mr. Attaran did not make formal submissions on this motion. He did, however, send an email to the Tribunal\u2019s Registry Office advising that he \u201cconsented\u201d to Ms. Stetskevych\u2019s \u201cintervention, with full rights of participation.\u201d\n[13] The Commission raises a concern that Ms. Stetskevych has not met the Tribunal\u2019s test for being added as an interested party. However, the Commission suggests that Ms. Stetskevych could be called as a witness by Mr. Attaran to give evidence about her experience.\n[14] The Respondent submits that it would not be appropriate to add Ms. Stetskevych as an interested party because she fails to meet the test outlined in Walden v. Canada (Treasury Board) 2011 CHRT 19 (\u201cWalden\u201d). At paragraph 23 of Walden, the Tribunal summarized its test as follows:\n[23] Concisely put, the case law indicates that interested party status has been granted in the past by the Tribunal in situations where:\n(a) the prospective interested party\u2019s expertise will be of assistance to the Tribunal;\n(b) its involvement will add to the legal positions of the parties; and\n(c) the proceeding will have an impact on the moving party\u2019s interests.\n[15] The Respondent argues that Ms. Stetskevych meets none of the above requirements. Ms. Stetskevych sponsored her parents for immigration much later than Mr. Attaran, under a new system that involves an element of chance or lottery for the opportunity to sponsor parents or grandparents. This makes her situation significantly different than Mr. Attaran\u2019s. Secondly, Ms. Stetskevych will not add to the legal position of Mr. Attaran because her complaint, as she states in paragraph 8 of her motion, \u201c\u2026is exactly the same legal issue.\u201d Lastly, the outcome of Mr. Attaran\u2019s case will have no impact on Ms. Stetskevych\u2019s situation as her sponsorship application is subject to a very different set of rules than Mr. Attaran\u2019s: in particular, the new lottery system for selecting applications that is intended to manage the intake flow.\nIV. Decision\n[16] From time to time the Tribunal receives applications for interested party status, usually for higher profile cases with a significant public interest. However, many times applicants fail to address whether they will advance different and valuable insights and perspectives that will actually further the Tribunal\u2019s determination of the matter. A successful applicant for interested party status must satisfy the Tribunal that they do possess some expertise or perspective that is not already available or before the Tribunal. Interested party status should not be conferred to give a third party a platform on which to make policy statements unrelated to the inquiry before the Tribunal. Participation should be limited to parties who can demonstrably add to the deliberations of the Tribunal (See e.g., FNCFCS v. Canada 2016 CHRT 11, paras. 3-4, 10-11).\n[17] Although I am convinced that Ms. Stetskevych\u2019s sponsorship application is subject to a very different set of rules than those which were applied to Mr. Attaran\u2019s application, the essence of her argument is the same as Mr. Attaran\u2019s: sponsorships of parents and grandparents are handled very differently than sponsorships of other members of the Family Class. Therefore, it is within the realm of possibility that a finding of discrimination in Mr. Attaran\u2019s case might impact her sponsorship application and others like it.\n[18] However, Ms. Stetskevych has not satisfied the Tribunal that her written and oral submissions dealing with her experience will assist the Tribunal in deciding the complaint before it. She has not made a case that she possesses any particular expertise, other than also being a frustrated immigration sponsor. While there may be some aspects of her experience that are similar to the Complainant\u2019s, her involvement as an interested party will not necessarily add a different perspective to the legal positions already put forward by Mr. Attaran.\n[19] Perhaps Ms. Stetskevych has grounds for her own separate human rights complaint. However, such complaint would have to be filed with the Commission, and based on the facts applicable to her situation.\n[20] For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal dismisses Ms. Stetskevych\u2019s motion for interested party status. As suggested by both the Commission and the Respondent, Mr. Attaran may wish to consider calling Ms. Stetskevych as a witness at the hearing if she has relevant evidence to offer, subject to the Tribunal\u2019s determination of the admissibility of her evidence.\nSigned by\nDavid L.

Analysis 10\nVI. Conclusion 14\nI. Introduction\n[1] This is a complaint made pursuant to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.C.S., 1985, c. H-6 (\u201cthe Act\u201d), that the Respondent employer discriminated against the Complainant based on his age and disability, by terminating his employment in response to his request to work reduced hours. The complaint alleges the Respondent employer engaged in adverse differential treatment, termination of employment, and established or pursued a discriminatory policy or practice, contrary to the Act. The complaint was referred to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (\u201cthe Tribunal\u201d) by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) on May 28, 2015. The Commission did not participate at the hearing of this matter.\n[2] This matter was heard in Toronto on the following dates: October 31st to and including November 4th, 2016, November 14th to and including November 18th, 2016, and on January 23 and 25th, 2017 with submissions on January 27th.\n[3] On January 31, 2017, the Respondent submitted a motion for recusal by email. The Complainant responded by email with further response by the Respondent.\nII. Respondent\u2019s Motion for Recusal\n[4] The Respondent\u2019s motion that I recuse myself came the Monday following the conclusion of the hearing and submissions. I therefore refrained from further considering the evidence and submissions and my decision thereon pending my review of this motion.\n[5] The Respondent bases its motion for recusal on two events that occurred at the end of the day and were not recorded:\nThe Complainant\u2019s counsel gave a USB storage drive to me on January 23, 2017; and,\nThe Complainant and his lawyer shook hands with me and said thank-you at the end of the hearing day on January 27, 2017.\n[6] Respondent\u2019s counsel asserts that as a result of these two events, he has a reasonable apprehension that I am biased toward the Complainant and possibly against the Respondent, and that I may not be impartial in my deliberations and decision-making.\n[7] The Complaint\u2019s counsel responded to the motion for recusal with a sworn affidavit of the Complainant affirming what he observed. The Complainant and his counsel assert the presentation of the USB storage drive occurred in the presence of Respondent\u2019s counsel, and that it was given to everyone in the room with an innocent intent. The Complainant and his counsel assert the handshake, thank-you and goodbye were directed to the Registry Officer and me, as a courtesy, and in full view of the Respondent\u2019s representative and Respondent\u2019s counsel.\n[8] In response to the Complainant\u2019s submission, the Respondent\u2019s counsel agrees that the Registry Officer and I did not initiate the distribution of the USB storage drive or the farewell handshake and pleasantries, and acknowledges that I may have been taken off guard in both instances. However, the Respondent asserts that I should have declined to accept the USB storage drive, as well as the handshake offered by the Complainant and his counsel, and the fact that I did not is what gives rise to the Respondent\u2019s apprehension of bias.\n[9] The Respondent\u2019s counsel asserts he remains concerned that I have been influenced by these events to consider the Complainant\u2019s case more favourably than the Respondent\u2019s, which effect the Respondent\u2019s counsel is unable to counteract. The Respondent\u2019s counsel is not asserting that he saw any indication I am biased, but the fact that I did not reject the Complainant\u2019s overtures has raised in Respondent\u2019s counsel an apprehension that I am biased in favour of the Complainant, and possibly against the Respondent.\nIII. Tribunal Member\u2019s recollection of events\nA. USB storage device\n[10] I recall that at the end of the hearing day on January 23rd, the Registry Officer and I were still at our desks. The Complainant, his counsel and Respondent\u2019s counsel, were still near their seats and were packing up to leave. The Respondent\u2019s representative had already left the room. Complainant\u2019s counsel stated in a light-hearted joking manner that he had ordered and just received USB storage devices as promotional items for his firm. Complainant\u2019s counsel then proceeded to distribute a sealed device to all of the aforementioned persons in the room.\n[11] While in the presence of the aforementioned persons, I opened the plastic and pulled on the device to see where the USB connector was. The connector was on the top of the bottom portion of the figurine. I commented, in mock offence, that the design \u201cwas almost pornographic\u201d (I do not recall anyone using the term \u201cphallic\u201d as asserted by Respondent\u2019s counsel in his motion), and everyone laughed. Complainant\u2019s counsel explained he could not figure out a way to design it any differently. We all left the room. I walked into the adjacent conference room and left the device on the conference room table. The Registry Officer did not open hers, and left it sealed on her desk.\n[12] When we resumed the hearing on Wednesday, January 25th, Respondent\u2019s counsel objected on the record to the USB storage device being distributed on the 23rd. He raised the concern that there might have been data on the device. Complainant\u2019s counsel confirmed there was no data on the devices. Respondent\u2019s counsel explained he was very uncomfortable with my having received this device. I acknowledged his concern and directed that the device given to me be returned. The Registry Officer retrieved the USB storage drive from the conference room table, and gave it and the one she was given to Complainant\u2019s counsel. This is all on the record.\n[13] My perception of this incident is that the USB storage device was a joke or gag, distributed for amusement, and not in an attempt to curry favour with me. I had expressed my mock offence at the design, and called it almost pornographic, in the same spirit. I was not really offended. This event had nothing to do with the issues under consideration by the Tribunal, and did not influence my consideration of the evidence and submissions.\nB. Handshakes and thank-you on January 27th\n[14] I recall that at the end of the submissions on January 27th, the recording stopped and the Complainant and his counsel were quick to approach the Registry Officer and me, to shake hands and say goodbye. I do not recall either of them saying thank-you, but they may have done so.\n[15] I recall that immediately after exchanging goodbyes with the Complainant and his counsel, I turned to look at the Respondent\u2019s counsel and the Respondent\u2019s representative, with the intention of doing the same with them. Neither indicated any desire to shake hands, and so I waved to them both and wished them well, probably by saying \u201ctake care\u201d and\/or \u201call the best\u201d, which are my habitual words when saying goodbye. I did not walk over to them to offer a handshake, because they did not seem to want or expect to shake hands. Furthermore, I was mindful that it was late in the day on a Friday, and the Registry Officer and I had to pack up the files and call the courier before we left the hearing space. Immediately after wishing the Respondent and his counsel well, I returned to my desk to pack up the file.\n[16] I recall that when we completed our last day of hearing on November 18th, 2016, I shook everyone\u2019s hand, including that of the Respondent\u2019s representative and his counsel, and wished them holiday greetings and safe travels for their planned trips. I believe the farewell pleasantries were initiated by the Complainant and his counsel on that occasion as well, and I ensured the Respondent\u2019s representative and Respondent\u2019s counsel were included in the handshakes and goodbyes. The Respondent\u2019s representative and counsel would, therefore, have every reason to think I would shake their hands on January 27th, if they had wanted to do so. In my view, my goodbye and best wishes to the Respondent\u2019s counsel and Respondent\u2019s representative on January 27, 2017, was equivalent to pleasantries I had just exchanged with the Complainant and his counsel.\n[17] My perception of the Complainant and his counsel initiating handshakes and goodbyes is that this was not intended to influence me. I observed the Complainant, in particular, to be very polite, smiling and exchanging pleasantries with the lawyers and witnesses on both sides. In order to preserve an atmosphere of even-handedness in the hearing room, I made sure to include the Respondent\u2019s representative, its witnesses and counsel in the same politeness and exchange of pleasantries. I am well aware that people have different comfort levels with expressing pleasantries, and as a consequence, I am not influenced negatively or positively by a person\u2019s superficial behaviour regarding social niceties.\nIV. Test for Reasonable Apprehension of Bias\n[18] In R. v. S. (R.D.), 1997 CanLII 324 (SCC), \u201c(herein S.(R.D))\u201d the Supreme Court of Canada, at paragraphs 31 to 36, 38 to 40, and 48 to 49, confirmed the test for bias enunciated by de Grandpr\u00e9 J. in Committee for Justice and Liberty v. National Energy Board, 1976 CanLII 2 (SCC):\nII. The Test for Reasonable Apprehension of Bias\n31 The test for reasonable apprehension of bias is that set out by de Grandpr\u00e9 J. in Committee for Justice and Liberty v. National Energy Board, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369. Though he wrote dissenting reasons, de Grandpr\u00e9 J.\u2019s articulation of the test for bias was adopted by the majority of the Court, and has been consistently endorsed by this Court in the intervening two decades: see, for example, Valente v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 673; R. v. Lipp\u00e9, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 114; Ruffo v. Conseil de la magistrature, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 267. De Grandpr\u00e9 J. stated, at pp. 394-95:\n\u2026the apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable and right-minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information\u2026.[T]hat test is \u201cwhat would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically -- and having thought the matter through -- conclude. Would he think that it is more likely than not that [the decision-maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly.\u201d\nThe grounds for this apprehension must, however, be substantial and I \u2026refus[e] to accept the suggestion that the test be related to the \u201cvery sensitive or scrupulous conscience\u201d.\n32 As Cory J. notes at para. 92, the scope and stringency of the duty of fairness articulated by de Grandpr\u00e9 depends largely on the role and function of the tribunal in question. Although judicial proceedings will generally be bound by the requirements of natural justice to a greater degree than will hearings before administrative tribunals, judicial decision-makers, by virtue of their positions, have nonetheless been granted considerable deference by appellate courts inquiring into the apprehension of bias. This is because judges \u201care assumed to be [people] of conscience and intellectual discipline, capable of judging a particular controversy fairly on the basis of its own circumstances\u201d: United States v. Morgan, 313 U.S. 409 (1941), at p. 421. The presumption of impartiality carries considerable weight, for as Blackstone opined at p. 361 in Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book III, cited at footnote 49 in Richard F. Devlin, \u201cWe Can\u2019t Go On Together with Suspicious Minds: Judicial Bias and Racialized Perspective in R. v. R.D.S.\u201d (1995), 18 Dalhousie L.J. 408, at p. 417, \u201cthe law will not suppose a possibility of bias or favour in a judge, who is already sworn to administer impartial justice, and whose authority greatly depends upon that presumption and idea\u201d. Thus, reviewing courts have been hesitant to make a finding of bias or to perceive a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of a judge, in the absence of convincing evidence to that effect: R. v. Smith & Whiteway Fisheries Ltd.(1994), 133 N.S.R. (2d) 50 (C.A.), at pp. 60-61.\n33 Notwithstanding the strong presumption of impartiality that applies to judges, they will nevertheless be held to certain stringent standards regarding bias -- \u201ca reasonable apprehension that the judge might not act in an entirely impartial manner is ground for disqualification\u201d: Blanchette v. C.I.S. Ltd., [1973] S.C.R. 833, at pp. 842-43.\n34 In order to apply this test, it is necessary to distinguish between the impartiality which is required of all judges, and the concept of judicial neutrality. The distinction we would draw is that reflected in the insightful words of Benjamin N. Cardozo in The Nature of the Judicial Process (1921), at pp. 12-13 and 167, where he affirmed the importance of impartiality, while at the same time recognizing the fallacy of judicial neutrality:\nThere is in each of us a stream of tendency, whether you choose to call it philosophy or not, which gives coherence and direction to thought and action. Judges cannot escape that current any more than other mortals. All their lives, forces which they do not recognize and cannot name, have been tugging at them -- inherited instincts, traditional beliefs, acquired convictions; and the resultant is an outlook on life, a conception of social needs.... In this mental background every problem finds its setting. We may try to see things as objectively as we please. None the less, we can never see them with any eyes except our own.\n\u2026\nDeep below consciousness are other forces, the likes and the dislikes, the predilections and the prejudices, the complex of instincts and emotions and habits and convictions, which make the [person], whether he [or she] be litigant or judge.\n35 Cardozo recognized that objectivity was an impossibility because judges, like all other humans, operate from their own perspectives. As the Canadian Judicial Council noted in Commentaries on Judicial Conduct (1991), at p. 12, \u201c[t]here is no human being who is not the product of every social experience, every process of education, and every human contact\u201d. What is possible and desirable, they note, is impartiality:\n. . . the wisdom required of a judge is to recognize, consciously allow for, and perhaps to question, all the baggage of past attitudes and sympathies that fellow citizens are free to carry, untested, to the grave.\nTrue impartiality does not require that the judge have no sympathies or opinions; it requires that the judge nevertheless be free to entertain and act upon different points of view with an open mind.\nIII. The Reasonable Person\n36 The presence or absence of an apprehension of bias is evaluated through the eyes of the reasonable, informed, practical and realistic person who considers the matter in some detail (Committee for Justice and Liberty, supra.) The person postulated is not a \u201cvery sensitive or scrupulous\u201d person, but rather a right-minded person familiar with the circumstances of the case.\n[\u2026]\nA. The Nature of Judging\n38 As discussed above, judges in a bilingual, multiracial and multicultural society will undoubtedly approach the task of judging from their varied perspectives. They will certainly have been shaped by, and have gained insight from, their different experiences, and cannot be expected to divorce themselves from these experiences on the occasion of their appointment to the bench. In fact, such a transformation would deny society the benefit of the valuable knowledge gained by the judiciary while they were members of the Bar. As well, it would preclude the achievement of a diversity of backgrounds in the judiciary. The reasonable person does not expect that judges will function as neutral ciphers; however, the reasonable person does demand that judges achieve impartiality in their judging.\n39 It is apparent, and a reasonable person would expect, that triers of fact will be properly influenced in their deliberations by their individual perspectives on the world in which the events in dispute in the courtroom took place. Indeed, judges must rely on their background knowledge in fulfilling their adjudicative function. As David M. Paciocco and Lee Stuesser write in their book The Law of Evidence (1996), at p. 277:\nIn general, the trier of fact is entitled simply to apply common sense and human experience in determining whether evidence is credible and in deciding what use, if any, to make of it in coming to its finding of fact.[Emphasis in original.]\n40 At the same time, where the matter is one of identifying and applying the law to the findings of fact, it must be the law that governs and not a judge\u2019s individual beliefs that may conflict with the law. Further, notwithstanding that their own insights into human nature will properly play a role in making findings of credibility or factual determinations, judges must make those determinations only after being equally open to, and considering the views of, all parties before them. The reasonable person, through whose eyes the apprehension of bias is assessed, expects judges to undertake an open-minded, carefully considered, and dispassionately deliberate investigation of the complicated reality of each case before them.\n[\u2026]\n48 We conclude that the reasonable person contemplated by de Grandpr\u00e9 J., and endorsed by Canadian courts is a person who approaches the question of whether there exists a reasonable apprehension of bias with a complex and contextualized understanding of the issues in the case. The reasonable person understands the impossibility of judicial neutrality, but demands judicial impartiality\u2026\n49 Before concluding that there exists a reasonable apprehension of bias in the conduct of a judge, the reasonable person would require some clear evidence that the judge in question had improperly used his or her perspective in the decision-making process; this flows from the presumption of impartiality of the judiciary. There must be some indication that the judge was not approaching the case with an open mind fair to all parties. Awareness of the context within which a case occurred would not constitute such evidence; on the contrary, such awareness is consistent with the highest tradition of judicial impartiality.\n[19] In Wewaykum Indian Band v. Canada, 2003 SCC 45, (herein \u201cWewaykum\u201d) the Supreme Court of Canada expanded the court\u2019s guidance regarding the principle of impartiality at paragraphs 57 to 59, and 67:\nIV. Analysis\nA. The Importance of the Principle of Impartiality\n57 The motions brought by the parties require that we examine the circumstances of this case in light of the well-settled, foundational principle of impartiality of courts of justice. There is no need to reaffirm here the importance of this principle, which has been a matter of renewed attention across the common law world over the past decade. Simply put, public confidence in our legal system is rooted in the fundamental belief that those who adjudicate in law must always do so without bias or prejudice and must be perceived to do so.\n58 The essence of impartiality lies in the requirement of the judge to approach the case to be adjudicated with an open mind. Conversely, bias or prejudice has been defined as\na leaning, inclination, bent or predisposition towards one side or another or a particular result. In its application to legal proceedings, it represents a predisposition to decide an issue or cause in a certain way which does not leave the judicial mind perfectly open to conviction. Bias is a condition or state of mind which sways judgment and renders a judicial officer unable to exercise his or her functions impartially in a particular case.\n(R. v. Bertram, [1989] O.J. No. 2123 (QL) (H.C.), quoted by Cory J. in R. v. S. (R.D.), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484, at para. 106.)\n59 Viewed in this light, \u201c[i]mpartiality is the fundamental qualification of a judge and the core attribute of the judiciary\u201d (Canadian Judicial Council, Ethical Principles for Judges (1998), at p. 30). It is the key to our judicial process, and must be presumed. As was noted by L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J. and McLachlin J. (as she then was) in S. (R.D.), supra, at para. 32, the presumption of impartiality carries considerable weight, and the law should not carelessly evoke the possibility of bias in a judge, whose authority depends upon that presumption. Thus, while the requirement of judicial impartiality is a stringent one, the burden is on the party arguing for disqualification to establish that the circumstances justify a finding that the judge must be disqualified.\n[\u2026]\nB. Reasonable Apprehension of Bias and Actual Bias\n[\u2026]\n67 Of the three justifications for the objective standard of reasonable apprehension of bias, the last is the most demanding for the judicial system, because it countenances the possibility that justice might not be seen to be done, even where it is undoubtedly done \u2014 that is, it envisions the possibility that a decision-maker may be totally impartial in circumstances which nevertheless create a reasonable apprehension of bias, requiring his or her disqualification. But, even where the principle is understood in these terms, the criterion of disqualification still goes to the judge\u2019s state of mind, albeit viewed from the objective perspective of the reasonable person. The reasonable person is asked to imagine the decision-maker\u2019s state of mind, under the circumstances. In that sense, the oft-stated idea that \u201cjustice must be seen to be done\u201d, which was invoked by counsel for the bands, cannot be severed from the standard of reasonable apprehension of bias.\n[20] The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal is not a court, as were the entities considered in R. v. S. (R.D.), and Wewaykum, and its decision-makers are not judges; they are adjudicators. The adjudicator\u2019s words, demeanour and actions need to be viewed in the context of the administrative tribunal.\nV. Analysis\n[21] Sections 48.9(1) and 50(1) of the Act state that the parties shall have a full and ample opportunity to be heard, in a proceeding, which is as informal and expeditious as the principles of natural justice will allow:\n48.9 (1) Proceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\n[\u2026]\n50. (1) After due notice to the Commission, the complainant, the person against whom the complaint was made and, at the discretion of the member or panel conducting the inquiry, any other interested party, the member or panel shall inquire into the complaint and shall give all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations.\n[22] I was assigned this case in March, 2016. I conducted numerous case management conference calls, which were recorded and summarized. I adjudicated two contested interim motions prior to the hearing, which lasted for 13 days in the period between October 13th, 2016 and January 27th, 2017.\n[23] I fully considered pre-hearing motions and submissions and provided detailed reasons for direction and rulings. Throughout the hearing, I ensured procedural fairness by allowing both parties to present evidence, question witnesses, raise issues, know the case they had to meet, respond to allegations, make objections and motions, and respond to same. I made my best effort to provide a thoughtful, thorough adjudication of motions and objections. This is all part of the official record, and I am confident that a review of the record will confirm that both parties had a full and fair opportunity to present their case.\n[24] The principle of natural justice which is applicable here is the right to an adjudicator who is unbiased. Neutrality and impartiality are not the same and procedural fairness does not require neutrality. (see R. v. S.(R.D.), per L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 and McLachlin JJ. supra, para. 34)\n[25] Adjudicators and judges will often challenge counsel on their submissions to ensure they have an opportunity to address a concern, and may deem it necessary to re-direct counsel during a hearing. Similarly, it may be necessary to remind witnesses to answer questions put to them, explain why an answer is inadmissible, etc. To preserve impartiality, the adjudicator\u2019s interventions must be for the purpose of ensuring justice is in fact done, and appear on their face as fair and conducive to the efficacy of the hearing (Yukon, para. 27). When such procedural conduct appears harsh, rude, disrespectful, and unfair or exhibits pre-judgement, then certainly the presumption of impartiality will give way to an apprehension of bias. (Zundel v. Citron, [2000] 4 FCR 225 (C.A.) paras. 36-37; Yukon, para. 54-55.)\n[26] The circumstances of the hearing may require procedural action, decision or intervention by the adjudicator in order to ensure a full and fair hearing, for example, orderly conduct of the hearing. Such intervention by the adjudicator may not appear neutral, in the senses that there is an expressed purpose and goal to the intervention. Any such intervention by the adjudicator, however, must maintain the appearance of impartiality, i.e., the adjudicator remains open-minded to the arguments to be made by counsel and has not pre-judged an aspect of the matter. (Wewaykum, supra, para. 58).\n[27] The absence of impartiality, i.e., bias, may be indicated by words or actions suggesting that the adjudicator has pre-judged an issue, or that the adjudicator has a predisposition towards one side or another or a particular result. Bias unfairly and improperly affects the outcome because it connotes a favourable or unfavourable disposition that is undeserved, that rests on knowledge that the subject ought not to possess, or that is excessive in degree. (S.(R.D.) per Cory J., para. 105). A party cannot counter the bias through evidence or submissions. Procedural fairness requires that the outcome\/decision is based on a fair hearing, evidence, legislation, jurisprudence and submissions thereon. The decision-maker is transparent in the reasons for the decision and is not influenced by irrelevant considerations.(Yukon Francophone School Board, Education Area #23 v. Yukon (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 25 (herein \u201cYukon\u201d), para. 24).\n[28] The apprehension of bias must be objective and reasonable in the context of the circumstances, and in light of the whole proceeding. (S.(R.D.) per Cory J., para. 111, 141). The Respondent is not claiming that there is any indication of apprehended or actual bias prior to January 23, 2017. Nor is the Respondent claiming any indication of actual bias arising from the events on January 23rd and 27th; just an apprehension that I might be biased against the Respondent and in favour of the Complainant as I review the evidence and submissions, and decide the issues.\n[29] In its submissions, the Respondent noted the Complainant is a nice person, and Respondent\u2019s counsel urged me not to be swayed by that in my decision-making. Following submissions, I made closing comments to confirm that I would carefully review all of the recorded testimony, all of the exhibits in the context of the testimony given, and that I would read all of the submissions in order to decide the issues. In other words, the witnesses\u2019 likeability was not relevant to my decision-making process.\n[30] The parties and counsel are aware that I have and will continue to consider their submissions fully and carefully before deciding and ruling. None of my actions, comments or decisions in this inquiry have given the Respondent any reasonable basis to fear that I would consider anything outside the scope of evidence, exhibits or submissions to decide the issues.\n[31] I have prior experience as a litigation lawyer and administrative tribunal adjudicator. I understand that procedural fairness requires that the decision-maker decide the issues based on the evidence presented, and not on information external to the hearing process that the parties cannot be aware of and respond to. Only the submissions, law and evidence presented to me by the parties in the presence of one another, with a chance to respond, can be considered by me in deciding the issues.\n[32] The Respondent\u2019s counsel is also aware of the principles of natural justice. I confirmed the principles of natural justice on many occasions throughout this matter, so Respondent\u2019s counsel knows that I am aware of the principles of natural justice, both in the context of a court and an administrative tribunal.\n[33] My response to the Complainant\u2019s distribution of the USB storage device, and to his initiation of a handshake and goodbyes, may not have appeared neutral, but colourlessness or absolute neutrality is not required in order to be impartial. Pursuant to s. 48.9(1) of the Act, informality is encouraged so long as it does not compromise natural justice. Specifically, so long as it does not compromise my impartiality as an adjudicator, or reasonably appear to do so.\n[34] In this hearing, I spoke to counsel several times to request that they display civility toward each other and the tribunal, and to not talk\/argue over one another during objections. I did so as a procedural matter to ensure a full, fair and orderly hearing, but the fact that I had to speak to counsel will not have any influence as regards to the merits of the complaint. The questions of alleged discrimination raised in this case are not decided based on the personality or hearing room conduct of the lawyers. Only the demeanour of witnesses during their testimony as it relates to credibility and reliability is relevant; a person\u2019s likeability is not relevant.\n[35] I confirmed during this hearing that because I had no jurisdiction under the Act to award costs, I concluded that I should not draw a negative inference regarding either party\u2019s pursuit of judicial review or appeal, especially involving proceedings between different parties and\/or under different legislation. Likewise, any comment by either party that they intend to pursue a judicial review of any ruling I make, is not relevant to my deliberations of this matter. The Act gives all parties the right to full and fair participation, including judicial review.\n[36] The Respondent\u2019s apprehension that I am biased toward the Complainant or against the Respondent, because of the events that occurred on January 23rd and January 27th, is not objective and\/or reasonable in light of the Respondent\u2019s actual experience with me as an adjudicator since March, 2016, and the Respondent counsel\u2019s knowledge of the concept of an unbiased, impartial decision-maker. If viewed by a reasonable and informed person who knew of my conduct throughout this proceeding, my specific experience, and the concepts of neutrality and impartiality, the events in question would not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.\nVI. Conclusion\n[37] For the foregoing reasons, I will not recuse myself from this matter.\n[38] As I stated at the conclusion of the hearing, I will review the evidence and submissions thoroughly and carefully, and make a decision supported by comprehensive reasons.\nSigned by\nJ.

Payment of legal expenses 17\nIII. Ruling 20\nI. Motion for disclosure and payment of legal expenses\n[1] This is the Tribunal\u2019s third ruling in relation to disclosure in this matter (see 2013 CHRT 3 [Louttit 1]; and, 2013 CHRT 27 [Louttit 2]). By way of motion, the Complainants argue the Attorney General (AG) has yet to disclose a complete set of relevant documents and seek further and better disclosure from the AG. They also seek an order that the AG reimburse them for legal expenses arising from an alleged failure to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s previous disclosure orders in Louttit 1 and Louttit 2.\n[2] These disclosure issues arise in the context of a complaint alleging the Complainants receive inferior policing services in comparison with non-First Nations in Canada. According to the Complainants, this amounts to discrimination on the basis of race pursuant to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act).\n[3] The Tribunal held a hearing with respect to the Complainants\u2019 motion. Two witnesses were called: Mr. Raymond Levesque, Senior Advisor, Countering Crime Division, Emergency Management Programs Branch, Public Safety Canada (PSC); and, Mr. Scott Merrithew, Director General, Strategic and Policing Agreements Branch, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).\n[4] Following the hearing, the AG undertook to make further inquiries to locate documentation identified by Mr. Levesque and Mr. Merrithew. On April 15, 2016, the AG provided an update thereon, including a description of the categories of documents that were subsequently produced to the Complainants. Further to this subsequent disclosure, the AG believes it has satisfied the Complainants\u2019 disclosure requests.\n[5] However, the Complainants claim there are still a number of outstanding documents yet to be disclosed by the AG. According to the Complainants, the categories of documents disclosed by the AG do not match those they requested in their motion, and the AG\u2019s response did not indicate how its additional disclosure addressed the categories of documents requested. Aside from the terms and conditions of the First Nations Policing Policy and Programs, the Complainants claim the following items remain to be disclosed: emails and other files of key staff persons at PSC; documents outlining the process for setting staffing and funding levels in remote or isolated communities served by the RCMP; materials relating to the process for setting staffing and funding levels for First Nation police services; materials relating to the negotiation of the Nishnawbe-Aski Police Service (NAPS) tripartite agreement; other documents for which Cabinet confidence privilege is claimed; documents outlining the standards governing the RCMP; documents containing redactions, missing pages and fragments; documents relating to the steps Canada has taken in relation to the recommendations of the Kashechewan inquest; and, documents regarding officer housing in the community of Norman Wells, Northwest Territories.\n[6] Following further directions from the Tribunal on December 16, 2016, and the subsequent disclosure of additional documents, the parties were able to resolve some of the above disclosure requests.\n[7] The Commission participated in the hearing of the disclosure motion and adopts the submissions of the Complainants. It also made its own request for further disclosure by the AG, which documents have now been produced.\nII. Analysis\nA. Preliminary issue: evidence on the motion\n[8] At the hearing, there was some dispute with respect to the status of documents which were included in the Complainants\u2019 book of documents, but which were not specifically referrred to during the hearing or put to the witnesses. It is the AG\u2019s position that those documents ought to be removed from the Complainants\u2019 book of documents. According to the AG, the Complainants had a full opportunity to question the witnesses on the documents in their book of documents. Therefore, permitting the Complainants to now rely on documents that were not put to the witnesses at the hearing would be unfair.\n[9] The Complainants do not believe documents should be removed from their book of documents. According to the Complainants, motions are typically decided based on written evidence given they most often deal with procedural issues. Furthermore, it is not necessary that witnesses establish the authenticity of documents when the motion is about the adequacy of the disclosure itself. The documents can be relevant merely as providing evidence to the Tribunal with respect to what has and has not been produced.\n[10] The Tribunal sought clarification from the parties on what they considered to be the motion record and the parties made submissions on the documents that were in contention. Further to this request, the parties have provided additional information and now have indicated that the matter has been resolved. Consequently, I will consider the motion materials filed by the parties in their entirety.\nB. Requests for disclosure\n[11] Pursuant to section 50(1) of the Act, parties before the Tribunal must be given a full and ample opportunity to present their case. The Tribunal must also conduct its proceedings as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and its rules of procedure allow (see s. 48.9(1) of the Act).\n[12] To fulfill these obligations, the Tribunal requires, among other things, the disclosure of arguably relevant information between the parties prior to the hearing of the matter. Along with the facts and issues presented by the parties, the disclosure of information allows each party to know the case it is up against and, therefore, to adequately prepare for the hearing. For that reason, if there is a rational connection between a document and the facts, issues or forms of relief identified by the parties in the matter, it should be disclosed pursuant to rules 6(1)(d) and 6(1)(e) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) (see Guay v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2004 CHRT 34 at para. 42).\n[13] While the Tribunal requires arguably relevant information be disclosed prior to the hearing, this does not mean that this information will be admitted as evidence or that significant weight will be afforded to it in the decision-making process (see Telecommunications Employees Association of Manitoba Inc. v. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 CHRT 28 at para. 4). Rather, it is a process that is meant to help parties prepare for the hearing and avoid delays in doing so [see Rule 9(3)(c) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04)].\n[14] It is with these principles in mind that I will now examine each of the Complainants\u2019 requests for disclosure.\n(i) Emails and other files of key staff persons at PSC\n[15] Mr. Levesque testified that the email accounts of four staff people were searched at PSC. However, according to the Complainants, he mentioned other personnel who were involved in activities relevant to this complaint, but whose emails and documents were not searched, including policy analysts, various regional managers for Ontario, the program support unit managers and negotiators for the NAPS agreements.\n[16] Furthermore, the Complainants indicate that 525 emails from the account of Mr. Levesque have been disclosed for the period of 2001 to 2005. Conversely, only 5 emails for the period of 2006-2007, from all staff, have been disclosed. The Complainants also note that, while emails of previous employees may have been disclosed through the search of Mr. Levesque and the other 3 employees\u2019 emails, there is no indication that the actual email accounts of these previous employees were searched. In the Complainants\u2019 view, this establishes that there has been an insufficient search of emails and documents of key staff persons in this matter. The Complainants are also concerned that the AG may have breached the Tribunal\u2019s order and general rules of fairness by failing to advise the parties and the Tribunal that, since the filing of the complaint, it deleted the email accounts of many PSC employees when they left the department.\n[17] According to the AG, Mr. Levesque testified that an exhaustive search was conducted to locate all documents that were relevant to the complaint, including the hard copy and electronic files of the 4 key staff persons in the Aboriginal Policing Directorate. Furthermore, the AG states that numerous emails from previous employees at the Ontario regional office have been disclosed, which includes a substantial number of emails dating back to 2000.\n[18] The AG does acknowledge that, during Mr. Levesque\u2019s testimony, it became aware that the email disclosure from employees in the policy branch of the Aboriginal Policing Directorate, along with the program support unit managers, may not be complete. It made further inquiries to obtain any additional relevant emails, which it says have now been produced.\n[19] According to the Complainants, the additional emails produced by the AG have not been categorized in relation to its motion and are organized in a confusing manner. As such, it has not been able to ascertain whether the additonal documents actually address its request for disclosure.\n[20] In Louttit 1, I indicated that while the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) do not specify the manner or form by which production is to take place, their purpose and the principles of fairness in general dictate that any disclosure and production of documents be sufficient to allow each party the full and ample opportunity to be heard. In the context of that ruling, I found the AG\u2019s production of an unorganized CD, with unindexed and unsorted documents, inhibited the Complainants\u2019 ability to rely upon or address evidence that the AG found arguably relevant to the case. I indicated that any disclosed documents should be clearly titled or labeled to allow for easy identification and consultation by the opposing party (see Louttit 1 at paras. 12-15)\n[21] Similarly, in Louttit 2, I had to address the situation where the AG produced additional documents in response to a request for disclosure from the Complainants and a subsequent order from this Tribunal. The AG did not indicate how the additional documents addressed the different disclosure requests\/orders and did not produce them in a manner that allowed the Complainants to determine whether the AG complied with the disclosure order. The AG was directed to indicate in writing how it had complied with the Tribunal\u2019s disclosure order. Specifically, it was directed to indicate how any additional disclosure responded to the Complainants\u2019 requests (see Louttit 2 at paras. 22-27).\n[22] In this third disclosure ruling, I must again address a situation where the AG is not producing documents in a manner that allows the Complainants to determine whether disclosure is complete. In following the principles outlined in Louttit 1 and Louttit 2, and by way of a letter dated December 16, 2016, I directed the AG to indicate in writing to the Tribunal and the other parties how it has complied with the Complainants\u2019 request for disclosure of \u201cemails and other files of key staff persons at PSC.\u201d Specifically, a written response to paragraphs 7-12 of the Complainants\u2019 January 30, 2015 submissions was required. The AG was to indicate how the additional documents address those requests or, conversely, certify that no additional documentation exists to address the requests.\n[23] After a number of extensions, the AG filed its response on May 19, 2017. On May 31, 2017, the Complainants confirmed their understanding that the AG\u2019s most recent response completed the matters that the Tribunal directed the parties to attend to on December 16, 2016. Moving forward, the principles outlined in Louttit 1 and Louttit 2 should guide the parties in responding to requests or orders for disclosure.\n[24] Finally, the Complainants believe that an important number of arguably relevant emails may have been deleted by the PSC following the filing of the complaint. This is a serious allegation and it is unclear from the parties\u2019 latest correspondence whether it has been resolved. The parties will be asked to address this issue at the next case management conference call.\n(ii) Documents outlining the process for setting staffing and funding levels in remote or isolated communities served by the RCMP\n[25] In Louttit 1, I found the Complainants\u2019 request for general policy documents relating to the RCMP\u2019s process for setting staffing and funding levels in remote communities to be arguably relevant to this matter and subject to disclosure (at para. 26). In response to that ruling, the AG disclosed three documents. According to the Complainants, those documents do not explain in any significant detail how staffing and funding levels are set in remote or isolated communities served by the RCMP.\n[26] At the hearing of this motion, the Complainants contend Mr. Merrithew acknowledged that the RCMP uses a Police Resourcing Model (PRM) to help determine the general staffing needs in a detachment. However, the Complainants claim the PRM and its corresponding Instruction Manual have not been disclosed. The Complainants also submit that a presentation disclosed by the AG lists 7 other models the RCMP uses to determine staffing levels, and that those models have also not been disclosed. If these 7 models were used to determine staffing levels for the RCMP, then in the Complainants\u2019 view, they are relevant to determining what staffing levels are needed in the Mushkegowuk First Nations.\n[27] The AG asserts the PRM has been disclosed, along with a completed PRM for a remote and isolated First Nations community in the Northwest Territories: the Norman Wells Community. With regard to the PRM Instruction Manual, the AG submits it can be disclosed through a confidentiality order.\n[28] As to the other models requested by the Complainants, the AG submits these methodologies were created by various private sector contractors, are not necessarily specific to the RCMP, and, were not consistently applied across the RCMP. In fact, the AG states the PRM was developed as a direct result of deficiencies identified with these other models. Therefore, according to the AG, the other models are not relevant for the purposes of this complaint. Otherwise, the AG submits there is no document that sets out the precise manner in which resource levels are set by the RCMP in remote or isolated communities. Rather, according to the AG, Mr. Merrithew testified that staffing levels are set on a detachment-specifc basis based on a dialogue between the RCMP and the contracting jurisdiction, with the latter deciding what the ultimate level of resource will be.\n[29] Indeed, Mr. Merrithew\u2019s affidavit indicates \u201c[p]olice service resource determination is done collaboratively between the contracting jurisdiction and the RCMP\u201d and that \u201c[t]his determination is an ongoing process that is unique to each contracting jurisdiction\u201d (at para. 7). He also indicated at paragraph 8 of his affidavit that there are many factors to consider when establishing policing resource levels, including operational requirements, officer safety, provincial\/municipal policing priorities and affordability.\n[30] However, Mr. Merrithew also identified certain standard articles that appear in Police Service Agreements. Article 5 adresses the level of policing in communities served by the RCMP. According to paragraph 9 of Mr. Merrithew\u2019s affidavit, \u201c[t]his Article states that the level of policing, determined by the RCMP and the contracting jurisdiction, will meet the minimum level that is required to maintain public or officer safety.\u201d\n[31] Furthermore, article 18 of the Police Service Agreement stipulates that each year the RCMP will submit to the contracting jurisdiction a projected Multi-Year Financial Plan for consideration. Mr. Merrithew also indicates at paragraph 11 of his affidavit that, \u201c[a]t a minimum, the Multi-Year Plan will address the number of positions required for the police service, budgetary considerations, infrastructure and equipment plans, previous year budget deviations and other information as agreed upon by the parties.\u201d This plan is submitted to the contracting jurisdiction on or before June 1st of each year.\n[32] By June 15th of each year, the contracting jurisdiction then will provide the RCMP with the projected annual budget for the next fiscal year\u2019s police service. In addition, the contracting jurisdiction provides any updates to the projected annual budget for the police service as they become available. As Mr. Merrithew states at paragraph 13 of his affidavit: \u201c[t]his ongoing process, which takes place at the local level, is a key element of setting resource requirements throughout the various contract jurisdictions and is unique to each jurisidiction.\u201d\n[33] Therefore, as I understand it, there is a back and forth between the RCMP and the contracting jurisdiction before agreements and budgets are put in place. This back and forth negotiation is not only done orally. Rather, various documents are exchanged throughout the process.\n[34] Hence, while there may not be documents that describe or detail the process undertaken by the RCMP and a contracting jurisdiction in concluding a Police Service Agreement, there are however, as indicated in Mr. Merrithew\u2019s affidavit, arguably relevant documents related to that process that can be disclosed, such as Police Service Agreements and Multi-Year Financial Plans. That said, as I understand the Complainants\u2019 request, not every Police Service Agreement and Multi-Year Financial Plan will be arguably relevant to this complaint. Only those for communities or jurisdictions that are comparable to the Nishnawbe-Aski Police Service or, as the Complainants have worded it, \u201cremote or isolated communities.\u201d Therefore, the AG shall disclose all Police Service Agreements, Multi-Year Financial Plans and any other related documents for remote and isolated communities served by the RCMP.\n[35] With respect to the PRM Instruction Manual, the AG shall disclose the manual subject to the following restrictions: (1) it shall be disclosed to counsel for the Complainants and the Commission only; (2) counsel for the Complainants and the Commission shall only use it to prepare for the hearing of this matter and to communicate with their clients to seek any instructions necessary; (3) counsel for the Complainants and the Commission shall not disclose it to any other individuals without prior permission from the Tribunal and notification to the AG; and, (4) counsel for the Complainants and the Commission shall not use it for any other purpose outside of the present inquiry. If the PRM Instructions Manual is to be used at the hearing of this matter, these confidentiality measures can be revisited pursuant to section 52 of the Act.\n(iii) Materials relating to the process for determining the overall budget for the First Nations Policing Program and the process for setting staffing and funding levels for First Nation police services\n[36] In Louttit 1, I found the Complainants\u2019 request for general policy documents relating to the process for setting staffing and funding levels for First Nations police services, under the First Nations Policing Policy administered by PSC, to be arguably relevant to this matter and subject to disclosure (at para. 26). In response to that ruling, the Complainants state only one document was disclosed by the AG. The Complainants believe there are other documents under this heading that are arguably relevant to this matter and subject to disclosure by the AG.\n[37] According to the Complainants, Mr. Levesque described numerous instances where arguably relevant materials would have been produced as part of the budget-setting process for a First Nations police service, but which have not been disclosed by the AG:\n\u00b7 Preliminary budgets are prepared by analysts in the policy branch.\n\u00b7 The budgets prepared by the analysts are based on consultations with provincial and territorial counterparts, funding partners, finance staff and corporate managers.\n\u00b7 Draft budgets prepared by analysts are reviewed by the director of the policy area, by the corporate management branch, and by finance staff.\n\u00b7 The needs of the program are communicated to the analysts in the policy area by staff in the program area through various documents, including emails and spreadsheets.\n\u00b7 One of the documents the program area provides to the policy area is a spreadsheet listing the different First Nation police forces and how much funding should be going to each, roughly over a 5 year period.\n\u00b7 Within the program area, the regional managers provide an initial estimate of the needs for First Nations policing to the program support manager(s) through various documents, such as spreadsheets. The program support manager(s) \u201croll up\u201d the information from the regional managers to be shared with the policy analyst in the policy area.\n[38] The AG maintains that all relevant documents relating to staffing and funding have been disclosed and that this was confirmed by Mr. Levesque during his testimony. With regard to budgets prepared at the analyst level, the AG submits that Mr. Levesque indicated that those budgets form part of the materials that are covered by Cabinet confidence privilege (discussed below). Otherwise, the AG states Mr. Levesque confirmed that hard copy files of documents from the policy area were searched. The AG adds that, through Mr. Levesque\u2019s testimony, it became aware that there may be some documentation leading up to the 2013 budget that has not been disclosed. It states the emails and hard copy files of relevant employees were searched and additional documents were located and disclosed.\n[39] In reply, the Complainants acknowledge that twelve new documents have been disclosed and listed as \u201crelating to the 2013 budget.\u201d According to the Complainants, at least half of these documents appear to be media-related documents such as news releases or documents detailing media lines. None of the documents appear to be the kind of documents relating to the setting of the funding and staffing levels that were requested and that appear to exist based on Mr. Levesque\u2019s testimony. The Complainants further note that the AG\u2019s submissions only address the budgets prepared by policy analysts and not other budget-setting documents that have not been disclosed, such as spreadsheets created by staff in the program area.\n[40] With regard to the budgets that the AG claims form part of the materials that are covered by Cabinet confidence privilege, the Complainants contend that the AG provided them with a list of documents submitted to the Privy Council Office for review. Budgets prepared at the analyst level do not appear on that list. Therefore, the Complainants submit the AG\u2019s statement is false or that there are additional Cabinet confidence documents yet to be disclosed.\n[41] Again, while there may be no documents that describe or detail the process for setting staffing and funding levels for First Nations police services, it is clear from Mr. Levesque\u2019s testimony that there are arguably relevant documents related to that process that are subject to disclosure, including preliminary and draft budgets, supporting spreadsheets and communications, such as emails, that gather input from various people with respect to those bugdets and spreadsheets. As the Complainants also indicate, their request includes other budget-setting documents created by staff in the program area, such as budget projections for the First Nations Policing Program as a whole and other initial estimates of the needs for First Nations policing by regional managers. The Complainants submit this request is central to their complaint and that proceeding without this evidence may prejudice their case. Therefore, where these documents are not subject to Cabinet confidence, the AG is ordered to disclose them. Where the AG claims Cabinet confidence over documents, it shall clearly identify those documents in its list of documents.\n(iv) Materials relating to the negotiation of the NAPS tripartite agreement\n[42] According to the Complainants, the AG has provided correspondence from the NAPS requesting additional funding as well as the federal government\u2019s correspondence responding to some of those requests. However, the Complainants claim the disclosure materials are missing internal federal government documents assessing funding requests and proposals and any responses thereto, documents formulating budget negotiating positions whether justifying proposed budgets or refusing to increase resources, or other documents analyzing what resources are truly needed by the police service. The Complainants believe these materials would likely be found in the emails or files of regional managers who were not fully included in the AG\u2019s initial search for documents, as discussed above. The Complainants also point to Mr. Levesque\u2019s testimony wherein he noted that there would be emails back and forth between the provincial negotiator and the federal negotiator, and formal or informal notes of meetings.\n[43] Following the hearing of their motion, the Complainants indicate that a number of new documents have been disclosed under this category. However, the Complainants claim these new documents do not appear to actually relate to the NAPS agreement negotiations, or to NAPS in general. Therefore, they submit this category of documents remains outstanding.\n[44] A detailed funding request by NAPS to the federal government is found at tab 6 of the Complainants\u2019 book of documents. However, as the Complainants indicate, no documents indicating the government\u2019s assessment of this proposal, or responding thereto, have been disclosed. Consistent with Mr. Levesque\u2019s testimony, I accept the Complainants\u2019 assertion that there are likely memos, notes, emails or other arguably relevant documents pertaining to the government\u2019s review, discussion and analysis of this proposal and the negotiation of the NAPS tripartite agreement in general. The AG is ordered to disclose and produce all arguably relevant documents related to this request, with specific regard to the types of documents identified by Mr. Levesque and, as specified by the Complainants, up to December 31, 2013. It shall disclose and produce those documents to the Complainants and Commission.\n(v) The terms and conditions of the First Nations Policing Policy and Programs\n[45] The AG has disclosed the terms and conditions of the First Nations Policing Policy and Programs expiring March 31, 2014, as well as those expiring March 31, 2018. However, the Complainants also requested the disclosure of earlier versions of the terms and conditions, including those that were in place for the period covered by the complaint and when the complaint was filed.\n[46] On May 2, 2016, the Complainants indicated that disclosure of this category of documents has now been completed.\n(vi) Other documents over which Cabinet confidence privilege is claimed\n[47] Pursuant to section 39 of the Canada Evidence Act, documents cannot be withheld from disclosure on the basis that they are covered by Cabinet confidence privilege unless the Clerk of the Privy Council certifies in writing that the information does indeed constitute a Cabinet confidence. The AG has witheld the disclosure of some documents pursuant to section 39 of the Canada Evidence Act, but has not produced a certificate from the Clerk of the Privy Council. That said, the parties have agreed to an alternative process. Pursuant to that alternative process, the AG provided the Complainants with the Clerk of the Privy Council Office\u2019s determination on 138 documents identified by the AG as potentially containing Cabinet confidence, including the statutory authority upon which each determination was based and a brief description of each document. Five documents were disclosed on a severed basis to the Complainants.\n[48] As a result, the AG believes this issue is resolved. However, as indicated above, the Complainants are concerned by the AG\u2019s assertion that the budgets for the First Nations Policing Program prepared at the analyst level are Memoranda to Cabinet and have been submitted to the Privy Council Office. According to the Complainants, these budgets were not previosuly included in the list of PCO documents provided by the AG. Other categories of documents over which Cabinet confidence privilege is claimed include documents related to the Comprehensive Review of the First Nations Policing Program, including any policy options created as a result of the review, and any Treasury Board documents discussing the quality of policing in the Mushkegowuk First Nations or in First Nations generally.\n[49] As indicated by the Complainants and addressed above at paragraph 38, there is still some uncertaintly with respect to some documents over which Cabinet confidence is claimed. As such, I will reserve issuing a ruling on this issue until the further disclosure ordered in this ruling is complete.\n[50] However, in the AG\u2019s consolidated list of documents, all documents over which Cabinet confidence is being claimed should be clearly identified. At the next case management conference call, the Complainants shall indicate whether the issue of Cabinet confidence documents remains a live issue.\n(vii) Documents outlining the standards governing the RCMP\n[51] In Louttit 1, the Tribunal directed the AG to disclose all documents outlining the standards of the RCMP governing service levels, facilities, equipment, wages, benefits, and isolation pay, and any standards specific to policing in remote or isolate communities.\n[52] The AG is concerned with the voluminous nature of the Complainants\u2019 request for documentation on this issue. According to the AG, Mr. Merrithew testified as to the extensive and inter-related nature of the various manuals containing the national RCMP standards and operating procedures. Given this, the AG claims the blanket disclosure of RCMP standards requested by the Complainants would lead to an endless stream of document production, consuming many months of time to complete.\n[53] The AG is also concerned with the lack of probative value of such all-encompassing disclosure. It submits that if all RCMP documents relating to standards were disclosed, there would be tens of thousands of documents, with the vast majority being irrelevant. It says this amounts to a fishing expedition. As a result, the AG has produced a copy of the Tables of Contents for the RCMP Operation, Administration and Subsidiary Manuals. With those Table of Contents, it suggests the Complainants identify specific standards that they believe are relevant to the complaint.\n[54] The Complainants submit that the AG\u2019s arguments for witholding the documents under this heading are not valid given the Tribunal has already ordered they be disclosed. They submit that the volume of documents can be dealt with through electronic disclosure and that they are willing to sign a confidentiality undertaking and work with the AG on any other measures that would allow for a more efficient and expeditious disclosure of these materials. Subject to the Tribunal\u2019s ruling on the most expedient way to proceed with respect to these materials, the Complainants indicated that they may need to follow up with a request for specific materials listed in the Tables of Contents provided.\n[55] In a letter dated December 16, 2016, the Complainants were directed to review the index and to indicate to the AG which materials would need to be disclosed. The Complainants did so on January, 10, 2017. On May 30, 2017, the AG indicated that it provided the required disclosure. On May 31, 2017, the Complainants indicated their understanding that the AG\u2019s most recent response completed the matters that the Tribunal directed the parties to attend to on December 16, 2016. Therefore, it is my understanding that this disclosure request has now been resolved and I no longer need to rule on this issue.\n(viii) Illegible documents, missing pages and additional information\n[56] The Complainants claim certain disclosed documents are illegible and\/or are missing pages. They also request further information regarding a document that it describes as outlining deficiencies with NAPS (author, cover pages, related emails). The Complainants claim Mr. Levesque acknowledged that it would be possible to search for further details relating to this document. Following the motion hearing, the Complainants state no new documents have been provided in relation to this category.\n[57] The AG contends it already made further inquiries regarding the documents identified by the Complainants and provided a response to each document. With regard to Mr. Levesque\u2019s comments, the AG submits he was not aware at the time of his testimony that the document, and other documents, had already been followed up on for missing information. As such, the AG argues there are no further items to be disclosed under this heading.\n[58] Insofar as the AG can rectify any documents that are illegible or are missing pages, it shall do so as part of its disclosure obligation (see paras. 20-23 above). That said, I accept the AG\u2019s assertion that it made further inquiries regarding the documents identified by the Complainants and provided a response to each document. However, the AG is reminded that it has an ongoing disclosure and production obligation pursuant to Rule 6(5) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04). If it subsequently determined that the AG has failed to disclose documents, the Tribunal has the power to summon witnesses and compel them to produce documents (see s. 50(3)(a) of the Act).\n(ix) Documents relating to the steps Canada has taken in relation to the recommendations of the Kashechewan inquest\n[59] The Kashechewan inquest concerned the deaths of two young First Nations men in a police station fire in one of the Mushkegowuk communities. According to the Complainants, the recommendations coming out of that inquest included that resources be provided to ensure equality in policing, as well as other recommendations to improve NAPS. The Complainants request documents relating to the steps Canada has taken in relation to the Kashechewan inquest recommendations. To date, the Complainants claim the AG has only provided one document in relation to this request. It finds it highly unlikely that there is only one document on this issue. The Complainants contend Mr. Levesque acknowledged that there would be notes from meetings between federal staff about the inquest recommendations, along with materials relating to calls, meetings and correspondence with provincial partners about certain key recommendations. However, these materials have not been disclosed.\n[60] The AG indicates that it made further inquiries to locate any additional relevant materials relating to the Kashechewan inquest, but that no further documents were located.\n[61] Given Mr. Levesque\u2019s testimony, I also find it difficult to believe that there are no other documents related to this issue. The AG is ordered to disclose all arguably relevant documents related to this request, with specific regard to the types of documents identified by Mr. Levesque. The AG is ordered to disclose and produce those documents to the Complainants and Commission.\n(x) Documents regarding officer housing in the community of Norman Wells, Northwest Territories\n[62] According to the Complainants, Norman Wells is a largely non-Aboriginal community in the Northwest Territories without road access, which is policed by the RCMP. The Complainants may use this community as part of a comparison between policing for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities. While the AG has disclosed a number of documents regarding Norman Wells, the Complainants request additional documentation regarding officer housing in the community. More specifically, the Complainants want to know whether the information already provided covers all of the units rented by the RCMP for its officers in Norman Wells, and are requesting information regarding the construction costs of the three properties used by the RCMP in Norman Wells.\n[63] The AG submits the three properties used by the RCMP in Norman Wells were purchased in 1977. The construction of the units is estimated to have taken place in the 1970s, and the AG states any documentation relating to construction costs no longer exists. Also, no information exists as to the current market appraisal of the properties.\n[64] I accept the AG\u2019s submissions regarding the construction costs of the three properties used by the RCMP in Norman Wells.\n[65] I note the AG has not addressed the Complainants\u2019 question as to whether the information already provided covers all of the units rented by the RCMP for its officers in Norman Wells. The AG shall provide a response to the Complainants\u2019 question. Again, the AG is reminded that it has an ongoing disclosure and production obligation pursuant to Rule 6(5) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04). If it subsequently determined that the AG has failed to disclose documents, the Tribunal has the power to summon witnesses and compel them to produce documents (see s. 50(3)(a) of the Act).\nC. Payment of legal expenses\n[66] The Complainants also seek an order that the AG pay their expenses arising from what they claim is the AG\u2019s failure to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s disclosure order of December 21, 2012 (see Louttit 1 at para. 8). They argue this has resulted in unwarranted costs and delays in this matter. Furthermore, the Complainants submit that an award of legal expenses will help ensure procedural fairness in this case. The Commission supports the Complainants\u2019 submissions, but does not seek reimbursement of any expenses it incurred.\n[67] Relying on Tipple v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FCA 158 [Tipple], the Complainants argue that administrative tribunals have the jurisdiction to award costs to control their own process. They contend this is a separate and distinct power from an order of legal costs to the winning side of a dispute, which the Supreme Court of Canada found the Tribunal did not have the power to award in Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 53 (Mowat).\n[68] The Tribunal\u2019s disclosure order of December 21, 2012 required the disclosure of 11 categories of documents. The Complainants claim only one category of documents was provided by the deadline set by the Tribunal. They submit as follows: 3 categories of documents were provided after the deadline and only because they continued to pursue them; 1 category of documents was never provided, but they have located the information through other means; and, 6 categories of documents are the subject of the present motion. The Complainants also note the Tribunal had to issue a second ruling on disclosure in this matter, Louttit 2, to direct the AG to indicate how it had complied with the Tribunal\u2019s initial disclosure order in Louttit 1. In this regard, they further note that the Tribunal found the AG\u2019s position on that motion was \u201c\u2026not in line with the spirit of the Tribunal\u2019s order or disclosure in general\u201d (Louttit 2 at para. 24).\n[69] The Complainants submit the AG\u2019s failure to comply on a timely basis with disclosure orders in this matter has resulted in unwarranted costs and delay. That is, this is the third disclosure motion filed to obtain documents that were requested over two years ago; counsel for the Complainants have drafted a considerable amount of correspondence regarding disclosure and have had to review and compare multiple disclosure packages; and, numerous case management conference calls have been held regarding disclosure. In the Complainants\u2019 view, none of these additional steps should have been necessary.\n[70] Finally, the Complainants argue an award of legal expenses can help ensure procedural fairness in this case. If the Tribunal does not intervene, the Complainants claim that parties with more funds and legal resources can use attrition to wear down the other side. By refusing to disclose materials, delaying the process, not responding to correspondence, raising repeated objections, and refusing to abide by Tribunal orders, the stronger party can force the other party to incur legal costs until they can no longer push the case forward. Therefore, in the Complainants\u2019 view, an award of legal expenses is a way for the Tribunal to control its process, ensure compliance with its orders and maintain a level procedural playing field.\n[71] It is the AG\u2019s position that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to make an award of costs. Neither the CHRA, nor the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04), contain any provision that would empower the Tribunal to impose the penalty requested by the Complainants. It notes the Supreme Court of Canada in Mowat determined the Tribunal does not have authority to award \u201clegal costs.\u201d Also, the AG argues the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to directly enforce its orders. Rather, it is a matter for the Federal Court.\n[72] Further, even if the Tribunal had jurisdiction to make an award of costs, the AG submits the circumstances of this case do not warrant the granting of such an award. In Tipple, the AG contends there were unusual and exceptional circumstances warranting an award of damages for obstruction of process. In this case, the AG advances its conduct has not been obstructive and it has diligently and consistently produced relevant documents in its possession. According to the AG, it is inevitable that, in a case of this size and complexity, involving thousands of pages of documents and multiple client departments in various locations, some documents will get overlooked. In order to address any perceived deficiencies in its disclosure, the AG notes it provided affidavits and facilitated the cross-examination of its witnesses on the issue of disclosure, even though neither of those steps were required by the Tribunal. In the AG\u2019s view, this level of transparency in disclosure belies the Complainants\u2019 assertion that there has been obstructive conduct.\n[73] Given there are still ongoing disclosure issues in this case, I am of the view that the Complainants\u2019 motion for the payment of legal expenses is best considered folllowing the hearing of the merits of this matter. At that time, the parties and the Tribunal will have a more complete understanding of how any disclosure issues may have affected these proceedings, including the above concerns raised by the Complainants and any additional issues that may arise in completing this inquiry. In this regard, I note the Complainants\u2019 assertions throughout this motion that they believe that further arguably relevant documents have yet to be disclosed by the AG. While I\u2019ve accepted some of the AG\u2019s statements regarding the sufficiency of its disclosure at this time, the grounds for the motion for the payment of legal expenses could evolve if those statements turn out to be inaccurate. As a result, pursuant to Rule 3(2)(c) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04), any argument or evidence on the Complainants\u2019 motion for the payment of legal expenses can be made during the hearing of the merits of the complaint.\nIII. Ruling\n[74] The AG shall complete the disclosure ordered in this ruling by August 21, 2017 and provide an updated consolidated list of documents to the Tribunal and the other parties. By the same date, the AG shall indicate to the Tribunal and the other parties, in writing, what actions it undertook to comply with this ruling and any new documents disclosed as a result. If no new documents are being disclosed in response to a particular order, the AG shall also clearly indicate this. The AG\u2019s written submissions shall be accompanied by a suporting affidavit or affidavits. Upon request, the AG will make the affiant(s) available for cross-examination. In addition, the affiant(s) will answer any clarification questions from the Tribunal, if any.\n[75] A case management conference call shall be scheduled following the completion of the AG\u2019s disclosure and written submissions to discuss any issues arising therefrom and to address some of the other issues outlined in this ruling. In working with the parties through case conferencing, I hope to avoid having to issue a fourth disclosure ruling in this matter and to move this matter towards a hearing as expeditiously as possible.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOttawa, Ontario\nJune 19, 2017\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal Files:\nT1683\/3811 & T1684\/3911\nStyle of Cause:\nGrand Chief Stan Louttit in a representative capacity on behalf of the First Nation of Mushkegowuk Council and Grand Chief Stan Louttit in his personal capacity v.

Introduction\n[1] In connection with the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal\u2019s (\u201cCHRT\u201d or \u201cTribunal\u201d) inquiry into an allegation of discrimination in the provision of a service by the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (\u201cCATSA\u201d) brought by Kathleen Mahood (\u201cMs. Mahood\u201d or the \u201cComplainant\u201d), the Minister of Transport has invoked the procedure prescribed by s. 4.79 of the Aeronautics Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. A-2 (the \u201cAct\u201d) and has requested a hearing to assess certain potential security concerns stemming from the disclosure of Closed Circuit Television footage (\u201cCCTV footage\u201d) from the Calgary Airport.\n[2] The Minister takes the position that this hearing should be held on an ex parte basis.\n[3] I have carefully reviewed the legislation, as well as the case law and the submissions put before me, and am of the view that the Act provides for an in camera hearing where the Minister of Transport has the right to appear and make representations on the confidentiality of security measures that may be disclosed in the context of a proceeding before the CHRT.\n[4] I do not find that the Act requires that these submissions be made on an ex parte basis, nor do I find sufficient grounds to order an ex parte hearing on the facts currently before me.\n[5] While I do not rule out the possibility that some elements of the Minister\u2019s representations may warrant an ex parte hearing, the automatic exclusion of the parties would represent a departure from basic principles of natural justice, and cannot be undertaken unless doing so is shown to be necessary on the specific facts of the case, or where expressly directed by Parliament.\n[6] There is very little case law outlining the procedure contemplated by s. 4.79 of the Act for consideration of the disclosure of security measures. In light of the nature of the rights and interests being affected, I have elected to release a formal ruling outlining my decision.\nII. Background\n[7] This procedural question arises in the context of an inquiry into a complaint brought by Kathleen Mahood, stemming from her experience at airport security in Calgary on July 9, 2015.\n[8] Briefly, Ms. Mahood claims that she was discriminated against on the basis of her disability in the way she was treated by the CATSA screening agents, who found marijuana and a vaporizer in her belongings on July 9, 2015, while she was travelling from Calgary to Toronto (the \u201cComplaint\u201d).\n[9] The Complaint giving rise to this inquiry was referred to the Tribunal by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) on October 13, 2016.\n[10] The events related to the Complaint transpired at the domestic traveller screening area of the Calgary Airport, and it is believed that the events were captured by CCTV footage, which is in CATSA\u2019s possession.\n[11] At a Case Management Conference Call on April 5, 2017, all parties stipulated to the relevance of the CCTV footage, and both CATSA (who has seen the CCTV footage) and Ms. Mahood (who has not seen the CCTV footage) have indicated that they would like to rely on the video at the hearing of the Complaint. Therefore, the relevance of the CCTV footage evidence to the instant inquiry is agreed.\n[12] Prior to producing the CCTV footage to the other parties in this proceeding, CATSA raised concerns about the confidential nature of the material captured, and brought a motion for a sealing and non-disclosure order related to the CCTV footage, and for an order that the other parties be allowed to consult the CCTV footage at the Respondent\u2019s offices instead of having a copy provided to them.\n[13] CATSA\u2019s motion record relied upon s. 4.79(1) of the Act, which prohibits disclosure of security measures, except where required by law.\n[14] Upon further review, it became clear that s. 4.79(2), which entitles the Minister to make representations prior to the issuance of a disclosure order, and 4.79(3), which provides for a disclosure order, subject to any restrictions or conditions that the Tribunal considers appropriate, are also engaged.\n[15] In light of the potential importance of the video to the Complainant\u2019s case, the considerable prejudice that would result to Ms. Mahood if CATSA\u2019s proposed Order were to be granted, and the legislative requirement to invite representations from the Minister of Transport, I asked the parties to file more detailed submissions, including an affidavit from CATSA, supporting the motion.\n[16] Pursuant to s. 4.79(2) of the Act, the Tribunal Registry Office served the Minister of Transport with a copy of CATSA\u2019s motion record, and the proposed schedule of submissions for the motion.\n[17] On May 10, 2017, the Minister wrote to the Tribunal and asserted his position that the procedure for the review established in s. 4.79(2) of the Act \u201c\u2026contemplates a standalone in camera hearing wherein the Minister of Transport would make submissions to the Tribunal about the effects of ordering production or discovery of the CCTV footage.\u201d\n[18] The Minister also requested that the Minister\u2019s representations be filed under seal, to be viewed only by the Tribunal Member.\n[19] The Minister did not take a position with regard to CATSA\u2019s motion.\n[20] On May 12, 2017, the Tribunal Registry Office wrote to the parties and the Minister, to advise them that I was concerned that conducting an ex parte hearing on this matter would represent a marked departure from the principles of natural justice which govern Tribunal proceedings. Consequently, I requested that the parties make further submissions on the review procedure proposed by the Minister and outlined in s. 4.79(2) of the Act.\n[21] On May 19, 2017, the Minister filed submissions, relying on two cases, in support of the assertion that the Act provided for an in camera hearing to be conducted ex parte.\n[22] The Commission did not consent to the Minister\u2019s request, but declined to make any further submissions.\n[23] CATSA also declined to make submissions.\n[24] On June 2, 2017 (albeit after the deadline provided for submissions had passed), the Complainant (who is representing herself in these proceedings) wrote to the Parties and the Tribunal, disputing CATSA and the Minister of Transport\u2019s assertion that the CCTV footage is \u201cprivileged\u201d, and reiterating her request for disclosure.\nIII. Issue\n[25] The main issue before me is to determine what is the appropriate procedure for consideration of the production or discovery of a security measure pursuant to s. 4.79(2) of the Act?\n[26] As I noted above, there is very little reported case law considering the application of s. 4.79 of the Act.\n[27] Given the importance of the interests that must be weighed pursuant to the scheme contemplated by the Act, I believe that careful consideration of the correct procedure is warranted.\n[28] The precise wording of the relevant provisions of the Act are central to my reasons, and so I will reproduce s. 4.79 in its entirety here:\n4.79 (1) Unless the Minister states under subsection 4.72(3) that this subsection does not apply in respect of a security measure, no person other than the person who made the security measure shall disclose its substance to any other person unless the disclosure is required by law or is necessary to give effect to the security measure.\n(2) If, in any proceedings before a court or other body having jurisdiction to compel the production or discovery of information, a request is made for the production or discovery of any security measure, the court or other body shall, if the Minister is not a party to the proceedings, cause a notice of the request to be given to the Minister, and, in camera, examine the security measure and give the Minister a reasonable opportunity to make representations with respect to it.\n(3) If the court or other body concludes in the circumstances of the case that the public interest in the proper administration of justice outweighs in importance the public interest in aviation security, the court or other body shall order the production or discovery of the security measure, subject to any restrictions or conditions that the court or other body considers appropriate, and may require any person to give evidence that relates to the security measure.\nA. The Minister of Transport\u2019s Submissions\n[29] Counsel for the Minister of Transport submits that although the Act expressly prescribes an in camera hearing, the hearing must also be conducted on an ex parte basis in order to prevent the disclosure of security measures protected by that Act.\n[30] In support of his argument, the Minister relies upon two related decisions in re CUPE and Air Canada (File nos. 2015-29; 2015-30; Ruling dated August 10, 2016, Ruling dated December 15, 2016), a proceeding conducted before an Appeals Officer of the Occupational Health and Safety Tribunal Canada (the \u201cOHSTC\u201d). In that case, the Appeal Officer agreed with the Minister and Air Canada\u2019s submission that the confidentiality required by s. 4.79(1) of the Act would be frustrated if the proceeding contemplated by s. 4.79(2) were to be conducted in the presence of the parties. I note that in that case, it appears that CUPE was provided with redacted copies of the security measures in issue.\n[31] The Minister also cites a judgment rendered in the criminal case of R. v Herman, 2017 BCSC 241, in which the Court indicates that the s. 4.79(2) hearing was conducted in absence of the accused. The Minister submits that if such an exclusion can be permitted in a criminal proceeding (where the Constitution guarantees the right to make a full answer and defense), then it ought to be sufficient for the purposes of an inquiry under the Canadian Human Rights Act (the \u201cCHRA\u201d).\n[32] The re CUPE and Air Canada reasons also refer to two cases before the Canada Industrial Relations Board (the \u201cCIRB\u201d) that were relied upon by CUPE in their submissions to the Appeals Officer (see: Securiguard Services Ltd., 2005 CIRB 342, paras. 17-18; A.S.P Inc, 2006 CIRB 368, paras. 3-5). While neither of those cases were referred to in the Minister\u2019s submissions to this Tribunal, it appears from the Appeal Officer\u2019s reasons in re CUPE and Air Canada that in those cases, the disclosure hearings were not conducted on an ex parte basis.\nIV. Analysis\n[33] While a decision of the British Columbia Supreme Court that s. 4.79(2) requires a hearing to be held on an ex parte basis would represent a highly persuasive authority for this Tribunal, a close examination of the judgment rendered in R. v. Herman reveals that no such finding or determination was made in that case. The fact that a hearing was conducted on an ex parte basis does not represent a finding that it must be so.\n[34] With regard to the OHSTC\u2019s determination that s. 4.79(2) prescribes an ex parte hearing, I would observe that I am not bound by the finding of the Appeal Officer. For the reasons that follow, I must respectfully disagree with the Appeal Officer\u2019s conclusion, as a matter of statutory interpretation.\n[35] While I agree that s. 4.79(1) prohibits the disclosure of a security measure, that prohibition is a general one, and is qualified by the limitation \u201c\u2026unless the disclosure is required by law\u2026\u201d.\n[36] There is no dispute between the parties that the CCTV footage is arguably relevant to the Complaint and therefore, the production of this CCTV footage would be required by the CHRA and the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure in the context of this proceeding.\n[37] As such, the CCTV footage is not captured by the prohibition against disclosure in s. 4.79(1), but rather by the exception.\n[38] Therefore, the Minister\u2019s concern that the purpose of s. 4.79(1) would be frustrated by disclosure to the parties at a hearing in the context of subsection (2) that is not conducted on an ex parte basis, is addressed, because the prohibition in subsection (1) is not engaged on these facts.\n[39] This then brings us to a careful reading of s. 4.79(2), which is engaged where a request is made for production or discovery of a security measure in the context of a proceeding before a court or other body with the ability to order production or discovery of information.\n[40] The issues that must be considered and determined are:\nDoes the public interest in the proper administration of justice outweigh in importance the public interest in aviation security with regard to the production or discovery of the security measure; and\nin the event that production or discovery of a security measure is warranted on the facts of the specific case, what restrictions or conditions ought to attach to its disclosure.\n[41] Where (as in this case) the Minister is not already a party to the proceeding, the Minister must be given Notice of the request for production, and must be given a reasonable opportunity to make representations with respect to the security measure.\n[42] The statute explicitly provides that the court or other body must examine the security measure and hear the Minister\u2019s representations in camera.\n[43] The issue before me arises because the Minister has asserted that the hearing must also be conducted on an ex parte basis, that is to say without the parties to the Complaint being present or knowing what is being said.\n[44] As I advised the parties and the Minister in the Tribunal\u2019s letter of May 12, 2017, an ex parte hearing is an extraordinary derogation from the requirements of natural justice that must guide the proceedings before this Tribunal, as confirmed by s. 48.9(1) of the CHRA.\n[45] It is my view that these requirements of procedural fairness are even more acute when one party is representing herself, as is the case with Ms. Mahood.\n[46] The right to be heard is a well-established principle of natural justice. In light of, among other things, the nature of the decisions made by the Tribunal, the quasi-judicial nature of Tribunal proceedings, the importance of the rights and issues at stake, and the lack of an appeal from Tribunal decisions, the Tribunal goes to great lengths to ensure that these principles are given meaningful effect in our proceedings.\n[47] In order to justify a departure from the basic principle that all parties should have the opportunity to be heard on an issue that affects their rights, privileges or interests, there would have to be a very clear reason to do so, including, but not limited to Parliament having expressly provided for such a departure. What is more, in the absence of a specific legislative mandate, a court or tribunal ought to take care to ensure that such a departure impairs natural justice principles as minimally as possible.\n[48] In the case of the Act, there are three separate provisions where Parliament saw fit to provide for an ex parte proceeding:\ns. 4.5(2): the application for an order of seizure in the case of non-payment of interest or charges owed to the Minister;\ns. 8.7(5): an application for a warrant to enter a dwelling-house; and\ns. 14(4): an application for a search warrant relating to an investigation of a military-civilian occurrence.\n[49] In each case, the provision for an ex parte proceeding is expressly made by Parliament.\n[50] As a matter of statutory interpretation, the fact that Parliament expressly provided for an ex parte hearing in the three instances cited above, and not in the case of s. 4.79(2), indicates that it did not intend for the production or discovery hearing to be an ex parte proceeding.\n[51] While counsel to the Minister has argued that s. 4.79(2) prescribes an ex parte hearing, I see no evidence that Parliament intended to do so. Instead, a contextual reading of the provision in accordance with the ordinary sense of the language indicates that Parliament intended for the hearing to be conducted in camera, to protect against public disclosure of the security measure, but not in absence of the parties, unless there was another reason to do so based on the facts of the case.\n[52] The Act requires this Tribunal to afford the Minister a reasonable opportunity to make representations with respect to the security measure\u2014in this case the CCTV footage\u2014prior to making a decision on whether or not to order production or discovery. In the absence of urgency, necessity or any specific legislative intent evincing an ex parte hearing, I find that it would be unreasonable to require the Tribunal to exclude the parties from the s. 4.79(2) hearing.\n[53] On the circumstances of the case before me, the process established in s. 4.79 of the Act is as follows:\nWhere production or discovery of a security measure (as prescribed in the Act) is sought, Notice of the request shall be given to the Minister.\nOn reasonable Notice to the parties and to the Minister, an in camera hearing will be conducted at which:\nthe Minister is afforded a reasonable opportunity to make representations with regard to the security measure;\nthe security measure is reviewed by the Tribunal;\nthe parties have an opportunity to make submissions with regard to the security measure and public interest issues at stake;\nthe Tribunal must determine whether, in respect of the requested production or discovery of the security measure, the public interest in the proper administration of justice outweighs in importance the public interest in aviation security;\nif the Tribunal orders production or discovery of the security measure, the Tribunal must determine;\nwhat restrictions or conditions should be placed on its production or discovery; and\nwhether any person should be required to give evidence relating to the security measure.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, where and as appropriate, the Tribunal may hear evidence or submissions regarding the security measure on an ex parte basis.\nV. DISPOSITION\n[54] I therefore Order that:\nA hearing pursuant to s. 4.79(2) of the Aeronautics Act, shall be conducted in Ottawa, at a date and location to be fixed by the Registrar in consultation with the parties, and counsel to the Minister (the \u201cConfidentiality Hearing\u201d);\nPrior to the date of the Confidentiality Hearing, the Minister will make arrangements with the Registry Office for the Member to review the security measure;\nThe Confidentiality Hearing shall be conducted in camera, with any materials to be filed under seal;\nThe Minister shall advise the Registrar of any further security arrangements it seeks for the Confidentiality Hearing; and\nIn the event that the Minister seeks to have any part of its representations made on an ex parte basis, such request shall be made at the outset of the Confidentiality Hearing.\nSigned by\nKirsten Mercer\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nJune 21, 2017\n",

Ruling 19\nI. Background\n[1] This Decision determines a Motion for Dismissal filed by the City of Ottawa (the \u201cRespondent\u201d) on the basis of abuse of process. The Respondent has requested that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) dismiss the complaint of Cheryl Bezoine (the \u201cComplainant\u201d) on the basis that it is an abuse of process in light of a settlement of her labour grievance which addressed the same facts.\n[2] On August 10, 2009, the Complainant was hired by the Respondent as a spare Bus Operator after successfully completing a 6 week paid training program and participating in a nine (9) month probationary period.\n[3] During this probationary period the Complainant missed approximately 52 days of work. Some of these absences were deemed non culpable (9 days) and related to medical reasons, others were deemed culpable (8 days) and approximately 35 days related to a WSIB injury from a prior employer. The Complainant\u2019s probationary period was extended to accommodate her medical absences.\n[4] On June 22, 2010, prior to successful completion of the probationary period, the Complainant\u2019s employment was terminated. The stated reasons for her termination were \u201cfailure to provide regular and reliable attendance\u201d. The Complainant grieved the termination of her employment.\nA. The Grievance\n[5] The Complainant belongs to a union. Her employment is governed by a collective agreement between the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 279 (the \u201cUnion\u201d) and the Respondent.\n[6] On June 29, 2010, the Union filed a grievance on the Complainant\u2019s behalf asserting that the termination was \u201cunjust and unwarranted\u201d.\n[7] The grievance was referred to arbitration. A hearing was held April 6, May 24, and June 8, 2011 before Arbitrator Christine Schmidt. The Complainant provided sworn testimony in this hearing. There is no transcript of the evidence in this hearing.\n[8] In June 2011, the Respondent and Union settled the Complainant\u2019s grievance by an agreement that the termination be replaced with a resignation for the limited purposes of employment references and that a neutral reference be given to any employer inquiries. The Complainant initially agreed to the settlement on or about June 8, 2011, the last date of the hearing, and subsequently withdrew her agreement sometime before the Minutes of Settlement were executed on June 15, 2011. This withdrawal occurred within a week, suggesting due diligence on behalf of the Complainant.\n[9] Minutes of Settlement were executed on June 15, 2011 on the following terms:\n(\u2026)\nAND WHEREAS this grievance asserted that the termination as both wrongful and discriminatory within the meaning of the Canadian Human Rights Act\n(\u2026)\nAND WHEREAS the parties, including the grievor, following the closing of the Union\u2019s case and a discussion with Arbitrator Schmidt agreed to a settlement of her grievance and a settlement of her outstanding human rights complaint currently before the Canadian Human Rights Commission;\nAND WHEREAS the grievor has subsequently advised the Union that she no longer wished to settle either her grievance of her human rights complaint;\nAND WHEREAS the Union, in the interest of good and harmonious labour relations, is not prepared to continue to litigate a grievance that had been resolved;\nNOW THEREFORE the parties agree as follows:\nThe termination of the grievor, Cheryl Bezoine, for the limited purposes of her employment record and for any references to future employers is hereby withdrawn and replaced with a resignation effective the same date.\nThe grievor should be given a neutral reference by the City of Ottawa in regards to any future employers.Specifically, any employers who enquire in regards to the grievor shall be advised only of the dates of her employment, the nature of her duties and that she resigned her employment with the City as of June 24, 2010.\nThe parties agree that the evidence put before Arbitrator Schmidt canvassed the issue of disability and whether or not the grievor had been discriminated against by the City contrary to the provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Code.\nThe parties agree that nothing in these Minutes of Settlement precludes or restricts the City from offering any defence to the complaint filed by the grievor with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\nIn consideration of paragraph 1 and 2 above, the Union agrees to withdraw the grievance #T-65-10 dated June 29, 2010.\nThe Minutes of Settlement were appended to the Commission\u2019s motion materials. No parties raised issues with regards to confidentiality.\n[10] Although the Minutes of Settlement state that the grievance asserted the termination was both wrongful and discriminatory, there is no reference in the grievance form to human rights concerns.\n[11] The Minutes of Settlement also note that the grievor \u201chas subsequently advised the Union that she no longer wished to settle either her grievance or her human rights complaint\u201d.\n[12] The Minutes of Settlement also state that evidence of the issue of disability and discrimination was put before the arbitrator and canvassed by the Arbitrator:\n3. The parties agree that the evidence put before Arbitrator Schmidt canvassed the issue of disability and whether or not the grievor had been discriminated against by the City contrary to the provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Code.\n[13] The Minutes of Settlement also note that nothing therein prevents the City from offering a defence to the human rights complaint:\n4. The parties agree that nothing in these Minutes of Settlement precludes or restricts the City from offering any defence to the complaint filed by the grievor with the Canadian Human Rights Code.\n[14] Because the matter was settled at arbitration, the arbitrator did not issue a final decision on the issue of whether or not the Respondent discriminated against the Complainant on the basis of her disability or any other matter. There is no evidence that a decision was reached on this issue.\nB. The Human Rights Complaint\n[15] On August 20, 2010, approximately one month after filing the grievance, the Complainant filed a human rights complaint alleging that her employment was terminated because of disability related absences.\n[16] The original complaint sets out the following alleged practices of discrimination:\n\u00b7 Adverse Differential Treatment (Failure to Accommodate)\n\u00b7 Termination of Employment\n\u00b7 Discriminatory Policy or Practice\n[17] On September 8, 2011, the Respondent requested that the complaint be dismissed pursuant to section 41(1)(d) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) on the basis that the issues raised in the complaint had been dealt with in the grievance process.\n[18] On December 8, 2011, the Commission issued a section 40\/41 report recommending that the Commission deal with the complaint pursuant to section 41(1) of the Act because it was not satisfied that the other process had addressed the allegations of discrimination.\n[19] On December 22, 2011, the Respondent acknowledged in written submissions that the settlement did not prevent the Complainant from proceeding with her human rights complaint.\n[20] On February 17, 2012, the Commission adopted the section 40\/41 report and advised the parties that they had 30 days to judicially review the decision. Neither party filed for judicial review of this decision.\n[21] On June 23, 2014, the Respondent filed a Statement of Particulars claiming that the complaint was an abuse of process as a result of the settlement of the grievance. The Respondent objected to the hearing of this matter alleging it was an abuse of process.\n[22] The Tribunal determined that argument on this issue should follow the hearing of evidence and that the motion could not be dealt with on a preliminary basis.\n[23] A hearing into the human rights complaint was held in November 2015. At that time the Complainant gave evidence about the nature of her grievance and the circumstances of the arbitration, including testimony that her absenteeism was related to a \u201cfeminine problem\u201d and that other matters that she considered were disabilities were raised during the course of the arbitration hearing.\n[24] The Respondent reserved its right to bring this motion to dismiss the complaint in its opening statement. No objection was raised.\n[25] On November 5, 2015 after the Complainant\u2019s testimony, but before any other witnesses were called, the Respondent requested that the claim be dismissed based on settlement of the grievance.\n[26] On December 4, 2015, the Respondent filed its motion to dismiss the complaint.\ni.) Respondent\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the Complaint\n[27] The Respondent submits that the complaint should be dismissed because it would amount to an abuse of process to proceed given the settlement of the Complainant\u2019s grievance.\nii.) Commission\u2019s Position on the Motion to Dismiss\n[28] The Commission submits that the motion to dismiss is unfounded because:\na) The arbitration process did not result in a final decision determining whether or not the Respondent discriminated against Ms. Bezoine on the basis of disability;\nb) The settlement between the Respondent and the Union did not resolve Ms. Bezoine\u2019s human rights allegations;\nc) Ms. Bezoine is not a party to the said settlement; and\nd) The Respondent already conceded before the Commission that the settlement between the Union and the Respondent did not prevent Ms. Bezoine from proceeding with her complaint.\niii.) Complainant\u2019s Position on the Motion to Dismiss\n[29] The Complainant has adopted the submission of the Commission.\nII. Issues\n[30] Does the Tribunal have the power to decide issues that could result in a dismissal of a human rights complaint without conducting a full hearing on the merits of the complaint?\n[31] If so, should the complaint of Cheryl Bezoine be dismissed as an abuse of process based on the settlement of a labour grievance between the Respondent and the Union?\nIII. The Law\n[32] After analyzing the relevant evidence and applicable case law, I have concluded that the Tribunal has the power to decide issues that could result in a dismissal of a human rights complaint at an interlocutory stage without a full hearing and have decided not to allow the Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss for the reasons set out below.\nA. Does the Tribunal have the power to decide issues that could result in a dismissal of a human rights complaint without conducting a full hearing on the merits of the complaint?\n[33] Section 50(2) of the Act states:\nIn the course of hearing and determining any matter under inquiry, the member or panel [of the Tribunal] may decide all questions of law or fact necessary to determining the matter.\n[34] I conclude that this section is broad enough that the Tribunal can decide questions of its own jurisdiction.\n[35] In Canada (Human Rights Commission) v Canada Post (re Cremasco), 2004 FC 81 at paras. 14-15 the Federal Court concluded that the Tribunal is a \u2018master of its own procedure\u2019 and may dismiss a matter without a full hearing on the basis of abuse of process:\n15 It strikes me as evidence that one cannot maintain that the Tribunal to(sic) is the \u2018master of its own house\u2019 if it cannot protect its own process from abuse.\n...\n18 Finally, it is hard to fathom a reason why it would be in anyone\u2019s interest to have the Tribunal hold a hearing in cases where it considers that such a hearing would amount to an abuse of its process.\n19 Accordingly, I find that there is no bar in either the case law or in the statute preventing the Tribunal from dismissing by way of a preliminary motion on the grounds of abuse of its process a matter referred to it by the Commission, always assuming there are valid grounds to do so.\n[36] While this dealt with a preliminary motion, I have no reason to conclude that the same cannot be said of a motion brought at an interlocutory stage.\n[37] In First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, 2012 FC 445, the Federal Court noted that while the Tribunal can dismiss a complaint without a full hearing, this authority must be exercised \u201ccautiously\u201d and \u201conly in the clearest of cases\u201d:\n[140] I do, however, understand the Government to agree with the statement in Buffet that the Tribunal\u2019s power to dismiss a human rights complaint in advance of a full hearing on the merits should be exercised cautiously, and then only in the clearest of cases: above at para 39. I also agree with this statement.\n[38] Thus, I conclude that the Tribunal has the power to decide issues that could result in a dismissal of a human rights complaint without conducting a full hearing on the merits of the complaint. This would include a decision at an interlocutory stage. I note however that, as stated by the Federal Court in First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, this authority must be exercised cautiously and only in the clearest of cases.\n[39] As discussed more fully below, I am not persuaded that this is one of the \u201cclearest of cases\u201d.\nB. Should the complaint of Cheryl Bezoine be dismissed as an abuse of process based on the settlement of a labour grievance between the Respondent and the Union?\n[40] Briefly, the doctrine of abuse of process precludes relitigation in circumstances where the strict requirements of issue estoppel (typically the privity\/mutuality requirements) are not met, but where allowing the litigation to proceed would nonetheless violate such principles as:\njudicial economy;\nconsistency;\nfinality; and\nthe integrity of the administration of justice\n(see para 37 of Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79, 2003 SCC 63 (\u201cCUPE\u201d), see also Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada Post Corp., 2004 FC 81, aff\u2019d in Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canada Post Corp., 2004 FCA 363 (\u201cCremasco\u201d)).\ni.) Have the strict requirements of issues estoppel been met?\n[41] Although not required, when considering abuse of process by relitigation, assessing the pre-conditions of issue estoppel can assist the Tribunal in completing its analysis for same. The pre-conditions of issue estoppel are as follows:\n[45] In Danyluk, the Supreme Court outlined the principles of finality underlying the doctrine of issue estoppel and reiterated the three pre-conditions for its operations:\n(...)\n25. The preconditions to the operation of issue estoppel were set out by Dickson, J., in Angle, supra, at p. 254:\n(1) that the same question has been decided;\n(2) that the judicial decision which is said to create the estoppel was final; and\n(3) that the parties to the judicial decision or their privies were the same persons as the parties to the proceedings in which the estoppel is raised or their privies.\n[46] The Court also stated that issue estoppel must be assessed under a two-step analysis. The first step requires the court or the tribunal to determine whether the three pre-conditions are met. If the conditions are met, the decision maker must then, as a second tier, determine as a matter of discretion whether the doctrine should be applied in the specific circumstances of the case (\u2026).\n[see Murray v. Canada, 2014 FC 139]\n(a) Has the same question been decided\n[42] The grievance form states that the termination was unjust and unwarranted but makes no reference to human rights, accommodation or discrimination in either a policy or practice:\nDetails of the Grievance\nGrieving the City of Ottawa\u2019s termination of this Employee\u2019s employment as being unjust and unwarranted.\n[43] The Minutes of Settlement state that the grievance asserted that the termination was both wrongful and discriminatory within the meaning of the Act.\nAND WHEREAS this grievance asserted that the termination was both wrongful and discriminatory within the meaning of the Canadian Human Rights Act\n[44] The Minutes of Settlement note that the parties agreed that there was evidence put before and canvassed by Arbitrator Schmidt on the issue of disability and discrimination under the Act:\n3. The parties agree that the evidence put before Arbitrator Schmidt canvassed the issue of disability and whether or not the grievor had been discriminated against by the City contrary to the provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Code.\n[45] There is no reference in the settlement to accommodation or whether the issue of whether the Respondent has a discriminatory policy or practice was decided.\n[46] While the Minutes of Settlement note that the evidence put before the arbitrator canvassed the issue of disability, I have no evidence before me that there was a decision reached on this issue. There is also no reference in the Minutes of Settlement as to whether or not discrimination occurred or to the withdrawal of the human rights complaint. Furthermore there is no reference to public interest remedies or whether the issue of the Respondent\u2019s policies or practices were considered. There is also no reference to accommodation.\n[47] As such I find that there is no evidence that it is the same question put before the Tribunal namely, whether or not discrimination occurred, whether the Respondent accommodated the Complainant and\/or whether there was a discriminatory practice or policy in place, which was decided in the arbitration hearing. At best, I have evidence that discrimination was canvassed and that the matter of the characterization of the termination of the Complainant\u2019s employment was settled by agreement between the Respondent and the Union. This is but one of the alleged practices of discrimination set out in the complaint.\n(b) Was the judicial decision that is said to create the estoppel final\n[48] Finality requires consideration of whether proceeding with the complaint would bring into question the finality of another decision. This case was settled by way of an agreement between the Union and the Respondent. There was no judicial decision.\n[49] Many of the authorities referred to by the Respondent, including Dunn v. Sault Ste. Marie (City), 2008 HRTO 149 (\u201cDunn\u201d) reference s. 45.1 of the Ontario Human Rights Act. This is significant as the wording of that provision refers to a matter being \u201cappropriately dealt with\u201d rather than using more narrow wording such as \u201cdecision\u201d that would imply that there has been adjudication of the matter. This fact, and its significance, was noted by the HRTO at paragraph 37 of the decision:\n[37] I will deal first with whether a settlement of a matter commenced before a different tribunal may be a \u201cproceeding\u201d that has \u201cdealt with the substance\u201d of the complaints within the meaning of the section. I find that s. 45.1 may apply to settlements of proceedings under other statutory schemes. This conclusion is supported by both the wording and the purposes of s. 45.1. The provision refers to a \u201cproceeding\u201d having \u201cdealt with\u201d the matter, rather than using narrower words that would only encompass adjudication like \u201cdecision\u201d or \u201creasons\u201d....\n[50] The Dunn case was decided specifically with reference to s. 45.1 of the Ontario Code. This legislation deals with language that is both specific and broad. However, s. 45.1 of Ontario\u2019s Code is not relevant to the present case; the Code does not grant any analogous authority to the Federal Tribunal. As such we rely upon common law doctrines of finality.\n[51] The arbitration in this case was concluded by execution of Minutes of Settlement on June 15, 2011. This settlement was reached by the Respondent and the Union. Although there is no argument that the Union has authority to effect a settlement of a grievance, it is worthy of note that the Complainant is not a party to the Minutes of Settlement. The Minutes of Settlement are not a judicial decision on the matter and provide no indication that a decision was reached on discriminatory policies, practices or the failure to accommodate, all of which are alleged in the complaint.\n[52] The Minutes of Settlement make no mention of a decision on the question of whether or not the Respondent discriminated against the Complainant on the basis of an alleged disability contrary to the Act, whether there was a failure to accommodate and\/or whether there was a discriminatory policy or practice in place, all of which are questions before the Tribunal in this complaint.\n[53] Further, the Minutes of Settlement do not contain a waiver and release of the Complainant\u2019s right to proceed with a human rights complaint. In the absence of such a clause, it appears that the Respondent is asking the Tribunal to infer a waiver of the Complainant\u2019s quasi-constitutional rights. This is not in keeping with the interpretive principles associated with human rights legislation.\n[54] The issue before the Tribunal is whether there was discrimination. The arbitration deals with the termination of the complainant\u2019s employment and makes no reference to conclusions on the human rights issues raised before the Tribunal. While the characterization of the termination may be an issue that is discussed, the focus of the proceeding will be on human rights issues, injury to the complainant\u2019s dignity as a result of these issues and discriminatory policies or practices. None of these factors were addressed in the Minutes of Settlement. Human rights issues have not been addressed with finality by the Minutes of Settlement.\n(c) Are the parties to the judicial decision or their privies the same persons as the parties to the proceedings in which the estoppel is raised or their privies\n[55] In order for there to be a finding of estoppel, the parties to each proceeding must be the same. In this case the parties to the arbitration are the Union and the Respondent. The parties before the Tribunal are the Complainant, the Commission and the Respondent. The Complainant was not a party to the Minutes of Settlement and the Union is not a party to the human rights proceeding.\n[56] Based on the above assessment, I conclude that the Respondent has failed to meet the three requirements for issue estoppel in that the there is no final decision on the matter before the Tribunal, there is no evidence that the questions before the Tribunal are the same as those before the arbitrator and the parties are not the same parties in the proceedings.\n[57] Although the Respondent would fail on a motion to dismiss on the basis of issue estoppel, as previously noted, in situations where a strict application of issue estoppel does not apply, the courts may turn to the doctrine of abuse of process by relitigation.\nii.) Principles applicable to abuse of process\n(a) Judicial Economy\n[58] Judicial economy requires a consideration of whether it would be a waste of public resources to proceed with a complaint. This is not the case in the present matter. There is no indication in the Minutes of Settlement that the complainant\u2019s human rights issues have been addressed through the arbitration process. As such, it would not be a duplicate proceeding or be a waste of resources to consider something which it is not clear has been properly addressed.\n(b) Consistency\n[59] Consistency requires consideration of whether a finding before the Tribunal on human rights issues would create inconsistent results with the previous settlement\/decision. In this case, the Minutes of Settlement only address the characterization of the termination and not the human rights issues. Therefore, it is unlikely that there will be an issue with respect to consistency if the matter is allowed to proceed. Should there be any issues with respect to remedies or a potential for double recovery, this may be addressed at the remedies stage of the hearing.\n(c) Finality\n[60] Inquiring into the complaint would not question the finality of another decision since there is no judicial decision. While the Union and the Respondent did execute Minutes of Settlement and have an expectation of finality, such expectation is limited to the proceeding that was terminated and the terms of those Minutes of Settlement. The Complainant in this case withdrew her support for the settlement prior to finalizing. While the Minutes of Settlement reflect that there was intent by the Respondent and the Union to resolve the complaint, they also note that the Complainant did not agree with the settlement and referenced that the Respondent may provide a defence to the human rights complaint. While the Union has authority to settle the grievance over the objection of the Complainant, withdrawal of her human rights complaint cannot occur without her consent. The Minutes of Settlement clearly state that the Complainant did not agree with the settlement and furthermore contemplated a continuation of the human rights complaint when stating that nothing in the settlement \u201c...precludes or restricts the City from offering any defence to the complaint filed by the grievor with the Canadian Human Rights Commission\u201d.\n[61] I find that the human rights issues have not been addressed with finality and as such, proceeding to a hearing on the issues would not question the finality of another judicial decision.\n(d) Integrity to the Administration of Justice\n[62] The Tribunal is established to assist parties with their human rights issues and the Act is remedial in nature. The complainant in this case is seeking to have her human rights issues addressed and remedied. The Minutes of Settlement as drafted foresee or anticipate a human rights complaint. It is therefore unlikely given how this settlement document was drafted that the integrity or administration of justice would be affected if this matter proceeds.\n[63] It is also important to note the comments of the Court in Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission) 2000 SCC 44. The Court concluded that for there to be an abuse of process the proceedings must be \u201cunfair to the point that they are contrary to the interests of natural justice\u201d:\n[120] In order to find an abuse of process, the court must be satisfied that, \u201cthe damage to the public interest in the fairness of the administrative process should the proceeding go ahead would exceed the harm to the public interest in the enforcement of the legislative proceedings were halted (Brown and Evans, supra, at p 9-68). According to L\u2019Heureux-Dube J. in Power, supra, at p. 616 \u201cabuse of process has been characterized in the jurisprudence as a process tainted to such a degree that it amounts to one of the clearest cases. In my opinion, this would apply equally to abuse of process in administrative proceedings. For there to be abuse of process, the proceedings must, in the words of L\u2019Heureux-Dube J., be \u201cunfair to the point that they are contrary to the interests of justice\u201d (p.616). \u201cCases of this nature will be extremely rare\u201d...\n[64] I am not convinced that in the circumstances of this case proceeding with this hearing would result in a process that is unfair to the point it is contrary to the interests of justice. While the issue of termination of employment has been considered and the issue of discrimination has been \u201ccanvassed\u201d, there is no evidence that all of the allegations in the complaint have been addressed or considered. As such, I find it would not put the integrity of the administration of justice into disrepute to move forward with the hearing and consider the human rights issues.\niii.) Fairness\n[65] The Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s (the \u201cCourt:)\u201d decision in CUPE, supra, remains a leading decision regarding abuse of process. In CUPE, the Court explains that the discretionary factors for fairness that apply to prevent the doctrine of issue estoppel from operating in an unjust or unfair way are equally available to prevent the doctrine of abuse of process from achieving a similar undesirable result (see para 53 of CUPE).\n[66] As such, when considering the question of whether to dismiss a complaint on the basis of issue estoppel or abuse of process, it is necessary to consider the issue of fairness.\n[67] The Court has recognized the importance of finality doctrines in two recent decisions: British Columbia (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) v. Figliola, 2011 SCC 52 (\u201cFigliola\u201d) (Can LII) and Penner v. Niagara (Regional Police Services Board), 2013 SCC 19 (\u201cPenner\u201d) (Can LII).\n[68] Briefly, Penner addresses the common law doctrine of issue estoppel. In particular, the Court dealt with an attempt to bar further proceedings on the basis of a previous administrative decision where the complainant was not a party and had limited participation, if any, in the administrative process. Whereas in Figliola, the Court dealt with provincial legislation that expressly empowered the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal to summarily dismiss a complaint that had been appropriately dealt with in another proceeding. The majority found that the provision in the British Columbia Human Rights Code was not limited to issue estoppel, but incorporated all of the principles underlying the common law doctrines of finality, including res judicata, abuse of process, collateral attack and issue estoppel. No analogous provision of the Act is in issue in the current matter.\n[69] I find that both Penner and Figliola provide guidance in determining and assessing finality doctrines such as abuse of process, but I agree with the Commission\u2019s submission that the determination of whether a complaint is an abuse of process by relitigation in the face of a settlement or final decision is ultimately fact-driven.\n[70] In Penner, the Court considered the issue of fairness at length. The Court concluded that the assessment of whether a second proceeding should continue must consider the procedural fairness of the first proceeding and decide if it would be fair to use the first proceeding to stop the second.\n[71] In this case I am not convinced that fairness will result if the motion to dismiss is granted. There is no evidence in this case that the Complainant\u2019s human rights concerns were resolved in the previous or first hearing or that all of the alleged practices of discrimination as set out in the complaint were considered. There is reference that some of these issues were \u201ccanvassed\u201d at the arbitration hearing however there is no evidence in the Minutes of Settlement to indicate that there was a decision reached on any of these issues. The Minutes of Settlement reference a removal of the word \u201ctermination\u201d from the Complainant\u2019s employment record for the limited purpose of future employment inquiries and replacement with resignation as well as provision of a limited employment reference. Neither of these remedies references a finding, or lack thereof, of discrimination or the complainant\u2019s human rights complaints of failure to accommodate and discriminatory policies or practices were specifically considered. There is no evidence that all of the alleged practices of discrimination have been addressed in the settlement.\n[72] While the Complainant may not be required to agree with the outcome of the settlement for it to be a bar to a second proceeding on the matter, it is relevant to note that the settlement, which the Complainant explicitly rejected, precluded her from having a final decision by an arbitrator on the issue of discrimination in the workplace.\n[73] This Decision does not diminish the importance of finality in settlements in the workplace. In the case of Dunn the Tribunal noted the importance of settlements in a unionized workplace:\nThe importance of final and binding settlements in the unionized workplace is articulated in the purposes of the LRA, which include \u201cto promote the expeditious resolution of workplace disputes.\u201d The importance of binding agreements was articulated by the OLRB in TRW Automotive (Kelsey-Hayes Canada Ltd) [2000] OLRB Rep. July\/Aug. 731 at para 14:\nParties are entitled to rely on agreements freely entered into. Nothing would be more disruptive to orderly labour relations than to permit parties to revoke agreements among employees, their trade union, and their employer into which parties have entered to settle disputes or potential disputes.\nThis is true of human rights disputes, in whatever social area they arise. There is a strong public interest in ensuring that when parties freely choose to resolve the substance of a human rights dispute, in whatever forum it is brought, the matter is at an end. This is a fundamental principle that should guide the Tribunal in the interpretation of s. 45.1, because to do otherwise could make the finality of settlements highly uncertain.\n[74] While recognizing the importance of binding settlements in the workplace, after analyzing the relevant statutory provisions and applicable case law in this case, the Tribunal has decided not to allow the Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss for abuse of process.\n[75] Allowing the complaint to proceed does not amount to an abuse of process because there is no evidence that the settlement resolved the complainant\u2019s human rights allegations. The grievance process did not result in a final decision on the alleged practices of discrimination as set out in the complaint but rather resulted in a settlement on the issue of how the termination would be characterized to future employers. There is no evidence of an agreement to withdraw the human rights complaint. This may be due to the fact that the grievor had advised the Union that she did not wish to settle her grievance or human rights complaint and was not a party to the settlement agreement. However, regardless of the reason, not only was a withdrawal of the complaint not referenced, there is specific reference to the Respondent\u2019s ability to mount a defence to this claim. This would indicate that the parties had turned their mind to this matter and were cognizant of the fact that this complaint would proceed after settlement of the grievance. I am not convinced that the parties intended the resolution of the grievance to result in the end of this complaint. On plain reading, the Minutes of Settlement contemplate that the human rights complaint will continue and make specific reference to a defence opportunity for the Respondent in the continuation of the complaint.\n[76] Furthermore, while the Minutes of Settlement makes reference to the settlement of the human rights complaint, there is also reference that the Complainant did not wish to settle either the grievance or the complaint at the time of settlement. Assuming without deciding, even if the Union had the authority to decide to waive or extinguish the complainant\u2019s rights to pursue a human rights claim under the Act, that intention is not reflected in the Minutes of Settlement. Based on the language of the Minutes of Settlement, it does not appear that a decision was reached as to whether or not discrimination occurred but merely that a settlement was reached to end the grievance process.\n[77] For these reasons I conclude that the Respondent has not established that the Tribunal should dismiss the complaint pursuant to this Motion.\nC. Should the complainant have sought judicial review of the Minutes of Settlement, or gone to the labour board for Duty of Fair Representation rather than bringing this matter before the Tribunal?\n[78] Finally, I note that the Respondent argues that the complainant ought to have sought judicial review of the Minutes of Settlement, or gone to the labour board for Duty of Fair Representation, rather than proceeding with this complaint before the Tribunal. I respectfully disagree.\n[79] It is unclear to me how the Complainant could seek judicial review of the Minutes of Settlement since she is not a party to same, and it is not clear how this would be a reviewable final decision.\n[80] The Respondent has also argued that the Complainant ought to have gone to the labour board if she was unhappy with the Union\u2019s decision to sign the Minutes of Settlement, not the Commission. Again, I respectfully disagree.\n[81] In Kelsh v. Canadian Pacific Railway, 2014 CHRT 36, the Tribunal explains as follows:\n[26] Parliament therefore specifically vested the Commission with the authority and responsibility to exercise the discretion to decide whether to \u201cdeal with any complaint filed with it\u201d, subject to the grounds in 41(1)(a) and the subsections following it.\n[27] Parliament did not give that authority to the Tribunal \u2013 otherwise, that authority would be in the Act, as in Harkin, supra, at paras. 21 and 22.\n[28] Further, Parliament did not authorize the Tribunal to be a second screening authority \u2013 that is not the scheme envisioned in the Act.\n[29] If a party is not satisfied with the way the Commission has exercised its discretion under subsection 41(1)(a), that party has recourse by way of an application to the Federal Court for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision.\n[82] Similarly, in the present case, the argument that the Complainant ought to have sought relief elsewhere would be more appropriately brought before the Commission.\nIV.

Background 1\nII. Analysis 1\nIII. Order 5\nI. Background\n[1] The Complainant has brought forth a Notice of Motion dated May 24, 2017 seeking:\nTo adjourn the decision making to continue proceedings, as per section 3.1.b of the CHRT Rules of procedure; and reconsideration for a \u201cre-do\u201d Tribunal hearing including 30 % amendment of inadmissible evidence tabs and have Commission participate in hearing; and\nAn order to amend Final Argument within 45 \u2013 60 days in writing only; and\nAn order to file confidential Exhibit R-1, Tab 30 into a privileged lock box, and;\nOr such further and other order as shall seem just to the Tribunal.\n[2] The Respondent has filed a response to the Motion on June 6, 2017. The Respondent has replied to the Complainant\u2019s pleadings in opposition to the requests of the Motion, but has also \u201cconsented to the Complainant filing reply submissions in writing provided that they are limited to and based solely on the evidence heard by the Tribunal and that the Respondent be given an opportunity to file written representations in response to the Complainant\u2019s Reply.\u201d\n[3] The Complainant has filed a reply to the Respondent\u2019s response on June 19, 2017.\nII. Analysis\n[4] I have reviewed the Complainant\u2019s submissions, and with respect, find that many of the issues raised by the Complainant are as a result of her perception that the Respondent\u2019s counsel conducted the Hearing in a manner which was disrespectful of the Complainant, unsympathetic to her health issues, and that she deliberately tried to interrupt and take advantage of her knowledge of the Rules of Procedure, and conduct of a Hearing over that of a lay person, and more importantly, an unrepresented party suffering with mental disorders.\n[5] As a matter of first instance, the Tribunal states in the strongest of terms that this belief of the Complainant is completely unfounded. Without implying as to the success or failure of the Respondent\u2019s case, I can quite clearly state that the Tribunal finds that counsel for the Respondent, conducted herself with professionalism and respect to both the Tribunal and the Complainant. I formally dismiss any allegations to the contrary made by the Complainant as without merit; the Tribunal will not consider such allegations as part of its decision making. Therefore, all references throughout the Complainant\u2019s Notice of Motion and reply submissions which are derogatory to the Respondent\u2019s counsel, or to the manner in which she conducted her client\u2019s defense, shall be struck.\n[6] However, the Tribunal did attempt to be abundantly considerate of the fact that the Complainant was not represented by counsel, and notwithstanding an impressive attempt to adequately prepare herself for the Hearing, Ms. O\u2019Grady nevertheless, as most if not all unrepresented Complainants discover, was in a forum that was completely unfamiliar, and perhaps all the more difficult due to her health issues. However, while there is an obligation to allow all parties to have an opportunity to fully present their case, the Complainant cannot use her health issues to afford her special privileges, in re-opening the Hearing. She has not claimed the discovery of new evidence, not formally available to her at the time of the Hearing.\n[7] The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) (the \u201cCHRT Rules\u201d) are unlike the rules of procedure in civil courts. The CHRT Rules are intended to be far more simplified, in part to compensate the party who stands without legal counsel and enable a full Hearing, notwithstanding that they may at times appear to be contrary to a learned counsel accustomed to appearing before the highest courts of our land.\n[8] Ms. O\u2019Grady states that she is bringing the motion to adjourn the decision-making and \u201creconsideration for a \u2018re-do\u2019 Tribunal hearing including 30% amendment of inadmissible Evidence Tabs and have Commission participate in hearing\u201d in accordance with Rule 3.1 (b) of the CHRT Rules of Procedure.\n[9] While Rule 3.1 (b) provides for motions for an adjournment during the Hearing process, I would agree that this permits the Complainant\u2019s Motion to be brought prior to the decision on the merits being rendered. However, it is my opinion that this Rule, nor any other rule of procedure of the CHRT, permits a completed Hearing to be re-opened and continued to adduce evidence and claims which were dealt with at the Hearing, and ruled inadmissible by the Tribunal.\n[10] When arguments of admissibility of evidence were made, it was for the Tribunal to rule on the issue. Section 50(2) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) provides that the Tribunal may decide all questions of law or fact necessary to determining the matter. In addition, section 50(3)(e) permits the Tribunal to decide any procedural or evidentiary question arising during the Hearing.\n[11] Ms. O\u2019Grady does not raise any new evidence that was not previously available to the parties at the time of the Hearing. Rather, she wishes to argue or re-argue why some of the evidence ruled inadmissible should be reversed.\n[12] Accordingly, I will not make an Order to \u201cre-do\u201d or reopen the Hearing for the purpose of attempting to submit argument which is in effect an appeal of the Tribunal\u2019s ruling that the evidence was not admissible. The Complainant\u2019s first request under her Notice of Motion thereby fails.\n[13] In her initial request for the Motion, Ms. O\u2019Grady also included to \u201chave the Commission participate in hearing.\u201d The Canadian Human Rights Commission\u2019s (the \u201cCommission\u201d or \u201cCHRC\u201d) jurisdiction to appear at a Tribunal hearing is governed under section 51 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. That section states: \u201cIn appearing at a hearing, presenting evidence and making representations, the Commission shall adopt such position as in its opinion, is in the public interest having regard to the nature of the complaint.\u201d\n[14] The CHRC is an independent body from the CHRT. The Commission determines if it will participate at a Tribunal hearing in accordance with its mandate pursuant to section 51 of the Act. While the Tribunal gives notice to the Commission of the Hearing via the Notice of Hearing, which is sent to all parties to a Tribunal case, and shall invite the Commission (as with other parties, receiving notice of the Hearing), the right to appear at the Hearing. It is for the Commission to decide if it shall participate and, if so, to define the extent of its participation (full participation at the Hearing versus participation that is limited to the case management process without participation at the Hearing). In the present matter, the Commission advised the Tribunal, upon referring the Complaint, that it had elected to limit its participation to the case management process. While the Commission is free to reconsider its decision to participate at the Hearing at any point in the process, it has not done so in this case. The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to order the attendance of the Commission at any of its hearings.\n[15] Therefore, the Complainant\u2019s first request under her Motion is denied in all of its aspects.\n[16] The Complainant wishes to amend her final written submissions presented during Final Argument on May 9, 2017, and submit the same in writing within 60 days of my finding in this decision.\n[17] Section 50(1) of the Act provides that the complainant shall have a full and ample opportunity to put forward his or her case. Rule 1 of the CHRT Rules provides that the parties shall have a full and ample opportunity to be heard.\n[18] During the course of the Hearing, I believe that the Complainant was afforded this opportunity to be fully heard and to present her evidence. She has stated in her submissions in support of this Motion that at times she was much overcome with anxiety, which prevented her to fully participate. The Complainant argues that she was prevented in Final Argument, as a result of objections from Respondent counsel, from presenting new evidence, which evidence was either not submitted at the Hearing or ruled inadmissible.\n[19] However, there are ample decisions of the CHRT that endorse the principle that the parties are entitled to a full and complete Hearing.\n[20] As a result, I will permit the Complainant to refile her final written submissions, presented during Final Argument, within 60 days of the release of this decision. The Complainant is to limit her final written submissions to evidence accepted and argued at the Hearing, by either party. These final written submissions are not to be used as a tool to present new allegations, or statements which might otherwise be more appropriate for a Statement of Particulars (SOP). The Complainant is merely to deal with the evidence accepted at the Hearing. The Tribunal will then consider the Complainant\u2019s amended final written submissions and determine if the evidence is persuasive.\n[21] I further dismiss the Complainant\u2019s request to file the document found in Exhibit R-2, Tab 30 into a privileged lock box. The reasons stated by the Complainant in support thereof were either insufficient or not persuasive.\nIII. Order\n[22] Accordingly, I will make the following Order:\nThat the Complainant be entitled to amend her final written submissions, provided that they do not raise any fact or issue which was not submitted before me at the Hearing; that the argument is to be based on the evidence accepted by the Tribunal at the Hearing from either party; that it not form part of the Complainant\u2019s argument any derogatory remarks directed at Respondent counsel; and that they be submitted no later than 60 days from the date of this decision.\nThat the Respondent shall have 60 days after receipt of the Complainant\u2019s amended final written submissions, to also file amended final written submissions in response, should it wish to.\nThat both parties have 30 days to file a reply.\nThat no new evidence be presented, unless it bears directly on the Complainant\u2019s SOP or the Respondent\u2019s SOP and unless it was not available or known about at the time of the Hearing.\nSigned by\nRonald Sydney Williams\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nJune 28, 2017\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT2116\/3215\nStyle of Cause:\nKathleen O\u2019Grady v.

Introduction\n[1] This is a ruling on a motion by the Complainant, Amir Attaran, dated February 17, 2017, seeking to amend his complaint to add grounds of discrimination and to include an allegation of retaliation against the Respondent, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (\u201cIRCC\u201d) under section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c. H-6 (the \u201cAct\u201d).\n[2] The complaint against IRCC was filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCHRC\u201d or the \u201cCommission\u201d) on July 28, 2010. The complaint alleged that the significant delay in processing sponsorship applications for parents and grandparents, compared to other categories under the Family Class (as defined in the Regulations to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act S.C. 2001, c.27), was discriminatory, contrary to section 5 of the Act. The prohibited grounds of discrimination alleged were the age of the sponsored persons and\/or the family status of the sponsor, Mr. Attaran.\n[3] On February 22, 2012, the Commission decided that an inquiry into the complaint was not warranted. Mr. Attaran made an application to the Federal Court for a judicial review of the Commission\u2019s refusal to refer the complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d). The Federal Court dismissed his application and Mr. Attaran then appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal (\u201cFCA\u201d).\n[4] On February 3, 2015, the FCA allowed the appeal and referred the complaint back to the CHRC, on the basis that the CHRC had not adequately addressed the issue of IRCC\u2019s bona fide justification (Attaran v. Canada (A.G.), 2015 FCA 37).\n[5] Pursuant to section 44(3)(a) of the Act, on September 6, 2016, the Commission requested the Tribunal Chairperson to institute an inquiry into Mr. Attaran\u2019s complaint.\n[6] The parties to this matter submitted their Statements of Particulars (SOPs) in the normal course. However, in his Reply to the SOP of the Respondent, Mr. Attaran sought to amend his complaint to add the prohibited grounds of race, and national or ethnic origin. This request to amend was prompted by a specific passage in IRRC\u2019s SOP which addressed the notion of a \u201cnuclear family\u201d. In his Reply SOP, Mr. Attaran also sought to add an allegation of retaliation relating to comments made in the House of Commons Chamber by a Member of Parliament, the details of which had been particularized in his SOP.\n[7] Sections 3(1), 5 and 14.1 of the Act provide as follows:\n3(1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds* of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.\n[\u2026]\n5. It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\n(a) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\n(b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[\u2026]\n14.1 It is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim. [1]\n[8] The Complainant argues that the SOP of the Respondent contains an admission of stereotyping on the part of IRCC, which amounts to discrimination on the grounds of race and national or ethnic origin. Mr. Attaran cites paras. 30-32, which contain a reference to the \u201cnuclear family\u201d, described by the Respondent as \u201cspouses, partners and dependent children\u201d of a sponsor. Mr. Attaran characterizes the term \u201cnuclear family\u201d as a \u201cWestern stereotype\u201d because, in his view, it makes no allowance for the equally valid but non-Western cultural concept of an \u201cextended family\u201d which prevails in many other parts of the world. As such, he argues the adoption of this Western stereotype constitutes discrimination on the grounds of race and national or ethnic origin.\n[9] The retaliation complaint arises from comments made by a Member of Parliament, Paul Calandra, in the House of Commons Chamber on February 14, 2011. Mr. Calandra was sitting as a member of the Conservative Party of Canada, which happened to be the party of the Government at that time. The Official Report (Hansard) of the House of Commons Debates on that date records Mr. Calandra\u2019s comments as follows:\nMr. Speaker, Amir Attaran may have gone to Harvard with the Liberal leader, but that certainly does not make him better than the rest of us.\nEarlier today, Amir Attaran had to defend his private lawsuit to move his American parents\u2019 sponsorship application to the front of the line. Attaran is not asking for faster treatment for anyone else\u2019s parents, just for his own.\nAttaran is entitled, like everyone else, to sponsor his American parents into Canada, but they need to wait in line, just like my constituents do and just like the constituents of every member of the House.\nImmigration Canada considers sponsorship applications in the order in which they are received. Amir Attaran may think that because the Liberal leader was his mentor, because he went to Harvard, that makes him better than the rest of us.\nI have news for Mr. Attaran. He is not better than my constituents and his parents are not better than the 150,000 immigrants in the sponsorship queue or the historically high 280,000 immigrants our government welcomed to Canada in 2010.\nWhy will Amir Attaran\u2019s parents not wait in line like the rest of them, and why will they not join with\u00ad\u00ad-\n(House of Commons Debates, vol. 145, No. 130, 3rd Sess., 40th Parl., February 14, 2011, at p. 8104)\n[10] As they do not engage identical considerations, it is appropriate for the two different types of amendments in the Complainant\u2019s motion to be dealt with separately. In particular, the rule regarding allegations of retaliation can probably be seen as an exception to the general practice regarding amendments. Whereas the proposition to add new grounds of discrimination will be mainly focused on whether such amendment alters the substance of the original complaint, retaliation may arise from a completely different set of facts or circumstances. (See Cook v. Onion Lake First Nation, 2002 CanLII 61849 (CHRT), para. 20.) I will address first the part of the motion that seeks to add the new grounds of discrimination. I will then address the second part of the motion that seeks to add an allegation of retaliation.\nII. Parties\u2019 Positions on the Motion to add the Grounds of Race and National or Ethnic origin\nA. Complainant\u2019s Position\n[11] The Complainant\u2019s position is that:\n1. the additional grounds of discrimination arise from the same set of facts contained in the original complaint;\n2. the additional grounds are admitted by the Respondent in its SOP; and\n3. adding these grounds of discrimination would not prejudice the Respondent.\nB. Commission\u2019s Position\n[12] The Commission\u2019s position is that:\n1. the Tribunal has the authority to grant the relief sought by Mr. Attaran;\n2. the proposed new grounds of discrimination emanate from the same factual matrix as Mr. Attaran\u2019s initial complaint;\n3. the Respondent will not be prejudiced by this amendment, especially as the inquiry is still at its early stages;\n4. the Tribunal has a responsibility of determining whether a right has been infringed, and has the jurisdiction to do so even if the complaint is not formally amended; and\n5. the Complainant\u2019s position on the motion meets all of the requirements which have been established for such amendments according to previous decisions of the Tribunal.\nC. IRCC\u2019s Position\n[13] The Respondent essentially concedes at para. 32 of its submissions that the proposed amendments do arise from the same facts as the original complaint. However, the Respondent objects to the amendments for the following reasons:\n1. the additional grounds should not be added to the complaint because they have no prospect of success; and\n2. the allegations of discrimination based on a Western stereotype of the nuclear family cannot succeed because the term \u201cWestern\u201d is overly broad and does not identify any particular race or national or ethnic origin.\nIII. Law and Analysis (Amendment to Add Grounds)\n[14] The Tribunal has the authority to amend a complaint to add grounds of discrimination where there is a common thread linking the amendment to the original complaint, or a common factor underpinning both the new and the original allegations. (See Canada (Attorney General) v. Parent, 2006 FC 1313 (\u201cParent\u201d), paras. 41, 43).\n[15] The Tribunal is also guided by the Court\u2019s judgment in Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canadian Telephone Employees Association et al, 2002 FCT 776, at paras. 30-31:\n[30] The jurisprudence is clear that the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to amend complaints of discrimination. In Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, 1992 CanLII 81 (SCC), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970 as per Sopinka J. at pages 978 and 996, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that a Human Rights Commission can amend a deficient complaint to bring the complaint into conformity with the nature of the proceedings before the Tribunal. This can be done at any time during the proceedings.\n[31] This jurisprudence is echoed in the decisions of the Federal Court with respect to amendments to pleadings under Rule 75 of the Federal Court Rules, 1998. I refer to the case of Rolls Royce plc v. Fitzwilliam (2000), 2000 CanLII 16748 (FC), 10 C.P.R. (4th) 1 (F.C.T.D.), where Blanchard J. set outas a general rule that proposed amendments should be allowed where they do not result in prejudice to the opposing party:\n10 Although leave is discretionary, as a general rule a proposed amendment should be allowed in the absence of prejudice to the opposing party. As stated by D\u00e9cary J.A., speaking for the Federal Court of Appeal, in Canderel Ltd. v. Canada, 1993 CanLII 2990 (FCA), [1994] 1 F.C. 3 (F.C.A.) at p. 10]:\n. . . the general rule is that an amendment should be allowed at any stage of an action for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties, provided, notably, that the allowance would not result in an injustice to the other party not capable of being compensated by an award of costs and that it would serve the interests of justice.\n[16] Useful guidance may also be garnered from the judgment rendered in Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation v. P.S.A.C. (Local 70396), 2006 FC 704. Therein the Court acknowledged that when a complaint is before the CHRT, a proposed amendment could alter the allegations set out in the original complaint to such a degree that it amounts to a new subject of inquiry that has not been referred to the Tribunal by the Commission (para. 30). However, the extension, elaboration or clarification of a complaint is permitted where it does not take the complaint outside the scope of the referral, subject to any prejudice caused to the parties (paras. 40, 50). Complaints are open to refinement. Provided that the substance of the original complaint is respected, the complainant and CHRC are allowed to clarify and elaborate upon the initial allegations before the matter goes to a hearing (para. 52).\n[17] The allegations of discrimination based on the additional grounds of race and national or ethnic origin emanate from the same factual matrix as the initial complaint. The Complainant alleges that IRCC discriminated in the way it prioritized the processing of certain Family Class applications. The additional alleged grounds of discrimination arise from the Respondent\u2019s explanation of that prioritization. As such, there is a common factor underpinning both the family status allegation and the race and national or ethnic origin allegation: namely, the Respondent\u2019s prioritization of Family Class applications and the assumptions this prioritization is allegedly making about families of different origins. This is the common thread between the original complaint and the proposed amendment (See Parent, para. 43).\n[18] In my opinion, IRCC will not be prejudiced by the amendment to add the additional grounds of discrimination, as it will have ample time and opportunity prior to the hearing to respond to the new grounds raised. In addition, even with the amendment, the facts and events upon which the complaint is based remain those of which the Respondent has already been notified.\n[19] However, I share the concern of the Respondent that Mr. Attaran\u2019s use of the term \u201cWestern\u201d is overly broad. In order for the Respondent to fully know the case to be met in respect of these new additional grounds, further particularization will be necessary. For the foregoing reasons, and without pronouncing myself on the merits of the allegations, I will allow this part of the motion to add the grounds of race and national or ethnic origin, subject to the terms of my order at the end of this ruling.\nIV. Parties\u2019 Positions on the Motion to add the Allegation of Retaliation\nA. Complainant\u2019s Position\n[20] The Complainant\u2019s position is that:\n1. the event that he considers as retaliation occurred in 2011 and as such, the Respondent has been aware of it for a long time;\n2. he was attacked in Parliament because he once knew the then-leader of the Liberal Party, Michael Ignatieff, when they were at Harvard University together, and that made him a \u201clegitimate target of attack\u201d for filing a human rights complaint;\n3. he has a reasonable perception that the MP\u2019s statements were retaliation, and that based on jurisprudence, it is not necessary to prove that the act was intentionally retaliatory;\n4. retaliation is a serious allegation and should not be rejected at a preliminary stage of the inquiry; and\n5. the respondent would suffer no prejudice if the retaliation allegation was added.\nB. Commission\u2019s Position\n[21] The Commission\u2019s position is that:\n1. it is not clear that Mr. Calandra\u2019s statements can be said to amount to statements made by or on behalf of the Respondent, such that s. 14.1 of the Act is engaged;\n2. Parliamentary privilege, giving Parliamentarians freedom of speech for statements made in Parliament, may be an impediment to this part of the motion succeeding; and\n3. the allegation cannot be said to disclose a tenable claim of retaliation, unless Mr. Attaran can assert facts that demonstrate a plausible connection between Mr. Calandra\u2019s statement and the Respondent.\nC. IRCC\u2019s position\n[22] The Respondent\u2019s position is that:\n1. the allegation of retaliation should not be added to the complaint because it has no prospect of success;\n2. the allegation of retaliation has no factual nexus to the original complaint; and,\n3. the alleged acts of retaliation were not committed by IRCC and are not connected to IRCC in any way.\nV. Law and Analysis (Retaliation)\n[23] The guiding principles of Parent, discussed above, remain relevant in the context of motions to add an allegation of retaliation. In addition, in motions to amend the complaint to add an allegation of retaliation, the Tribunal has held that it is necessary to assess whether the allegations of retaliation are by their nature linked, at least by the complainant, to the allegations giving rise to the original complaint and disclose a tenable claim for retaliation (Virk v. Bell Canada, 2004 CHRT 10 (\u201cVirk\u201d), para. 7).\n[24] The Tribunal must also consider the prejudice that IRCC could suffer in allowing the Complainant to amend his complaint to allege retaliation. In Virk, supra, at para. 10, the Tribunal noted that the complainant in that case had clearly identified the facts upon which he relied to assert retaliation. Thus the respondent had proper knowledge and adequate notice of the case to be met with respect to allegations of retaliation, and could properly defend itself against them.\n[25] In determining whether the motion to amend the complaint should be granted, the Tribunal should not embark on a substantive review of the merits of the retaliation allegation at the time the amendment is sought (see Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2004 CHRT 2 (\u201cBressette\u201d) at para. 6). The merits of the allegations should be assessed after the hearing when the parties have had a full and ample opportunity to provide and make submissions.\n[26] Regarding the part of the motion to add retaliation, Mr. Attaran has not satisfied me that statements made by Mr. Calandra give rise to a tenable claim for retaliation. I acknowledge that the Complainant links Mr. Calandra\u2019s statement to the original human rights complaint, and that substantive review of this allegation is not appropriate at the amendment stage. Nonetheless, the obstacle the allegation faces is the principle of parliamentary privilege. The privilege of freedom of speech in parliamentary debates is one of the most important privileges enjoyed by Members of Parliament (See Michaud c. Bissonnette, 2006 QCCA 775 (\u201cMichaud\u201d), leave to appeal refused [2006] C.S.C.R. no 333] paras. 33, 46).\n[27] Parliamentary privilege is an important part of the general public law of Canada, inherited from the Parliament at Westminster by virtue of the Constitution Act, 1867 (UK), 30 & 31 Victoria, c 3, s. 18, and enacted by the Parliament of Canada Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. P-1. Section 4 of the Parliament of Canada Act prescribes that the Senate and the House of Commons and the members thereof each hold, enjoy and exercise all of the privileges held, enjoyed and exercised by the members of the British House of Commons at the time of Confederation. These include the parliamentary freedom of speech guaranteed by Article 9 of the British Bill of Rights of 1689. (See Canada (House of Commons) v. Vaid, 2005 SCC 30, para. 29, principles 3 and 10).\n[28] Freedom of speech protected by Parliamentary privilege allows Members to freely engage in democratic debate (Michaud, supra). This freedom to debate is a vital national interest for all Canadians. It has been held that the need for the right of freedom of speech in the House is so obvious as to require no comment and the right of the House to be the sole judge of the lawfulness of its proceedings, is similarly evident (Ontario (Speaker of the Legislative Assembly) v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), 2001 CanLII 8549 (ON CA), para. 27. Also, New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 319 per McLachlin J., at paras. 385-386.)\n[29] Mr. Calandra\u2019s comments may have been for partisan purposes as the Complainant alleges. They may also have been \u201cwholly inappropriate\u201d as alleged by the Commission. However, it is not this Tribunal\u2019s place to pass judgment on statements made by a Member in the House of Commons. Moreover, for the Tribunal to hold the Respondent accountable for comments made by Mr. Calandra in this context would violate the constitutional separation of powers (Vaid, supra, para. 21). Were such a violation to be permitted, it would put a chill on free debate in the Houses of Parliament. Parliamentarians have been elected to speak, debate and state points of view, and their freedom of speech is not confined to popular points of view. However, human rights tribunals should not, as a matter of principle, interfere with this most protected level of discourse, so necessary to Parliamentarians\u2019 ability to carry out their functions (Vaid, supra, para. 29).\nVI. Decision and Order\n[30] For the foregoing reasons, the part of the motion to amend the complaint to add the grounds of discrimination of race and national or ethnic origin is granted. However, the Complainant must provide additional particulars with respect to the definition of terms he has used in this motion, specifically the terms \u201cWestern\u201d and \u201cnon-Western\u201d, and their use as the basis for his allegation of discrimination. The Registrar will contact Mr. Attaran regarding dates for these submissions, and the Respondent and Commission will be given the opportunity to respond in the normal course.\n[31] The part of the motion to add the allegation of retaliation is dismissed.\nSigned by\nDavid L.

Motion to Dismiss\n[1] This is a ruling concerning a Motion filed by one of the Respondents, the Air Canada Pilots Association (\u201cACPA\u201d), dated March 15, 2016, seeking an order dismissing the complaints. ACPA set out several reasons why the complaints should be dismissed at this preliminary stage before the hearing has commenced. The other Respondent, Air Canada, supported the motion, adopting ACPA\u2019s submissions and adding further reasons in their submissions.\n[2] These complaints are part of a complex matter involving the mandatory retirement of Air Canada pilots at the age of 60. The issue has been before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (\u201cTribunal\u201d or the \u201cCHRT\u201d) for more than a decade. For the reasons set forth below, I grant ACPA\u2019s motion and dismiss the complaints of those complainants who reached the age of 60 prior to December 31, 2009. For the within complainants who reached the age of 60 on January 1, 2010 or later, the motion is dismissed and I will grant a hearing.\nII. Background\n[3] This matter involves the complaints of retired Air Canada pilots who claim that Air Canada engaged in a discriminatory practice and applied a discriminatory policy by requiring them to retire at the age of 60. The mandatory retirement was pursuant to the collective agreement negotiated between Air Canada and the bargaining agent, ACPA, and the pilots\u2019 pension plan. As a result, many human rights complaints have been filed by these retired pilots against both Air Canada and ACPA, and in this instance the ninety-seven (97) pilots have been combined into a single hearing by the Tribunal, referred to as the \u201cBailie\u201d matter. The pilots claim that requiring them to retire at age 60 was in violation of sections 7, 9 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, as amended (the \u201cCHRA\u201d).\n[4] Prior to the Bailie group of complainants, there were two similar groups of Air Canada retired pilot complainants before the Tribunal. The Tribunal similarly grouped those complainants together into separate hearings. The first group will be referred to as the Vilven\/Kelly matter, and the second group will be referred to as the Thwaites\/Adamson matter.\n[5] The Bailie matter was previously seized by Member Garfield, whose term with the Tribunal has since expired. In 2011, ACPA brought a motion to adjourn the Bailie matter in light of the ongoing appeals in both the Vilven\/Kelly and the Thwaites\/Adamson matters. Those matters were making their way through the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal (\u201cFCA\u201d). Member Garfield granted the motion in February of 2012 (2012 CHRT 6). He opined that the legal issues in Vilven\/Kelly, Thwaites\/Adamson and Baillie address substantially the same issues. Further, the history of the Vilven\/Kelly and Thwaites\/Adamson proceedings showed that every significant Tribunal decision had been judicially reviewed by one or more parties. Therefore, Member Garfield found that an adjournment with certain conditions was preferable and less intrusive than determining some parts of the complaint based on res judicata, issue estoppel or abuse of process as some parties had suggested. When adjourned, the Bailie group of complaints remained intact for adjudication once judicial clarity in the other cases had been achieved. As such, Member Garfield adjourned these proceedings.\n[6] The Bailie matter remained adjourned for four (4) years, until the Supreme Court of Canada (\u201cSCC\u201d) dismissed the application for leave to appeal the FCA\u2019s judgment in the Thwaites\/Adamson matter. (Leave to appeal denied March 10, 2016, see Robert Adamson, et al. v. Air Canada, et al., 2016 CanLII 12161).\n[7] In the Bailie matter there are ninety-seven (97) complainants and the majority are represented by one legal counsel, Mr. Raymond Hall, who is also an Air Canada pilot and one of the complainants herein. The complainants represented by Mr. Hall are referred to as the \u201cCoalition complainants\u201d. The complainants in the Bailie matter have retirement dates ranging from June 2004 to February 2012. Fifty-two (52) pilots turned 60 prior to 2010 and the remaining forty-five (45) retired at various times after December 31, 2009 and up to February of 2012. The importance of distinguishing these two groups will become clear in these reasons.\n[8] ACPA brought a motion to dismiss the Bailie complaints dated March 15, 2016. In correspondence dated March 16, 2016, counsel for the Coalition complainants stated that he required a substantial amount of time to contact his clients, consult them, and seek instructions regarding the motion and a number of substantive issues given the years that had passed since the adjournment of the proceedings and the number of determinations of the court. Counsel for the Coalition complainants argued that all parties should restate their positions given the changes in the law and the facts since the original Statements of Particulars (\u201cSOPs\u201d) were filed.\n[9] ACPA responded by arguing that the parties should not be amending their SOPs prior to a motion to dismiss. Rather, ACPA suggested that the Coalition complainants raise any new facts or changes to the legal framework in response to ACPA\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaints.\n[10] On April 4, 2016, Member Garfield directed the parties to serve and file motion materials by specific dates. He further stated that \u201cany party may request, or the Tribunal determine, that a conference call take place to hear oral submissions\u201d. All of the written submissions on the motion to dismiss were received and the conference call to hear oral submissions was conducted before me on September 19, 2016.\nIII. Judicial History of the Similar Complaints in Vilven\/Kelly & Thwaites\/Adamson\n[11] The Vilven\/Kelly matter was the first proceeding regarding the mandatory retirement rules and pilots who were forced to retire from Air Canada at the age of 60. Three (3) complaints were combined for the proceeding from two complainants, Mr. Vilven and Mr. Kelly, and both were represented by Mr. Hall. The timeframe assessed in the Vilven\/Kelly proceedings was for pilots retiring from 2003 to 2005.\n[12] The main issue in that case was whether the mandatory retirement rule under section 15(1)(c) of the CHRA was constitutional. Section 15(1)(c) (since repealed) permitted the termination of employment based on age, if it was the \u201cnormal age of retirement for employees working in positions similar to the position of that individual.\u201d If section 15(1)(c) applied, then what was the normal age of retirement for similarly employed pilots in Canada, and how would that be determined?\n[13] The complainants in Vilven\/Kelly challenged the constitutionality of section 15(1)(c). This issue was finally resolved by the FCA\u2019s decision (2012 FCA 209), which declared that section 15(1)(c) was constitutionally valid (Leave to appeal to the SCC denied (2013 CanLII 15565)). Given the Federal Court\u2019s earlier judgment in Vilven v. Air Canada (\u201cVilven FC\u201d) (2009 FC 367), upholding the Tribunal\u2019s finding that 60 was the normal age of retirement for pilots and that Mr. Kelly and Mr. Vilven were caught by section 15(1)(c), the FCA confirmed that their complaints should be dismissed. (See Vilven\/Kelly v. Air Canada & Air Canada Pilots Association, 2007 CHRT 36 for the Tribunal\u2019s decision where it made the finding of the normal age of retirement.)\n[14] It should be noted that Parliament repealed section 15(1)(c) of the CHRA in December 2012 and thereafter the Respondents ceased requiring pilots to retire at age 60.\n[15] The Thwaites\/Adamson matter was the second proceeding regarding the mandatory retirement rules and pilots who were forced to retire from Air Canada at the age of 60. There were seventy (70) pilots in this group, with retirement dates starting in 2005 up until 2009. The majority of the complainants were represented by Mr. Hall.\n[16] The Tribunal\u2019s decision in the Thwaites\/Adamson matter was considered by the FCA which explained that the Federal Court\u2019s decision by Justice Mactavish in Vilven FC is not necessarily a binding precedent on the Tribunal given the fact situation. The FCA stated that this decision should be seen as informing the context in which the Tribunal\u2019s decision is made and should limit the range of reasonable options open to the Tribunal when crafting the comparator group under para. 15(1)(c). (See paras. 31 and 60 of the Adamson v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), 2015 FCA 153).\n[17] The FCA in Thwaites\/Adamson further found that the comparator group factors identified in the Vilven FC decision is not a \u201ctest\u201d but rather \u201cfactors\u201d to be applied by the Tribunal. The activities of other Canadian airline pilots must be examined on the basis of the factors identified in Vilven FC, but not necessarily applied in a rigid fashion like a test. The factors were identified as follows:\n1. Flying domestically;\n2. Flying internationally;\n3. Transporting passengers;\n4. Flying varying sizes of aircraft; and\n5. Flying varying types of aircraft.\n(See para. 41, Adamson v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), 2015 FCA 153).\n[18] In the Thwaites\/Adamson matter, the parties disagreed over which Vilven FC factors were paramount and, most importantly, whether these factors were to be read conjunctively by the Tribunal, or disjunctively, as found by the Federal Court in Thwaites\/Adamson.\n[19] The FCA explained in the Thwaites\/Adamson decision that the Tribunal was not obliged to apply the Vilven FC factors in the same manner as Mactavish J. suggested in Vilven\/Kelly, but rather it had greater leeway in deciding how to make use of these factors. As such, the Tribunal was entitled, when applying the Vilven FC factors, to opt for the conjunctive approach.\n[20] In the end, the FCA concluded that the threshold for judicial review was not met. The FCA judge could not set aside the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the normal age of retirement issue as there was evidence on the record supporting the Tribunal\u2019s findings and conclusions (see paras. 82-83 of the FCA Thwaites\/Adamson decision). The FCA explained:\n[82] In the present matter, the Tribunal heard extensive evidence on the choice of comparator groups. In the end, it accepted Captain Duke\u2019s evidence, a witness for Air Canada, to determine the comparator group for the years 2005 to 2008 (Tribunal\u2019s decision at paragraph 173). For the year 2009, it accepted the evidence of two witnesses, Captain Paul Prentice, a witness for the complainants, and Harlan Clark, a witness for Air Canada.\n[83] There was evidence on record supporting the Tribunal\u2019s findings and conclusions. I find no reason to intervene.\n[21] As such, the FCA in Thwaites\/Adamson accepted the Tribunal\u2019s finding that \u201cfor each of the years 2005-2009, the majority of pilots working for Canadian airlines, including Air Canada, in similar positions to that of the complainants, retired by the age of 60\u201d (see para. 181 of the Tribunal decision in Thwaites\/Adamson (2011 CHRT 11)).\nIV. Judicial Findings \u2013 Finally Determined by FCA\n[22] The following issues have been finally determined by the FCA in the Vilven\/Kelly and Thwaites\/Adamson proceedings:\n1. Paragraph 15(1)(c) of the CHRA is constitutionally valid (now repealed);\n2. The Tribunal ought to apply the Vilven FC factors when determining the comparator group pursuant to paragraph 15(1)(c) of the CHRA for Air Canada pilot retirement complaints;\n3. The Tribunal has discretion as to how they wish to apply the factors, with the direction of the previous decisions;\n4. 60 was the normal age of retirement for pilots in positions similar to those occupied by Messrs. Vilven and Kelly in the period of 2003 \u2013 2005;\n5. 60 was the normal age of retirement for pilots working for Canadian airlines in similar positions to the Complainants in the years 2005 \u2013 2009 (see para. 181 of the Tribunal decision in Thwaites\/Adamson (2011 CHRT 11).\nV. Law\nA. Tribunal\u2019s Discretion to Dismiss Complaint without Hearing\n[23] In Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FC 445 (\u201cFirst Nation\u201d), the Federal Court confirmed the Tribunal\u2019s power to dismiss a complaint on the basis of a preliminary motion. Justice Mactavish explained that a previous Federal Court decision, cited below, had already confirmed this discretionary power as follows:\n[137] After examining some of the statutory provisions referred to above, Justice von Fickenstein observed that it was \u201chard to fathom\u201d why it would be in anyone\u2019s interest for the Tribunal to hold a hearing in a case where the hearing would amount to an abuse of process: at para. 18. He concluded that there was no statutory or jurisprudential bar that would preclude the Tribunal from dismissing a complaint on the basis of a preliminary motion on the grounds of abuse of process, \u201calways assuming there are valid grounds to do so\u201d: at para 19. This decision as subsequently affirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal: 2004 FCA 363 (CanLII), 329 N.R. 95.\nSee also Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada Post Corp., 2004 FC 81 (\u201cCremasco\u201d), affirmed in Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canada Post Corp., 2004 FCA 363.\n[24] The Tribunal\u2019s power to dismiss a human rights complaint in advance of a full hearing on the merits \u201cshould be exercised cautiously and then only in the clearest of cases...\u201d (See para. 140 of First Nation, supra). In cases where there may be serious issues of credibility or where the issues of fact and law are complex and intermingled, it may well be more efficient to await the full hearing before ruling on the preliminary issue. However, Justice Mactavish did add the following:\n[143] That said, there may be cases where a full hearing involving viva voce evidence is not necessarily required. As the Tribunal noted, this could include cases where there is no dispute as to the facts, or where the issue is a pure question of law. (\u2026)\n[148] (\u2026) In every case, the Tribunal will have to consider the facts and issues raised by the complaint before it, and will have to identify the appropriate procedure to be followed so as to secure as informal and expeditious a hearing process as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\n[149] However, the process adopted by the Tribunal will have to be fair, and will always have to afford each of the parties \u201ca full and ample opportunity to appear[,] \u2026 present evidence and make representations\u201d in relation to the matter in dispute.\n[25] Accordingly, the Tribunal has the power to dismiss a complaint on a motion to dismiss for abuse of process. However, should the Tribunal dismiss a complaint on a motion to dismiss, the process adopted must meet the requirements of natural justice and procedural fairness and it should only be done in the clearest of cases.\nB. Abuse of Process by Re-litigation\n[26] The SCC decision in Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79, 2003 SCC 63 (\u201cCUPE\u201d) remains a leading decision regarding abuse of process. The doctrine of abuse of process precludes re-litigation in circumstances where the strict requirements of issue estoppel (typically the privity\/mutuality requirements) are not met, but where allowing the litigation to proceed would nonetheless violate such principles as judicial economy, consistency, finality and the integrity of the administration of justice (see para. 37 CUPE, see also Cremasco).\n[27] The determination as to whether the re-litigation of issues and material facts constitutes an abuse of process by re-litigation is a discretionary matter (see CUPE at para. 35). In CUPE, the SCC explored the rationales underlying issue estoppel and abuse of process, explaining the doctrine engages \u201cthe inherent power of the court to prevent the misuse of its procedure, in a way that would \u2026 bring the administration of justice into disrepute\u201d and that it had been applied in cases where the litigation before the court is found to be in essence, an attempt to re-litigate a claim which the court has already determined (see para. 37 of CUPE, see also para. 56 of Canam Enterprises Inc. v. Coles, 2000 CanLII 8514, dissent approved by SCC (2002 SCC 63)).\n[28] The focus of the doctrine of abuse of process is the integrity of the adjudicative process. In CUPE, the SCC makes three preliminary observations when assessing same:\n1. There can be no assumption that re-litigation will yield a more accurate result than the original proceeding;\n2. If it yields the same result, will it be a waste of additional resources and unnecessary expenses for the parties?\n3. If the result in the subsequent proceeding is different from the conclusion reached in the first on the very same issue, will the inconsistency, in and of itself, undermine the credibility of the entire judicial process, thereby diminishing its authority, its credibility and its aim of finality?\n(See CUPE at para. 51)\n[29] Re-litigation carries serious detrimental effects and should be avoided unless the circumstances dictate that re-litigation is in fact necessary to enhance the credibility and the effectiveness of the adjudicative process as a whole. The SCC suggests the following situations where re-litigation may be necessary:\n1. When the first proceeding is tainted by fraud or dishonesty;\n2. When fresh, new evidence, previously unavailable, conclusively impeaches the original results; or\n3. When fairness dictates that the original result should not be binding in the new context.\n(See CUPE at para. 52)\n[30] Although none of the parties to the Motion referred to the SCC decisions in Figliola (British Columbia (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) v. Figliola, 2011 SCC 52) (\u201cFigliola\u201d) and Penner v. Niagara (Regional Police Services Board), 2013 SCC 19 (\u201cPenner\u201d), these are two important SCC decisions where the court has recently reviewed finality doctrines.\n[31] In Penner, the SCC elaborated on the discretionary application of issue estoppel and the need for flexibility and fairness. Although Penner does not refer to the doctrine of abuse of process, as the court explained in CUPE, the discretionary factors for fairness that apply to prevent the doctrine of issue estoppel from operating in an unjust or unfair way are equally available to prevent the doctrine of abuse of process from achieving similar undesirable results (see para. 53 of CUPE).\n[32] In Penner the SCC reaffirmed an older SCC decision in Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., 2001 SCC 44, where a list of factors were established to indicate some circumstances that may be relevant in a particular case to determine whether, on the whole, it is fair to apply issue estoppel. The SCC explained how the factors arose and can be considered at para. 39 as follows:\nBroadly speaking, the factors identified in the jurisprudence illustrate that unfairness may arise in two main ways which overlap and are not mutually exclusive. First, the unfairness of applying issue estoppel may arise from the unfairness of the prior proceedings. Second, even where the prior proceedings were conducted fairly and properly having regard to their purposes, it may nonetheless be unfair to use the results of that process to preclude the subsequent claim.\n[Emphasis added]\n[33] This list of factors is not exhaustive and the SCC specifically states that it does not need to be applied mechanically (see paras. 37-38 of Penner). The factors are taken from the previous SCC decision, and are known as the \u201cDanyluk factors\u201d. The factors that could be considered in exercising discretion are as follows:\na. the wording of the statute;\nb. the purpose of the legislation;\nc. the availability of an appeal;\nd. safeguards within the administrative process;\ne. the expertise of the administrative decision maker;\nf. the circumstances giving rise to the prior decision; and\ng. any potential injustice that might result from the application or non-application of the doctrine.\n(See paras. 66 to 80 of Danyluk, supra)\n[34] Although the decision in Figliola can be distinguished from this matter on the facts, the SCC provided a good summary of the common underlying principles of the doctrines of finality for preventing \u201cabuse of the decision-making process\u201d at para. 34 as follows:\n\u00b7 It is in the interests of the public and the parties that the finality of a decision can be relied on (Danyluk, at para. 18; Boucher, at para. 35).\n\u00b7 Respect for the finality of a judicial or administrative decision increases fairness and the integrity of the courts, administrative tribunals and the administration of justice; on the other hand, re-litigation of issues that have been previously decided in an appropriate forum may undermine confidence in this fairness and integrity by creating inconsistent results and unnecessarily duplicative proceedings (Toronto (City), at paras. 38 and 51).\n\u00b7 The method of challenging the validity or correctness of a judicial or administrative decision should be through the appeal or judicial review mechanisms that are intended by the legislature (Boucher, at para. 35; Danyluk, at para. 74).\n\u00b7 Parties should not circumvent the appropriate review mechanism by using other forums to challenge a judicial or administrative decision (TeleZone, at para. 61; Boucher, at para. 35; Garland, at para. 72).\n\u00b7 Avoiding unnecessary re-litigation avoids an unnecessary expenditure of resources (Toronto (City), at paras. 37 and 51).\n[Emphasis added]\n[35] The above principles are a useful guide to the Tribunal in considering the analysis required in the motion herein. Generally speaking, the application of the doctrine of abuse of process is discretionary and considers various factors to arrive at a conclusion as to whether or not the matter amounts to re-litigation, which would put the administration of justice into disrepute. Lastly, I must also consider fairness and whether there are any reasons not to apply the finality doctrine.\nVI. Positions of the Parties on the Motion\n[36] The Bailie complaints and the predecessor complaints are unusual and precedent-setting because the legal and most of the factual issues are the same in all related matters, except for the actual complainants and their dates of birth. Furthermore, the normal age of retirement should apply to all complainants equally in a given timeframe. However, it remains within the realm of possibility that the normal age of retirement itself may have changed over the years with changes in the industry.\nA. ACPA\u2019s Position on the Motion\n[37] ACPA relies upon Cremasco to confirm the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to dismiss the matter by way of a preliminary motion on the ground of abuse of its process inasmuch as the Tribunal is the \u201cmaster of its own house\u201d. This is not a contested point of law. The Tribunal does have this jurisdiction, but as explained in the FC\u2019s First Nation decision, it must only be exercised in the \u201cclearest of cases\u201d.\n[38] ACPA submits that the CUPE decision directly applies to the Bailie matter. ACPA relies upon the decision in Thwaites\/Adamson to explain that proceeding with the Bailie complaints would be an abuse of the Tribunal\u2019s process and a re-litigation of a matter which has already been determined. ACPA quotes the FCA decision in Thwaites\/Adamson at length, particularly relying on the following at para. 16:\nThe record reasonably supports the Tribunal\u2019s finding at paragraph 181 of its decision that \u201c\u2026for each of the years 2005-2009, the majority of pilots working for Canadian airlines, including Air Canada, in similar positions to that of the [c]omplainants, retire[d] by the age of 60.\u201d\n[39] ACPA submits there is simply nothing left to litigate. Unfortunately, ACPA did not address the fact that the court determination of the normal age of retirement was only for the period of 2005 to 2009. ACPA did not make any distinction of the forty-five (45) pilots in the Bailie matter who turned 60 after December 31, 2009.\n[40] ACPA submits that should re-litigation be required, the same evidence considered in the previous hearings will be the only evidence before the Tribunal in the Bailie matter. The Coalition complainants have specifically admitted in their SOP that they would be relying on the evidence in Vilven\/Kelly and Thwaites\/Adamson. In fact, the Coalition complainants went so far as to assert that it would be an abuse of process for them to be required to call any evidence. In their motion submissions, ACPA provided examples from the Coalition complainants\u2019 SOPs and previous Notices of Motion in the Bailie matter.\n[41] ACPA also argues that dismissing the matters would support judicial economy as there was a considerable amount of evidence adduced in the Thwaites\/Adamson hearing and given the complainants have admitted that they would be relying upon the same evidence, there is no factual basis upon which their claims should require adjudication. In their view, the Tribunal has received judicial clarity from the FCA decisions and the Tribunal should be avoiding duplicative litigation.\nB. ACPA\u2019s Reply\n[42] ACPA\u2019s reply to the responses of the Coalition complainants and other self-represented complainants points out that the Coalition complainants have failed to provide anything further than an assertion to support their position that the normal age of retirement may be different in the Bailie matter. Although the Coalition complainants assert there are material facts which would affect the normal age of retirement that differ from the Vilven\/Kelly and Thwaites\/Adamson proceeding, no details were provided.\n[43] ACPA asserts that the balance of the Coalition complainants\u2019 position regarding the inapplicability of the previous decisions is nothing more than a reiteration of the positions advanced unsuccessfully before the FCA and their leave to appeal to the SCC.\nC. Air Canada\u2019s Position on the Motion\n[44] Air Canada relies upon the motion submissions of ACPA. In addition, Air Canada addresses the fact that some pilots retired after the time frame specifically addressed in the Thwaites\/Adamson proceedings at paras. 8 and 9 of their submissions:\n8. A similar abuse of process arises regarding the complainants who retired shortly after the last of the Thwaites complainants. The complainants who retired after the time analyzed in Thwaites, did so shortly following that period. Further, the evidence in Thwaites concerned the age of retirement of thousands of pilots in Canada. (See para. 176 of Thwaites, 2011 CHRT 11, in ACPA\u2019s materials).\n9. Given the stability in the normal age of retirement through the time considered in Thwaites, and indeed, considered in Vilven v. Air Canada, and given that in both cases it was established that there are thousands of pilots in the comparator group, it is highly improbable that a meaningful change to the normal age of retirement could have occurred in the short time between the retirement of the Thwaites complainants and that of these complainants. (Ibid. and Vilven v. Air Canada, 2007 CHRT 36, (\u201cVilven\u201d), attached as Tab 1).\n[45] Air Canada also raises the issue of costs, submitting that the Tribunal must be vigilant to avoid an abuse of process. The Respondents in this matter have already committed significant time and effort defending the complaints in Vilven\/Kelly and Thwaites\/Adamson. Neither should be required to do so again given the chances of the complaints being upheld are as remote as they are in this case. Furthermore, Air Canada submits, re-litigating adds to the unfairness because the Respondents do not have the possibility of being compensated for the expense of the hearing based on the SCC decision in Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 53 (\u201cMowat\u201d).\nD. Coalition Complainants\u2019 Position on the Motion\n[46] There are eighty-nine (89) pilots represented by Mr. Hall, with eight (8) additional self-represented complainants, totaling ninety-seven (97) complainants in the Bailie matter. Four (4) of the self-represented complainants have provided submissions on the motion. Unfortunately, I do not read them as addressing the legal issues but rather restating their general complaint, seeking to have \u201ctheir individual\u201d complaint heard.\n[47] The following provides a brief overview of the Coalition complainants\u2019 arguments. I have only included arguments which I find to be relevant to this decision. The Coalition complainants\u2019 first argument is based on privity. They argue that none of the Bailie complainants were a party to the previous proceedings. To the extent that each complainant is unique, each complaint should be heard separately. None of the Bailie complainants have had any opportunity to participate in the two prior proceedings or the right to make any representations to the Tribunal in respect of the issues raised or to be informed of the issues in dispute in those proceedings.\n[48] Much of the motion submissions of the Coalition complainants suggests that the reason they want to re-litigate is because they feel that the Tribunal should apply the comparator group factors differently for the Bailie matter, than was done in the Vilven\/Kelly and Thwaites\/Adamson proceedings. The Coalition complainants argue that even where an appellate court has found one interpretation to be reasonable, that decision will not necessarily bind a future administrative tribunal. Strictly speaking, an administrative tribunal is not bound by its previous decisions or the decisions of its predecessor (see Altus Group Limited v. Calgary (City), 2015 ABCA 85 at para. 16).\n[49] The Coalition complainants rely upon the FCA decision in Morel v. Canada, 2008 FCA 53 (\u201cMorel\u201d) to address the balancing of interests between the rights of individuals to be heard and the interests of finality, fairness, efficiency and the authority of judicial decisions in respect of the doctrine of abuse of process. They rely upon Morel to assert their right to be heard, over the gravity of casting doubt on the previous proceedings. More specifically, that the quasi constitutional rights of a party to a fair hearing must take precedence over finality and the potential for conflicting results.\nVII. Analysis\n[50] I have considered all of the parties\u2019 arguments, although I am not addressing all of them here. I am addressing the ones that I feel are necessary and relevant to my decision.\nA. General Observations\n[51] The Coalition complainants find themselves in the somewhat awkward position of arguing against part of their position taken in their SOP dated March 18, 2011, and in their Replies to Air Canada and ACPA dated April 11, 2011 and April 12, 2011 respectively. In their SOP at para. 13, they state: \u201cWith respect to the liability portion of the hearing, the Complainants expect to rely on the evidence and argument adduced in both the Vilven\/Kelly hearing and the Thwaites\/Adamson hearing.\u201d Only one or two witnesses would be required to re-adduce that evidence for the hearing. In other words, the argument was being made that new evidence on liability would not be required in the Bailie matter.\n[52] In the Coalition complainants\u2019 Reply to Air Canada, dated April 11, 2011, at para. 16, they affirmed the issue of mandatory age having been settled:\n16. The issue of determining whether Air Canada\u2019 termination of its pilots by reason of mandatory retirement meets the requirements of paragraph 15(1)(c) of the Act was thoroughly canvassed by all parties in the Thwaites hearing.\n[53] In the Coalition Complainant\u2019s Reply to ACPA\u2019s Statement of Particulars, dated April 12, 2011, at paras. 9 and 10, they stated:\n9. This proceeding marks the third instance of litigation of the identical issue involving the identical mandatory retirement provisions of the Air Canada \u2013 ACPA collective agreement and pension plan by the same four parties (albeit with a different set of Coalition Complainants privies). While the specific attributes and behaviors of the individual Complainants may be relevant to issues related to remedy, including damages, none of the Complainants\u2019 specific characteristics distinguish the instant issue of liability from the issue that was twice previously heard and decided by the Tribunal and the Federal Court. These Complainants, like all of the Complainants in the two prior proceedings, are before the Tribunal solely because their employment was terminated pursuant to the provisions of the Air Canada \u2013 ACPA collective agreement and pension plan, on the basis of having acquired the age of 60. Consequently, this entire proposed liability hearing is nothing more than a relitigation of the very same issues that have already been decided with finality by the Tribunal and by the Federal Court.\n10. On the basis of the submissions made by ACPA in the instant Statement of Particulars, the Complainants at the outset object to re-litigating issues that have already been dealt with, with finality, by both this Tribunal and by the Federal Court in both the Vilven-Kelly proceeding and\/or in the Thwaites proceeding. It is the respectful submission of the Complainants that re-litigation of most, if not all of the issues raised in ACPA\u2019s Statement of Particulars can and should be dealt with by the Tribunal under principles of judicial comity, stare decisis, issue estoppel and\/or abuse of process.\n(Emphasis added.)\n[54] As previously noted, the Coalition complainants\u2019 had expressed a desire to amend their SOP\u2019s following the release of the FCA decisions in both Vilven\/Kelly and Thwaites\/Adamson. The Respondents took the position that the Coalition complainants could raise any of these new material facts in response to the motion to dismiss.\n[55] In the Coalition complainants\u2019 submissions in this motion to dismiss, they took a different view from their 2011 SOPs, stating, \u201c\u2026the material facts with respect to the normal age of retirement in the industry as of their respective dates of termination of employment are different than those of the Complainants in the Thwaites\/Adamson proceeding.\u201d (Para. 4.) However, the submissions do not elaborate at all what is different. What material facts are different for the Bailie complainant group? The written submissions are silent.\n[56] When the parties gave their oral submissions to me, I took the opportunity to ask certain questions to attempt to get at the root of what had changed. Counsel for the Coalition complainants did not give me satisfactory answers, and the opportunity afforded to the unrepresented complainants did not yield any compelling information regarding evidence which could be adduced at a hearing, or legal argument. While the Complainants readily asserted that the normal age of retirement would be different for them, they did not provide much suggestion as to what evidence they intended to bring to the hearing to substantiate that claim.\nVIII. Principles Applicable to Abuse of Process\n[57] In the following analysis of the principles applicable to the determination of abuse of process, the Complainants are separated into two groups based on their age. Different conclusions are reached for each group.\nA. Judicial Economy\n[58] Air Canada submits that the Tribunal needs to be more vigilant about the possibility of abuse of process given our inability to award costs. At para. 13 of Air Canada\u2019s submissions, they detail the burden they have already undertaken in these cases:\n13. The instant provides a compelling illustration of why that is the case: the complaints raise essentially the same issues, save for the identity of the complainants, as were raised in Vilven, above, where the lead complainant retired in 2003. Some thirteen years later, and by counsel\u2019s count, after some 50 days of hearings on the merits alone before the Tribunal, the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal, and despite having twice had these issues heard by the Federal Court of Appeal and complainant counsel having twice sought leave to have them heard by the Supreme Court of Canada, the same complainant counsel seeks to continue this litigation.\n[59] While I am sympathetic to their argument, case law tends to explain judicial economy in the context of abuse of process as pertaining to a Court or Administrative Tribunal\u2019s resources. That said, a considerable amount of evidence was led by the parties in the previous proceedings and the Tribunal\u2019s 77 page decision in Thwaites\/Adamson contained 30 pages of evidence. Further, the Coalition complainants\u2019 SOP and previous motion materials admit that they have no new evidence and that their cases are essentially identical to the Thwaites\/Adamson and Vilven\/Kelly hearings. For the Bailie complainants with retirement dates prior to December 31, 2009, they would fall directly in this time period. As such, I find it would go against judicial economy to re-litigate and entertain evidence which was already brought before the Tribunal on the same issue with the same factual scenario and time period.\n[60] The Respondents have made a strong argument, demonstrating that from 2003 all the way until December 31, 2009, evidence before this very Tribunal found that the normal age of retirement for pilots was 60. Given the number of years and evidence brought forward, they argue that without any new facts or evidence, the normal age of retirement for pilots remains 60 for all of the complainants in this matter. Rather than address the argument of judicial economy, the Coalition complainants failed to bring forth any new evidence to support their argument that there are new facts that have changed that normal age of retirement, despite having been directly questioned by myself during oral submissions.\n[61] The argument of judicial economy is less convincing in the context of the younger group of complainants. The Tribunal does not have material facts before it for the time period considered by the younger group. It should not preclude the complainants who turned 60 after December 31, 2009, from having the opportunity to make their case.\nB. Consistency\n[62] The Bailie complaints follow two FCA decisions (leave to appeal to SCC denied), which address the same legal issues, albeit for different time periods. In Morel, the FCA explains that when Justice Arbour applied the doctrine of abuse of process to the facts on appeal in CUPE, \u201cit is clear that she was mostly concerned with maintaining the integrity of the judicial system, especially with respect to the prospect of conflicting decisions bringing the administration of justice into disrepute\u201d (see para. 38 of Morel).\n[63] I believe it would create judicial inconsistency should the Tribunal render a new decision on the merits which could place one pilot retiring on February 1, 2009 who was part of the Thwaites\/Adamson group, receiving a different result than a pilot retiring on the same date, or even an earlier retirement date, who is in the Bailie group. Arriving at an inconsistent result would question the authority and finality of a judicial decision from one of Canada\u2019s highest courts, the FCA (with leave to appeal to the SCC denied). I conclude the Tribunal would be risking a judicial inconsistency to allow the older group of pilots, who turned 60 before December 31, 2009, to re-litigate this matter.\n[64] For the pilots who turned 60 after December 31, 2009, there would be no judicial inconsistencies created in proceeding with their complaints. There is no evidence before the Tribunal for the normal age of retirement for that time period. As such, it cannot be said that there would be a strict judicial inconsistency arising if there was a different finding.\nC. Finality\n[65] It is important to repeat part of one of the underlying principles of the doctrines of finality which was summarized at para. 34 of Figliola: \u201cRespect for the finality of a judicial or administrative decision increases fairness and the integrity of the courts, administrative tribunals and the administration of justice (\u2026)\u201d (see also CUPE, at paras. 38 and 51).\n[66] For the most part, Mr. Hall used his oral argument to criticize the earlier approach taken by the Tribunal in the previous matters to determine the comparator group. Mr. Hall stated that the Thwaites\/Adamson Tribunal\u2019s chosen comparator group leads to \u201ca profound absurdity.\u201d (See para. 26 of the Coalition complainants\u2019 submissions)\n[67] The response to this statement by counsel for ACPA, with which I am inclined to agree, was set out at para. 12 of their Reply:\n12. The statement at paragraph 26 of the Response that the Thwaites chosen comparator group leads to a profound absurdity is precisely the position rejected by the Federal Court of Appeal. If it had been a profound absurdity then the Court of Appeal would not have concluded that the Tribunal\u2019s decision was reasonable.\n[68] It is apparent to me that the main aim of the Coalition complainants is to attempt to re-litigate the comparator groups that were established in the earlier proceedings, and later reviewed by the Federal Court and the FCA. The Tribunal is not necessarily bound by those decisions. However, there must be some finality to judicial decisions, especially those of higher courts. In my view, to allow the re-litigation of this issue would indeed be an abuse of process. It would not be fair to demand the Respondents to start all over again and would bring the integrity of this proceeding into question if I so ordered.\n[69] For the pilots turning 60 after December 31, 2009, it cannot be said there is finality already determined in their case. As mentioned above, there is no evidence before the Tribunal regarding the normal age of retirement for the period after 2009. Further, the Respondents have not provided me with convincing arguments beyond speculation that the age of retirement for the pilots turning 60 after December 31, 2009 has remained 60. There is no judicial finality with respect to those years affecting the younger claimants.\nD. Integrity of the Administration of Justice\n[70] As noted in the FCA decision in Thwaites\/Adamson, the Tribunal had the discretion to apply the Vilven FC factors as they saw fit given the facts. No parties have provided new evidence which would allow the Tribunal to find that re-litigation of the 2003-2009 retirees will yield a more accurate result than the original proceeding. A significant amount of time and judicial resources were expended in litigating the first two proceedings. I believe it would be a waste of judicial resources and expenses for parties to re-litigate. Lastly, if for some reason the Tribunal were to arrive at a different result than the prior proceeding, I believe this inconsistency in and of itself would undermine the credibility of the entire judicial process, yielding conflicting results and would put the integrity of the administration of justice into disrepute.\n[71] As previously noted, for the post-December 31, 2009 retirees, proceeding to a hearing would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute as that time period has not been before the Tribunal.\nE. Fairness\n[72] The complainants have not led evidence that the earlier findings of the Tribunal were tainted by fraud or dishonesty. They have not suggested there is fresh evidence that was not available to the Tribunal for the Thwaites\/Adamson and Vilven\/Kelly matters. That the Complainants do not like the findings in the earlier matters is not sufficient argument under the heading of fairness.\n[73] However, with respect to the pilots who turned 60 after December 31, 2009, a different argument of fairness arises. These pilots were not privy to the earlier matters before the Tribunal. Their facts are different in that they were forced to retire during a period of time that was not under consideration of the Tribunal in the other complaints.\n[74] The reality is that there is no factual or evidentiary record before the Tribunal regarding the normal age of retirement from 2010 to 2012. One self-represented complainant, Mr. Collier, who reached the age of 60 in September 2011, called for the Tribunal to re-evaluate the mandatory retirement age in 2011 as he felt there were changes in the industry.\n[75] Section 50(1) of the CHRA requires me to \u201cgive all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity\u2026to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations.\u201d For complainants like Mr. Collier, who turned 60 after December 31, 2009, the CHRA makes it clear to me that he must be given the opportunity to be heard. The doctrine of fairness is compelling in the case of complainants like Mr. Collier.\nIX. Recent Federal Court Decision in Gregg et al v. Air Canada Pilots Association and Air Canada, 2017 FC 506 (\u201cGregg\u201d)\n[76] Following the close of submissions on this motion but prior to my releasing this ruling, the Federal Court released the above noted judgment which the Respondents argue is relevant to this motion. The Gregg decision is a judicial review of the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) decision, since 2013, not to refer similar Air Canada pilot complaints to the Tribunal because it is \u201cplain and obvious that the complaints cannot succeed\u201d. The Federal Court upheld the Commission\u2019s decision not to refer the pilots to the Tribunal.\n[77] In May of 2017, the parties were invited to provide additional written submissions regarding the Gregg decision. ACPA submitted that the Gregg \u201cdecision is directly applicable to the outstanding motion to dismiss and fortifies the arguments advanced in that motion.\u201d Air Canada suggests that to decide differently from Gregg would lead observers to conclude that \u201cform has trumped substance or that the decision on the Motion was tainted by arguments over technicalities.\u201d\n[78] Counsel for the Coalition complainants notes the distinction between the Court\u2019s task and that of the Tribunal. In the Gregg decision, the Court was reviewing the reasonableness of the Commission\u2019s exercise of its discretion in assessing the preliminary merits of the complaints. Whereas the Tribunal, in the present motion before it, is assessing abuse of process to determine whether the complaints should be preliminarily dismissed. Nevertheless, Mr. Hall describes the Gregg decision as \u201cseverely flawed\u201d and has since given notice of its appeal to the FCA.\n[79] On the surface, these two decisions may look very similar. However, the task before the Tribunal is indeed different than the task before the Commission. Under the CHRA, the Commission is permitted to summarily reject a complaint under the statutory provisions of section 41(1). However, the CHRA affords no statutory option to the Tribunal for the preliminary rejection of a complaint. The only basis upon which the Tribunal may reject a complaint prior to a hearing is under the common law.\n[80] The Commission\u2019s decision not to refer the Gregg complaints to the Tribunal was based on section 41(1)(d) of the CHRA:\n41 (1) Subject to section 40, the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint it appears to the Commission that\n(\u2026)\n(d) the complaint is trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith; or\n(\u2026)\n[Emphasis added.]\nThe courts have developed voluminous jurisprudence guidance with respect to this provision. In the Gregg decision, the Federal Court concluded that the Commission\u2019s actions were reasonable and therefore not reviewable.\n[81] This ruling must be based on the common law and the doctrines of abuse of process that were outlined above. The Tribunal\u2019s powers and functions under the CHRA are different than the Commission\u2019s. The Commission has a preliminary screening and investigative role, acting as a gatekeeper to the inquiry process, which includes consideration of the public interest. The Tribunal, on the other hand, has adjudicative powers granted under the CHRA to hold a full, quasi-judicial de novo inquiry.\n[82] This does not mean that the Tribunal lacks the authority to dismiss a referred complaint on a preliminary basis. But the Tribunal cannot do so relying upon the statutory authority afforded to the Commission under section 41(1) of the CHRA, as occurred in the case of Gregg. Instead, the Tribunal must apply the common law doctrines of finality, in this case, abuse of process by re-litigation. Dismissing a referred complaint on a preliminary basis before the Tribunal, in this case based on a finding of abuse of process by re-litigation, is not identical to the test applicable under section 41(1)(d) of the CHRA. Therefore, while the Gregg decision certainly informs the Tribunal, it does not create a precedent which binds the Tribunal in this ruling.\n[83] It is not lost on me that this ruling has the possibility of creating an apparent judicial inconsistency for the younger complainants\u2019 vis-\u00e0-vis the complainants in the Gregg matter. However, as noted above, the Tribunal has a different role than the Commission. At this stage the Tribunal has not completed any fact finding nor has it rendered a final decision. The Tribunal does not benefit from the preliminary screening that the Commission has in place. In any event, it may be that no judicial inconsistency will occur once the Tribunal has rendered a decision. There is also no certainty of the outcome of the Gregg appeal to the FCA. The issue of judicial uncertainty is but one element of the test for abuse of process by re-litigation. In this case, I do not find that this one element outweighs the other reasons to allow the younger complainants to continue before the Tribunal as I have outlined above.\nX. Conclusion\n[84] In their motion to dismiss, ACPA reiterates the Coalition complainants\u2019 position in the past, at para. 20: \u201cthat there are no new facts which would undermine the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions in the Thwaites\/Adamson decision. In fact the Complainants asserted that it would be an abuse of process for them to be required to call any evidence.\u201d\n[85] In their submissions to this motion to dismiss, Air Canada submits at para. 9 that, \u201c\u2026it is highly improbable that a meaningful change to the normal age of retirement could have occurred in the short time between the retirement of the Thwaites\/Adamson complainants and that of these complainants.\u201d\n[86] The earlier objections to re-litigating the normal age of retirement by the Coalition complainants were made in March and April of 2011, prior to the Tribunal having dismissed the Thwaites\/Adamson complainants. At a time that was some 15 months after the last period considered in the Thwaites\/Adamson matter, the complainants were not putting forward any argument that \u201cmaterial facts\u201d had changed in the industry that would impugn the earlier finding. The last Bailie complainant reached the age of 60 in February of 2012.\n[87] In the interests of judicial economy, consistency, finality, for the sake of the integrity of this Tribunal and in fairness to the Respondents, I am not going to allow the re-litigation of the comparator group for the older pilots in this group of complaints. I am satisfied that the normal age of retirement for commercial airline pilots in Canada, for the periods considered in the Vilven\/Kelly and Thwaites\/Adamson matters, namely up to December 31, 2009, was 60.\n[88] While I am sympathetic to the Respondents\u2019 arguments that it is \u201chighly improbable\u201d that a meaningful change to the material facts affecting the normal age of retirement occurred during the short period after December 31, 2009 until the last Bailie complainant reached the age of 60 in February of 2012, I have not been provided with satisfactory information that there were no changes in the industry.\n[89] I acknowledge the hardship of the Respondents after all this time. However, the words of Justice Mactavish in First Nation, supra, are clear that the Tribunal\u2019s power to dismiss a human rights complaint in advance of a full hearing on the merits \u201cshould be exercised cautiously and then only in the clearest of cases...\u201d (para. 140). Air Canada uses the words \u201chighly improbable\u201d to describe the likelihood of a different finding in this matter. In the Gregg decision, Justice Annis describes the existence of probative evidence showing a different conclusion to be \u201chighly unlikely.\u201d However, it is the role of the Tribunal to weigh actual evidence that is brought before it. While the Commission must necessarily assess the likelihood of the existence of evidence when carrying out its duties under section 41, it is not the role of the Tribunal to speculate whether certain evidence may or may not exist. The Tribunal has no investigatory powers and has no material evidence before it for the younger complainants. It is the right and the obligation of the parties to present that evidence to the Tribunal in a quasi-judicial forum. At the Tribunal stage, summary dismissal should only occur in cases where it is clearly the most appropriate means by which to secure the procedurally fair determination of the complaint. For the younger complainants, this is not one of those cases. The Tribunal should not summarily dismiss a complaint based solely on probabilities or speculation.\n[90] In a motion to dismiss, the onus is on the moving party to satisfy the Tribunal that there is no further evidence to be heard. Counsel for ACPA has suggested that the evidentiary burden should shift to the complainants to show that there were new factors affecting retirement age in 2010, 2011 and 2012. However, I do not think this is correct. As concluded by Justice McTavish in First Nation, supra, parties ought to be given a full hearing except in the clearest of cases, supporting a presumptive right to a hearing. This is consistent with section 50(1) of the CHRA which requires the Tribunal to give parties a full and ample opportunity to present evidence and make representations at an inquiry. It follows that in a motion to dismiss for abuse of process, it is the moving party who must satisfy the Tribunal that this is the clearest of cases where the complaint should be dismissed.\n[91] There is no factual or evidentiary record before the Tribunal regarding the normal age of retirement from 2010 to 2012. Section 50(1) of the CHRA requires the Tribunal to \u201cgive all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity\u2026to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations.\u201d For the complainants in this matter who turned 60 after December 31, 2009, the CHRA compels us to give them the opportunity to be heard.\n[92] While this ruling concludes that we will have a hearing for the younger complainants, I have some sympathy for the Respondents in this matter. They have battled for more than a decade at considerable effort and cost which, they argue, citing the Mowat decision, supra, are costs they cannot recover. The length and cost of proceedings before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal have been a source of criticism in the past.\n[93] While the Tribunal is described as an \u201cadministrative tribunal\u201d, the quasi-constitutional nature of our subject matter assures that parties before us generally wish to argue their position to the fullest extent, as is their right. Injuries may run deep, and reputations are vigorously defended. While Parliament set up an expectation for an \u201cexpeditious\u201d inquiry in the language of our governing legislation, this expectation is tempered by the requirements of natural justice and the procedural rights afforded under sections 48.9(1) and 50(1) of the CHRA. As a result, CHRT hearings rarely proceed as quickly as one would expect in an \u201cadministrative\u201d process.\n[94] In conclusion, the motion to dismiss the complaints of the complainants herein who reached the age of 60 on or before December 31, 2009, is granted for the reasons above.\n[95] For the remaining forty-five (45) complainants who reached the age of 60 on or after January 1, 2010, the motion is dismissed. This dismissal is without prejudice to the Respondents to bring a motion to dismiss again at a later time.\nSigned by\nDavid L.

BACKGROUND\n[1] Mr. Todd, (the \u201cComplainant\u201d) was hired by OC Transpo (the \u201cRespondent\u201d) in 2001 to work as a Bus Operator.\n[2] The Complainant asserts that, in 2004, he was diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (\u201cIBS\u201d) and gastro-esophageal reflux disorder (\u201cGERD\u201d) and required accommodation for these conditions by his employer.\n[3] The Complainant also asserts that he experienced episodes of chronic pain in his neck and shoulder dating back to 2004, and hip and leg pain starting in 2012.\n[4] The Complainant submits that as a result of these and other conditions, he was required to miss work for periods of time on various occasions. His absences from work ultimately became a concern to his employer.\n[5] The Complainant and the Respondent entered into a Continuing Employment Agreement (the \u201cCEA\u201d), which governed, among other things, the Complainant\u2019s absences from work.\n[6] The Complainant was placed on administrative leave in January 2014, and was terminated pursuant to an alleged breach of the CEA on March 10, 2014.\n[7] The circumstances leading up to and including the Complainant\u2019s termination are the subject of this complaint.\nA. The Duty of Fair Representation Complaint\n[8] At the relevant time, the Complainant was a member of the Amalgamated Transit Union (the \u201cATU\u201d). His employment with the Respondent was governed by a collective agreement between ATU Local 279 (the \u201cUnion\u201d) and the Respondent.\n[9] On May 8, 2014, the Complainant filed a complaint pursuant to section 37 of the Canada Labour Code (\u201cCLC\u201d) with the Canadian Industrial Relations Board (the \u201cCIRB\u201d) in which he asserted that the Union failed to discharge its duty of fair representation by refusing to file a discrimination grievance on his behalf, contesting his termination (the \u201cDFR Complaint\u201d).\n[10] Section 37 of the CLC provides that:\nA trade union or representative of a trade union that is the bargaining agent for a bargaining unit shall not act in a manner that is arbitrary, discriminatory or in bad faith in the representation of any of the employees in the unit with respect to their rights under the collective agreement that is applicable to them.\n[11] The Complainant sought a determination of the DFR Complaint by the CIRB (the \u201cCIRB Proceeding\u201d) and submitted that by refusing to grieve his termination, the Union had breached the duty owed to him pursuant to s. 37 of the CLC.\n[12] Although the Respondent appears to have participated in these proceedings, the DFR Complaint was not a proceeding against the Respondent nor was it a consideration of the Complainant\u2019s allegation that he was discriminated against by the Respondent.\n[13] It appears that the CIRB conducted a review based on the paper record before it, having received submissions from the Complainant, the Union and the Respondent.\n[14] On November 25, 2014, the CIRB dismissed the DFR Complaint in writing (the \u201cCIRB Decision\u201d).\n[15] In the CIRB Decision, the Board stated that \u201c[t]he Board\u2019s role under section 37 is to assess the union\u2019s conduct and decision-making process in the handling of a matter, and not the merits of the grievance.\u201d\n[16] The CIRB Decision is a final decision.\nB. The Human Rights Complaint\n[17] On November 16, 2014, the Complainant made a human rights complaint pursuant to section 7 and section 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cCHRA\u201d) alleging that he was discriminated against by his employer on the basis of a disability (the \u201cComplaint\u201d).\n[18] On April 20, 2015, upon filing its response with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) in this matter, the Respondent requested that the Complaint be dismissed on the basis of s. 41(1)(d) of the CHRA. The Respondent claimed that the issues raised in the Complaint had already been addressed by the CIRB in the CIRB Decision.\n[19] On April 5, 2016, the Commission denied the Respondent\u2019s request and issued a report pursuant to s. 41(1) of the CHRA (the \u201cReport\u201d) recommending that the Complaint proceed to an inquiry before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d). In the Report, the Commission determined that the CIRB had:\nonly considered whether the Complainant\u2019s union had breached its duty of fair representation under s. 37 of the CLC and the Complainants human rights allegations against the Respondent were not properly before it. Therefore the substance of the complaint has not been considered. Having regard to all of the above, justice requires the Commission to deal with the complaint.\n[20] The Commission adopted the Report (the \u201cCommission\u2019s Decision\u201d) and advised the parties that they had 30 days to seek judicial review of the Commission\u2019s Decision.\n[21] Neither party sought judicial review of the Commission\u2019s Decision.\n[22] By letter dated June 28, 2016, the Commission referred the Complaint to the Tribunal for inquiry.\n[23] On December 22, 2016, the Complainant filed a statement of particulars with the Tribunal detailing his Complaint.\n[24] On January 17, 2017, the Respondent filed a statement of particulars with the Tribunal in which it responded to the Complaint and alleged (among other things) that the Complaint was an abuse of process. The Respondent further reserved its rights to bring a motion to dismiss the Complaint on that basis.\n[25] In its Reply, filed on January 31, 2017, the Complainant denied that the Complaint constitutes an abuse of process.\n[26] In a letter to the Tribunal sent of February 3, 2017, the Commission (which is not participating in the hearing of this matter, but reserved the right to participate in the pre-hearing process) advised the Tribunal that it wished to make submissions on the proposed motion to dismiss the Complaint for abuse of process. The Commission further requested that any such motion to dismiss be brought as a preliminary matter and not at the final hearing in order that the Commission might have an opportunity to make submissions.\n[27] On February 8, 2017. The Tribunal wrote to the parties requesting that the Respondent bring its motion to dismiss as a preliminary motion.\n[28] On March 24, 2017, the Respondent filed its motion to dismiss the Complaint (the \u201cMotion\u201d).\nC. The Motion to Dismiss\n(i) The Respondent\u2019s Position\n[29] The Respondent submits that the Complaint should be dismissed on the basis that:\ni. It is subject to an issue estoppel,\nor in the alternative that:\ni. It is an abuse of process, and\/or\nii. It is a collateral attack on the CIRB Decision.\n[30] In the further alternative, the Respondent submits that the findings of fact made by the CIRB ought to bind this Tribunal and that the parties should be precluded from challenging those finding in the Tribunal proceedings.\n(ii) The Complainant\u2019s Position\n[31] The Complainant submits that the Motion is unfounded for the following reasons:\ni. The issues before the Tribunal differ from those before the CIRB; and\nii. The parties before the Tribunal differ from those that appeared before the CIRB;\n[32] The Complainant further submits that the Tribunal is not bound by the findings of a prior proceeding as:\ni. There is no precedent for doing so in absence of a finding that the issue estoppel or abuse of process doctrines apply;\nii. Doing so might introduce information out of context in a manner that would detract from the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry;\niii. Factual matters may not have been properly canvassed in the CIRB Proceeding for the purpose of determining the Complainant\u2019s human rights complaint; and\niv. It is against the public interest to have human rights issues determined without the benefit of oral evidence.\n(iii) The Commission\u2019s Position\n[33] The Commission adopted the position advanced by the Complainant, and submitted that\ni. The Respondent\u2019s motion itself is a collateral attack on the Commission Decision;\nii. The Tribunal is not bound by the CIRB\u2019s factual findings, rather such findings or recitations ought to be treated by the Tribunal as hearsay.\nII. THE ISSUES\nA. Does the Tribunal have the jurisdiction to dismiss a Complaint by way of a preliminary motion?\nB. Should the Complaint be dismissed by operation of the finality doctrines of:\na. Collateral attack;\nb. Issue Estoppel; and\/or\nc. Abuse of Process?\nC. What bearing, if any, should findings of fact made in a prior proceeding have of the determination of the Complaint?\nIII. THE LAW\nA. Jurisdiction of the Tribunal\n[34] The proceedings of the Tribunal are conducted pursuant to the CHRA. Section 50(2) of the CHRA provides that\nIn the course of hearing and determining any matter under inquiry, the member or panel may decide all questions of law or fact necessary to determining the matter.\nIt is well established that the Tribunal has the authority to dismiss a complaint as a preliminary matter (Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada Post Corp., 2004 FC 81 (\u201cCremasco\u201d), affirmed in Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canada Post Corp., 2004 FCA 363 at paras. 14-15; Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FC 445 (\u201cFNCFCS\u201d) at para. 140; Bezoine v. City of Ottawa, 2017 CHRT 2 at paras. 33-39). However, the Federal Court has cautioned against dismissing a complaint without a full hearing except in \u201cthe clearest of cases\u201d (FNCFCS at para 140).\n[35] Thus, the Tribunal is within its jurisdiction to determine this motion at this time.\nB. The Finality Doctrines\n[36] The finality doctrines of collateral attack, issue estoppel and abuse of process by relitigation stem from one of the most basic principles of the common law: that an issue, once determined by a competent court or tribunal, cannot be redetermined except by an appeal or judicial review of the initial decision. This principle is sometimes articulated axiomatically to say that \u201ca party should only be vexed once in the same cause\u201d.\n[37] The twin values of finality and fairness lie at the heart of these doctrines and these values must be held in tension, with neither one eclipsing the other. This point was highlighted in the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s (the \u201cSCC\u201d) overview of the finality doctrines in British Columbia (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) v. Figliola, 2011 SCC 52 (\u201cFigliola\u201d), where Abella J. wrote:\nAll of these questions go to determining whether the substance of a complaint has been \u201cappropriately dealt with\u201d. At the end of the day, it really is a question of whether it makes sense to expend public and private resources on the relitigation of what is essentially the same dispute. (see para 37)\n[38] In many ways, the application of the finality doctrines is a highly discretionary exercise, driven by the needs of both substantive and procedural justice. As the Court stated in Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., 2001 SCC 44 (\u201cDanyluk\u201d), and a majority of the SCC reiterated in Penner v. Niagara (Regional Police Services Board), 2013 SCC 19 (\u201cPenner\u201d): \u201ca judicial doctrine developed to serve the ends of justice should not be applied mechanistically to work an injustice\u201d (Danyluk at para 1; Penner at para 30).\n[39] On the motion before me, the Respondent has failed to demonstrate that the CIRB Decision that the Union discharged the duty of fair representation owed to the Complainant addressed the same question as that which is before the Tribunal in this inquiry. The finality of the CIRB Decision is not jeopardized by the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of the Complaint.\n[40] In absence of evidence that the same question has already been decided by a prior proceeding, the finality doctrines of collateral attack, issue estoppel and abuse of process by relitigation are of little relevance.\n[41] While I am of the view that it is possible for a prior finding of fact to bind a subsequent adjudicative process by operation of the finality doctrines, I do not find sufficient evidence to warrant an Order to that effect in this case, at this time. What\u2019s more, I am not convinced that the interests of justice or the cause of fairness would be served by imposing such a limitation on the scope of Tribunal\u2019s inquiry into this Complaint.\n[42] We now turn to consider in more detail each of the specific doctrines invoked by the Respondent on the Motion.\n(i) Collateral Attack\n[43] The doctrine of collateral attack was articulated by the SCC in Wilson v. The Queen, [1983] 2 SCR 594 at page 599:\nIt has long been a fundamental rule that a court order, made by a court having jurisdiction to make it, stands and is binding and conclusive unless it is set aside on appeal or lawfully quashed. It is also well settled in the authorities that such an order may not be attacked collaterally\u2014and a collateral attack may be described as an attack made in proceedings other than those whose specific object is the reversal, variation, or nullification of the order or judgment. (Wilson at 599)\n[44] A collateral attack is not to be confused with relitigation of issues or facts already decided within an Order (Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79, 2003 SCC 63 (\u201cCUPE\u201d) at para 33; Garland v. Consumers' Gas Co., 2004 SCC 25 at para 71). Rather, it is a specific doctrine precluding a challenge to an Order or the execution of an Order.\n[45] If a subsequent proceeding does not constitute an attack on a final Order, or represent and attempt to preclude the execution of an Order, then the doctrine of collateral attack has no application (Donald J. Lange, The Doctrine of Res Judicata in Canada, 4th ed. (Toronto: LexisNexis), 2015 at page 469).\n[46] The Complaint, in which the Complainant is seeking a remedy from the Respondent (his former employer) for discrimination, does not represent an attack on the CIRB\u2019s Decision that the Union duly discharged its duty to fairly represent the Complainant.\n[47] The Respondent has failed to demonstrate that the Complaint represents an attack on the Order made as a result of the CIRB Decision, or the implementation thereof.\n[48] The Complaint therefore is not a collateral attack.\n(ii) Issue Estoppel\n[49] Where an issue has already been decided by a competent body, that decision may be said to create a bar (an estoppel) against a redetermination of the same issue in a future proceeding.\nThe law of issue estoppel in Canada builds on three factors. An issue estoppel can be created by a proceeding where these preconditions are met:\ni. the judicial decision which is said to create the estoppel is final;\nii. the same question was decided in the prior proceeding; and\niii. the parties to the judicial decision (or their privies) were the same persons as the parties to the proceedings in which the estoppel is raised. (Danyluk at para 25)\nThe SCC in Penner confirmed that the leading case for the application of the doctrine of issue estoppel to a Tribunal decision is Danyluk. Justice Binnie, writing for the Court, quotes Dickson J. (as he then was) in adopting a strict approach to the application of the issue estoppel analysis. \u201cIt will not suffice if the question arose collaterally or incidentally in the earlier proceeding or is one which must be inferred by argument from the judgment.\u201d (Danyluk at para 24)\n[50] The three factors are thus said to create the preconditions for the operation of issue estoppel (Danyluk at para 25). If any one of the three conditions are not present in a given case, then an issue estoppel does not arise.\n[51] Even where the preconditions are established, the Court in Danyluk cautions against a mechanistic application of the doctrine, and articulates a further step in the analysis required to determine if an issue estoppel arises (Danyluk at para 33).\n[52] If the party seeking to invoke an estoppel is able to demonstrate that the preconditions are established, \u201cthe court must still consider whether, as a matter of discretion, issue estoppel ought to be applied\u201d [emphasis added] (Danyluk at para 33). This step has been referred to as the fairness test.\n[53] The criteria to be considered when applying the fairness test are not fixed, but may include:\nThe purpose of the legislative framework enacted for each proceeding;\nThe availability of an appeal;\nThe procedural safeguards available to the parties;\nThe expertise of the decision makers;\nThe circumstances giving rise to the prior proceeding; and\nThe potential injustice of applying an estoppel in this case. (Danyluk at paras 68-80)\n[54] In applying the Danyluk test to this Motion, let us consider whether the preconditions for an issue estoppel are met:\n(a) Was the CIRB Decision a final decision?\n[55] There is no dispute that the CIRB Decision was a final decision.\n(b) Is the question raised by the Complaint the same as the question that was determined in the CIRB Decision?\n[56] The CIRB Decision determines whether the Union discharged its duty to fairly represent its member in the manner prescribed by section 37 of the CLC.\n[57] The CIRB made no determinations or orders about the Respondent, or the Respondent\u2019s conduct, nor would it have had the jurisdiction to do so in the CIRB Proceeding.\n[58] What\u2019s more, as was described above, the CIRB made an explicit point of stating in the CIRB Decision that it is not making a determination of the Complainant\u2019s grievance against his employer.\n[59] In my view, this fact is fatal to the Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the Complaint on the basis of the finality doctrines. Where a prior proceeding does not consider the same question or determine the same issues as those in which the finality doctrines are being invoked, the adjudicative tools of issue estoppel, collateral attack and abuse of process by relitigation are of little use.\n(c) Are the parties to the Complaint the same as the parties to the CIRB proceeding?\n[60] A duty of fair representation complaint is a proceeding between a union and its member.\n[61] The Respondent was not the subject of the CIRB Decision. While there was very little evidence before me on this factual question, it appears from the language of the CIRB Decision that the Respondent and the Complainant both participated in the CIRB Proceeding and likely had an opportunity to be heard on the issues before the CIRB. As such, it is likely that both the Complainant and Respondent were parties to both proceedings.\n[62] There is insufficient evidence before me to determine with finality whether the Respondent was a party to the CIRB Proceeding. However, as I have already found that the CIRB did not consider the same question as that which is raised in the Complaint, determining whether the Respondent was a party to the CIRB Proceeding is not necessary to dispose of this motion.\n(d) Does fairness nonetheless operate against the application of the doctrine of issue estoppel in this case?\n[63] Only when the preconditions for the operation of the doctrine of issue estoppel are met do we turn to consider whether fairness would nonetheless preclude the operation of the doctrine in the specific case.\n[64] As the preconditions are not met in this case, there is no need to consider the fairness factors on this motion.\n[65] Having said that, as I have found that the CIRB Decision expressly states that the CIRB was not attempting to address or resolve the grievance underlying Mr. Todd\u2019s DFR Complaint, I find that it would be unfair to use the CIRB Decision to preclude the Complainant from raising those issues here.\n(iii) Abuse of Process by Relitigation\n[66] Even in a case where the strict requirements of issue estoppel are not met, the doctrine of abuse of process can nonetheless preclude a relitigation of the same issue twice where it would be abusive to do so.\nCanadian courts have applied the doctrine of abuse of process to preclude litigation in circumstances where the strict requirements of issue estoppel (typically the privity\/mutuality requirement) are not met but where allowing the litigation to proceed would nonetheless violate such principles as judicial economy, consistency, finality, and the integrity of the administration of justice. (CUPE at para 37)\n[67] Although the formal requirements that are applied with regard to issue estoppel are relaxed when considering the doctrine of abuse of process, the mischief with which the court is concerned is the same. The doctrine of abuse of process is engaged where a party, dissatisfied with the result obtained before one decision maker, seeks to achieve a different result in another forum to the effect of wasted time and resources for the parties and the proper administration of justice (Danyluk at para 20; CUPE at paras 37, 51).\n[68] In considering the application of the doctrine of abuse of process (albeit within the context of a different statutory framework) the SCC in Figliola confirmed several key principles to be considered in the abuse of process analysis: \u201cjudicial economy, consistency, finality, and the integrity of the administration of justice\u201d. (Figliola at para 33; CUPE at para 37)\n[69] The determination as to whether a subsequent proceeding constitutes an abuse of process is a discretionary matter.\n[70] In Penner the SCC elaborated on the discretionary application of issue estoppel and the need for flexibility and in CUPE, the SCC confirmed that the discretionary factors for issue estoppel apply equally to the doctrine of abuse of process. (CUPE at para 53)\n[71] The SCC also clarified that the requisite fairness considerations apply to both the conduct of the prior proceeding, as well as to any consideration of whether the prior proceeding can preclude the litigation of related facts or findings in a subsequent proceeding.\nBroadly speaking, the factors identified in the jurisprudence illustrate that unfairness may arise in two main ways which overlap and are not mutually exclusive. First, the unfairness of applying issue estoppel may arise from the unfairness of the prior proceedings. Second, even where the prior proceedings were conducted fairly and properly having regard to their purposes, it may nonetheless be unfair to use the results of that process to preclude the subsequent claim. [Emphasis added] (Penner at para 39)\n[72] I have already found that the CIRB Decision did not address or attempt to resolve the Complainant\u2019s Complaint. Rather, the CIRB expressly stated that it was making no attempt to do so.\n[73] Although the material before me on this Motion is somewhat incomplete in this regard, it does not appear that either the parties to the CIRB Proceeding or the Board considered or addressed the underlying discrimination grievance. Nor could the parties, based on the statutory purpose and scope of a section 37 proceeding, reasonably have concluded that the CIRB Decision would dispense with the Complainant\u2019s allegation of discrimination on the part of the employer.\n[74] While the DFR Complaint and the Complaint arose from an overlapping factual matrix, the two proceedings do not consider the same issues or even bind the same parties.\n[75] A future Tribunal decision regarding the merits of the Complaint does not run the risk of redetermining the issues decided in the CIRB Decision, nor could any such decision regarding discrimination by the Respondent experienced by the Complainant (or not) undermine the CIRB Decision and therefore there is no real concern regarding finality, consistency of result or the integrity of the administration of justice as between the CIRB Proceeding and the Tribunal proceeding.\n[76] Because of the distinct nature of the two proceedings, I also find that there is no real concern with judicial economy in this case. Any sacrifice of judicial resources made as a result of the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of evidence that formed part of the CIRB Decision is offset by the more important consideration of ensuring the procedural fairness of a full hearing of the Complaint. For the forgoing reasons, I find that the Complaint is not an abuse of process.\nC. Prior Factual Findings\n[77] The Respondent raises an alternative argument that certain factual findings made in the CIRB Decision bind this Tribunal, and that the Complainant ought to be prevented from raising those issues at a hearing before the Tribunal.\n[78] In order to make such a finding, this Tribunal would have to be convinced that the interests of fairness and the administration of justice are best served by foreclosing certain areas of inquiry at the hearing.\n[79] In my view, to limit the scope of the hearing in this way would be an unusual step- although not without precedent (Davidson v. Health Canada, 2012 CHRT 1 at para 16 (\u201cDavidson\u201d)).\n[80] While I agree with the Respondent that it is within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to make such an order where a relitigation of already determined facts would constitute an abuse of process, I do not agree that a reconsideration of facts necessarily constitutes an abuse of process. Furthermore, for the reasons detailed below, I do not find that making such an order in this case, and on the basis of the facts currently before me, would be in the interest of justice.\n(i) The Respondents Submissions\n[81] In making its alternative argument, the Respondent relies on three cases in support of its submission that the Complainant should be precluded from leading evidence that was the subject of a factual finding made by the CIRB. The Respondent submits that a relitigation of facts that were the subject of a finding by the CIRB constitutes an abuse of process and should be barred by the Tribunal.\n[82] The Respondent relies on OC Transpo v A.T.U., Local 279, [2005] 142 L.A.C. (4th) 343 in support of its motion. In that case, an arbitration panel found that a relitigation of factual findings arising from a prior criminal proceeding would constitute an abuse of process. It appears that, in that case, each of the adjudicative bodies were examining the same conduct of the same party, albeit through a different legal lens and applying a different standard of proof.\n[83] The arbitration panel specifically noted the SCC\u2019s language in CUPE, highlighting that a finding arising from a prior robustly-contested proceeding should be shown deference.\n[84] In re George Brown, 1644-13-M OLRB, 2014 CanLII 38605 (ON LRB) , the Ontario Labour Relations Board (the \u201cOLRB\u201d) considered whether or not to adopt factual findings made by the same parties before a labour arbitrator interpreting a different but related section of the Labour Relations Act (the \u201cLRA\u201d). Although the OLRB was considering different subsections of s. 5 of the LRA, it determined that in the specific context, conflicting findings directed at the same parties in closely related questions would \u201cundermine the integrity of the labour relations system\u201d.\n[85] In Davidson, this Tribunal considered whether evidence ought to be put before it in respect of the fairness of a selection process that had already been the subject of a proceeding before the Public Service Commission Appeal Board (the \u201cPSCAB\u201d). Once again, the Tribunal found that the matter at issue in the second proceeding had been through a rigorous process and had been the subject of two appeals, each of which had considered the fairness of the Complainant\u2019s treatment in the selection process.\n[86] The Tribunal in Davidson found that the precise allegations of unfairness had been made previously and had been determined by the PSCAB. The Tribunal was satisfied that the material questions had been asked and answered and the Member determined that a reconsideration would not be a good use of judicial resources in that case.\n(ii) The Complainant\u2019s Submissions\n[87] The Complainant submits that the findings made by the CIRB were, as a matter of fact, made for another legislative purpose, in the absence of some procedural protections that would be available before the Tribunal, and were not made in the context of a human rights analysis. As such, the Complainant submits that it would be unfair to read in findings from a different forum.\n[88] The Complainant did not cite any authorities in support of his submissions.\n(iii) The Commission\u2019s Submissions\n[89] The Commission dealt with this issue only in passing, and submitted that the findings of the CIRB are elements of evidence that a Tribunal can take into account, and which ought to be given the same weight as hearsay, although it cites no authority for this proposition.\n(iv) Analysis\n[90] In each of the cases relied upon by the Respondent, the adjudicative body making an order to preclude relitigation of certain facts determined that relitigation would be unfair and\/or could risk undermining the administration of justice on the facts of the specific case before it.\n[91] In this case, as has been previously discussed, the essential question that was at issue before the CIRB is fundamentally different than that which is before this Tribunal. Furthermore, there are critical distinctions between the two proceedings that must be weighed when considering the applicability of findings made in the CIRB context to the fact finding exercise being pursued before this Tribunal, such as the different legislative objectives, the distinct legal questions, the disparate procedural safeguards and even the different parties that are the subject of each proceeding.\n[92] None of the cases relied upon by the Respondent stand for a proposition that a relitigation of facts considered by a prior proceeding cannot be put before a subsequent adjudicative body where it would be in the interest of justice to do so. The abuse of process doctrine is a tool designed to enhance the administration of justice, and should not be deployed to work an injustice.\n[93] The application of the doctrine of abuse of process by relitigation is a highly discretionary, and requires a careful consideration of the specific facts surrounding the proceedings.\n[94] As a general matter, it would appear to me that the greater the differences between the two proceedings, the less the subsequent proceeding ought to be bound by the former.\n[95] Any application of the abuse of process doctrine to the facts in this case, should be subject to an analysis of the Danyluk fairness factors. Based on what is before me at this stage, I am particularly concerned with the following issues:\ni. The different legislative purposes of a section 37 panel and this Tribunal;\nii. The different procedural safeguards available to the parties in each proceeding;\niii. The quality of the evidence presented and relied upon in each proceeding;\niv. The expertise of the CIRB panel in considering human rights issues; and\nv. The potential injustice of the CIRB Decision limiting the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of the Complaint.\n[96] I am not convinced at this stage that it would be in the interest of justice to limit the facts to be considered at the hearing into the Complaint. However, I do not preclude the possibility of making such a finding in the face of a more complete factual picture.\n[97] Although I do not find cause to grant the Respondent\u2019s motion at this time, in my view, any questions of the admissibility and appropriate weight to accord the facts raised in this inquiry are best determined in the context of the hearing of the Complaint.\nIV. DISPOSITION\n[98] Having regard to all of the above considerations, I am not convinced that the issues before the Tribunal have adequately been addressed in a prior proceeding. Consequently, I do not find any basis on which to apply the finality doctrines to dismiss the Complaint.\n[99] Although there is some overlap between the facts that were before the CIRB in their consideration of the DFR Complaint and those at issue before this Tribunal, based on the evidence and submissions before me on this Motion, and upon consideration, I do not find sufficient grounds to grant the Respondent\u2019s motion to prevent the parties from leading evidence on factual matters considered by the CIRB at this stage of the proceedings.\n[100] I do not believe that the interest of justice would be served by foreclosing any avenue of inquiry at this stage.\n[101] Accordingly, I dismiss the Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the Complaint.\n[102] I also dismiss the Respondent\u2019s motion to narrow the factual inquiry at this stage of the proceeding.\nSigned by\nKirsten Mercer\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nJuly 10, 2017\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT2160\/3416\nStyle of Cause:\nJamison Todd v.

Conclusion 39\nI. Introduction\n[1] This is a decision regarding two separate complaints dated April 13, 2012 and made by Mr. Keith Waddle (the \u201cComplainant\u201d) to the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCHRC\u201d). They allege the Respondents, Canadian Pacific Railway (\u201cCP\u201d or the \u201cEmployer\u201d) and Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (\u201cTCRC\u201d or the \u201cUnion\u201d) discriminated against him during the course of his employment on the grounds of disability and family status.\n[2] On July 30, 2014, pursuant to section 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the \u201cCHRA\u201d), the CHRC requested the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) institute an inquiry into the complaints at which time they were consolidated as they involved substantially the same issues of fact and law (the \u201cComplaint\u201d).\n[3] The Complainant, through his then counsel, filed a Statement of Particulars (the \u201cSOP\u201d) setting out the details of his Complaint. The Respondents each filed a response to the SOP. The Complainant appeared at the hearing and gave evidence, initially with counsel and later representing himself. The Complainant also had an expert witness give evidence on his behalf. Each of the Respondents appeared at the hearing with benefit of counsel and called several witnesses. The CHRC did not attend the hearing and made no submissions.\nII. Decision\n[4] For the reasons set out below, I find no prima facie case of discrimination based on family status against either Respondent, and that portion of the Complaint is dismissed.\n[5] I further find for the reasons set out below that the Complainant has shown a prima facie case of discrimination based on the ground of disability against each of the Respondents. However, the restrictions imposed on his employment were based on a bona fide occupational requirement (\u201cBFOR\u201d), and the Complainant was fully accommodated at all relevant times to the point of undue hardship. The claim of discrimination on the ground of disability is dismissed.\nIII. Issues\n1. Did the Complainant establish a prima facie case of discrimination by CP under section 7 of the CHRA, based on Family Status?\n2. Did the Complainant establish a prima facie case of discrimination by CP under section 7 of the CHRA based on Disability?\n3. Did the Complainant establish a prima facie case of discrimination under section 10 of the CHRA by TCRC based on Family Status?\n4. Did the Complainant establish a prima facie case of discrimination under section 10 of the CHRA by TCRC based on Disability?\n5. If the Complainant establishes a prima facie case of discrimination based on disability, can the Respondents or either of them prove that the impugned restrictions were based on a BFOR?\na. Was the restriction on the Complainant\u2019s work adopted for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job?\nb. Was the restriction adopted in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of that legitimate work-related purpose?\nc. Was the restriction reasonably necessary such that it was impossible to accommodate the Complainant without imposing undue hardship on the employer, having regard to health, safety and cost?\nd. Did the Respondent TCRC, by virtue of its duty as a third party in the accommodation process, accommodate the Complainant to the point of undue hardship?\n6. Did the Complainant take reasonable steps to facilitate the accommodation process?\nIV. Facts\n[6] The Complainant began working for CP in 1986. In 2011 he was employed as a locomotive engineer (an \u201cLE\u201d) at CP\u2019s terminal in Lethbridge, Alberta (the \u201cHome Terminal\u201d) and was a member of the Respondent TCRC. In this job, he was driving trains from his home terminal to various other terminals in Southern Alberta (the \u201cAway Terminals\u201d) and back.\n[7] By 2011, the Complainant was in unassigned service. This meant he was required to be on-call during his shifts and would get a phone call during this on-call period, giving him at least two hours\u2019 notice of his start time. After arriving at the given start time, he would be required to operate a train for up to 12 hours to an Away Terminal, then would be allowed up to 8 hours of rest time, after which he was on-call again waiting to begin the up to 12 hour shift back to the Home Terminal.\n[8] While employed by CP, the Complainant experienced a number of medical issues, including ongoing difficulty with his neck and spine and osteoarthritis in his knee. These conditions had been raised with Occupational Health and Safety (\u201cOHS\u201d) at CP over the years but had not prevented the Complainant from carrying out the job of LE in unassigned service. By 2010, however, the Complainant was experiencing increased difficulties with sleeping, and increasing anxiety, while waiting to be called for a shift. As a result, he was forced to report medically unfit for work 59 times in 2010 and 33 times in the first half of 2011. He also reported to his physician that he had fallen asleep on two or three occasions while driving a train.\n[9] The Complainant\u2019s evidence was consistently that, regardless of his medical status, he preferred to stay in unassigned service as an LE out of the Lethbridge terminal. A position with CP in assigned service as an LE, by contrast, involved set shifts in the yard at the Lethbridge terminal, with no call-out window.\n[10] CP led evidence, unchallenged by TCRC and the Complainant, that the Complainant\u2019s position as an LE was Safety Critical. In a Safety Critical position, impaired performance due to a medical condition could result in a significant incident affecting the health and safety of employees, the public, property or the environment.\n[11] The Complainant sought out an expert physician, Board Certified in Sleep Medicine, who was also a Sleep Medicine Consultant (the \u201cSleep Specialist\u201d) on April 11, 2011. The Complainant gave evidence, as did the Sleep Specialist, who was an expert witness for the Complainant, that he did not discuss with her the general working conditions or options at CP, and that she was not familiar with railway operations generally. Instead, the Complainant asked the Sleep Specialist to recommend to his Employer an LE position in unassigned service with a call-out window restricted to the period between 5 a.m. and 5 p.m. He asked for this schedule because it had worked for him when he was based in Calgary a number of years prior, at which terminal this particular call-out window was applied to all LEs in unassigned service.\n[12] Based on her diagnosis of a suspicion of Circadian Sleep Rhythm Disorder, the Sleep Specialist recommended a call-out window of 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. for a three month trial period. The Sleep Specialist\u2019s evidence was that when she made this recommendation, she did not know what other options the Complainant had, nor did she know that the 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. call-out window could still have required the Complainant to drive a train overnight. She recommended it because the Complainant requested it.\n[13] OHS sought and on June 20, 2011 received a clarification from the Sleep Specialist that the Complainant could work 12 hour shifts, and could work past 5 p.m., as long as he received the call to start work before 5 p.m. The Chief Medical Officer (\u201cCMO\u201d) gave evidence that after considering the Sleep Specialist\u2019s report, her clarification and existing medical records on the Complainant\u2019s other medical conditions, OHS created a Fitness To Work Assessment Form (\u201cFTWAF\u201d) that confirmed the Complainant could continue to work in the Safety Critical Position of LE, with a call out window between 5 a.m. to 5 p.m., 12 hour shifts, and lifting restrictions.\n[14] OHS sent the FTWAF to CP\u2019s Return to Work (RTW) Committee, for consideration of an appropriate accommodation. On July 6, 2011, this FTAWF and a proposed accommodation plan were the subject of a RTW meeting involving the Complainant, a member of CP\u2019s RTW Committee, and two members of TCRC (\u201cFirst RTW Meeting\u201d).\n[15] The Complainant\u2019s evidence was that at the time of the First RTW Meeting, he wanted CP to create him a position as an LE in unassigned service at Lethbridge, with a restricted 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. call-out window. CP\u2019s evidence was that they rejected this option because the call-out window could not be managed at the Away Terminals, as no other employees at Lethbridge used it.\n[16] The Complainant\u2019s evidence was that he thought everyone involved in his return to work process would understand the Sleep Specialists\u2019 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. call-out restrictions would not apply at the Away Terminals, and that he told CP and TCRC at the First RTW Meeting that he would seek a further modification of his medical restrictions, to limit the 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. call-out window to the Home Terminal.\n[17] Given, however that at the time of the First RTW Meeting, the Complainant was still restricted to a 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. call-out window at all locations, other potential accommodations were discussed. These included: office work\u2014rejected because the Complaint could not read well; relocation\u2014rejected because the Complainant was unwilling to relocate; mechanical engineering positions\u2014rejected because of the need for displacement of a more senior employee; and finally, an accommodation within his own job\u2014rejected due to his medical inability to manage the call-out windows during shifts.\n[18] The Complainant\u2019s evidence was that he had asked his Union representatives at the First RTW Meeting to indicate on the RTW Plan that he was unwilling to relocate due to family obligations. Relocation was an issue in this accommodation process, as there were positions in Calgary in which the Complainant could have been accommodated. The original RTW Plan did not make reference to family obligations, but instead just stated that the Complainant was unwilling to relocate. The Complainant took significant issue with this at the hearing, and gave evidence that the failure to indicate family status obligations on this form was part of a plan to force him to relocate at some later date. TCRC\u2019s witnesses refuted this. The Tribunal will not reproduce this evidence in detail, as the RTW Plan was ultimately revised to include family obligations as a reason for not relocating, and the Complainant was never required to relocate.\n[19] At the conclusion of the First RTW Meeting, an RTW Plan was signed that included OHS\u2019 medical restrictions. The RTW Plan contemplated the Complainant working any of the day and afternoon shifts in assigned service, as an LE in the Lethbridge Yard. These shifts had no call-out window, and complied with his lifting restrictions, so he could work 5 shifts per week within his restrictions as they stood at that time.\n[20] The Respondent CP did call evidence about its refusal to create a unique position in unassigned service, with a 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. call-out window at the Lethbridge terminal:\na. The 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. call-out schedule applied to all the unassigned LEs at the Calgary terminal. It did not exist in Lethbridge;\nb. Additional employees would, depending on the time of call-out, be required to travel to an Away Terminal to bring back trains, should those trains be needed before the Complainant\u2019s call-out window;\nc. The schedule would involve increased uncertainty for other employees, including the conductor, who travelled on the trains with the Complainant, as they would be required to wait additional amounts of time at the Away Terminal to support the call-out window;\nd. The increased uncertainly in the scheduling of the employees could lead to safety concerns in their work, which was Safety Critical; and\ne. It would likely result in a loss of income for the Complainant, as he would miss shifts that came outside his call-out window, that would then go to an LE with no such restrictions.\n[21] I find creating a 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. call-out window for the Complainant in Lethbridge would have caused considerable expense to CP and would have posed a health and safety risk to other CP employees. The Complaint\u2019s suggestion during the accommodation process that the call-out window could be applied only at the Home Terminal --and not the Away Terminal-- was medically counter-indicated, and could not be considered by OHS in light of the restrictions the Complainant\u2019s Sleep Specialist had recommended. I accept CP\u2019s CMO\u2019s evidence that a medical restriction, if necessary, must be applied consistently. However, I also find as a question of fact, based in particular on the Sleep Specialists\u2019 own evidence, that she would not have recommended this 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. call-out window if she had known it could have resulted in the Complainant driving a train overnight. This proposed accommodation was medically counter-indicated by the Complainant\u2019s own physician, and therefore does not warrant detailed consideration.\n[22] Even though, as a result of the First RTW Meeting, an accommodation in assigned service had been developed for the Complainant, he continued to try to modify his medical restrictions to resolve the Employer\u2019s concerns about managing the 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. call-out window at the Away Terminals. He spoke to his Sleep Specialist, and asked her to confirm that he needed the 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. call out window restriction to apply only at the Home Terminal. She provided this confirmation.\n[23] The CMO gave evidence that it was inconsistent with the Complainant\u2019s medical diagnosis to have a medical restriction that applied in one location, but not another. Given this, OHS did not relay the modified restriction to management and the Union, but instead asked the Sleep Specialist for clarification.\n[24] While this discussion about restrictions between the Sleep Specialist and OHS was ongoing, on July 19, 2011, a letter of agreement was executed between CP and TCRC that allowed for the terms of the Complainant\u2019s RTW (\u201cFirst RTW Agreement\u201d). He was to work in assigned service in the Lethbridge Yard as an LE, and if needed, a more senior member of TCRC would be bumped to allow the Complainant to work the more senior employee\u2019s shifts. At this time, however, no bump would be required, because the Complainant\u2019s restrictions (which at this point still allowed for overnight shifts), would allow him to work five shifts a week within his seniority.\n[25] Subsequent to this First RTW Agreement, the Complainant made a telephone call to an OHS nurse at CP, of which he made an audio recording. The Complainant, at the hearing of this matter, submitted a recording of several telephone calls he had had with members of CP management, employees with OHS, and his Union representatives. All the recordings were made without the knowledge of the other participants in the calls. These recordings had not been previously disclosed to either of the Respondents. The Respondents objected to their admission, based on issues of timeliness, reliability and credibility. Also, the Respondent TCRC raised a concern that allowing surreptitious recordings to be admitted as evidence in the hearing could stifle open discussions in the labour context.\n[26] Despite the arguments of the Respondents, I allowed the tapes to be admitted, in accordance with section 50(3)(c), and subject to a subsequent assessment of their weight. I have considered their reliability and the credibility of the statements made within them, and I note a number of concerns. There is no ability for the Tribunal to assess the extent to which the participants in the calls felt the obligation to be truthful on those calls. Some of the recordings produced were of poor quality, and portions of the calls were inaudible. Some of the recordings were incomplete. The Complainant was able to provide only a general time period, rather than a particular date, for many of the calls. Furthermore, many of the statements made by the Complainant in the recordings were simply a repetition of his position before this Tribunal.\n[27] With regard to TCRC\u2019s argument that admission of these tapes would stifle communications in labour matters, I reject same. These discussions, whether recorded or not, would to a large extent be admissible in this matter, based on the relevance of their content. The only distinction is how the evidence was given: by tape, rather than through testimony of a live witness.\n[28] To the extent that the aforementioned concerns give rise to issues of both the reliability and credibility of the statements made therein, I have accorded little weight to the recordings. Also, to the extent that the recordings simply tend to replicate evidence the Complainant himself gave at the hearing, they did not assist the Tribunal in resolving any dispute of material fact.\n[29] In the Complainant\u2019s recording of his conversation with the OHS nurse after the First RTW Agreement, the Complainant stated he had been open to working overnight in unassigned service on the road, but he could not work overnight in assigned service in the yard. The OHS nurse advised him, that according to his medical profile, he was not medically restricted from working overnight only from certain call-outs, and his medical restrictions would have to be updated to deal with overnight shifts.\n[30] In August of 2011, the Complainant had his Sleep Specialist update his restrictions to allow him to work in the yard, provided he had a regular start time every day with no \u2018graveyard shifts\u2019. It is only at this point that the medical restrictions changed from a restricted call-out to restricted shifts. The Sleep Specialist\u2019s evidence was that it was only at this point that the Complainant advised her as to the availability of assigned service.\n[31] The CMO communicated these revised restrictions to the Complainant\u2019s manager and the Union. Given some confusion as to the meaning of a graveyard shift, the Complainant continued to be assigned two shifts requiring him to work past midnight. After communication by the Complainant with OHS, the RTW Committee, the Employer and TCRC, this restriction was ultimately applied appropriately by November of 2011.\n[32] In or around September 2011, CP drafted a second RTW Agreement (the \u201cSecond RTW Agreement\u201d), which included the restrictions of morning and afternoon shifts only. The Second RTW Agreement also required that TCRC bump a more senior person, if needed, to allow the Complainant to work within his restrictions. TCRC\u2019s evidence was that in order to allow the Complainant to have a guarantee of 5 shifts per week within his restrictions, a more senior LE who was very close to retirement, and had ongoing health issues, would have to be bumped. The Union did not sign the Second RTW Agreement.\n[33] At all relevant times, shifts were assigned to employees of CP based on a bid-card they submitted, and their respective seniority. TCRC\u2019s evidence was that they repeatedly asked the Complainant to update his bid-card to ensure he got all the additional shifts he was entitled to, within his seniority (in addition to the three shifts he already had per week). TCRC\u2019s evidence was that completing this bid-card was a simple standard process with which all employees of CP would be familiar.\n[34] Between late September and November of 2011, during which time the Complainant had three shifts per week in assigned service with the opportunity to bid for additional shifts, the Complainant continued to seek further accommodation, and in particular, to return to unassigned service. The records from his Sleep Specialist include the following annotations in November 2011:\nHe would like to be eligible to work shifts on the road again, rather than being restricted to the yard only. As we had discussed, this was something that we had requested only because he did not think that there were any shifts on the road that would be able to meet his accommodation need\u2026He has requested my support for several possible shifts. I made it clear to Keith that while I can make recommendations as to his start times, I would not be providing any recommendations in terms of the nature or location of work.\n[35] The CMO\u2019s evidence was that the Complainant\u2019s case was one of the most complicated in the workplace. In the period between April and November of 2011, OHS and the Complainant\u2019s physicians were trying to clarify not only the new restrictions regarding his sleep disorder, but also the additional restrictions regarding his osteoarthritis in his knee (a changing and ongoing condition), as well as his lifting restrictions resulting from his C-spine injury. The efforts of OHS during this time were extensive, and the records show continual ongoing review of \u2014and requests for\u2014 medical information and clarification. The records also show that the Complainant was in contact with OHS by telephone.\n[36] During this time, TCRC, the Complainant and CP were engaged in discussions about three possible accommodation proposals, in addition to the assigned service shifts the Complainant had already been provided.\na. The union was asked to bump a more senior LE to allow Mr. Waddle all 5 shifts per week in assigned service as an LE in the Lethbridge yard. TCRC did not bump this senior employee.\nb. CP was asked to create a position for the Complainant doing a bundle of tasks, or doing office work, to make up the two additional shifts each week. CP\u2019s evidence was that they could not find meaningful office work or bundled tasks for the Complainant.\nc. CP offered the Complainant work as a yard foreman in assigned service, with a modification of duties and the addition of a helper. The discussion of this accommodation did not proceed, as the Complainant indicated he thought this would be too much work for the helper, and too difficult for him. In January of 2012, the Complainant provided additional medical evidence indicating he was restricted from the job of yard foreman, even as modified, as a result of his knee.\n[37] A Second RTW Meeting between the Complainant, TCRC representatives, and CP took place on November 22, 2011. The accommodation options noted above were discussed, but little progress was made as the Complainant was seeking further medical documentation to confirm his medical restrictions, in particular, in relation to walking.\n[38] In September of 2011, TCRC asked the Complainant for a release allowing them to review the Complainant\u2019s medical records, as part of the accommodation process. TCRC\u2019s internal documents tendered in evidence indicate that on September 9, 2011, CP had sent an email to TCRC indicating that the Complainant would now have to be accommodated by bumping a senior person. TCRC agreed in its evidence that it was only upon receipt of this email that access to the Complainant\u2019s medical records was requested.\n[39] On September 14, 2011, TCRC executive members exchanged emails challenging the medical restrictions defined by OHS for the Complainant. The email exchange concluded with one TCRC officer noting: \u201cWe will (not) subrogate our seniority because person makes subjective complaints.\u201d (While the email itself omits the italicized \u201cnot\u201d TCRC agreed in its evidence it was intended to be included.) TCRC also agreed in its evidence that they had had no one with any medical expertise to assess the Complainant\u2019s medical records, and that they did not obtain a third party medical review in this case. The Complainant, in the correspondence adduced, and in his testimonial evidence, expressed his concern at being compelled to provide confidential medical records to his Union.\n[40] In late 2011, TCRC received an executed release from the Complainant. The Complainant\u2019s evidence was that it was provided only because he felt he had no other option. TCRC performed its review of the Complainant\u2019s medical records. On January 3, 2012, TCRC executive members exchanged emails that challenged the conclusions of the CMO, OHS, and the Sleep Specialist. One such email read as follows: \u201cWhat a great criteria for an accommodation; go complain to the doctor I have a problem sleeping so I can bump to that cozy day job. Dame (sp) too late I am already the senior guy. IT IS ALL SELF REPORTING.\u201d\n[41] Shortly after this January 3, 2012 email, TCRC wrote to the Complainant\u2019s then counsel: \u201cYour self-reported condition will not allow us to modify any position in Lethbridge based on your seniority. We are not able to adjust seniority on the basis of your self-reporting of a condition.\u201d TCRC then suggested in this letter that the Complainant should move to Calgary.\n[42] Dave Abel, a witness for TCRC testified that bumping seniority was not uncommon, and in fact, he had done it on more than 17 occasions in one year. Based on the email correspondence, as well as the testimony before me, I find TCRC\u2019s perception of the nature of the Complainant\u2019s primary disability (which it viewed as being psychological rather than biological in nature) was, at least in part, the reason for TCRC\u2019s refusal to bump a more senior employee as part of the accommodation process. TCRC was not concerned solely with preserving the principle of seniority.\n[43] I find that while TCRC was actively engaged in the Complainant\u2019s accommodation process, having, for example, participated in two RTW meetings, several phone calls, and active consideration of his accommodation needs, TCRC\u2019s participation was restricted by a bias against the Complainant. The Union believed that the Complainant\u2019s circadian rhythm sleep disorder somehow did not constitute a real disability deserving of accommodation, through the taking of such measures as bumping a more senior member of TCRC.\n[44] Having reviewed the evidence about the steps taken by CP and TCRC to find an accommodation for the Complainant, I would also note shortcomings in the Complainant\u2019s participation in this accommodation process:\na. As a result of his focus on obtaining the 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. call-out window he desired, the Complainant provided the Sleep Specialist with inadequate information to determine appropriate medical restrictions. By designing his own preferred accommodation and seeking it directly, he made the process of arriving at a suitable accommodation more lengthy;\nb. As will be discussed in depth below, I find the Complainant also failed to update his bid-card to ensure he obtained 5 shifts per week, as many times as possible between September of 2011 and February of 2012. TCRC led evidence that there were numerous shifts during this time to which the Complainant had been entitled, and which he would have been given if he had bid on them. I find below that the Complainant had no reasonable explanation for his failure to bid on these shifts.\n[45] With respect to this last point, a significant issue in this matter is whether the Complainant updated his bid-card as requested, to ensure he received as many shifts as possible as part of the efforts to accommodate him. I have concerns regarding the credibility of the Complainant\u2019s evidence that he did complete an updated bid-card. In an October 24, 2011 letter to the Complainant\u2019s then counsel, TCRC had drawn attention to a full week of shifts to which the Complainant had been entitled during the week of October 17, 2011, but for which he did not bid. TCRC reiterated the Complainant\u2019s obligation to bid for positions within his restrictions, to ensure he obtained five shifts per week as often as possible.\n[46] At the hearing of this matter, the Complainant introduced a photocopy of a document purporting to be a bid-card for this October 17, 2011 week of shifts. The Complainant\u2019s evidence was that he submitted this bid-card, but that the shift went to a less senior employee because of an error in the bid-card. He could not point out the error, and he could not produce a fax sheet confirming the card was submitted, although he agreed it was standard practice for railway employees to retain the fax confirmation sheets generated in submitting any bid-cards.\n[47] At the hearing, a witness for TCRC produced a summary of a number of other weeks of work between September of 2011 and February of 2012 to which the Complainant was entitled, but which he failed to obtain. These opportunities arose when a more senior employee with shifts within the Complainant\u2019s restrictions was absent on annual leave, sick leave, or for other reasons. That employee\u2019s shifts would become available to the most senior employee who had submitted a bid-card. There were numerous weeks between September of 2011 and February of 2012 when the Complainant was the most senior employee, but did not receive the work. Given that the bid-card, once submitted, would stay in place ensuring the Complainant would obtain these additional shifts, the Complainant had no explanation for why he did not obtain these shifts.\n[48] I have concerns regarding the reliability and authenticity of the bid-card submitted into evidence by the Complainant. It simply defies logic that this bid-card would somehow have been overlooked on more than six occasions without explanation. Further, none of the witnesses for TCRC or the Complainant himself, despite being familiar with the bid-card system, was able to identify the alleged error in the bid-card. The Complainant also provided no explanation for why he did not correct the alleged error in the bid-card, when his failure to obtain a week of shifts was brought to his attention in October of 2011.\n[49] I find on a balance of probabilities that the Complainant did not update his bid- card to ensure he received as many shifts in assigned service as possible. Rather, the Complainant worked the three shifts per week to which he was entitled, and continued to seek additional accommodation in unassigned service from CP and TCRC until February of 2012.\n[50] The Complainant led evidence regarding his losses as a result of the alleged discrimination. He argued that employees of CP working as LEs in unassigned service told him they were making incomes much larger than those he earned in assigned service. He called no witnesses on this point, and provided no records supporting the incomes to which he was comparing his own.\n[51] CP led evidence and produced records, through its witness from its pension department, that the Complainant\u2019s income remained stable throughout 2011, and continued to increase as he worked in assigned service until his retirement in February of 2016. In the particular months coinciding with the accommodation process between June of 2011 and February of 2012, the Complainant gave evidence that he had lost 30% of his income, threatening his home ownership. In fact, CP\u2019s records revealed that his earnings each month were either higher than for the months in the previous years, or between 1-5% lower. The Complainant, despite being provided an opportunity by the Tribunal, did not challenge the accuracy of these records or the testimony given in relation thereto.\n[52] I find as a fact that the Complainant, throughout the accommodation process in 2011 and early 2012, was able to sustain his earnings on a consistent basis. Some examples of this are as follows:\na. in a pay period falling within October of 2010, the Complainant\u2019s actual earnings were $4,638.44. In the same pay period in October of 2011, his actual earnings were $5,186.40;\nb. in a pay period falling within March of 2010, the Complainant\u2019s actual earnings were $900 more than he earned in the same pay period in March 2012. However, in a pay period falling within April of 2012, the Complainant\u2019s actual earnings were $2,900 more than they were in the same period in April of 2010;\nc. in 2010, the Complainant\u2019s lowest actual earnings in one pay period were $4,190.48 and his highest actual earnings in one pay period were $6,378.68. In 2011, the Complainant\u2019s lowest pay in a single pay period was $4,218.10 and his highest was $6,706.64. Both the highest and lowest amounts increased during the process of accommodation;\nd. also the Complainant\u2019s annual income generally increased or remained stable each year following the accommodation process, and until his retirement.\nFurther, I find as a fact that the Complainant\u2019s five highest earning years for the purposes of calculating pension benefits, described as annual pensionable earnings, were in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, namely years corresponding to this accommodation process and the period that followed it.\n[53] The pension witness for CP was also able to determine that any impact on the Complainant\u2019s pensionable earnings would have arisen only through the accommodation period, as a result of the decision to describe some of the Complainant\u2019s missed shifts as \u201ccompany business\u201d rather than \u201cmedically unfit\u201d. This was done based on the Complainant\u2019s supervisor\u2019s mistaken belief that it would protect pensionable earnings. Instead, it resulted in a differential pension payment of approximately $7.03 per month, dropping the Complainant\u2019s monthly pension payment from $3,719.97 to $3,712.94.\n[54] Such loss in pension amounts, however, would have been off-set by a subsequent increase in pensionable earnings, as the Complainant was able to increase his pensionable earnings from $71,333.71 in 2010, to $86,229.90 in 2014 and $82,617.59 in 2015. In the years from 2011 and up to and including 2015, the Complainant\u2019s average annual pensionable income was $80,226.55. The average income in the five years preceding was only $67, 373.88. Any impact to the Complainant\u2019s pensionable income, and therefore to pension amounts, from the accommodation process and switch to assigned service was minimal at most.\nA. Family Status Ground\n[55] The Complainant led limited evidence of his obligations to his parents in Lethbridge. In particular, he did not indicate, what, if any eldercare activities he carried out on either of their behalves. He led evidence his father was residing in a care facility, and had Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and his mother lived independently. They both lived in Lethbridge. He also led evidence that he had returned to live in Lethbridge to be near his parents. I would note that in his final argument, the Complainant indicated that if he moved to Calgary, his mother would have to sell her home. He led no evidence of this in the hearing, and I therefore decline to consider the point.\nV. Preliminary Issues\nA. Credibility of Witnesses\n[56] At points, there was disagreement between the Complainant and the Respondents as to the facts in this matter. A number of elements of the Complainant\u2019s testimony raised concerns regarding the reliability of his evidence. While I found the Complainant made efforts to be truthful, I also found he tended to tailor his evidence so as to have it presented in a manner most favourable to him:\na. During examination in chief he was asked directly by the Tribunal if he had further tape recordings of telephone conversations that he had not produced. He denied it, but then admitted in cross-examination that he had many more tapes, but had excluded those that were not \u201cas helpful\u201d.\nb. The Complainant repeatedly stated he was close to losing his home as a result of a decline in his income. CP\u2019s evidence, however, showed his income had remained stable through the accommodation process in 2011, and had then increased in 2012 and 2013. The Complainant could not provide an explanation for this discrepancy.\nc. The Complainant gave evidence in examination-in-chief that he had been forced to sit in the back of the room at the First RTW Meeting, but then admitted in cross-examination that the seating was changed to place him at the front and ensure his participation.\nd. Several times during cross-examination, when faced with a fact not helpful to him, the Complainant avoided questions.\ne. The Complainant\u2019s evidence about submitting his bid-card was inconsistent with the undisputed facts about how the bid-card system works.\n[57] I further find that the four witnesses for the Respondent CP testified in a forthright, straightforward manner that was consistent with the records produced. Generally, where the evidence of the Complainant differs from that of the Employer\u2019s witnesses, I prefer the evidence of the Employer\u2019s witnesses.\n[58] I did find, in general, that the TCRC witnesses gave evidence in a truthful manner. As I have addressed above, I have found evidence of a bias within the TCRC towards the Complainant\u2019s disability, based on its psychological nature. However, TCRC\u2019s witnesses were not evasive when presented with this evidence at the hearing, and while they may have disagreed with the significance of the comments executive members had made in their own email records, their testimony in relation to them remained straightforward. As a whole, I find the witnesses for TCRC to be credible, and to the limited extent that their evidence differs from that of the Complainant, I prefer the evidence of the TCRC witnesses.\nB. The Complainant\u2019s Withdrawal of His Admission that he had been Accommodated by February 2012 and his Proposed Addition of Claims Extending Beyond February or March of 2012.\n[59] The Complainant\u2019s SOP, filed October 31, 2014, included an admission that the Complainant was fully accommodated by February of 2012. Prior to the original hearing dates in this matter scheduled on November 15 and 16, 2015 (\u201cOriginal Hearing Dates\u201d) the Complainant, through his counsel, sought to raise claims not included in the SOP relating to ongoing discrimination from February of 2012 until late 2015.\n[60] At the Original Hearing Dates, the Complainant\u2019s counsel indicated his desire to proceed with these claims for the period February 2012 to late 2015, and the Respondents objected. At that time, the Complainant, through his counsel, also requested leave to amend the SOP to add family status as a ground of discrimination.\n[61] The Original Hearing Dates in this matter were adjourned for unrelated reasons. During a subsequent case management conference call (\u201cCMCC\u201d), the Tribunal directed the Complainant to bring an application seeking any amendments to the SOP he believed were needed, given the recently arising matters. The Complaint brought an application to amend the SOP to include family status as a ground of discrimination, and he was granted leave to do so (see Waddle v. CPR and TCRC 2016 CHRT 8, \u201cthe 2016 Ruling\u201d). No other amendments were sought.\n[62] The hearing in this matter resumed, based on the now amended SOP, on March 17, 2016 (\u201cResumed Hearing Date). In the examination-in-chief of the Complainant during the Resumed Hearing Dates, he sought to enter documents, not previously disclosed, to support a claim of discrimination in respect of events occurring after February of 2012.\n[63] This additional claim would have significantly altered the amount of damages sought for loss of income, from the approximately $12,000 set out in the SOP, to nearly $1,000,000. In addition, the Complainant indicated he was retracting the statement, in his SOP, whereby he conceded that he had been fully accommodated by February of 2012. The Respondents argued, and I agreed, that this would give rise to the need for the Respondents to call additional witnesses, to further prepare the witnesses already scheduled, and to seek additional disclosure from the Complainant\u2014all during the course of an ongoing hearing.\n[64] In their oral submissions at the Resumed Hearing Date, the Respondents objected to the Complainant\u2019s request for leave to make further amendments to his SOP, on grounds that can be summarized as follows:\na. Any claim of discrimination beyond February of 2012 is outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal because the Amended Summary of Complaint form, that was included in the referral of the matter to the Tribunal, limits the Complaint to the period ending in March, 2012. In support of this argument, the Respondents relied upon the 2016 Ruling;\nb. The amendment would cause prejudice, as it was inconsistent with the SOP on which the Respondents had been relying on; and\nc. The amendment would cause prejudice, as the Complainant had been previously directed to seek any and all necessary amendments to the SOP, but did not use this opportunity to request an extension of the period within which he alleged discrimination occurred.\n[65] The Complaint itself in this matter does not restrict the time period of the discrimination alleged. The CHRC referred the Complaint to the Tribunal by way of letter dated July 30, 2014. The Complaint Form attached to the Letter of Referral itself does not restrict the time period of the alleged discrimination. Also attached to the Letter of Referral was an Amended Summary of Complaint Form, dated August 22, 2013. The Amended Summary of Complaint Form lists the date of the alleged discrimination as being the period June 2011 to March 2012. The SOP filed by the Complainant through his counsel on October 31, 2014, states that the failure to accommodate persisted only until February 7, 2012, and that the Complainant was fully accommodated after that time.\n[66] Following oral submissions from the Complainant and each of the Respondents, and upon consideration of the 2016 Ruling, I ordered that any disclosure not previously made, that dealt with a claim of discrimination occurring between March 2012 and December 2015, was admissible only to the extent that it was relevant to the question of the scope of damages arising from the periods of discrimination alleged in the SOP or the Amended Summary of Complaint Form, being June 2011 to March 2012. These new documents disclosed for the first time at the hearing, were not otherwise admissible. I denied both leave to raise new issues and introduce new documents under the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (\u201cRule\u201d) 9(3)(a) and (c). I also denied leave to amend the SOP to add a claim of discrimination extending beyond February of 2012. The following are the reasons for that decision.\n(i) Jurisdiction\n[67] The CHRC\u2019s request for an inquiry into a matter defines the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. On the specific facts of this case, as set out in the 2016 Ruling, both the Complaint Form and the Amended Summary of Complaint Form demarcated that jurisdiction. I will not repeat here the reasons given in the 2016 Ruling for deciding that the Amended Summary of Complaint Form serves as one of the jurisdiction - granting documents in this case, but I do note the relevance of the following passage at para. 31:\nAs a result of the particular use of the Amended Summary of Complaint Form by the CHRC in this matter, the Tribunal concludes that it does form part of the Complaints and can help to define the scope of jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n[68] I was clear to specify in the 2016 Ruling that I was not ruling as to whether the Amended Summary of Complaint Form would help define the scope of jurisdiction granted to the Tribunal in every case. It did in this case however, given the way the CHRC amended it, referred to it, and relied upon it. It was also the Amended Summary of Complaint Form alone that was relied upon by the Complainant to argue that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in this matter included a claim based on family status.\n[69] The Amended Summary of Complaint Form in this case includes a time-limited period of discrimination running from July 2011 to March 2012. The Complaint, however, at the time it was filed in March of 2012, states the discrimination is ongoing. When read together, the Complaint and the Amended Summary of Complaint Form in this case grant jurisdiction over a claim of discrimination based on disability extending beyond March 2012.\n[70] That said, for the reasons that follow, and in accordance with Rule 9(3)(a) and (c), I have declined leave to amend the SOP to raise the issues occurring post-March 2012, and I have also declined leave to introduce new documents connected with same.\n(ii) Rule 9(3)(a) and (c) Leave\n[71] The Respondents argued that the documents pertaining to the issue of discrimination extending beyond February or March 2012 are not admissible, as they are inconsistent with the SOP as filed. I reject this argument. In accordance with Rule 9(3)(a) and (c), leave may be sought to introduce at the hearing both issues not raised in the SOP and documents not previously disclosed. The question is whether that leave should be granted.\n[72] Such leave to raise new issues and introduce new documents is to be granted if doing so would be consistent with the purposes of the CHRT Rules, as set out in Rule 1(1):\n1(1) These Rules are enacted to ensure that\n(a) all parties to an inquiry have the full and ample opportunity to be heard;\n(b) arguments and evidence be disclosed and presented in a timely and efficient manner; and\n(c) all proceedings before the Tribunal be conducted as informally and expeditiously as possible.\n[73] In the case of the Complainant\u2019s allegations regarding ongoing discrimination after February of 2012, this claim was expressly excluded from the SOP. Further, when these matters arose prior to the Original Hearing Dates, and during the Original Hearing Dates, the Complainant was directed to seek amendments to his SOP. This direction was discussed at the CMCC, and also placed into correspondence following the CMCC. At that time, the Complainant was still represented by counsel.\n[74] The Complainant failed to seek this amendment, despite proceeding with a motion seeking another amendment to his SOP. At the Resumed Hearing Dates, he was unable to provide any reason for failing to seek this amendment other than that he hadn\u2019t been listening during the CMCC.\n[75] The Respondents were justified in assuming they would not be dealing with a claim of discrimination extending beyond February or March 2012 at the Resumed Hearing Dates, and they indicated that they were unprepared to do so. It was clear that, in order to answer such a claim, additional witnesses would be required to be called by the Respondents. They would also require further disclosure from the Complainant, including additional medical documentation and financial records. The Respondents would likely have been forced to seek an adjournment of the Resumed Hearing Dates, which would have constituted the third adjournment either directly sought by the Complainant, or resulting from the Complainant\u2019s failure to amend his SOP. The Respondents expressed their continued desire not to further adjourn the hearing. This placed the Respondents into a very difficult and unfair situation.\n[76] Ultimately, the question to be asked is whether raising the issue of discrimination occurring after February of 2012, and the further disclosure necessitated by same, would accord with the purposes of Rules 9(3) and 1(1). The Tribunal considered this question in Whyte and Richards v. CNR 2009 CHRT 33, in which the Tribunal held the respondent was required to proceed with a motion in accordance with Rule 9(3) if it wished to raise \u201ca completely new issue and particulars.\u201d The Tribunal noted at para. 12:\nThe Tribunal would like to remind the parties that if they are seeking leave to raise new issues not addressed in their Statements of Particulars or in its Amended Statement of Particular [sic] they can only do so by seeking leave or authorization from the Tribunal under rule 9(3) of the Tribunal Rules of Procedure. Any party seeking such authorization will have to show how their request is not prejudicial to the other parties and to the Tribunal\u2019s process. It will also have to demonstrate that there was some valid justification for this late request.\n[77] The Resumed Hearing Dates were scheduled after two previous adjournments of this matter, more than four years after the initial filing of the Complaint, and more than four years after many of the events at issue. The Complainant had been given ample opportunity to bring his SOP and his disclosure into alignment with his current view of his Complaint, but failed to do so. The Tribunal recently addressed this issue in the case of Carpenter v. Navy League of Canada 2015 CHRT 8, para. 57, when denying leave to amend an SOP under Rule 9(3):\nTo suggest that the hearing is the correct place to raise an amendment or other new matter when the need for the amendment or the fact of the new matter is known to the requesting party well before the hearing, as is the case here, does not take into account the purpose of Rule 9(3). That purpose is to avoid what is called \u201ctrial by ambush\u201d and the resulting waste of time, resources and added expense to all those participating in the hearing - the parties, counsel, witnesses - and the Tribunal.\n[78] The addition of these allegations and disclosure would have made it extremely difficult for the hearing to proceed or be completed during the scheduled hearing dates, and the further passage of time necessitated by an adjournment could have had an impact on the memory of the witnesses involved, causing prejudice to the Respondents. Further, the right to an expeditious hearing, as set out in section 48.9 of the CHRA, applies equally to the Respondents in this case, who have consistently expressed their desire to proceed in this matter.\n[79] The amendment, to be granted, must ultimately \u201c\u2026.serve the interests of justice.\u201d (Canderel Ltd. v. Canada 1993 CanLII 2990 (FCA), as cited in Canada (A.G.) v. Parent, 2006 FC 1313, para. 30. In this case, allowing the new issues and disclosure would neither meet the purposes set out in Rule 1(1), nor serve the interests of justice.\n[80] In addition to its discretion under Rule 9(3) to allow new issues to be raised, the Tribunal may allow an amendment to the SOP upon application. This leave to amend can be granted even during the hearing. In this case, however, the Complainant\u2019s continued failure to make disclosure in a timely fashion, and his failure to adhere to directions of this Tribunal regarding amendments to the SOP, made granting leave to amend in this case inconsistent with the interests of justice.\nVI. Decision on the Merits\nA. Discrimination Based on Family Status\n[81] The Complainant claims discrimination based on the prohibited ground of family status, as set out in section 2 of the CHRA. The discrimination based on family status is claimed pursuant to section 7 in respect of the Employer, and section 10 against the Union:\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[\u2026]\n10. It is a discriminatory practice for an employer, employee organization or employer organization\n(a) to establish or pursue a policy or practice, or\n(b) to enter into an agreement affecting recruitment, referral, hiring, promotion, training, apprenticeship, transfer or any other matter relating to employment or prospective employment,\nthat deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[82] This allegation of discrimination on the basis of family status as against both the Employer and the Union arises from within the accommodation process, and in particular, from the failure of TCRC to initially identify family status obligations in the RTW Plan, and further, from TCRC\u2019s suggestion in January of 2012 that the Complainant relocate to Calgary, despite his stated obligations to his parents in Lethbridge.\n[83] The evidence of the Complainant at the hearing was that these two impugned family status related incidents involved actions or omissions of the Respondent TCRC. Meagre evidence was presented at the hearing to connect the allegations related to family status to the Respondent CP. The only allegation for which evidence was given was that a member of CP Management was at the First RTW Meeting and helped complete the initial RTW Form. I therefore conclude that the Complainant has failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities, a prima facie case of discrimination based on family status, as against CP.\n[84] With regard to the claim of discrimination based on family status made against the Union, the TCRC relied on the test in Canada (A.G.) v. Johnstone 2014 FCA 110 (\u201cJohnstone\u201d), para. 93, for establishing a prima facie case of discrimination on this ground:\n\u2026[I]n order to make out a prima facie case where workplace discrimination on the prohibited ground of family status resulting from childcare obligations is alleged, the individual advancing the claim must show (i) that a child is under his or her care and supervision; (ii) that the childcare obligation at issue engages the individual\u2019s legal responsibility for that child, as opposed to a personal choice; (iii) that he or she has made reasonable efforts to meet those childcare obligations through reasonable alternative solutions, and that no such alternative solution is reasonably accessible, and (iv) that the impugned workplace rule interferes in a manner that is more than trivial or insubstantial with the fulfillment of the childcare obligation.\n[85] While none of the parties in this matter raised the decision of the Tribunal in Hicks v. Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, 2013 CHRT 20 (\u201cHicks-CHRT\u201d), or the subsequent decision of the Federal Court of Canada in its judicial review of Hicks (Canada (Attorney General) v. Hicks, 2015 FC 599 (Hicks-FC)), the Tribunal\u2019s decisions may be more informative on the standard to be applied in assessing a family status claim as it relates to an obligation to parents.\n[86] In Hicks-CHRT, the Tribunal did not have the benefit of the decision in Johnstone, supra, and did not therefore rely on the four part test. Nonetheless, the Tribunal member made clear that the obligations of a child to an elderly parent could also be recognized in the context of a family status claim (Hicks\u2013CHRT, para 44). The Tribunal\u2019s finding on this point was upheld on judicial review to the Federal Court (Hicks-FC, para 66). The Federal Court in Hicks-FC had the benefit of the decision in Johnstone, supra, and agreed that its requirement for caregiving obligations to engage legal responsibility, as opposed to a personal choice, would be applicable to family status claims involving eldercare. The Federal Court held on this point, at paras. 69-70:\nThe Federal Court of Appeal in Seeley FCA reiterated the principle identified in Johnstone on why the prohibited ground of discrimination of family status encompasses the childcare obligations at paragraph 41:\nAs found by this Court in Johnstone, the prohibited ground of discrimination of family status encompasses the parental obligations whose non-fulfillment engages the parent\u2019s legal responsibility to the child. The childcare obligations contemplated by the expression family status are thus those that have immutable or constructively immutable characteristics, such as those that form an integral component of the legal relationship between a parent and a child. As a result, the childcare obligations at issue are those which a parent cannot neglect without engaging his or her legal liability. This approach avoids trivializing human rights by extending human rights protection to personal choices.\nI find this similar rationale can be applied for the analysis of eldercare obligation in the instant case\u2026\n[87] In Hicks-CHRT, the complainant\u2019s family status claim was based on expenses he and his wife incurred in maintaining two residences, after he relocated to Ottawa and she stayed in Sydney, Nova Scotia to provide ongoing care for her mother. The complainant\u2019s evidence, as accepted by the Tribunal in Hicks-CHRT, was that his mother-in-law was ill, and living in an assisted-living apartment. With regard to his wife\u2019s obligations to care for her, the evidence was that third party caregivers could not provide the full necessary support, that the mother-in-law struggled to communicate without assistance from her daughter, that the daughter also checked in on her several times a day, purchased her groceries, arranged homecare, arranged for or prepared her meals, accompanied her on doctors\u2019 visits, communicated frequently with nursing home staff, and provided all her social interactions. The evidence in Hicks-CHRT was of a high level of interaction by the complainant\u2019s wife on his mother-in-law\u2019s behalf, and the decision suggests her playing a crucial role in her mother\u2019s care.\n[88] In the current matter, the Complainant provided very limited evidence as to the nature or extent of any disabilities from which his parents might suffer, or as to any medical, social, homecare or other needs his parents might have had. He indicated that his father had Alzheimer\u2019s and lived in a medical facility, but provided no evidence as to the extent of his illness. He led no evidence regarding the scope of any medical, homecare, social, or other needs his mother might have had. Based on the evidence in this matter, the Complainant has not shown that at the relevant times, he had an obligation to provide care for his parents that was comparable to the legal obligation to provide care set out in Johnstone, supra. Moreover, given the failure to present any evidence as to the nature of the care he provided for his parents, the Complainant failed to show his obligation engaged his legal responsibility to his parents.\n[89] The Complainant has also failed to show that he made efforts to obtain alternative care, whether through other family members, or third party care. This is significant, as in Hicks-CHRT, the Tribunal noted evidence about the inadequacy of third party caregivers, given the ill mother\u2019s specific needs. Also, the Tribunal in Hicks-CHRT cited the decision in Devaney v. ZRV Holdings Limited 2012 HRTO 1590, in which the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario decided a family status claim on the basis of eldercare obligations, and noted that there were no family members, other than the complainant in that case, who could provide the care.\n[90] Without the evidence to satisfy the foregoing, the Complainant has not established that he had an eldercare obligation that engaged his legal responsibility. One arrives at this conclusion, whether the four part test in Johnstone, supra is applied strictly, or whether one applies the standard suggested by the criteria set out in Hicks-CHRT and Hicks-FC.\n[91] Accordingly, the Complainant has failed to prove on a balance of probabilities that the Respondent TCRC discriminated against him based on family status under section 10.\nB. Discrimination Based on Disability\n(i) The Prima Facie Case\n[92] A prima facie case of discrimination is one that \u201c\u2026covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent\u2014employer.\u201d (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd. [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at p. 558). To demonstrate prima facie discrimination, the Complainant is required to show that he had a characteristic protected from discrimination under the CHRA, that he experienced an adverse impact with respect to employment, and that the protected characteristic was a factor in the adverse impact (Moore v. B.C. (Education) 2012 SCC 61, para. 33). Moreover, the use of the expression \u201cprima facie discrimination\u201d must not be regarded as a relaxation of the Complainant\u2019s obligation to satisfy the tribunal in accordance with the standard of proof on a balance of probabilities, which he must still meet (Qu\u00e9bec (C.D.P.D.J) v. Bombardier Inc., 2015 SCC 39, para. 65).\n[93] In the Complaint, discrimination based on disability is claimed against CP under section 7 of the CHRA, and claimed against the Union under section 10 of the CHRA, both as set out above. Given that the Complainant at all times remained employed by CP, only subsection 7(b) is applicable. Also, given the allegations, as they relate to TCRC, are that it failed in its obligations as a party to the accommodation process, section 10(a) is the applicable provision.\n[94] CP admits in its written argument that the Complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination based on disability. Further, the undisputed evidence given was that the Complainant was barred from working in unassigned service as an LE, as a result of the restrictions arising from his medical disability. While CP was not specific in its submissions about which discriminatory practice it admitted to having engaged in, it did submit in its final argument that the Complainant had proven a prima facie case of discrimination based on disability. In light of the applicability of section 7(b), I find the admission relates to differentiating adversely in relation to the Complainant in the course of his employment.\n[95] The TCRC\u2019s responsibility in the matter of this discrimination is engaged by the nature of its role in the accommodation process. In Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970, 16 C.H.R.R. D\/425, the Supreme Court set out the two ways in which a union could become a party to discrimination. The second, which is relevant in this matter, is that a union may become a party to discrimination if the union impedes, as is alleged here, the reasonable efforts of the employer to accommodate:\nIf reasonable accommodation is only possible with the union\u2019s co-operation and the union blocks the employer\u2019s efforts to remove or alleviate the discriminatory effect, it becomes a party to the discrimination. In these circumstances, the union, while not initially a party to the discriminatory conduct and having no initial duty to accommodate, incurs a duty not to contribute to the continuation of discrimination. [at C.H.R.R. para. 37]\n[96] In this case, the Respondent CP and the Respondent TCRC are both subject to the burden of showing that the duty to accommodate to the point of undue hardship was met. The Respondent CP has admitted that it engaged in prima facie discrimination within the meaning of section 7(b) of the CHRA. Moreover, I find that the Respondent TCRC engaged in prima facie discrimination within the meaning of section 7(b) of the CHRA, when it refused, during its participation in the accommodation process, to properly consider an option that impacted the seniority of another employee, based on its improper consideration of the nature of the Complainant\u2019s disability. As I found above, the TCRC\u2019s actions were guided by a biased view that the Complainant\u2019s sleep disorder did not constitute a disability deserving of accommodation to the point of displacing a more senior employee. Accordingly, the Complainant is entitled to relief against both Respondents, unless they are each able to justify their impugned conduct as a BFOR.\n(ii) The BFOR\n[97] The prima facie discrimination based on disability having been admitted by the Employer and found as against TCRC, the matter turns to whether the prima facie discriminatory action is justified as a BFOR. \u201c(Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Etobicoke, 1982 CanLII 15 (SCC), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 202, at p. 208; Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204, at para. 18. Sections 15(1)(a) and 15(2) of the CHRA provide that impugned adverse treatment is not a discriminatory practice where an employer establishes that it is based on a BFOR. In particular, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of affected individuals would impose undue hardship, considering health, safety and cost.\n[98] The three part test to consider the discriminatory action and whether it constitutes a BFOR is as set by the Supreme Court of Canada, in B.C.(PSERC) v. BCGSEU (\u201cMeiorin\u201d) [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3. At para. 54 of this judgment, the Court held that the employer may justify the impugned standard by establishing on the balance of probabilities:\n1. that the employer adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job;\n2. that the employer adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of that legitimate work-related purpose; and\n3. that the standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that legitimate work-related purpose. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, it must be demonstrated that it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship upon the employer.\n[99] An LE is a Safety Critical Position. CP led evidence which I accept that the Complainant, to work as an LE in unassigned service with irregular start times for shifts, would be required to maintain a level of alertness and cognitive functioning inconsistent with his diagnosis of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder. It is significant that the Complainant\u2019s own physician and expert witness confirmed that he was not medically able to operate trains overnight. I find that the Employer\u2019s decision to prohibit the Complainant from working as an LE in unassigned service without restrictions was made for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of his Safety Critical position as an LE, and further that it was made in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to maintain safety, and was consistent with his diagnosed medical restrictions.\n[100] This is not a case in which the employer refused to make any attempts at accommodation. The issue, therefore, is whether the efforts made to find employment for the Complainant, for which he was medically fit, amounted to reasonable accommodation. Where the employer proposes a reasonable accommodation, the complainant cannot insist on his or her preferred alternative accommodation (See Croteau v. C.N.R. 2014 CHRT 16, para. 44(2)).\n[101] The dispute as between the parties as to whether the Complainant was fully accommodated raises five main issues:\n1. Did the accommodation process and the work provided to the Complainant from July of 2011 until February of 2012 constitute reasonable accommodation? If not,\n2. Did CP fail to meet its obligation to provide reasonable accommodation by rejecting the option of unassigned service with a 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. call-out window?\n3. Did CP fail to meet its obligations to provide reasonable accommodation by not creating two shifts per week in an office, or by not creating other bundled work for the Complainant?\n4. Did TCRC fail in its obligation to co-operate in the accommodation of the Complainant, by not bumping a more senior employee, to ensure the Complainant had 5 shifts per week in the Lethbridge yard within his medical restrictions?\ni. Did TCRC give honest and good faith consideration to altering seniority to accommodate the Complainant?\nii. Was TCRC\u2019s request to review the Complainant\u2019s medical records reasonable, or did it impede good faith accommodation efforts?\n5. Having regard to the pronouncements of the Supreme Court in Renaud, supra, did the Complainant fail in his obligations to facilitate the accommodation process, in particular, by:\ni. Failing to provide work-related information to medical practitioners, or failing to provide updated medical information to the Employer\u2019s medical advisors?\nii. Failing to consider reasonable accommodation options, including a transfer to Calgary, or work as a yard foreman?\niii. Failing to take steps to update his bid-card, to ensure access (within his seniority) to as many shifts in assigned service as he could work?\nIssue 1: Was the Work provided to the Complainant from July 2011 to February 2012 reasonable accommodation?\n[102] I find, with regard to both the Respondents, that the Complainant\u2019s position in assigned service as an LE in Lethbridge, with three shifts per week, amounted to reasonable accommodation. To constitute reasonable accommodation, the option need not be perfect. A complainant cannot expect a perfect solution (Renaud, supra, para. 44). Part-time work can, in some cases, satisfy this requirement (Renaud, supra, para. 43). This is particularly the case in this situation, as the Complainant experienced no loss of income in 2011, despite the change to three shifts per week in assigned service. Further, the Complainant was able to stay within his position as an LE, to stay in his preferred location of Lethbridge, and to work within his medical restrictions, obtaining enough shifts to earn comparable and increasing annual incomes until his retirement.\n[103] I further find that, given the Complainant was unable to establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on family status, the Respondents, or either of them, would have been entitled to require the Complainant to accept a transfer, as part of his accommodation. I find that the offer to transfer the Complainant to Calgary, which was available at all times, also constituted reasonable accommodation. While the Employer and the Union continued to participate in an accommodation process to find the Complainant a more desirable accommodation, their legal obligation to accommodate was satisfied by the offer of relocation.\n[104] At all times during the process of evaluating the Complainant\u2019s medical disability, through to February of 2012 and ultimately to the date of his retirement in early 2016, the Complainant was fully accommodated through the efforts of his employer. He was working at least three shifts per week in assigned service, with capacity to obtain full-time work in the period running from August of 2011 until February of 2012, at which point he admits to having been fully accommodated, and to having worked full-time in assigned service until his retirement.\n[105] The Complainant raised three primary alternatives for his accommodation that he felt would have constituted full accommodation, but these were rejected by either CP or TCRC. The Complainant argued that one of these options should have been utilized, and because none of them were he was not fully accommodated. While I have found above that the Complainant was fully accommodated, each of these options is considered below.\nIssue 2: Should CP have accommodated the Complainant with a call-out window in unassigned service?\n[106] The Complainant could not, given the safety critical nature of his work in unassigned service as an LE, and given his medical disability, continue to work as an LE in unassigned service from the Lethbridge terminal. This was not only the view of his own medical expert, but also that of the CMO.\n[107] The modification of his job as an LE in unassigned service, by adding a 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. call-out window, was inconsistent with the medical restrictions to which he was subjected by his Sleep Specialist, once he had provided her with all the information she needed to assess the accommodation.\n[108] While the 5 a.m. to 5 pm. call-out window was preferred by the Complainant, it was never a viable accommodation.\nIssue 3: Should CP have accommodated the Complainant with bundled work or office work?\n[109] The employer does not have a make-work obligation to assign unproductive work, in order to satisfy its duty to accommodate. (Croteau, supra, para. 44(4)). In this case, the Employer was not required to create office work or other bundled work for the Complainant, in order to fill the additional two shifts per week, where to do so would not provide the Complainant with meaningful work.\n[110] I have considered and rejected TCRC\u2019s argument that the Employer was compelled to create office work or bundled work for the Complainant, based on its practice of doing so for employees in receipt of Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits. These arrangements are created in a completely different context of short-term assignments for employees injured in the workplace, in respect of which employees the Employer has distinct compensatory obligations created by a statute other than the CHRA. The existence of this practice in Workers\u2019 Compensation cases is not indicative of the reasonableness of such measures in the context of workplace accommodation pursuant to the CHRA.\nIssue Four: Should TCRC have bumped a more senior employee to accommodate the Complainant?\n[111] The efforts at accommodation made by the Employer in this case are a complete answer to the Complainant\u2019s claim of discrimination. Since the Complainant was fully accommodated at all times through the efforts of his employer, and the Union\u2019s co-operation was not ultimately required to achieve this result, no obligations of Union participation are triggered, as per Renaud, supra, paras. 37 and 40.\n[112] However, in keeping with the Tribunal\u2019s statutory duty to \u201cinquire into the complaint\u201d, I would note that some actions of TCRC officers during the accommodation process, while not creating any liability for discrimination, do warrant comment.\n[113] Despite the arguments made by TCRC that their refusal to bump a more senior employee was motivated by a desire to protect the value of seniority, the evidence indicates otherwise:\n1. TCRC clearly considered the nature of the Complainant\u2019s disability in making their decision not to consider bumping a more senior employee in order to accommodate the Complainant. They felt the Complainant was a less deserving candidate for bumping because of their belief that his diagnosis was less credible, based as it was on his own reporting of symptoms.\n2. TCRC insisted that the Complainant disclose his medical records to the union, and withheld assistance in the accommodation process until he did so. A witness for the Union gave evidence that this was a request frequently made by the Union of its members. Yet the Union\u2019s evidence at the hearing was that it had no expertise or ability to assess those medical records, and that while the Union did on occasion retain medical experts to review its members\u2019 medical records, it did not do so in this case.\n3. In their email communications, Union officials made disparaging comments about the nature of the Complainant\u2019s disability, admitting this was the reason why TCRC would not consider a bump.\n[114] While these actions as set out above do not give rise to any liability in this case, and are not being considered here for that purpose, it is difficult to see how they would be consistent with the Union\u2019s obligations under the CHRA.\nIssue 5: Did the Complainant fail in his duty to facilitate accommodation?\n[115] While the accommodation provided by the Employer in this matter is a full answer to the Complainant\u2019s claim of discrimination based on disability, the Complainant\u2019s own failure to facilitate the accommodation process is also a full bar to any claim against the Employer. That failure to facilitate the accommodation process is also a full bar to any claim against TCRC as per Siddoo v. I.L.W.U Local 502, 2015 CHRT 21, (\u201cSiddoo\u201d) para. 42 although I would note that there is a judicial review application of the decision in Siddoo, supra which is pending: T-1742-15.\n[116] The Complainant\u2019s failure to facilitate the accommodation process was three-fold: First, the Complainant was hesitant to provide complete information to his Sleep Specialist. Rather than providing her from the outset with a complete understanding of his workplace, and the options available, he merely provided her with only enough information at each stage of the process to ensure he obtained his most preferred accommodation at that time. It is clear that the efficacy of the Sleep Specialist\u2019s recommendations was undermined by the Complainant\u2019s failure to advise her fully of the nature of his work.\n[117] The Complainant also failed in his obligations to provide ongoing and updated medical records to the Respondent CP, to allow for a more effective effort to return him to work. He tended only to update his medical information after he was presented with employment options that were inconsistent with his medical restrictions. This practice left the Respondents, and the Employer in particular, constantly one step behind in the accommodation process, and resulted in much wasted effort in trying to design a modified foreman position for the Complainant.\n[118] Finally, the Complainant failed to update his bid-card appropriately, which prevented him from working as many shifts in assigned service as possible. Instead, he continued to argue for his preferred accommodation options.\nVII. Compensation\n[119] The Complainant, in his final oral arguments and in his evidence, set out a number of forms of compensation he is seeking:\na. the maximum compensation allowable under sections 53(2)(e) and 53(3) of the CHRA, being $20,000 under each provision;\nb. recovery for lost wages under section 53(2)(c), being the difference between what the Complainant estimated he could have earned in full-time unassigned service, and what he actually made in assigned service; and\nc. recovery for amounts by which his pensionable earnings were reduced, as a result of working in assigned rather than unassigned service.\n[120] Given the findings on liability in this matter, it is not strictly necessary to address the question of remedy. However, it is important to note that should the findings on liability be incorrect, certain conclusions regarding remedy may be useful. As concerns compensation for lost wages under section 53(2)(c), the Complainant was unable to present any evidence showing that he experienced any loss of income, reduction in pensionable earnings, or a reduction in pension benefits. It is clear from the evidence of CP, which was undisputed by the Complainant, that the Complainant suffered no decrease in income, but rather was able to sustain and increase his earnings until his retirement. This is likely as a result of his ability to report to work consistently in assigned service, as opposed to unassigned service, where he had been forced to repeatedly miss shifts as a result of a lack of medical fitness.\n[121] The Complainant\u2019s analysis of loss of income was based on his staying in unassigned service, on the road, until his retirement. As previously noted, the Complainant\u2019s own witness indicated he was medically unable to carry out this work. However, the Complainant continued to assess his loss by comparing what he earned in the 2011- 2015 time period with what other Lethbridge LEs in unassigned service told him they were earning.\n[122] There are a number of issues with this position. The first is, assuming the other employees were truthful and accurate in their reporting of earnings to the Complainant, there was no evidence to establish how many hours these employees were working, and how many miles they were driving. The Complainant did not submit any documentary evidence to support this position, and did not call any of his co-workers to give evidence on this point. The actual number of hours worked and miles driven would have a considerable impact on earnings. The second issue is that, given that the 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. call-out window does not exist at the Lethbridge terminal, none of these LEs were working that restricted shift. It is therefore impossible to assess the impact this type of restrictive shift would have had on their earnings. The Complainant himself has never disputed that he was unable to work in unassigned service without a restricted call-out window. Therefore, it is impossible to know how his income would compare with that of other LEs who had an unrestricted call-out. Thirdly, the Complainant, even when working unrestricted in unassigned service from Lethbridge, earned annual incomes vastly lower than the amount he suggested other LEs were earning. For example, the Complainant earned only $67,060.83 in 2009, working in unassigned service without medical restrictions, and prior to the emergence of his sleep circadian rhythm issues. Despite this, he argued his loss of income should be based on earnings of $120,000 or $110,000 per year. Both of these amounts vastly exceed anything he was able to earn while working unrestricted in unassigned service as an LE. This comparative wage claim is therefore unsupportable.\n[123] The Complainant also made allegations regarding a loss in pensionable earnings arising from his reduced income between 2011 and 2015. This claim is also not supportable, and CP\u2019s evidence on this point, which was clearly and succinctly led, established that any loss to pensionable earnings arising through the accommodation process would be so extremely minimal as to be insignificant, amounting to only a few dollars per month. Such losses would have been offset by higher pension earnings generated as a result of his subsequent higher income earnings in an accommodated position. I further find that given the variability in the Complainant\u2019s income, which tended to fluctuate from month to month and year to year, both before and after this accommodation process, the impact on his pensionable earnings was within the inherent earnings range the Complainant had always experienced, and would always experience, as an LE at CP. In light of the foregoing, it is impossible to assess whether the Complainant would overall have had higher pensionable earnings and a higher pension, had he received a different accommodation.\nVIII. Conclusion\n[124] The Complainant\u2019s case of prima facie discrimination based on family status has not been made out. The evidence as led was insufficient to show the Complainant had any obligations of care to his parents that had to be satisfied by his remaining in Lethbridge. Further, while the reference to family status was initially excluded by TCRC from the RTW Plan, and while TCRC ultimately suggested a transfer, the Complainant was never forced to move, but was in fact accommodated at all times in Lethbridge.\n[125] The Respondent CP admitted the Complainant\u2019s case of prima facie discrimination based on disability. Further, even without CP\u2019s admission, the Complainant has made out the prima facie case by establishing he was prevented from working as an LE without restrictions, based on his medical disability. As I have previously expressed, TCRC\u2019s duty to accommodate in this case was not triggered given that CP fully accommodated the Complainant. In the circumstances of this case, TCRC was not required to take any steps, or give any consideration to bumping an employee.\n[126] The prima facie discriminatory restriction imposed by CP is, however, a BFOR adopted for the purposes of ensuring the safety of the Complainant and the public in his performance of safety critical work. Also, it was adopted in the honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of these purposes. Further, the Complainant was at all times accommodated to the point of undue hardship. Reasonable accommodation was provided by the offer to relocate, by the three shifts per week in assigned service with the opportunity to bid for further shifts, and then, by the provision of five shifts per week in assigned service beginning in February 2012. Finally, given the efforts made by the Employer, the Complainant\u2019s failure to facilitate the accommodation process is a complete answer to his claim.\n[127] If the conclusions regarding family status discrimination or disability discrimination\u2014including the BFOR\u2014are held to be incorrect, I find the Complainant has not proven that he incurred any wage loss or pension income loss as a result of the work restrictions placed on him by CP.\n[128] The Complaints against the Respondents CP and TCRC are hereby dismissed.\nSigned by\nRicki T.

Background\n[1] The Complainant in this file, Ms. Nicole Grace Valenti, filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) on April 15, 2013, which was later amended on August 27, 2014.\n[2] The Complainant alleges that she has suffered discrimination contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA).\n[3] More particularly, she alleges that her employer discriminated against her based on the ground of disability, and treated her in an adverse differential manner, following a work-related car accident which took place on September 28, 2012.\n[4] On December 22, 2015, pursuant to section 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the \u201cCHRA\u201d), the Commission requested the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) institute an inquiry into the complaint.\n[5] On June 27, 2016, the Tribunal Chairperson assigned the file to me for inquiry, and the disclosure process commenced.\nII. The motion for further disclosure\n[6] In her statement of particulars (SOP) filed on October 7, 2016, the Complainant disclosed approximately 109 documents, and requested disclosure for 95 classes of documents from the Respondent.\n[7] In its response, the Respondent disclosed 41 non-privileged documents in its SOP filed on November 18, 2016. On December 15, 2016, the Respondent disclosed an additional 466 documents.\n[8] A motion for further disclosure was submitted by the Complainant on January 21, 2017.\n[9] On February 10, 2017, in order to considerably reduce the number of disputed documents raised in the Complainant\u2019s motion, I sent written directions to the parties.\n[10] In order to facilitate the process of ascertaining how each document produced corresponded to a class of documents requested, I directed the Respondent to transmit to the Complainant a Table of Concordance.\n[11] After many email exchanges between the parties during the months of March to June, and the disclosure of new documents, a final Table of Concordance with some thirty document requests still in dispute was produced. The table contained submissions by both parties in respect of each of the disputed documents.\n[12] In an effort to resolve the motion for further disclosure, I invited the parties to participate in a case management conference call (CMCC), which took place on June 29, 2017. At that time, 21 document requests were still in dispute, and each party had the opportunity to present their verbal arguments in regard to each of those requests.\n[13] Although the Commission will not be participating at the hearing, they did participate in the CMCC. The Commission stated their position on some of the documents discussed during the call.\n[14] As a result of the discussion that took place during the CMCC, the parties reached an agreement on five (5) of the document requests, and full disclosure was made of those documents.\n[15] For the remaining sixteen (16) document requests, I advised the parties that I would rule on each request and give my decision in writing.\nIII. Tribunal Rules and Jurisprudence\n[16] Rule 6 of the Tribunal Rules of Procedure (Rules) deals with the SOP, disclosure, and production of documents.\n[17] Rule 6(1)(d) is particularly relevant and states:\nWithin the time fixed by the Panel, each party shall serve and file a Statement of Particulars setting out,\n[\u2026]\n(d) a list of all documents in the party\u2019s possession, for which no privilege is claimed, that relate to a fact, issue, or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule;\n[18] Rule 6(5) makes the obligation to disclose ongoing in the circumstances described.\n[19] The jurisprudence is well-settled that the standard for the disclosure of documents pursuant to Rules 6(1) (d) and 6(5) is that of \u201carguable relevance\u201d.\n[20] \u201cArguable relevance\u201d means that a document requested to be disclosed must have a nexus or rational connection to a fact, issue or form of relief sought or identified by a party (Guay v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2004 CHRT 34 (\u201cGuay\u201d) at para. 42; Seeley v. Canadian National Railway, 2013 CHRT 18 (\u201cSeeley\u201d), at para. 6).\n[21] A request for disclosure cannot be \u201c\u2026speculative or amount to a \u2018fishing expedition\u2019\u201d (Guay, at para. 43).\n[22] I would add that a party must show\u2014not that a document is relevant in the traditional sense\u2014but that disclosure of such document will be useful, is appropriate, will likely contribute to advancing the debate, is based on an acceptable objective that he or she seeks to attain in the case, and that the document is related to the dispute (C.E.P.U. v. Bell Canada, 2005 CHRT 34, at para. 11).\n[23] Most importantly, the link between the issues to be proven and the requested material must be demonstrated in the present case before the Tribunal \u2014 and not in another case before another tribunal or court (Warman v. Bahr, 2006 CHRT 18, (\u201cWarman\u201d) at paras. 6-7, 9).\n[24] The question is, could the document, if accepted as evidence at a hearing, affect the conclusion of the Tribunal in regard to the existence of a fact, a disputed point of law, or the justification of a remedy sought? If the answer is yes, the document is then deemed to be arguably relevant and should be disclosed. It is not sufficient that the name of one of the parties appears on the document to make this document arguably relevant.\n[25] Finally, unless there is reason to believe that a party is not complying with Rule 6 in good faith, or with reasonable diligence, it is the Tribunal\u2019s practice, once such a party\u2019s list is complete and any particularized disclosure requests are answered, to accept the disclosure made as the full disclosure of that party, at that time. While parties have ongoing obligations under Rule 6(5), the foregoing is generally sufficient to confirm that the party does not have any other arguably relevant documents in its possession.\nIV. Decision\n[26] With this legal framework in mind, the following is my ruling for each outstanding document request. In the following table , the number of each document request is the same as the one appearing in the last Table of Concordance produced by the Respondent, which was used during the CMCC. Only the sixteen (16) document requests still in dispute are referred to in the table.\nDisputed Documents\nTribunal\u2019s Ruling\nC110\nC111\nC113\nC114\nC116\nC117\nGiven the Respondent\u2019s declaration that it has disclosed all relevant documents found, and in the absence of any evidence that the Respondent might be acting in bad faith, or that the Respondent is not co-operating, the Tribunal cannot ask for more disclosure in relation to these requests. The Tribunal accepts the Respondent\u2019s declaration that CPR does not have the document requested by the Complainant.\nC119\nThe documents requested by the Complainant for disclosure pass the threshold for arguable relevance and the requested information should be disclosed. There is a rational connection between the \u201cCP\u2019s Benefit Team Agreement with Manulife and policy and procedure for non-unionized benefits\u201d requested and the relief sought by the Complainant. I refer here particularly to paras. 35, 149, 150 and 161 (ix) of the Complainant\u2019s SOP. The request by the Complainant to have these particular documents disclosed cannot be characterized as a fishing expedition. I order that the Respondent disclose these documents to the parties by August 18, 2017.\nC153\nThe Complainant cannot simply request disclosure of all documents concerning certain individuals because she feels it would be helpful. This would amount to a fishing expedition (see Guay, at para. 43). I accept the Respondent\u2019s statement and explanation that it has disclosed all relevant documents in respect of this request, and I note Respondent counsel\u2019s commitment made during the CMCC that CPR will comply with its obligation to produce on a continuous basis if other relevant documents are found.\nC165\nThe Tribunal accepts the Respondent\u2019s declaration regarding the disclosure of that document and acknowledges Respondent counsel\u2019s commitment made during the CMCC that CPR will comply with its obligation to produce on a continuous basis if other relevant documents are found.\nC179\nFor this particular request, the Complainant is making an analogy to CPR\u2019s \u201cconsent to release information\u201d policy. While I understand why the Complainant is making that comparison, it is not useful or applicable in the context of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules. Under Rule 6, the criterion for disclosure is the arguable relevance of the documents requested. Arguable relevance means that the documents requested must have a nexus or rational connection to a fact, issue or form of relief sought or identified by a party (Seeley, at para. 6; Guay, at para. 42). For this particular request, the Complainant is clearly not being specific enough as to what exactly she is looking for, and her request amounts to a fishing expedition. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent, and accepts the Respondent\u2019s declaration that relevant documents have been disclosed, and that CPR does not have other relevant documents in its possession that relate to this request.\nC178\nC188\nC191\nThe Complainant cannot simply request all documents concerning certain individuals just because she feels it would be helpful. This would amount to a fishing expedition (see Guay, at para. 43). Given the Respondent\u2019s declaration that it has disclosed all relevant documents found, and in the absence of any evidence that the Respondent might be acting in bad faith, or that the Respondent is not co-operating, the Tribunal cannot ask for more disclosure in relation to this request. The Tribunal accepts the Respondent\u2019s declaration.\nC204\nThe Respondent\u2019s declaration is that it has no document in its possession that relates to this request. The Complainant has cited the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Ledoux v. Gambler First Nation, 2017 CHRT 13, (\u201cLedoux\u201d) as an example of a case where the Tribunal ordered a party to produce documents that were in the possession of a third party. The obligation to produce even when a document is in the hand of a third party was also recognized by this Tribunal in another decision, Rai v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2013 CHRT 6, paras. 33-35.\nCPR, as a customer of a cell phone provider, is indeed in a position to obtain such documents and information like cell phone records from its provider. To oppose the production of a document or documents in the possession of a third party but on which it has a right of access doesn\u2019t respect the spirit of Rule 6. On that argument, I agree with the Complainant. But this is not sufficient to order the Respondent to produce such documents. Indeed, such documents must be relevant. And arguable relevance must be assessed in the context of the case in which the disclosure order is being sought (see Warman, paras. 6-7, 9). It appears that the documents requested relates to the WSIB case and the relevance of the requested documents to the Complainant\u2019s WSIB appeal is not an appropriate consideration in this case before this Tribunal. The Tribunal notes that the facts the Complainant is trying to establish through these documents \u2013 her state of mind \u2011 can be better addressed through the Complainant\u2019s testimony at the hearing as well as through medical reports than by cell phone records which would only establish time and location of calls.\nC206\nThe Complainant has not demonstrated how the requested vehicle records relate to a disputed fact in this case, as set out in the SOPs. The Respondent does not contest the fact that the Complainant was involved in a car accident. The Tribunal does not believe that the requested documents are then arguably relevant.\nC207\nGiven the Respondent\u2019s declaration that it has disclosed all relevant documents found, and in the absence of any evidence that the Respondent might be acting in bad faith, or that the Respondent is not co-operating, the Tribunal cannot ask for more disclosure in relation to this request. The Tribunal accepts the Respondent\u2019s declaration. Moreover, the Tribunal notes that the facts the Complainant is trying to establish through this document request can be addressed through testimony at the hearing.\nSigned by\nAnie Perrault\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nJuly 18, 2017\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT2126\/4215\nStyle of Cause:\nNicole Grace Valenti v.

Ruling 2\nVI. Order 3\nI. Background\n[1] On December 16, 2013, the Tribunal issued Ruling 2013 CHRT 34 (the Confidentiality Order), ordering the confidentiality of certain documents, namely Port of Entry Recruitment Training program (POERT) assessor manuals and various POERT test results of the Complainant\u2019s classmates, in accordance with section 52 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the Act), and requiring the documents to be subject to certain terms, as set out in that Ruling (the Confidentiality Order).\nII. Respondent\u2019s motion and request for confidentiality of additional documents\n[2] The Complainant has recently requested disclosure of additional documents, specifically, the complete set of DII simulations which the Complainant was assessed on, including the correct simulation assessed by Kevin Phillips, and all the Recruit Assessment Reports - Determination Point I, for the other candidates in the Complainant\u2019s class.\n[3] The Respondent submits that the Confidentiality Order ought to be extended to the additional pages of the POERT testing material because the simulation scenarios are of the same type as those already protected by the Confidentiality Order, and these documents are by their nature sensitive and confidential. The Respondent submits that the Tribunal\u2019s reasons and analysis in the Confidentiality Order also apply to these documents.\n[4] The Respondent also seeks an order that paragraph 30 of the Confidentiality Order be extended to cover such additional documents.\nIII. The Complainant\u2019s position\n[5] The Complainant has consented to the extension of the Confidentiality Order to the documents set out in paragraph 2 above.\nIV. Conclusions in the Confidentiality Order\n[6] In granting the Confidentiality Order, the Tribunal concluded the following:\n[22] It is in the interests of Canada and those who live here that BSOs be properly trained, vetted and qualified for this significant work. The POERT program tries to accomplish this. Another rubric under which POERT functions is the requirement under the [Public Service Employment Act of Canada] that public service appointments be based on merit and be nonpartisan, and further, that these values be safeguarded. In order to do so, the integrity of the POERT documents listed in the Schedule \u201cA\u201d documents must be safeguarded; otherwise, there is a real risk that POERT\u2019s testing materials and training and assessment scenarios could be disclosed, whether intentionally or inadvertently, and candidates without merit could pass them. This would compromise not only the merit principle and cause the Respondent undue hardship, but would also compromise the public\u2019s safety.\n[23] \u2026if the Schedule \u201cA\u201d Documents were made public during the inquiry or as a result of the inquiry being conducted in public, there is a real and substantial risk that matters involving public security would be disclosed, and that the disclosure of personal or other matters will cause undue hardship to the persons involved, particularly the Respondent, such that the need to prevent disclosure other than under the conditions set out in the Order below outweighs the societal interest that these documents be fully disclosed to the public.\nV. Ruling\n[7] Considering that the complete set of DII simulations which the Complainant was assessed on, including the correct simulation assessed by Kevin Phillips, form part of POERT assessments and are the same type of documents which the Confidentiality Order already covers, for the same reasons in the Confidentiality Order reproduced above, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Confidentiality Order ought to cover the documents at issue. In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal hereby orders that the Confidentiality Order is extended to and applies mutatis mutandis to the additional documents set out above.\nVI. Order\n[8] The Tribunal designates the following documents as confidential in accordance with section 52 of the Act:\nthe complete set of DII simulations that the Complainant was assessed on, including the correct simulation assessed by Kevin Phillips (54 pages); and\nall the Recruit Assessment Reports \u2013 Determination Point I for the other candidates in the Complainant\u2019s class.\n[9] Terms (a) through (f) of paragraph 30 of the Confidentiality Order in 2013 CHRT 34, apply mutatis mutandis to the documents listed in paragraph 8 above.\nSigned by\nOlga Luftig\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nAugust 9, 2017\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT1817\/4712\nStyle of Cause:\nGeevarughese Johnson Itty v.

Summary\n[1] In light of the broad and systemic nature of the Complaint, and the relatively low bar that is set for production of documents at the disclosure stage, I have determined that the Nance Report is arguably relevant to the issues raised in the Complaint. For the reasons contained herein, I order Air Canada to produce the Nance Report, as well as any additional documents in its power, possession or control that reflect Air Canada\u2019s or its employees\u2019 input into the drafting of the Nance Report or the implementation of the Nance Report, to the extent that such documents exist, and are not privileged.\n[2] The Commission has also requested the further production of documents pertaining to the bid around system for pilot scheduling. Air Canada has advised that no further such disclosable documents exist.\n[3] At the request of Pilot XY, who is the subject of the Nance Report, I have also made a series of orders to ensure that Pilot XY\u2019s identity is protected in the disclosure and any subsequent reliance on the Nance Report, for the duration of the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry into the Complaint.\nII. Background\n[4] In May 2012, Jane Clegg (\u201cMs. Clegg\u201d or the \u201cComplainant\u201d) filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) against Air Canada, her former employer, alleging adverse differential treatment on the basis of sex in the course of her employment as a pilot (\u201cthe Complaint\u201d).\n[5] The Commission conducted an investigation into the Complaint and issued a report recommending that the matter proceed to an inquiry before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cCHRT\u201d or the \u201cTribunal\u201d). On June 15, 2016, the Complaint was referred to the Tribunal for inquiry.\n[6] In April 2017, the parties advised the Tribunal that the disclosure process was complete and the matter was set down for a hearing in October 2017.\n[7] On April 25, 2017, counsel for Air Canada advised the Tribunal that a June 2014 report drafted by Captain John Nance in the context of another proceeding (the \u201cNance Report\u201d), which should not have been disclosed, had been inadvertently been produced during the Commission investigation. Ultimately, Air Canada claimed that the document was not relevant to the Complaint, and furthermore, contained confidential information of a non-party.\n[8] The Commission and the Complainant both argued that the document was indeed relevant to the Complaint, was properly produced, and indicated that they intended to rely on the Nance Report at the hearing.\n[9] The parties were able to agree that Air Canada would withdraw the document and the Commission would bring a motion seeking its production, which it has now done.\n[10] In light of the confidentiality issues that had been raised about the individual who was the subject of the Nance Report, who I will refer to as Pilot XY, Pilot XY was given notice of the Commission\u2019s motion. Pilot XY was provided an opportunity to make submissions regarding confidentiality to the Tribunal, which Pilot XY has done.\nA. The Complaint\n[11] Ms. Clegg alleges that she experienced adverse differential treatment on the basis of sex in regards to a series of specific incidents occurring between July 2009 and April 2013, as well as Air Canada\u2019s response to these incidents.\n[12] The Complainant and the Commission also raise a broader, systemic complaint regarding gender harassment of female pilots at Air Canada. Specifically, in her Summary of Complaint, Ms. Clegg alleges widespread experiences of gender harassment among female pilots at Air Canada and \u201csystemic ambivalence that Air Canada displays towards harassment\u201d. Furthermore, at paragraph 20(f)(sic) of Ms. Clegg\u2019s Statement of Particulars, she seeks the broad, systemic remedy of a \u201cmodification of the Respondents policies and procedures regarding gender harassment in consultation with the Commission\u201d.\n[13] The CHRC alleges systemic discrimination concerns regarding the bid around system employed for scheduling purposes as it applies to female pilots who believe that they have experienced harassment or discrimination.\n[14] On the basis of these allegations, and for the purpose of the analysis below, I find that the Complaint alleges systemic discrimination experienced by female pilots at Air Canada on the basis of sex.\nB. The Nance Report\n[15] The Nance Report was prepared by Captain John Nance in June 2014. Captain Nance was retained by the Air Canada Pilots Association (\u201cACPA\u201d) to produce the Nance Report in respect of a grievance made by the ACPA against Air Canada on behalf of Pilot XY. Neither Pilot XY nor the ACPA are currently parties to the Complaint.\n[16] In considering this motion, I initially attempted to render my ruling without reviewing the Nance Report. However, in light of the factual dispute between the parties to this motion on the subject matter of the Nance Report, and the fact that no party had raised an objection to my reviewing it, I determined that it would be best for me to review the Nance Report in order to decide whether it contains information that is arguably relevant to the Complaint.\n[17] I have done so, and on the basis of that review and the parties\u2019 submissions, for the purpose of this analysis, I find that (inter alia) the following subjects are considered in the Nance Report:\nA general overview regarding developments in air safety since the late 1970\u2019s, with particular emphasis on the impact of human error on flight safety\nThe impact of distraction of the flight crew on flight safety including the impact of pornography as a distraction of the flight crew, and more specifically, the unique impacts of pornography on female pilots in a male-dominated industry\nThe need for specific attention and support for pilots who may experience distraction from the perspective of flight safety\nThe effect of perceived ethnic slurs on flight safety\nThe duty of the flight crew regarding sexually explicit material (including pornography)\nAn assessment of Air Canada\u2019s response to:\nSexually explicit materials systematically found in Air Canada cockpits;\nExplicit sexual and\/or racist commentary in Air Canada cockpits;\nThe existence of a hostile or poisoned work environment resulting from any repetitious or cultural incidences of (1) or (2) above.\n[18] I agree with Air Canada that the Report was produced in the context of a grievance about pornography in the cockpits of Air Canada aircraft brought by a non-party (ACPA) on behalf of a non-party (Pilot XY). And I further agree with Air Canada that Captain Nance\u2019s primary expertise pertains to flight safety and the impact of pilot distraction on flight safety. However, I cannot agree with Air Canada\u2019s limited characterization of the Report as being about \u201cpornography in the flight deck and any impact that such pornography may have on flight safety\u201d.\n[19] My review of the Nance Report indicates that it includes a broader assessment of the culture at Air Canada with regard to sexual harassment and discrimination (of which the display of pornography cockpits may be a part), contemporaneous with the time period of the Complaint.\nC. Issues\nIs the Nance Report arguably relevant to the issues raised in the Complaint?\nShould it be disclosed?\nShould other documents pertaining to the Nance Report in Air Canada\u2019s power possession and control be disclosed?\nShould any further documents pertaining to the bid around system be disclosed?\nIf the Nance Report is ordered to be disclosed, what confidentiality measures ought to be put in place to protect the confidential personal information of Pilot XY?\nIII. ISSUE 1: Disclosure\nA. Law\n[20] The Tribunal\u2019s authority to order production of a document flows from subsection 50(1) of the Canadian Human Right Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), which states, in part:\n\u201c\u2026the member or panel shall inquire into the complaint and shall give all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations.\u201d\nand rule 6 of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure, which states:\n\u201c(1) Within the time fixed by the Panel, each party shall serve and file a Statement of Particulars setting out,\n(d) a list of all documents in the party\u2019s possession, for which no privilege is claimed, that relate to a fact, issue, or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule;\n(5) A party shall provide such additional disclosure and production as is necessary\n(b) where the party discovers that its compliance with 6(1)(d)\u2026is inaccurate or incomplete.\u201d\n[21] It is well-established by case law, and not in dispute on this motion, that the standard for the disclosure of documents pursuant to Rule 6(1)(d) and (5) is that the documents be arguably relevant to a fact, issue or form of relief sought, or identified by other parties. To be arguably relevant, there must be a nexus or rational connection between the document sought to be disclosed and a fact, issue or form of relief sought or identified by other parties (Seeley v. Canadian National Railway, 2013 CHRT 18 (\u201cSeeley\u201d), at para. 6).\n[22] Requests for disclosure \u201c\u2026must not be speculative or amount to a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d (Guay v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2004 CHRT 34 (\u201cGuay\u201d), at para. 43), but the bar for production of arguably relevant documents is a low one, and the trend is towards broader disclosure at the production stage (Warman v. Bahr, 2006 CHRT 18 at paras 6-7; see also Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 42, at para 11).\n[23] In Telecommunications Employees Association of Manitoba Inc. v. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 CHRT 28 (\u201cTEAM\u201d), the Tribunal held at para. 4:\nThe production of documents is subject to the test of arguable relevance, not a particularly high bar to meet. There must be some relevance between the information or document sought and the issue in dispute. There can be no doubt that it is in the public interest to ensure that all relevant evidence is available in a proceeding such as this one. A party is entitled to get information or documents that are or could be arguably relevant to the proceedings. This does not mean that these documents or this information will be admitted in evidence or that significant weight will be afforded to them.\n[24] However, it should also be noted that the disclosure of arguably relevant information does not mean that this information will be admitted in evidence at the hearing of the matter or that significant weight will be afforded to it in the decision-making process (see Yaffa v. Air Canada, 2014 CHRT 22 at para 5; see also TEAM at para. 4).\nB. The Positions of the Parties\n(i) The Commission\u2019s Position\n[25] The Commission submits that both the Report and any documents in Air Canada\u2019s power, possession or control that pertain to the preparation or implementation of the Nance Report (the \u201cRelated Documents\u201d) are relevant to the Complaint, including the remedies sought. More specifically, the Commission submits that the Report\u2019s analysis of the importance of an airline\u2019s support (or lack thereof) for its female pilots- particularly those that report harassment or discrimination- is relevant to the Complaint. The Commission cites Air Canada\u2019s use of the bid-around process as an example of Air Canada\u2019s alleged failure to support female pilots.\n[26] The Commission also specifically seeks documents pertaining to the bid around system employed by Air Canada for scheduling pilots and flight crew, including any gender analysis or other analysis that Air Canada has undertaken of the system and how it is used.\n[27] Finally, the Commission submits that the Report and the Related Documents would be relevant to the systemic remedies sought by the Commission as they would assist the Tribunal in understanding the steps already put in place by Air Canada to address the concerns raised in the Complaint.\n(ii) The Complainant\u2019s Position\n[28] The Complainant echoed the Commissions submissions and concluded that the Air Canada Nance Report is not only relevant but essential to the Complaint as it provides expert opinion and evidence of the consequences of gender harassment on flight safety. Ms. Clegg further submits that the Report provides evidence pertaining to the inevitable career loss of female pilots who report harassment and are not properly supported by their company.\n(iii) The Respondent\u2019s Position\n[29] Air Canada argues that the Report is limited in its scope to the issue of pornography in the cockpit of Air Canada planes, and as such has no relevance to an inquiry into Ms. Clegg\u2019s Complaint, the bid around system or scheduling more generally. Air Canada further submits that the Report is about flight safety, which is not (in its submission) a significant issue in the Complaint.\n[30] Air Canada further submits that the Report and the Related Documents are not disclosable as they are not arguably relevant to the Complaint, or (to the extent that any such documents exist and are disclosable) they have already been produced.\n[31] With regard to the request for documents pertaining to the bid around mechanism, Air Canada submits that, to the extent that such documents exist and are not privileged, all such documents have already been disclosed.\nC. Analysis\n[32] As I have noted above, I find that the Complaint that was referred to the Tribunal includes a broad allegation of systemic discrimination against female pilots at Air Canada. Furthermore, both the Complainant and the Commission are seeking systemic remedies against Air Canada to address, among other things, policies and procedures regarding gender harassment.\n(i) The Nance Report and Related Documents\n[33] In light of the broad nature of the Complaint, I find that several aspects of the Nance Report are arguably relevant to the issues before the Tribunal. Without anticipating or limiting the parties\u2019 arguments on this matter at the hearing, issues such as:\nthe need for specific attention and support for pilots who may have experienced harassment;\nthe various duties of the flight crew regarding sexist jokes, comments or materials; and\nan assessment of Air Canada\u2019s response to:\nsexually explicit materials systematically found in Air Canada cockpits;\nexplicit sexist commentary in Air Canada cockpits;\nthe existence of a hostile or poisoned work environment resulting from sexist incidents\ncould be arguably relevant to the allegations and remedies sought in the Complaint.\n[34] The motion for disclosure of the Nance Report and Related Documents passes the threshold for arguable relevance and the requested information should be disclosed. There is a rational connection between the information requested and the facts, issues and remedies identified in the Complaint. The request cannot be characterized as a fishing expedition as the information to be disclosed would provide the parties with a full and ample opportunity to present their cases.\n[35] As such, the Nance Report and the Related Documents, to the extent that such documents exist, and are not privileged, should be disclosed by Air Canada if they have not already been produced, subject to the terms of my Orders below.\n[36] It is important to note that this order pertains to the production of documents at the disclosure stage of this proceeding, and is not intended to represent any determination whatsoever of the admissibility of the Nance Report or the weight that could be afforded to it at the hearing, in the event that it is admitted, particularly in the event that it is admitted in absence of any viva voce evidence from, or cross examination of, Captain Nance by Air Canada.\n(ii) Documents Pertaining to the Bid Around System\n[37] The Commission has requested any documents analysing or investigating why co-pilots engage in altering their schedules to fly with certain captains, or bidding around, including any data, and\/or gender analysis of data, in respect of the number of co-pilots who bid around.\n[38] With regard to the documents requested by the Commission pertaining to the bid around system, it is my view that any such documents would easily meet the threshold for disclosure in this matter. Any such documents should have already been produced or (pursuant to r. 6(1)(e) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules) should be included in Air Canada\u2019s list of relevant documents over which privilege is claimed.\nIV. ISSUE 2: Confidentiality of Pilot XY\nA. Law\n[39] The Canadian Human Rights Act provides the Tribunal with the authority to make a confidentiality order in the appropriate circumstances.\n[40] Section 52(1)(c) of the Act stipulates that the Tribunal may take any measures and make any order necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the inquiry if the Tribunal is satisfied that there is a real and substantial risk that the disclosure of matters will cause undue hardship to the persons involved and that this outweighs the societal interest in a public hearing.\nB. The position of the parties\n(i) Pilot XY\u2019s Position\n[41] Pilot XY submits that disclosure of the Nance Report raises serious concerns about the confidentiality of Pilot XY\u2019s personal information (\u201cIdentifying Information\u201d) and could cause her undue hardship.\n[42] Although the Nance Report was produced in the context of a grievance by the ACPA on behalf of Pilot XY, that issue was been resolved as between those parties and it appears that the Nance Report was never made public.\n[43] Pilot XY has an ongoing employment relationship with Air Canada and is concerned that any disclosure of her Identifying Information may cause her undue hardship. As a result, Pilot XY has requested that the Tribunal take various measures to protect her confidentiality, including:\nRedaction of the Nance Report to remove Identifying Information;\nDestruction of any unredacted copies of the Nance Report;\nContinued anonymization of Pilot XY;\nNon-disclosure of the Report and Identifying Information by the Tribunal;\nLimits on disclosure of the Nance Report;\nStanding in any future motions or proceedings concerning the Nance Report.\n(ii) The Commission\u2019s Position\n[44] The Commission is supportive of measures that would protect the Identifying Information of Pilot XY.\n[45] No other party made submissions with regard to the confidentiality protections requested by Pilot XY. As such, Pilot XY\u2019s request is unopposed.\nC. Analysis\n[46] Pilot XY is not a party to the Complaint, and (with the possible exception of the fact that she is a female pilot at Air Canada) her Identifying Information is not relevant to this proceeding. Furthermore, her requests for confidentiality protections are reasonable and are unopposed.\n[47] The Tribunal is empowered to take any measures necessary to ensure the appropriate balance between confidentiality and the societal interest in a public hearing.\n[48] I am convinced that the need to protect Pilot XY\u2019s confidentiality outweighs the societal interest in the full disclosure of this aspect of the hearing process, and I find that an order protecting Pilot XY\u2019s confidentiality is warranted under these circumstances.\nV. Order\nA. Disclosure\n[49] Exercising my discretion within the purpose of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure, I make the following orders:\nAir Canada shall produce the Nance Report, as well as any additional documents in its power, possession or control that reflect input by Air Canada or its employees into the preparation or implementation of the Nance Report, to the extent that such documents exist, and are not privileged, subject to the Confidentiality Orders below.\nAir Canada shall provide this information to the parties within three (3) weeks of the date of this decision.\nB. Confidentiality\n[50] Exercising my discretion within the purpose of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure, I make the following orders:\nThe party who is the subject of the Nance Report shall be referred to as Pilot XY in all further submissions, discussions, rulings or decision over the course of this inquiry.\nAir Canada shall disclose a copy of the Nance Report wherein all Identifying Information (exclusive of Pilot XY\u2019s gender) has been redacted in a manner consistent with the submissions of Pilot XY.\nThe Commission and the Complainant shall destroy any unredacted copies of the Nance Report in their power, possession or control.\nThe Tribunal Registry Office shall retain one copy of the unredacted Nance Report, which shall be filed under seal and which shall not be disclosed.\nAny further motion regarding the Nance Report shall be made on Notice to Pilot XY, who will also have standing to make submissions to the Tribunal with regard to the continued protection of her confidential information.\nSigned by\nKirsten Mercer\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nAugust 11, 2017\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT257\/3116\nStyle of Cause:\nJane Clegg v.

In light of this secondary process that was started after I had requested family accommodation, and the efforts that were made to identify and accommodate Cpl.

Complaint & Motions for Disclosure\n[1] Corporal Kayreen Brickner (Complainant or Cpl. Brickner) is a female member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the Respondent in this proceeding. She is married to another member of the RCMP and together they have four minor children. The Complainant and her husband, Corporal Marinis (Cpl. Marinis), had been stationed together at E Division (British Columbia) in Squamish, B.C. In April 2012, Cpl. Marinis applied for an RCMP position in Whitehorse in the Yukon Territory but it required moving his spouse and children from British Columbia to the Yukon Territory.\n[2] The Complainant alleges in her Statement of Particulars (SOP) that the RCMP agreed to try its best to accommodate her in securing a new position in Whitehorse. However, she only began to work in Whitehorse two years later in January 2015. In the meantime, the Complainant alleges that the RCMP in the Yukon (M Division) had offered her a position that did not accommodate her childcare responsibilities. The Complainant further alleges that subsequent to her rejection of this offer of employment, M Division failed to inform her of other available employment opportunities and deviated from RCMP practice in filling positions with other candidates rather than staffing the said positions with the Complainant. She alleges this was discrimination based on the grounds of sex and family status. She also alleges two acts of retaliation.\n[3] In preparing for the hearing of this case, Cpl. Brickner has brought this motion for the disclosure of documentation that she believes is arguably relevant.\nII. Principles of Disclosure\n[4] Pursuant to subsection 50(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (Act), parties before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (Tribunal) must be given a full and ample opportunity to present their case. To be given this opportunity, parties require, among other things, the disclosure of arguably relevant information in the possession or care of the opposing party prior to the hearing of the matter. Along with the facts and issues presented by the parties, the disclosure of information allows each party to know the case it is up against and, therefore, adequately prepare for the hearing.\n[5] In deciding whether the information ought to be disclosed, the Tribunal must consider whether the information at issue is arguably relevant (see Warman v. Bahr, 2006 CHRT 18 at para. 6). This standard is meant to \u201cprevent production for purposes which are speculative, fanciful, disruptive, unmeritorious, obstructive and time-consuming\u201d (see Day v. Department of National Defence and Hortie, Ruling No. 3, 2002\/12\/06). This also ensures the probity of the evidence.\n[6] The standard is not a particularly high threshold for the moving party to meet. If there is a rational connection between a document and the facts, issues, or forms of relief identified by the parties in the matter, the information should be disclosed pursuant to paragraphs 6(1)(d) and 6(1)(e) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) (Rules) (see Guay v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2004 CHRT 34 at para. 42 (Guay); Rai v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2013 CHRT 6 at para. 28; and, Seeley v. Canadian National Railway, 2013 CHRT 18 at para. 6 (Seeley)).\n[7] However, the request for disclosure must not be speculative or amount to a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d (see Guay at para. 43). The documents requested should be identified with reasonable particularity. It is the Tribunal\u2019s view that in the search for truth and despite the arguable relevance of evidence, the Tribunal may exercise its discretion to deny a motion for disclosure, so long as the requirements of natural justice and the Rules are respected, in order to ensure the informal and expeditious conduct of the inquiry (see Gil v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1999 CanLII 8407 (FC) at para. 13; see also s. 48.9(1) of the Act).\n[8] This Tribunal has already recognized in its past decisions that it may deny ordering the disclosure of evidence where the probative value of such evidence would not outweigh its prejudicial effect on the proceedings. Notably, the Tribunal should be cautious about ordering searches where a party or a stranger to the litigation would be subjected to an onerous and far-reaching search for documents, especially where ordering disclosure would risk adding substantial delay to the efficiency of the inquiry or where the documents are merely related to a side issue rather than the main issues in dispute (see Yaffa v. Air Canada, 2014 CHRT 22 at para. 4; Seeley at para. 7; see also R. v. Seaboyer [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577 at 609-611).\n[9] It should also be noted that the disclosure of arguably relevant information does not mean that this information will be admitted in evidence at the hearing of the matter or that significant weight will be afforded it in the decision making process (see Telecommunications Employees Association of Manitoba Inc. v. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 CHRT 28 at para. 4).\n[10] Moreover, given that a party\u2019s obligation to disclose is limited to documents that are \u201cin the party\u2019s possession\u201d under section 6 of the Rules, the Tribunal cannot order a party to generate or create new documents for disclosure (see Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 42 at para. 17).\nIII. Complainant\u2019s Motion for Disclosure\n[11] The disclosure process between the parties commenced more than a year ago. The Respondent provided a number of documents, more than 1,100 in total, to the Complainant in the fall of 2016. However, Cpl. Brickner believed there were more relevant documents outstanding, so she made a written request to the RCMP in January of 2017, outlining various documents that she wanted disclosed. Cpl. Brickner was not satisfied with the Respondent\u2019s response to her request, which she received in April 2017. As such, Cpl. Brickner brought a motion for disclosure to the Tribunal on May 17, 2017.\n[12] A Case Management Conference Call (CMCC) was held on May 24, 2017, at which time I raised the point that the time required to hear, rule on and comply with any order made on this complex motion might result in the parties not being ready to begin the hearing scheduled to start in September 2017. Two days later, Cpl. Brickner advised the Tribunal that she would amend her motion to narrow the list of requests. The new motion, which is the subject of this ruling, was received by the Tribunal on May 29, 2017. Submissions on the motion were received from the Commission and the RCMP, and the Complainant and the Commission were permitted to provide reply submissions.\n[13] In total, the motion lists 23 separate documents or groups of documents that Cpl. Brickner would like disclosed by the RCMP. This ruling will address each of those 23 requests separately, with the Tribunal\u2019s ruling for each request contained under each of the 23 headings below.\nIV. Documentation Requested By Complainant\n1. All documents pertaining to the outcome of the question posed in 2013 by K Division DSSR Michelle BOUTIN to Commissioner PAULSON regarding Workplace Accommodation.\nNote: Commissioner PAULSON is set to retire by the end of June 2017. If this particular disclosure is moved forward by the tribunal then I request that a firm deadline also be imposed on the RCMP to guard against the potential inability of Commissioner PAULSON to disclose given his announced retirement date.\n(i) Complainant\u2019s Submissions\n[14] Cpl. Brickner believes these documents are arguably relevant because they would show that senior managers of the RCMP were informed in 2013 that there were failures throughout the organization to meet requests for family accommodations. In her view, this would be evidence of a systemic issue within the RCMP.\n(ii) Commission\u2019s Submissions\n[15] The Commission believes this information would be helpful to Cpl. Brickner and that Commissioner Paulson\u2019s response to female officers about workplace accommodation would be arguably relevant to compare it to the manner in which Cpl. Brickner was treated.\n(iii) Respondent\u2019s Submissions\n[16] The RCMP submits that this request is too vague, too broad and the information requested is, at best, of questionable usefulness. There is no adequate information in the request to specifically identify the email exchange or to understand which documents she is seeking production of. It also submits that a response given four years ago may not be an accurate reflection of current RCMP policies or practices.\n[17] Notwithstanding its objections, the RCMP has indicated it will make reasonable efforts to look for and produce Commissioner Paulson\u2019s email or otherwise written response to DSSR Michelle Boutin\u2019s 2013 question on workplace accommodation.\n(iv) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[18] The RCMP is ordered to make reasonable efforts to look for and produce Commissioner Paulson\u2019s email or otherwise written response to DSSR Michelle Boutin\u2019s 2013 question on workplace accommodation. The Tribunal imposes a deadline of September 15, 2017, to comply with this order. However, if the Respondent is able to comply earlier, the earlier production should be made to assist with this matter moving forward to hearing in a timely manner. If this documentation cannot be located with reasonable efforts, the RCMP will advise the other parties and the Tribunal what steps were undertaken in committing their efforts on or before September 15, 2017.\n2. All requests made within M Division (Yukon) and all documents pertaining to the number of Family accommodations received as per form 6346 (created b\/w 2012-05) in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. These documents can be vetted to protect the identity of the requestor.\n(i) Complainant\u2019s Submissions\n[19] The Complainant states that this form is required by the RCMP when a family accommodation request is made. However, she was not advised of this requirement and as such, she wants to see if there was any formal direction or policy requiring the completion of this form at the relevant time.\n(ii) Commission\u2019s Submissions\n[20] The Commission supports the request given that the RCMP alleged in its SOP that Cpl. Brickner did not make a request for accommodation or fill out form 6346. It further adds that the RCMP should disclose the number of times a family accommodation was made in 2012-2015 in M Division where the form 6346 was not submitted.\n(iii) Respondent\u2019s Submissions\n[21] The RCMP characterizes this request as an onerous and far-reaching search for documents. Its submission explains that there are approximately over 200 employees in M Division alone and that formal family-related workplace accommodation requests are not kept in a central database. Thus, to fulfill the request, the RCMP would be required to manually review the paper service files of each RCMP member posted at M Division within the relevant time. Furthermore, since the paper copies of such forms would only exist in each employee\u2019s file, where employees have transferred to other divisions of the RCMP, M Division would have to request the assistance of other divisions of the RCMP to obtain the forms, if any, in dispute. Where the form was not filed, an informal request would have been made to the employee\u2019s supervisor, and in such cases, the RCMP submits, it would be necessary to contact every supervisor working during that period to canvass their recollection of informal requests. The RCMP also gave additional reasons why it objects to this request.\n(iv) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[22] The Tribunal recognizes that the production of the documents requested by Cpl. Brickner may help refute the RCMP\u2019s claim that she ought to have completed form 6346 in order to receive family accommodation. However, given that the collection of this information would be time-consuming for the RCMP and given that the documentation sought appears to be of limited value to the Complainant\u2019s case, it is the Tribunal\u2019s view that this request for disclosure ought to be denied.\n[23] At the hearing, and perhaps in the cross-examination of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses, Cpl. Brickner will have the opportunity to explore the question of whether there were exceptions to the requirement to complete the form 6346 in order to have workplace accommodation. It is the Tribunal\u2019s view that proceeding in this manner will prevent further delay in the proceeding while preserving the Complainant\u2019s right to know the case she has to meet.\n[24] Regarding the Commission\u2019s suggestion that the RCMP disclose the number of times a family accommodation was made in 2012-2015 in M Division where the form 6346 was not submitted, the Tribunal is of the view that the Commission is requesting the Tribunal to order the creation of a document or list. Under section 6 of the Rules, a party\u2019s obligation to disclose is limited to documents that are in the party\u2019s possession. As stated above, the Tribunal cannot order a party to generate or create new documents for disclosure. For these reasons, the Commission\u2019s request is denied.\n3. All documents pertaining to file 2013-3588, this file was created and maintained by S\/Sgt. Diane DOYLE. S\/Sgt. DOYLEs position was a Respectful Workplace representative for E Division which oversaw M Division.\n(i) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[25] The RCMP has agreed to disclose and produce all documents located in the above-mentioned file, with the exception of any document that may be protected by a recognized privilege under the law of evidence. If there are any documents for which privilege is claimed, the Respondent will indicate to the other parties such documents and the privilege claimed. The Tribunal orders the production of these documents and imposes a deadline of September 15, 2017, to comply. However, if the Respondent is able to comply earlier, the earlier production should be made to assist with this matter moving forward to the hearing in a timely manner.\n4. All documents pertaining to the \u201cyellow\u201d files labeled BRICKNER and\/or MARINIS maintained by E and M Division Human Resource Officer A\/Comm Sharon WOODBURN.\n(i) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[26] The RCMP has agreed to disclose and produce a copy of Cpl. Brickner and Cpl. Marinis\u2019 \u201cyellow files\u201d (service files). In its submissions, the RCMP argues that much of Cpl. Brickner\u2019s file, and perhaps the totality of Cpl. Marinis\u2019 file, is not arguably relevant. However, in this case, the RCMP has agreed to the disclosure request anyway, but on the condition that it receives written consents from Cpl. Brickner and Cpl. Marinis before such disclosure is made. The reason for this was not explained in the RCMP\u2019s submissions, but it would appear to be a reasonable request, especially for Cpl. Marinis, who is not a party to this proceeding.\n[27] As such, the Tribunal makes no order regarding this request and leaves it up to the Complainant and her husband to avail themselves of the Respondent\u2019s offer.\n5. All documents pertaining to Sgt. Cindy RATTRAY, E Division promotions unit, giving direction or receiving requests for assistance from S\/Sgt. Tony PARK. Including any notes, direction or communications relating to M Division and MCU placements and\/or Cpl. Kayreen BRICKNER.\n(i) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[28] The Tribunal does not need to order disclosure on this request as the RCMP indicates its belief that it has already disclosed all such relevant documents in its possession. However, the Tribunal directs the Respondent to provide Cpl. Brickner with a list of all documents that it has already provided which it believes meets this request on or before September 15, 2017. The Respondent has further agreed to confirm with Sgt. Rattray that all documents arguably relevant to this matter, including notes from July and August 2012, have been produced. If any new documents are identified, the Tribunal orders their disclosure subject to the exception of any document that may be protected by a recognized privilege under the law of evidence. If there are any documents for which privilege is claimed, the Respondent will indicate to the other parties such documents and the privilege claimed. The Tribunal imposes a deadline of September 15, 2017, to comply with this order. However, if the Respondent is able to comply earlier, the earlier production should be made to assist with this matter moving forward to the hearing in a timely manner. If any new such documents are identified at a later date, they will be disclosed and produced as required by Rule 6(5)(b).\n6. All documents pertaining to conversations, communications or direction Elizabeth MACDONALD gave regarding staffing, grievances or human rights complaints involving Cpl. Kayreen BRICKNER and\/or Phil GOULET and any member in M Division relating to promotional or staffing actions, specifically the two processes of the MCU position (2014-2017) and the Crops Reviewer (promotion) 2015. This would include notes, files and phone conversations relating to Cpl. Kayreen BRICKNER including the following phone conversations;\n\u00b7 April 2015 Phone conversation(s) with Insp. Phil GOULET relating to the Crops Reviewer promotional position in M division, grievance and human rights complaint.\n\u00b7 February 12, 2016 Phone conversation with S\/Sgt. Jason FLYNN regarding the conversation and direction given relating to the MCU lateral position.\n(i) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[29] The Tribunal does not need to order disclosure on this request as the RCMP indicates it believes that it has already disclosed all such relevant documents in its possession. However, the Tribunal directs the Respondent to provide Cpl. Brickner with a list of all documents that it has already provided which it believes meets this request on or before September 15, 2017. If any new documents relevant to this request are identified, the Respondent must disclose them in accordance with Rule 6(5)(b) subject to the exception of any document that may be protected by a recognized privilege under the law of evidence. If there are any documents for which privilege is claimed, the Respondent will indicate to the other parties such documents and the privilege claimed.\n7. All documents from Inspector Phil GOULET, E Division Promotions Unit, pertaining to Cpl. Kayreen BRICKNER, the Crops Reviewer position (promotion 2015) includes (sic) any notes, documents and communications regarding phone conversations, the staffing file and the Grievance.\n(i) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[30] The Tribunal does not need to order disclosure on this request as the RCMP indicates that it believes it has already disclosed all such relevant documents in its possession. However, the Tribunal directs the Respondent to provide Cpl. Brickner with a list of all documents that it has already provided which it believes meets this request on or before September 15, 2017. If any new documents relevant to this request are identified, the Respondent must disclose them in accordance with Rule 6(5)(b) subject to the exception of any document that may be protected by a recognized privilege under the law of evidence. If there are any documents for which privilege is claimed, the Respondent will indicate to the other parties such documents and the privilege claimed.\n8. All documents pertaining to the (depersonalized) staffing actions for M Division, including Bulletins, STE positions, and divisional placements, newly created positions, official staffing actions (posted jobs national\/promotion) and a list of positions that remained vacant anytime within years 2012 \u2013 2014. Breaking down:\n\u00b7 All 2285\u2019s for the NCO General Duty positions in from April 2012 thru 2014.\n\u00b7 All A22a issued for M Division NCO Cpl. positions filled laterally or promoted into between April 2012-2014.\n\u00b7 General Duty Schedule (working schedule) including restructuring, secondments and vacancies for 2012, 2013 and 2014.\n\u00b7 M Division MCU schedule (working) which reflects the restructuring, secondments and vacancies throughout 2012, 2013, and 2014.\n\u00b7 Org Chart \u2013 Including years 2012, 2013, 2014 outlining FTE and duration in each position in which he did not vacate General Duty until his transfer in Feb 2013.\n(i) Complainant\u2019s Submissions\n[31] Cpl. Brickner argues that these documents will give an accurate account of how M Division manages its resources and vacancies. She suggests that there were additional positions available that were not offered to her and as such these documents support her allegations of discrimination and retaliation.\n[32] In her Reply submissions, Cpl. Brickner does not add clarification. She reiterates requests for two documents the RCMP has agreed to provide, and she requests information in two instances, but not related to specific documents. She also uses her Reply to make argument in support of her allegations.\n(ii) Commission\u2019s Submissions\n[33] The Commission agrees these documents are arguably relevant because they will allow the parties and the Tribunal to examine the RCMP\u2019s defence in context of its argument that it could not offer certain positions to Cpl. Brickner.\n(iii) Respondent\u2019s Submissions\n[34] The RCMP states that some of the above disclosure has already been made, and it agrees to make certain further disclosure of documents requested that are in its possession. However, the Respondent refuses to disclose certain documents, such as documents relating to positions outside of Whitehorse or at levels other than Corporal, some of which it argues are not relevant and for others it argues that the requests are too onerous and far-reaching.\n(iv) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[35] The Complainant\u2019s request was not entirely clear to the Tribunal, especially since Cpl. Brickner uses some abbreviations and terminology that are not familiar to it. She also makes a reference to a specific person in the last part of her request (i.e. \u201c\u2026which he did not vacate\u2026\u201d), but does not sufficiently identify this person. Moreover, it was not clear what M Division meant geographically to the Complainant. A request for clarification was made to Cpl. Brickner, and the other parties were offered a chance to reply to her clarifications. The Commission chose not to reply to the Complainant\u2019s clarifications. The Respondent replied and added to the clarifications. They also confirmed which documents they had already disclosed under this request. The clarifications have assisted the Tribunal with this decision. Notably, while the Complainant\u2019s understanding of M Division differs from that of the RCMP, the Complainant\u2019s response confirms that she is only interested in acquiring information about positions physically located in Whitehorse. The Complainant also specified that the person she refers to in the request is Cpl. Hutchings, yet she provided no reasons to explain the arguable relevance of this specific request.\n[36] In a broad sense, any documentation requested must be arguably relevant, and as such it must bear some connection with the allegations made by a party to the dispute. It is apparent that this request relates to the allegations Cpl. Brickner made in paras. 62-73 of her SOP where she alleges that between June 2012 and December 2014, there were 11 vacant positions of which she was not advised or selected. This request seeks to further identify what other positions might have been available during this period for which again, Cpl. Brickner was not advised or considered. I am not convinced that this additional documentation will add to Cpl. Brickner\u2019s case in any measurable way. It is the Tribunal\u2019s view that allowing this request may unduly delay the efficiency of the inquiry without adding any substantial probative value as the Complainant seems to already be in possession of evidence that may support her claim that she was not considered for several jobs in M Division. The Tribunal wishes to take this time to remind the parties that the Complainant need only establish that she was passed over for one position on a prohibited ground in order for the Tribunal to make a finding of discrimination.\n[37] Furthermore, if she desires, Cpl. Brickner will have the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses of the Respondent about the general turnover and availability of positions during this period. However, in the interest of keeping the inquiry focused on the allegations in the SOP, further documentation under this request will not be ordered by the Tribunal.\n[38] The Respondent states that it has already produced, with one exception noted below, all relevant documents in its possession regarding the staffing actions at the Corporal level between 2012 and 2014 based in Whitehorse. However, the Tribunal directs the Respondent to provide Cpl. Brickner with a list of all documents that it has already provided which it believes meets this request on or before September 15, 2017. If any new documents relevant to this request are identified, the Respondent must disclose them subject to the exception of any document that may be protected by a recognized privilege under the law of evidence. If there are any documents for which privilege is claimed, the Respondent will indicate to the other parties such documents and the privilege claimed.\n[39] The exception to the documents provided relate to the General Duty Watch Commander position that was offered to Cpl. Brickner in 2012. The RCMP has undertaken to disclose the documentation relating to this staffing position. Therefore, the Tribunal orders the production of these documents and imposes a deadline of September 15, 2017, to comply. However, if the Respondent is able to comply earlier, the earlier production should be made to assist with this matter moving forward to the hearing in a timely manner. If any new such documents are identified at a later date, they will be disclosed and produced as required by Rule 6(5)(b).\n[40] Cpl. Brickner also requests the General Duty Schedule, the MCU (Major Crimes Unit) Schedule and the Organizational Chart for the years 2012-2014. The RCMP has agreed to provide these documents, but it suggests that certain pieces of information Cpl. Brickner has identified in her request, namely information with respect to \u201crestructuring, secondments and vacancies\u201d may not be reflected in these documents. The Tribunal therefore directs the RCMP to produce the General Duty Schedules, the MCU Schedules and the Organizational Charts as they exist for the years 2012-2014 on or before September 15, 2017. The Tribunal also notes that the Complainant will have the opportunity to make specific inquiries about Cpl. Hutchings as well as any restructuring, secondments and vacancies occurring in M Division during the cross-examination of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses.\n9. All documents pertaining to the MCU staffing file (2014) for the Corporal position that has remained vacant and is still vacant. Including notes, meetings, emails and direction regarding the stopping and starting (reviews) of this job process.\n\u00b7 All notes, files, documents and emails relating to the 2014-03-08 MCU selection. S\/Sgt. PARK advises DUNMALL \u201cwill advise of the results once the selection process has been completed. Then on 2014-04-08 \u201cthe staffing of this position is currently being reviewed by an outside source. All applicants that were part of this process and the HRMIS run.\n\u00b7 All notes, files, documents and emails between S\/Sgt. FLYNN, S\/Sgt. PARK, Sgt. WILTSE and Kurtis PILOPOW relating to their discussions to create a panel for the MCU selection. If they met, reviewed or had any discussions relating to any applications or documents (2014-10-14).\n\u00b7 All notes, files, documents and emails relating to the processes and efforts made by M Division to identify candidates for this position throughout 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.\n(i) Complainant\u2019s Submissions\n[41] The Complainant argues that these documents are arguably relevant to her second allegation of retaliation. She believes they will be part of the evidence that shows she was not considered to fill this vacancy because she filed a human rights complaint against the Respondent.\n(ii) Commission\u2019s Submissions\n[42] The Commission supports Cpl. Brickner\u2019s request as it believes the documents are arguably relevant to the retaliation allegation and may demonstrate why Cpl. Brickner was not considered for this position.\n(iii) Respondent\u2019s Submissions\n[43] The Respondent argues that it has already disclosed all the relevant documents in its possession relating to this staffing action. The RCMP suggests that the only documents relevant to Cpl. Brickner\u2019s complaint are documents relating to the staffing action up to the point in time when she was advised of the decision not to offer her that position. Unfortunately, the Respondent does not indicate when that happened. According to the Complainant\u2019s SOP, she was advised she was not successful on two occasions, November 2014 (see SOP para. 88) and again in April 2016 (see SOP para. 95.)\n(iv) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[44] The Tribunal finds the requested documents to be arguably relevant in the context of the retaliation complaint. The RCMP is ordered to disclose all of the requested documents related to the vacant MCU staffing file up to December 31, 2016, on or before September 15, 2017. This disclosure order is limited to documents up until this date as the Tribunal finds that later disclosure is not arguably relevant. As the RCMP did not specify the exact date upon which Cpl. Brickner was advised of the decision not to offer her that position, December 31, 2016 was selected to permit reasonable disclosure to the Complainant without subjecting the Respondent to an unreasonable, far-reaching request for documents that are not arguably relevant. To the extent that the Respondent has already disclosed some of this documentation, it is directed to provide the Complainant with a list of such documentation already submitted under this request on or before September 15, 2017. However, if the Respondent is able to comply earlier, the earlier production should be made to assist with this matter moving forward to hearing in a timely manner.\n10. A copy of then Cpl. and now Sgt. Calista MCLEODs CV that was submitted for the MMIW&G positon in 2013.\n(i) Complainant\u2019s Submissions\n[45] Cpl. Brickner challenges statements from the RCMP that she was considered for every position that was open during the time she sought to be transferred to M Division. She believes that by comparing her qualifications to the curriculum vitae of Sgt. McLeod, she will be able to demonstrate that her qualifications were superior. Cpl. Brickner believes this is arguably relevant to her claim that the RCMP did not intend to offer her a position because of her family accommodation request.\n(ii) Commission\u2019s Submissions\n[46] The Commission also supports this request for the same reasons Cpl. Brickner provided.\n(iii) Respondent\u2019s Submissions\n[47] The Respondent refuses disclosure of this document on the grounds that it is not arguably relevant to Cpl. Brickner\u2019s allegations and because it contains personal information about a third-party not involved in this case. The RCMP alleges that Cpl. Brickner inquired about and was invited to indicate her interest in this position. However, Cpl. Brickner did not indicate any interest. She later disclosed that she was on work restrictions due to her pregnancy. Having acknowledged that she was not in a position to indicate her interest for the temporary positions after May 2013, including the MMIW&G\u2019s position, the RCMP argues that Cpl. Brickner was never in competition with Cpl. McLeod for this position.\n(iv) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[48] The request for this document is denied. It is not arguably relevant to compare Cpl. Brickner\u2019s qualifications against successful applicants for temporary positions in which Cpl. Brickner admits she did not express an interest.\n11. A copy of then Cpl. and now Sgt. Calista MCLEODS resume \/ CV used for her placement\/secondment to MCU in 2013 (2013-2015).\n(i) Complainant\u2019s Submissions\n[49] Cpl. Brickner\u2019s argument for this document is similar to the previous request. She challenges statements from the RCMP that she was considered for every position that was open during the time she sought to be transferred to M Division. She believes that by comparing her qualifications to the curriculum vitae of Sgt. McLeod at the time she was seconded into the MCU, she will be able to demonstrate that her qualifications were superior. Cpl. Brickner believes this is arguably relevant to her claim that the RCMP did not intend to offer her a position because of her family accommodation request.\n(ii) Commission\u2019s Submissions\n[50] In addition to supporting Cpl. Brickner\u2019s reasons, the Commission argues that this document is particularly relevant given that Cpl. Brickner had qualified in second place for the MCU position on offer in 2012.\n(iii) Respondent\u2019s Submissions\n[51] The Respondent\u2019s reasons for refusing disclosure of this document are similar to the previous request. The secondment to the MCU was another temporary positon for which Cpl. Brickner did not indicate her interest. Having acknowledged that she was not in a position to indicate her interest for the temporary positions after May 2013, including this secondment, the RCMP argues that Cpl. Brickner was never in competition with Cpl. McLeod for this position. The Respondent argues there are no facts or legal questions that would justify disclosing the private and personal information of a third party not involved in this matter.\n(iv) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[52] The request for this document is denied because it is not arguably relevant. The secondment arose out of the temporary MMIW&G positon of which Cpl. Brickner was aware, but for which she chose not to express an interest. It does not appear to be probative to compare Cpl. Brickner\u2019s qualifications against a successful applicant\u2019s for a temporary position that arose from duties of another position for which Cpl. Brickner did not apply. Regarding the general vacancy of the MCU position, Cpl. Brickner will have the opportunity to lead other evidence on that subject without Sgt. McLeod\u2019s resume \/ CV used for her placement\/secondment to MCU in 2013.\n12. A copy of then Cpl. and now Sgt. Calista MCLEOD\u2019s competencies and Cover resume used to compete in the promotion for the Crops Reviewer Position in January 2015.\n(i) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[53] The RCMP has agreed to make reasonable efforts to locate and produce Sgt. McLeod\u2019s competencies and cover r\u00e9sum\u00e9 used to compete in the promotion for the Crops Reviewer position in January 2015. The Tribunal orders the production of these documents and imposes a deadline of September 15, 2017, to comply. However, if the Respondent is able to comply earlier, the earlier production should be made to assist with this matter moving forward to hearing in a timely manner. If there are any documents for which privilege is claimed, the Respondent will indicate to the other parties such documents and the privilege claimed. If this documentation cannot be located with reasonable efforts, the RCMP will advise the other parties and the Tribunal what steps were undertaken in committing their efforts on or before September 15, 2017.\n13. All documents pertaining to the request by M Division for an \u201cIndependent\u201d Review of the MCU selection (2012) including a copy of the review file, communications and notes between involved parties. This is referenced in emails and is believed to have been created by Insp. LUCIER and\/or Supt. MCCONNELL.\n(i) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[54] The Tribunal does not need to order disclosure on this request as the RCMP indicates that it believes it has already disclosed all such relevant documents in its possession. However, the Tribunal directs the Respondent to provide Cpl. Brickner with a list of all documents that it has already provided which it believes meets this request on or before September 15, 2017. If any new documents relevant to this request are identified, the Respondent must disclose them in accordance with Rule 6(5)(b) subject to the exception of any document that may be protected by a recognized privilege under the law of evidence. If there are any documents for which privilege is claimed, the Respondent will indicate to the other parties such documents and the privilege claimed.\n14. A copy of the document (attachment) from S\/Sgt. BRAMHILL\u2019s email titled \u201cFamily Separation\u201d that was sent to S\/Sgt. Douglas COOPER on October 31, 2014.\n(i) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[55] The RCMP has agreed to make reasonable efforts to locate, disclose and produce this document. The Tribunal orders the production of this document and imposes a deadline of September 15, 2017, to comply. However, if the Respondent is able to comply earlier, the earlier production should be made to assist with this matter moving forward to hearing in a timely manner. If the document cannot be located with reasonable efforts, the RCMP will advise the other parties and the Tribunal what steps were undertaken in committing their efforts on or before September 15, 2017.\n15. A copy of the attachment from the email forwarded to Insp. TEWNION on June 4, 2012 by S\/Sgt. PARK. Attachment was labeled \u201cMARINIS-spouse\u201d.\n(i) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[56] The RCMP has agreed to make reasonable efforts to locate, disclose and produce this document. The Tribunal orders the production of this document and imposes a deadline of September 15, 2017, to comply. However, if the Respondent is able to comply earlier, the earlier production should be made to assist with this matter moving forward to hearing in a timely manner. If the email attachment cannot be located with reasonable efforts, the RCMP will advise the other parties and the Tribunal what steps were undertaken in committing their efforts on or before September 15, 2017.\n16. All relevant documents related to Cpl. Lana PLUMMERS emails to M Division S\/Sgt. PARK and\/or Sgt. Mark LONDON (August 7, 2012) where Cpl. PLUMMER identified herself as a mother with an 18 month old child and was interested in the MCU position.\n(i) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[57] The Tribunal does not need to order disclosure on this request as the RCMP indicates that it believes it has already disclosed all such relevant documents in its possession. However, the Tribunal directs the Respondent to provide Cpl. Brickner with a list of all documents that it has already provided which it believes meets this request on or before September 15, 2017. If any new documents relevant to this request are identified, the Respondent must disclose them in accordance with Rule 6(5)(b) subject to the exception of any document that may be protected by a recognized privilege under the law of evidence. If there are any documents for which privilege is claimed, the Respondent will indicate to the other parties such documents and the privilege claimed.\n17. A list of all the Corporals within the division and the dates each Corporal received their assessments for since 2013.\n(i) Complainant\u2019s Submissions\n[58] The Complainant argues this document will show that she and her husband have been subjected to retaliation in the form of not having regular assessments. She believes this will demonstrate that she and her husband are not being supported or developed by management due to their involvement in the complaint.\n(ii) Commission\u2019s Submissions\n[59] The Commission supports the request and argues that the lack of assessments is peculiar. In its Reply submissions, the Commission states that the key thrust of its SOP is that the RCMP adversely differentiated against Cpl. Brickner. As such, this document request should not be restricted to the issue of retaliation. Further, the Commission highlights para. 35 of its SOP where it refers to Cpl. Brickner having been \u201cexcluded and dismissed by members and other supervisors, including middle and senior management.\u201d The Commission goes on to suggest this has negatively affected her prospects for career advancement.\n(iii) Respondent\u2019s Submissions\n[60] The Respondent argues that this documentation is not arguably relevant because there is no nexus to the issues in dispute. Specifically, the RCMP argues that the request essentially amounts to a new allegation of retaliation that was not outlined in the Complainant\u2019s SOP or in her Reply SOP. As such, there should be no order for compliance with this request.\n(iv) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[61] I note that the Complainant\u2019s request appears to be for information, rather than specific documentation which may or may not exist. The Tribunal cannot order disclosure of a document that does not exist.\n[62] The Respondent\u2019s main objection, however, is that the allegation of retaliation, based on the allegation that neither the Complainant nor her husband have received assessments since beginning work at M Division, is a new allegation that was not part of the Complainant\u2019s SOP. I must agree with the RCMP\u2019s position on this point. The documents requested must have a nexus to the allegations contained in a party\u2019s SOP. In this case, Cpl. Brickner\u2019s SOP does not allege that she has been subjected to retaliation in the form of not having regular assessments.\n[63] Moreover, the Commission\u2019s argument that a key thrust of its SOP relates to the adverse differential treatment against Cpl. Brickner is too vague to now encompass a very specific allegation that should have been raised in a SOP. This document request alludes to a very specific act of retaliation and it would be prejudicial to the Respondent to allow what would amount to a new allegation of retaliation without having provided the RCMP the chance to respond to such in its SOP.\n[64] It is always open to a party before the Tribunal to make an application to amend their SOP to add another allegation. However, all parties are reminded that any new interlocutory motion will take time and could potentially further delay the commencement of any scheduled hearing.\n18. A list of the M Division Corporals and or Constables in an acting role (Sergeant and\/or Staff\/Sergeant) since 2013.\n(i) Complainant\u2019s Submissions\n[65] Similar to the previous document request, the Complainant argues this document will show that she and her husband have been subjected to retaliation by not having been given the opportunity to partake in \u201cacting roles\u201d which may assist in their career advancement. She would like to compare the opportunities afforded to other corporals to demonstrate that she and her husband are being excluded.\n(ii) Commission\u2019s Submissions\n[66] The Commission supports the request and gives the same argument as for the previous document request. In its Reply submissions, the Commission states that the key thrust of its SOP is that the RCMP adversely differentiated against Cpl. Brickner. As such, this document request should not be restricted to the issue of retaliation. Further, the Commission highlights para. 35 of its SOP where it refers to Cpl. Brickner having been \u201cexcluded and dismissed by members and other supervisors, including middle and senior management.\u201d The Commission goes on to suggest this has negatively affected her prospects for career advancement.\n(iii) Respondent\u2019s Submissions\n[67] Similar to its submissions for the previous request, the Respondent argues that this documentation is not arguably relevant because there is no nexus to the issues in dispute. Specifically, the RCMP argues that the request essentially amounts to a new allegation of retaliation that was not outlined in the Complainant\u2019s SOP or in her Reply SOP. It would be against the principle of procedural fairness to require the RCMP to defend such factual allegations without having had the opportunity to first respond to them in its SOP. As such, there should be no order for compliance with this request.\n(iv) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[68] Again, I note that the Complainant\u2019s request appears more to be a request for information, rather than specific documentation which may or may not exist. The Tribunal cannot order disclosure of a document that does not exist.\n[69] Furthermore, as in the previous request, the Respondent\u2019s main objection is that this allegation, that neither the Complainant nor her husband have received any acting assignments since their transfer, is a new allegation that was not part of the Complainant\u2019s SOP. I must again agree with the RCMP\u2019s position on this point. The documents requested must have a nexus to the allegations contained in a party\u2019s SOP. In this case, Cpl. Brickner\u2019s SOP does not allege that she has been subjected to retaliation in the form of not having been given the opportunity to perform in acting roles.\n[70] As with the previous request, the Commission\u2019s argument that a key thrust of its SOP relates to the adverse differential treatment against Cpl. Brickner, is again too vague to now encompass a very specific factual allegation that should have been alleged in a party\u2019s SOP. This document request alludes to a very specific act of adverse differential treatment or retaliation and it would be prejudicial to the Respondent to allow what would amount to a new allegation of discrimination or retaliation without having provided the RCMP the chance to respond to such in its SOP.\n[71] It is always open to a party before the Tribunal to make an application to amend their SOP to add another allegation. However, all parties are reminded that any new interlocutory motion will take time and could potentially further delay the commencement of any scheduled hearing.\n19. In June or July 2012 Carla DECOCK applied for a dispatchers position in M Division, in the initial stages of the job process, the staffing officer Barb ARMSTRONG contacted S\/Sgt. Tony PARK and advised him that DECOCK had applied for a position\/transfer to Whitehorse and was common law with Cpl. Mark CASWELL. ARMSTRONG sent an email \u201cto see if there would be anything for him in Whitehorse if he is deemed releasable and outlined that he was currently in GIS. In light of this secondary process that was started after I had requested family accommodation, and the efforts that were made to identify and accommodate Cpl. Mark CASWELL just prior to the MCU job being advertised, I am requesting that all information pertaining to Carla DECOCK and the discussions surrounding her transfer to Whitehorse be disclosed.\n\u00b7 A copy of Barb ARMSTRONGS staffing file for M Division dispatchers that included Carla DECOCK (job posting in June\/July 2012). Including copies of the M Division and E Division file.\n\u00b7 I request a copy of all notes and emails by S\/Sgt. PARK, Barb ARMSTRONG and G Division Staffing relating to this staffing action.\n\u00b7 All documents pertaining to any discussion of a transfer to M Division involving Cpl. Mark CASWELL and\/or Carla DECOCK and the staffing offices of E Division, M Division and G Division.\n\u00b7 A copy of the email response from S\/Sgt. PARK to Barb ARMSTRONGS email on July 18, 2012, including any notes regarding any conversation between S\/Sgt. PARK and Barb ARMSTRONG. S\/Sgt. Park received an email from Barb ARMSTRONG asking if he could accommodate Cpl. Mark CASWELL. DECOCK received a notice of transfer (1272), without participating in a northern staffing interview weeks after this contact with S\/Sgt. PARK.\n\u00b7 Please provide all documents involving S\/Sgt. PARK and Cpl. CASWELL relating to Cpl. CASEWELLs interest and placement in M Division including any offer to him of the vacant General Duty position or suggestion that Cpl. CASWELL take an LWOP to accommodate his \u201ccommon law\u201d DECOCKs offer of a position (1272) in August 2012.\n\u00b7 A copy of all documents and emails relating to DECOCKS issuance of a 1272 without the required pre northern interview that is required before a 1272 is issued, she received her 1272 (offer of employment) before August 13, 2012.\n\u00b7 A copy of S\/Sgt. BELANDs notes relating to Cpl. CASWELLs transfer to M Division including conversations and emails between Barb ARMSTRONG, S\/Sgt. Tony PARK, Cpl. CASWELL and Carla DECOCK.\n(i) Complainant\u2019s Submissions\n[72] The Complainant argues that these documents are arguably relevant because they represent a similar lateral staffing transfer, around the same time in 2012 that involved a trailing spouse or common law partner. Cpl. Brickner alleges that Cpl. Caswell received differential treatment because of his gender and because he was one-half of an RCMP member couple that did not have children.\n(ii) Commission\u2019s Submissions\n[73] The Commission supports the request and suggests the documents contain information critical to the Tribunal\u2019s examination of the different treatment received by these two RCMP member couples.\n(iii) Respondent\u2019s Submissions\n[74] The Respondent states that the documents relating to Cpl. Caswell\u2019s staffing into the MCU position have already been disclosed. The RCMP also agrees to make reasonable efforts to locate and produce the notes of S\/Sgt. Beland relating to Cpl. Caswell\u2019s transfer.\n[75] However, the RCMP refuses the disclosure of the remaining documentation on the basis that the staffing action related to Carla Decock\u2019s transfer to M Division is not arguably relevant to the issues before the Tribunal. This request concerns a separate staffing action for a totally different position. Furthermore, the Respondent objects to the disclosure of documents containing private information of third parties not involved with this matter.\n(iv) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[76] The Tribunal acknowledges the Respondent\u2019s undertaking to use reasonable efforts to locate and produce the notes of S\/Sgt. Beland relating to Cpl. Caswell\u2019s transfer to M Division. If the notes cannot be located with reasonable efforts, the RCMP will advise the other parties and the Tribunal what steps were undertaken in committing their efforts. The Tribunal orders the production of these documents and imposes a deadline of September 15, 2017, to comply. However, if the Respondent is able to comply earlier, the earlier production should be made to assist with this matter moving forward to hearing in a timely manner. If the documentation cannot be located with reasonable efforts, the RCMP will advise the other parties and the Tribunal what steps were undertaken in committing their efforts on or before September 15, 2017.\n[77] Regarding the documentation related to the MCU Corporal staffing action in 2012, the RCMP indicates it believes it has already disclosed all such relevant documents in its possession. As such, the Tribunal does not need to make an order regarding that documentation. However, the Tribunal directs the Respondent to provide Cpl. Brickner with a list of all documents that it has already provided which it believes meets this part of this request on or before September 15, 2017. If any new documents relevant to this request are identified, the Respondent must disclose them in accordance with Rule 6(5)(b) subject to the exception of any document that may be protected by a recognized privilege under the law of evidence. If there are any documents for which privilege is claimed, the Respondent will indicate to the other parties such documents and the privilege claimed.\n[78] Regarding the remainder of the documents requested, the Tribunal finds some of them to be arguably relevant insofar as the documentation related to Ms. Decock\u2019s placement are connected to the placement of her common-law partner, Cpl. Caswell. Accordingly, the Tribunal orders the RCMP to release any of the above documentation related to Ms. Decock\u2019s staffing that includes a reference to Cpl. Caswell, subject to redactions made to Ms. Decock\u2019s personal information on or before September 15, 2017. Other documentation relating to her staffing at M Division that does not mention Cpl. Caswell is not arguably relevant.\n20. Full Disclosure regarding any discrimination, harassment or workplace conflict complaints made against S\/Sgt. Jason FLYNN, Sgt. Mark LONDON, S\/Sgt. Doug HARRIS, C\/Supt. Paul McCONNELL, and Assistant Commissioner Peter CLARK including how they were addressed, the outcome of those complaints, and any subsequent redress.\n(i) Complainant\u2019s Submissions\n[79] The Complainant submits that these documents are arguably relevant because the RCMP failed to act, investigate or acknowledge the reported acts of retaliation after she filed her human rights complaint. She alleges that senior management did not follow policy and refused to conduct an investigation.\n(ii) Commission\u2019s Submissions\n[80] The Commission references the RCMP\u2019s failure to eliminate harassment and to respect the Gender and Respect Action Plan as concluded in the Report into Workplace Harassment in the RCMP and suggests the requested documents would assist the Tribunal in assessing the Respondent\u2019s defence that it was competent in relation to staffing and human rights matters.\n(iii) Respondent\u2019s Submissions\n[81] The Respondent argues that the request is largely not arguably relevant to the facts in issue, is inappropriate, unlikely to contribute to advancing the debate and would raise privacy concerns (for both the officers named and the persons who may have lodged complaints). The Respondent also submits that the request is too broad and would be an onerous task to produce.\n[82] Furthermore, the Respondent argues that if the competence of M Division is in dispute, as the Commission suggests, then complaints arising from the whole division ought to be at issue, not those of specific individual officers.\n[83] In addition, the RCMP submits that it would be onerous to gather data about harassment complaints and grievances prior to November 2014 at which time they became recorded at the RCMP\u2019s central Office of Coordination of Grievances and Appeals. The RCMP also argues that grievances generally relate to matters other than grounds of discrimination under the Act.\n[84] Finally, in response to this request, the RCMP agrees to provide a list \u201csetting out the total number of (i) harassment complaints in \u201cM\u201d Division from November 2014 to present, and (ii) human rights complaints relating to family status or gender in M Division between the periods 2009 to present, and the outcome of such complaints.\u201d\n(iv) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[85] It is the Tribunal\u2019s view that the Complainant\u2019s request for \u201cFull Disclosure\u201d is not very helpful when disclosure is aimed at locating and producing specific documents. It is generally helpful if parties can specifically identify the type of documents they are requesting. Furthermore, a specific time frame would assist the Tribunal in the determination of whether the requested documentation meets the test of arguable relevance.\n[86] A request for disclosure must be connected to the issues in dispute. In this case, the request ought to be limited to similar complaints, namely, discrimination on the grounds of family status or gender (see Yaffa at para. 60).\n[87] The Tribunal notes that none of the officers named in this request were named personally in this complaint. The Complainant also failed to make a rational connection between an allegation in an SOP and these individuals in her motion materials. Moreover, I am concerned that singling out only these five individuals without having provided any reasons for same to the Tribunal in the SOP or motion materials, runs the risk of implying or inferring wrongdoing on their part. I therefore agree with the Respondent that an examination of all complaints relating to family status and gender at M Division would be more appropriate. I would also note that with the exception of Assistant Commissioner Clark, all of the above-named individuals are scheduled to be called as witnesses at the hearing. As such, Cpl. Brickner will have the opportunity during cross-examination to pose questions concerning their previous involvement with human rights complaints that relate to family status and gender.\n[88] In addition, given that the Complainant has asked for \u201cFull Disclosure\u201d, the Tribunal infers she would like to have full particulars of each Complaint. However, the Tribunal is concerned that the particulars of each complaint may not be arguably relevant. Indeed, the Complainant has not explained why the particulars would be relevant to her case. Moreover, persons who come forward to make complaints of harassment or discrimination ought not be dissuaded from doing so for fear of their story becoming public in the future in some unrelated proceeding before this Tribunal. Disclosure of such sensitive material should be ordered in only exceptional circumstances where the need and arguable relevancy is clearly demonstrated. The RCMP has made the further point that the Whitehorse detachment is a small office and such matters are particularly sensitive. Therefore, it is the Tribunal\u2019s view that even where the Tribunal imposes a confidentiality order over the inquiry, the disclosure could still be unsettling for co-workers who have lodged complaints in the past.\n[89] Also, I accept the RCMP\u2019s submission that the grievance process is generally not related to complaints of discrimination under the Act. Therefore, I have not been persuaded that disclosure of all grievances filed against these individuals is arguably relevant.\n[90] For the foregoing reasons, this request for disclosure is denied. However, in response to the RCMP\u2019s offer, the Tribunal directs the Respondent to produce a list of the total number of (i) harassment complaints in M Division from November 2014 to present, and (ii) human rights complaints relating to family status or gender in M Division from 2009 to present, and the outcome of those complaints. Although not necessary at this stage in the proceeding, the Respondent may anonymize the list to protect the identity of third parties.\n21. Full disclosure regarding any grievances or complaints under the command of Insp. Phil GOULET, the Officer in Charge of the Staffing and Promotion unit where applicants were removed from the validation pool when there was a supported objection of a validation committee member, including how they were addressed, the outcome of those complaints.\n(i) Complainant\u2019s Submissions\n[91] Cpl. Brickner submits that these documents would be arguably relevant to her claim of retaliation. Specifically, she believes this disclosure will demonstrate that she was treated differently than others because of a deviation from standard policy.\n[92] Noting the objections of the Respondent in her Reply submissions, Cpl. Brickner amended this request to ask for three examples of other promotional processes that are comparable, where the applicant\u2019s objection was supported and instead of following policy and removing the member of the validation committee, the applicant was removed from the pool of candidates.\n(ii) Commission\u2019s Submissions\n[93] The Commission supports this request as it may demonstrate retaliation and differential treatment. The Commission acknowledges there would be privacy concerns.\n(iii) Respondent\u2019s Submissions\n[94] The Respondent objects to the request on the basis that it is too broad and too onerous. As indicated in response to request #7 above, the RCMP undertakes to continue to make reasonable efforts to provide all relevant documents in relation to the Crops Reviewer promotional process. However, the RCMP submits that the process to comply with this request would be very onerous and time-consuming as it would have to manually review thousands of staffing actions in order to identify the information being sought.\n(iv) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[95] It is the Tribunal\u2019s view that the initial request is too broad and would be too time-consuming for the amount of probative value suggested by Cpl. Brickner. The revised request, in Cpl. Brickner\u2019s Reply submissions, is not probative without sufficient context, and indeed is not the type of disclosure intended by the Tribunal\u2019s process. Cpl. Brickner seeks to bring evidence before the Tribunal that she was treated differently. In the absence of any specific documents which would portray her specific adverse differential treatment, she seeks to give the Tribunal three random examples which she believes will support her allegations. The evidence Cpl. Brickner seeks to put before the Tribunal is best brought out in the context of the cross-examination of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses. The Respondent has included Insp. Phil Goulet in the list of witnesses it intends to call at the hearing. Accordingly, this request is denied.\n22. Copies of Curriculum Vitae (CV\u2019s) for the following witnesses and \/or people referenced as Subject Matter Experts.\n\u00b7 S\/Sgt. Tony PARK\n\u00b7 S\/Sgt. Chuck LAN\n\u00b7 S\/Sgt. Doug COOPER\n\u00b7 Insp. Keith BRAMHILL\n\u00b7 Insp. Phil GOULET\n\u00b7 S\/Sgt. Jason FLYNN\n\u00b7 Insp. Stacey TABLOT\n\u00b7 Cyndi DESHARNAIS\n\u00b7 S\/Sgt. Diane DOYLE\n(i) Complainant\u2019s Submissions\n[96] The Complainant does not give reasons for this request in her motion. In her Reply submissions she states she would like the CV\u2019s to determine the knowledge, skills and abilities of those involved directly in this case. The Reply submissions contain a number of statements which are not argument, but unsupported assertions of evidence.\n(ii) Commission\u2019s Submissions\n[97] The Commission refers to the Report into Workplace Harassment in the RCMP and its conclusion that persons appointed to senior administrative positions often lack specialized expertise. It suggests these CVs are arguably relevant because they would show that persons involved in processing her requests for accommodation did not understand the RCMP\u2019s obligations under the Act.\n(iii) Respondent\u2019s Submissions\n[98] The Respondent argues that the CVs are not arguably relevant to the issues in this matter. None of the people listed in this request are appearing before the Tribunal in the capacity as an expert witness, where the request for a CV would be warranted. In fact, two of the people listed, S\/Sgt. Doyle and Insp. Talbot, have not been identified as witnesses by any of the parties.\n(iv) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[99] It is the Tribunal\u2019s view that the information Cpl. Brickner seeks to elicit from the CVs, namely whether or not each person was trained about their obligations under the Act, may not be contained in such documents. The better method for putting such evidence before the Tribunal is for Cpl. Brickner to elicit her evidence through cross-examination. Accordingly, this request is denied.\n23. Copies of all notes for the following individuals relating to me, my husband (as I am referred to his spouse in documents) and my complaint(s) (grievance\/Canadian Human Rights Complaint) which has been summed up and simplified within the RCMP as lateral transfer including my complaint of Harassment (Act of Retaliation).\n\u00b7 Maureen LEVY\n\u00b7 Stacey TALBOT\n\u00b7 Jerry SCOTT\n\u00b7 Ken TURNER\n\u00b7 Dan DUBEAU\n\u00b7 Cindy RATTRAY\n\u00b7 Elizabeth MACDONALD\n\u00b7 Garry JAY\n\u00b7 John BREWER\n\u00b7 Brian JONES\n\u00b7 Allan LUCIER\n\u00b7 Karen BYRNE\n\u00b7 Patrice DESJARDINS\n\u00b7 Phil GOULET\n\u00b7 Jasmin BRETON\n\u00b7 Peter CLARK\n\u00b7 Sharon WOODBURN\n\u00b7 Doug HARRIS\n\u00b7 Mark LONDON\n\u00b7 Jason FLYNN\n\u00b7 Archie THOMPSON\n\u00b7 Ken FOSTER\n\u00b7 Dan AUSTIN\n\u00b7 Tony PARK\n\u00b7 Gerry ELL\n\u00b7 Neil CROSS\n\u00b7 Scott SHEPPARD\n\u00b7 Pat Mulhall\n(i) Complainant\u2019s Submissions\n[100] Cpl. Brickner submits that these senior members of the RCMP were involved in the processes that impacted her family situation, including the initial request for accommodation, gender bias, unfair treatment, family separations, harassment and ongoing acts of retaliation. She submits that the notes will demonstrate the RCMP\u2019s processes and what the role of the RCMP management is relating to issues like harassment, human rights complaints, and acts of discrimination and retaliation.\n[101] In her Reply submissions, Cpl. Brickner elaborates more on the roles of Chief Superintendent Sheppard, Superintendent Jones and Inspector Austin and the potential relevance of their notes. She states that Chief Superintendent Sheppard had email communications and telephone calls with Chief Superintendent Peter Clark relating to her situation and transfer to the Yukon. Superintendent Jones arrived in M Division in January of 2016. Cpl. Brickner states that he was involved in a grievance process which she filed in May 2016 and which remains in abeyance pending the outcome of this hearing. Inspector Dan Austin arrived in M Division in September of 2015 and Cpl. Brickner alleges he did not say hi or acknowledge her during the first 6 weeks after she was relocated next to his office.\n(ii) Commission\u2019s Submissions\n[102] The Commission submits that the production of these notes is critical to the proper examination of the issues raised in this complaint. The notes are critical to the thorough examination of the communications, mindset, and thought process of the RCMP members involved in the events giving rise to Cpl. Brickner\u2019s complaint.\n(iii) Respondent\u2019s Submissions\n[103] The Respondent states that it has already disclosed all relevant notes in its possession of the following people: Phil Goulet; Doug Harris; Mark London, Tony Park; and Elizabeth Macdonald.\n[104] The Respondent agrees to make reasonable efforts to locate and produce such notes from the following individuals: Stacey Talbot; Dan Dubeau; Cindy Ratrray; Peter Clark; Sharon Woodburn; and Archie Thompson.\n[105] The RCMP provides details about Messrs. Sheppard, Jones and Austin, submitting that they were not in relevant positions at the times of the alleged discrimination and retaliation.\n[106] The Respondent refuses to produce the notes for the remaining individuals as they are not relevant to the specific allegations made in Cpl. Brickner\u2019s SOP or in her Reply to the Respondent\u2019s SOP.\n(iv) Tribunal\u2019s Ruling\n[107] The Tribunal does not need to order disclosure on the request for the notes of Phil Goulet; Doug Harris; Mark London, Tony Park; and Elizabeth Macdonald as the RCMP indicates its belief that it has already disclosed all such relevant documents in its possession. However, the Tribunal directs the Respondent to provide Cpl. Brickner with a list of all documents that it has already provided which it believes meets this request on or before September 15, 2017. If any new documents relevant to this request are identified, the Respondent must disclose them in accordance with Rule 6(5)(b) subject to the exception of any document that may be protected by a recognized privilege under the law of evidence. If there are any documents for which privilege is claimed, the Respondent will indicate to the other parties such documents and the privilege claimed.\n[108] The RCMP has agreed to disclose and produce the notes from Stacey Talbot, Dan Dubeau, Cindy Ratrray, Peter Clark, Sharon Woodburn, and Archie Thompson. The Tribunal orders production of these individuals\u2019 notes, if any, relating to Cpl. Brickner and \/ or Cpl. Marinis, but only in relation to the human rights complaint that is the subject of this proceeding. The Tribunal imposes a deadline of September 15, 2017, to comply with this order. For greater certainty, the disclosure order includes notes related to the MCU staffing position(s) and the crops reviewer position, given that the main thrust of the Complainant\u2019s allegations of discrimination and retaliation appear to be grounded in these staffing actions. However, if the Respondent is able to comply earlier, the earlier production should be made to assist with this matter moving forward to hearing in a timely manner. If there are any documents for which privilege is claimed, the Respondent will indicate to the other parties such documents and the privilege claimed.\n[109] Having given consideration to the Reply submissions of Cpl. Brickner, the Tribunal finds the personal notes of Chief Superintendent Sheppard to be arguably relevant. Although he was not appointed as the Commanding Officer for the Yukon until November 2016, he apparently had some earlier involvement with Cpl. Brickner\u2019s transfer to the Yukon. The Tribunal therefore orders the production of Chief Superintendent Sheppard\u2019s notes, if any, relating to Cpl. Brickner and \/ or Cpl. Marinis in relation to the grievance and\/or human rights complaint that is the subject of this proceeding, and imposes a deadline of September 15, 2017 to comply with this order. For greater certainty, the disclosure order includes notes related to the MCU staffing position(s) and the crops reviewer position, given that the main thrust of the Complainant\u2019s allegations of discrimination and retaliation appear to be grounded in these staffing actions. However, if the Respondent is able to comply earlier, the earlier production should be made to assist with this matter moving forward to hearing in a timely manner. If there are any documents for which privilege is claimed, the Respondent will indicate to the other parties such documents and the privilege claimed.\n[110] Regarding the Complainant\u2019s request for the notes of Superintendent Jones, the Tribunal notes that the harassment grievance filed against Superintendent Jones and outlined by Cpl. Brickner in her Reply submissions is not a matter before this Tribunal. As that matter is outside the scope of this inquiry, no order is made for his notes relating to that grievance. However, the Tribunal orders the production of Superintendent Jones\u2019 notes, if any, relating to Cpl. Brickner and \/ or Cpl. Marinis in relation to the human rights complaint that is the subject of this proceeding, and imposes a deadline of September 15, 2017, to comply with this order. For greater certainty, the disclosure order includes notes related to the MCU staffing position(s) and the crops reviewer position, given that the main thrust of the Complainant\u2019s allegations of discrimination and retaliation appear to be grounded in these staffing actions. However, if the Respondent is able to comply earlier, the earlier production should be made to assist with this matter moving forward to hearing in a timely manner. If there are any documents for which privilege is claimed, the Respondent will indicate to the other parties such documents and the privilege claimed.\n[111] The Complainant has not convinced me that the notes of Inspector Austin are arguably relevant. Her allegation that he did not say hi or introduce himself when she moved into the next office has no nexus with the allegations of discrimination outlined in Cpl. Brickner\u2019s SOP. Moreover, I do not find the alleged behaviour to support the Commission\u2019s allegation that Cpl. Brickner was excluded and dismissed in a way that negatively affected her prospects for future career advancement. Although Cpl. Brickner states Inspector Austin was at one time her acting supervisor, she is not specific about the dates and has not established that the alleged behaviour occurred during this period.\n[112] Regarding the personal notes of Jason Flynn and Neil Cross, they are mentioned in the Complainant\u2019s SOP and Reply SOP respectively by name, and as such, I will accept the argument that their notes may be arguably relevant. The Tribunal orders the production of Messrs. Flynn\u2019s and Cross\u2019 notes, if any, relating to Cpl. Brickner and \/ or Cpl. Marinis in relation to her human rights complaint, and imposes a deadline of September 15, 2017, to comply with this order. For greater certainty, the disclosure order includes notes related to the MCU staffing position(s) and the crops reviewer position, given that the main thrust of the Complainant\u2019s allegations of discrimination and retaliation appear to be grounded in these staffing actions. However, if the Respondent is able to comply earlier, the earlier production should be made to assist with this matter moving forward to hearing in a timely manner. If there are any documents for which privilege is claimed, the Respondent will indicate to the other parties such documents and the privilege claimed.\n[113] The names of Maureen Levy, Jerry Scott, Ken Turner, Garry Jay, John Brewer, Allan Lucier, Karen Byrne, Patrice Desjardins, Jasmin Breton, Ken Foster, Gerry Ell, and Pat Mulhall do not appear anywhere in the parties\u2019 SOPs. While some of these names only appear in the disclosure document list of the Respondent, the Tribunal is unaware of what role these individuals may have played in the Complainant\u2019s allegations as she has not established a connection between these individuals and any facts, issues or forms of relief identified by the parties in this dispute. As a result, the Complainant has failed to convince the Tribunal of the arguable relevance of such notes, if they exist. The request for the notes of these individuals is therefore denied.\nSigned by\nDavid L.

Complaint and motion 1\nII. Issues 1\nIII. Analysis 2\nA. Does the Tribunal have the power and the jurisdiction to order the Complainant to submit to an independent medical examination? 2\nB. The Complainant\u2019s rights 4\nIV. Conclusion 6\nI. Complaint and motion\n[1] This is a preliminary motion by the Respondent asking the Tribunal to order the Complainant to submit to a medical examination by an expert retained by the Respondent.\n[2] In this ruling, I will not repeat all the facts alleged in the complaint; In essence, the Complainant alleges that he was treated differently and that he had unfairly accumulated penalty points in his disciplinary file, all of which led to his dismissal on October 5, 2012. The ground of discrimination alleged in his file and accepted by the Tribunal is disability.\n[3] The Tribunal has already issued rulings in this file, specifically, on March 30, 2017, on a motion to strike filed by the Respondent; and on May 11, 2017, on a motion to amend filed by the Complainant. The Tribunal also issued clear directions to the parties on June 16, 2017, regarding the motions for disclosure filed by the Complainant and by the Respondent.\n[4] The Tribunal is now considering the Respondent\u2019s motion for a medical assessment and has received the written submissions of the Complainant and the Commission in response to this motion. The Respondent did not file a reply.\nII. Issues\n[5] The Tribunal has identified the following issues arising from the filing of the Respondent\u2019s motion for a medical assessment and the written submissions of the parties:\na) the jurisdiction and powers of the Tribunal and the issue of procedural fairness raised by the Respondent; and\nb) the Complainant\u2019s rights.\nIII. Analysis\nA. Does the Tribunal have the power and the jurisdiction to order the Complainant to submit to an independent medical examination?\n[6] First, it is important to note that the Respondent\u2019s motion is poorly supported. Despite the clear responses submitted by the Complainant and the Commission, who object to this motion, the Respondent did not file a reply with the Tribunal that would allow me to better understand why the Respondent requires such a medical assessment. In fact, the Respondent has not given any legal reason or raised any legal arguments in its motion other than procedural fairness, an issue on which I will rule further on. Its motion is drafted in very general terms.\n[7] In its response, the Commission objects to the Respondent\u2019s motion, raising the issue of the Tribunal\u2019s powers. In short, the Commission argues that there is no procedural rule that would allow the Tribunal to make such an order.\n[8] In my view, there is no provisions in the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) or the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure expressly providing for such an order. Given that administrative tribunals are masters of their own procedures, it is less often a matter of determining what Parliament has permitted, but rather of how to interpret the powers that have been granted to them. Moreover, administrative tribunals are often called upon to interpret what Parliament has left unsaid, in light of the legislative regime in force. Therefore, the question is whether the Tribunal has an ancillary or implicit power to do so.\n[9] Without elaborating on its argument, the Respondent refers in its notice of motion to the principle of procedural fairness and its right to a full and fair hearing to justify its motion for a medical assessment.\n[10] On this point, I refer to Day v. Canada (Department of National Defence), 2002 CanLII 45923 (CHRT) (\u201cDay\u201d) at paras. 22-24:\n[22] . . . So where does the Tribunal obtain the interim authority to deal with such matters? I think the answer can be found in the ancillary or incidental jurisdiction of the Tribunal, without which an informal body cannot carry out its proper functions.\n[23] All a term like ancillary jurisdiction means in this context is that a body with a more informal mandate has the authority to do what is necessary to ensure a fair hearing, in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Unlike the courts, which take their powers from their own inherent authority, this authority inheres in the process contemplated by the Act rather than the character of the Tribunal. The basic statutory role of the Tribunal is set out in the provisions of section 50(1), which requires the Tribunal to give the parties a full and ample opportunity to present their cases. This sets out the natural scope of the Tribunal's authority. It is the fairness of the process before the Tribunal that must be consulted, in determining whether the Tribunal has the authority to issue an order that extends, strictly speaking, beyond the process. This is a pragmatic standard that cannot be reduced to rigid rules.\n[24] None of this should be taken too far. There are many limits on the ancillary authority of the Tribunal, which does not give the Tribunal the more general powers enjoyed by the courts. It is clear, however, that Parliament cannot have intended that the Tribunal be without the essential authority that it needs to fulfil its responsibilities and uphold the Act. This is in keeping with the quasi-constitutional nature of the Act, which calls for a large and liberal interpretation. The question before me, as I see it, is whether these powers extend as far as the requested order. In order to answer that question, I think it is necessary to examine the nature of the interests that would be imperilled by such an order.\n[11] I agree with the statements of my colleague Member Groarke in that decision. I find that the Tribunal, through its ancillary or implicit powers, could make such orders where appropriate, in very specific circumstances. However, as in Day, I am troubled by the fact that the Tribunal could have such powers to invade someone\u2019s privacy, and I believe that the Tribunal must proceed with extreme caution in these cases.\n[12] I will say no more on the issue of jurisdiction, as in any event, I am not prepared to give the Respondent carte blanche and grant its motion. Here is why.\nB. The Complainant\u2019s rights\n[13] Since personal dignity is the very foundation of human rights protection, the Tribunal should \u201cexercise some prudence before compelling an unwilling complainant to submit to an examination by those in the service of the respondent\u201d (Rogers v. Deckx Ltd., 2002 CanLII 61838 (CHRT), at para. 9).\n[14] The CHRA is based on the dignity and value of the person. Human rights tribunals should therefore respect the autonomy of the individual and protect the dignity of the person, as these are fundamental values. This implies maintaining a certain measure of privacy. A tribunal faced with a motion from one of the parties should therefore consider whether the requested order, such as an order for a medical assessment, would have an impact on these values, and whether this impact is warranted.\n[15] Each case is therefore unique and must be assessed on its own merits.\n[16] The act of compelling an individual to undergo a medical examination is inherently coercive. I must therefore be very careful before granting such a request, which affects an essential aspect of the person. The physical and psychological integrity of the individual lie at the very heart of human rights and could implicate section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees security of the person (Day, supra, para. 28; Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 2000 SCC 44, paras. 55-57).\n[17] The basis for a human rights complaint is discrimination; medical issues are subordinate to the main issue considered in the complaint. In the present case, the main issue refers to alleged facts in the file that date to 2012 at the latest.\n[18] More specifically, in the case now before the Tribunal, the Complainant submits that he was treated differently and that he had unfairly accumulated penalty points in his disciplinary file, all of which led to his dismissal on October 5, 2012. The ground of discrimination alleged is disability.\n[19] The Complainant understands that his psychological history will be considered at the hearing in relation to the alleged facts and the time the events unfolded. What troubles him is that, through this motion for a medical assessment, the Respondent is attempting to obtain information about his current medical condition, which has nothing to do with the complaint . I share his concerns.\n[20] It is now 2017, more than five years after the alleged facts. The Tribunal does not believe that a medical assessment at this stage of the process would enlighten the Tribunal on the allegations in dispute, which date back to 2012 or before. The medical assessment requested by the Respondent is therefore irrelevant.\n[21] The fact that the Complainant won\u2019t submit himself to an independent medical assessment as the Respondent wishes will in no way prevent the Respondent from presenting its rebuttal evidence at the hearing. Accordingly, the Respondent, through its counsel, will have an opportunity to, among other things; freely cross-examine the Complainant or his expert witnesses regarding the Complainant\u2019s disability at the time of the alleged facts.\n[22] Finally, the most important factor is that I agree with the Commission\u2019s submissions in its response to the Respondent\u2019s motion, to the effect that the burden of proof lies on the Complainant to show a prima facie case of discrimination. To do so, the Complainant must meet three criteria, namely, he will have to show that, at the relevant time, he had a characteristic protected from discrimination by the CHRA, that he experienced an adverse impact, and that the protected characteristic was a factor in the adverse impact. (Stewart v. Elk Valley Coal Corp., 2017 SCC 30, para. 24; Quebec (C.D.P.D.J.) v. Bombardier Inc., 2015 SCC 39, paras. 63-65).\nIV. Conclusion\n[23] For all these reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent\u2019s motion for a medical assessment.\nSigned by\nAnie Perrault\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nAugust 18, 2017\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT2162\/3616\nStyle of Cause:\nSerge Lafreni\u00e8re v.

Background\n[1] On February 4, 2015, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) received a complaint from Sandra Temple (the \u201cComplainant\u201d) against Horizon International Distributors (the \u201cCompany\u201d, the \u201cRespondent\u201d or \u201cHorizon\u201d) alleging that she was discriminated against on the basis of her sex and her disability. Relying on these two grounds, she alleges that she suffered adverse differential treatment in the course of employment and that the Company refused to continue to employ her, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the \u201cCHRA\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d).\n[2] On February 26, 2016, the Commission referred the complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) to institute an inquiry under section 44(3)(a) of the CHRA.\n[3] On December 22, 2016, the Vice-Chairperson of the Tribunal, Susheel Gupta, ruled on a motion regarding the location of the hearing. It was decided that the hearing would take place in two different places, namely, Calgary (from May 23 to 25, 2017), for the witnesses called by the Complainant, and Winnipeg (from June 6 to 9, 2017) for the witnesses called by the Respondent. The Complainant was present during the first three days of the hearing in Calgary and accompanied by her son, Jonathan Temple. Also present were counsel for the Respondent, Terra Welsh, and a representative of the Company, Luc Dub\u00e9. Two other Company representatives, Gilbert Dub\u00e9 and his spouse, participated in the hearing via videoconference from Winnipeg. During the subsequent four days of hearings in Winnipeg, all the Respondent representatives attended, assisted by their counsel. Ms. Temple participated in the hearing via videoconference, from Calgary, again accompanied by her son.\n[4] Considering the constant use of videoconferencing during this seven-day hearing, including for some of the testimony, the Tribunal was very proactive in guiding the parties throughout the hearing, specifically in managing documents and testimony. The Tribunal also ensured that the parties were able to follow and understand the hearing even if they were not physically present. The Tribunal asked the parties, repeatedly, to inform it of any technological difficulties. The parties did not hesitate to do so when there were any, and measures were taken to rectify the situation.\n[5] In Calgary, Ms. Temple testified first. She then called three witnesses: Paul Murray, a truck driver and friend; Yves Carriere, a Company truck driver and former colleague; and Jonathan Temple, her son. In Winnipeg, the Respondent called six witnesses: Gilbert Dub\u00e9, President of the Company; Luc Dub\u00e9, General Manager of the Company; Sheldon Savage, Equipment Manager; Terry Matthews and Verne Wyatt, dispatchers; and David Yach, a former truck driver for the Company.\n[6] Having heard the various testimonies, and apart from some exceptions that I will deal with later in this decision, I find nothing to suggest that the witnesses were not forthright or credible in their testimony. Moreover, the Tribunal recognizes Ms. Temple\u2019s perseverance and her respect for the quasi-judicial process. The Tribunal also recognizes Ms. Welsh\u2019s great work. The parties worked well together and a sense of collegiality pervaded the hearing.\n[7] Having said that, I must render a decision that is based on the evidence before me. For the following reasons, I find that Ms. Temple\u2019s complaint is not substantiated. Ms. Temple has not met the burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination or, more specifically, that the characteristics protected by the CHRA were a factor in the adverse impact.\nII. Relevant provisions of the Act\n[8] The following provisions from the Act are relevant in this case: 2 and 3(1), 7(a) and (b), 15(1)(a), 15(2), 53(1), 53(2), 53(3) and 53(4).\n[9] These provisions provide as follows:\n2 The purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, family status, genetic characteristics, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.\n3 (1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, family status, genetic characteristics, disability and conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.\n7 It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n15 (1) It is not a discriminatory practice if\n(a) any refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement;\n. . .\n15 (2) For any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) to be considered to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement and for any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(g) to be considered to have a bona fide justification, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost.\n53 (1) At the conclusion of an inquiry, the member or panel conducting the inquiry shall dismiss the complaint if the member or panel finds that the complaint is not substantiated.\n53(2) If at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may, subject to section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice and include in the order any of the following terms that the member or panel considers appropriate:\n(a) that the person cease the discriminatory practice and take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in future, including\n(i) the adoption of a special program, plan or arrangement referred to in subsection 16(1), or\n(ii) making an application for approval and implementing a plan under section 17;\n(b) that the person make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that are being or were denied the victim as a result of the practice;\n(c) that the person compensate the victim for any or all of the wages that the victim was deprived of and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice;\n(d) that the person compensate the victim for any or all additional costs of obtaining alternative goods, services, facilities or accommodation and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice; and\n(e) that the person compensate the victim, by an amount not exceeding twenty thousand dollars, for any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n53 (3) In addition to any order under subsection (2), the member or panel may order the person to pay such compensation not exceeding twenty thousand dollars to the victim as the member or panel may determine if the member or panel finds that the person is engaging or has engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly.\n53 (4) Subject to the rules made under section 48.9, an order to pay compensation under this section may include an award of interest at a rate and for a period that the member or panel considers appropriate.\nIII. Factual context\n[10] For the sake of brevity and a clear understanding of the case, the Tribunal will summarize the general aspects of the case on the basis of the documents submitted by the parties and the various testimonies given at the hearing. The Tribunal deems it necessary to establish these facts in order to capture the essence of the case and the trucking industry.\nA. Horizon International Distributors and the trucking sector\n[11] Horizon is a Manitoban trucking company that was founded in 1988 by Gilbert Dub\u00e9 and whose headquarters are located in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Company\u2019s activities stretch across all of Canada and focus specifically on the transportation of perishable and refrigerated foods. At the time of the hearing, the Company\u2019s operations were administered by just over ten employees. The Company has a fleet of about 32 trucks and a warehouse in the Montr\u00e9al area (Quebec). Horizon employs two types of truck operators to deliver its freight: (1) truck operators who drive the trucks that belong to the Company and who are employees (\u201coperator-employees\u201d); and (2) truck operators who own their own heavy goods vehicle and who are employed on a contractual basis (\u201cowner-operators\u201d). Importantly, on the date of the complaint, Ms. Temple was the only female owner-operator at Horizon.\n[12] Owner-operators are paid for their mileage: the more kilometres they drive, the more they are paid. In addition, they earn a fixed minimum amount for each delivery they make. The trucks owned by the Company are managed and maintained by the Company, while owner-operators are responsible for their own heavy goods vehicles and related expenses. Horizon is the type of trucking company that does not provide a specific schedule for collecting freight. It also does not guarantee particular areas or routes to truck operators. However, truck drivers indicate their availability and preferred areas or routes to the Company, which dispatches deliveries to the operators available. Horizon attempts to accommodate truckers according to their preferences where possible. It should be noted that the truck operators\u2019 loads do not necessarily all go to the same client. Operators\u2019 trailers may therefore contain several loads that have to be delivered to different clients.\n[13] Horizon allows owner-operators to have their expenses, including repairs, gas, insurance and permits, billed to its account. Sometimes, it also advances money to owner-operators in the middle of the month to help them pay for their everyday expenses. Finally, the Company issues a statement at the end of the month listing the earnings and expenses of owner-operators. Their earnings can be summarized in the following manner: the amount allocated for their mileage and their deliveries, less gas, advances, repairs and maintenance, insurance, permits and other expenses.\n[14] Without going into every detail of how the Company operates, when goods have to be delivered to a client, a dispatcher organizes the logistics of the delivery. Without limiting his or her tasks, we understand that the dispatcher assigns loads to truck operators, organizes delivery times with clients, works closely with truck operators, anticipates alternatives in the event of a problem and contacts clients, among other things. The dispatcher is the link between the Company, clients and truck operators. At Horizon, dispatchers divide duties across two sections: Eastern and Western Canada. Each section has a dispatcher.\n[15] Truck operators have to deliver the goods as planned. They must obviously follow delivery schedules. Some clients are less flexible about delivery times, and sometimes deliveries have to be changed or rescheduled. This is not rare. Truck operators also have to respect strict transportation regulations and are subject to particular requirements when it comes to their working hours. Once again, without going into every detail of the regulations on heavy goods transportation, the Tribunal notes that truck operators have to work one of two cycles: a 7-day cycle or a 14-day cycle. For each cycle, specific restrictions apply. For example, during the 7-day cycle, a truck operator may not drive more than 70 hours. After the 70-hour period, a 36-hour break is mandatory. The Tribunal also understands that, over a 24-hour period, truck operators may not drive more than 13 hours a day. They are entitled to a two-hour break and an hour long maintenance break, especially to inspect the truck and refuel but not to drive. Lastly, they have to rest for eight consecutive hours. The Tribunal understands that truck operators may switch from one cycle to another while, once again, respecting certain rules. The Tribunal certainly does not claim to reproduce all the regulatory requirements applying to heavy goods transportation.\n[16] Truck operators are also obliged to keep what is commonly known as a log book. This log book allows truck operators to maintain a record of their activities for each 24-hour period. The 24-hour period is divided into 15-minute intervals. Operators must keep a record of their movements and driving time, the length of their mealtimes and breaks and any time not working. When Ms. Temple worked for Horizon, her log book was kept by hand and not electronically.\nB. Sandra Temple\n[17] Sandra Temple has been a truck operator for about twenty years. She was living in the town of Salmon Arm, British Columbia, but now resides in the Calgary area, Alberta. Her son, Jonathan Temple, and her mother, whom she takes care of, also live in Calgary. Ms. Temple started working for the Company in winter 2011. She was replacing a sick driver, Peter Cox, and was driving his truck. What should have been a short-term replacement was extended until summer 2012. After this time, the Company and Ms. Temple reached an agreement for Ms. Temple to become an owner-operator for the Company. She therefore joined the team officially with her own truck in August 2012. Horizon terminated her employment contract on December 18, 2014. Ms. Temple preferred making deliveries in western Canada. She therefore made deliveries between Manitoba (point of departure and destination) and British Columbia.\nC. The October 14, 2014 accident and subsequent events\n[18] On October 14, 2014, another truck collided with Ms. Temple\u2019s truck while she was filling up in Kelowna, British Columbia. Ms. Temple injured her hand, more specifically, her thumb. However, there was no need to contact the first responders or the police, and the accident was caught by the gas stations\u2019 cameras. The truck and its trailer were substantially damaged, but the load was not affected. Ms. Temple made her deliveries as planned.\n[19] Without going into detail, and since the events will be explained later on, this type of incident involving a truck driver gives rise to two types of possible claims that can be made in parallel: (1) a claim to WorkSafeBC (\u201cWCB\u201d) for loss of wages; and (2) a claim to Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) for damage to the vehicle. In Ms. Temple\u2019s case, both claims were made because the truck was damaged and because she had to stop working for some time. The Tribunal understands that Ms. Temple\u2019s claim to WBC was completed only in December 2014. This issue will be addressed later. As a result, Ms. Temple did not receive payments from WBC until March 2015, retroactive to the date of the accident and to when she stopped working. A claim to the MPI was also made, and the deductible was not reimbursed until July 2016.\n[20] The Complainant did not work between October 14, 2014, the date of her accident, and early December 2014. The truck was damaged and had to be repaired. There were some communications between Ms. Temple and the Company regarding the MPI claim. In early December 2014, they started discussing her possible return to work. The truck was ready to go back on the road, and Ms. Temple, who was still in British Columbia, returned to Winnipeg to pick up her load. She made her deliveries as planned. Even though the Complainant had not worked for almost two months, Horizon found her some loads right before the holidays, a quiet period of the trucking year. Ms. Temple drove to British Columbia and had to be back in Winnipeg on Sunday, December 14, 2014. On the same day, she informed the Company that she had an appointment for a CT scan at Chilliwack Hospital, British Columbia, on December 18, 2014. On December 17, 2014, Horizon told the Complainant that she had a load to pick up in Richmond, British Columbia, on December 18, 2014. Ms. Temple reminded Horizon that she had a CT scan that day, between noon and 6 p.m., and that she also had to have her truck inspected because of a warning light indicating an engine problem. On December 18, 2014, Ms. Temple could not pick up the load as requested by the Respondent because she had to go to her hospital appointment and because there were more problems with her truck than she had thought: the truck could not go back on the road before being repaired. Horizon attempted to find an alternative, but at that time of the year, finding a truck is difficult. The Company was unable to fulfill its commitment to its client. On the same day, Horizon terminated Ms. Temple\u2019s employment contract.\nIV. Legal framework applicable to this case\n[21] The purpose of the Act is set out in section 2 and allows everyone the opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by any discriminatory practices or prohibited grounds of discrimination under the Act.\n[22] In human rights complaints, the Complainant has the burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. As noted in Ont. Human Rights Comm. v. Simpsons-Sears, 1985 CanLII 18 (SCC), at paragraph 28, a prima facie case is \u201c. . . one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent-employer\u201d.\n[23] In the particular case of the Complainant, Ms. Temple has to establish, in accordance with section 7 of the Act,\n(1) That there were one or more prohibited grounds of discrimination under the Act (in this case, sex and disability);\n(2) That, in the course of employment, the respondent differentiated adversely in relation to her or refused to continue to employ her; and\n(3) That there was a connection between the prohibited grounds of discrimination and the adverse differential treatment in the course of employment or the refusal to continue to employ her.\n[24] As was recently confirmed in Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier Aerospace Training Center), 2015 SCC 39 (\u201cBombardier\u201d), a prima facie case must be established on a balance of probabilities. Consequently, the Complainant has to establish, on a balance of probabilities, the three elements of a discriminatory practice. It is not necessary to establish that the prohibited ground is the sole cause of the discriminatory practice: the prohibited ground can be one of many factors (see Bombardier, supra, at paragraphs 44 to 52). Conversely, if the prohibited ground has not influenced the Respondent\u2019s conduct, the complaint must be dismissed\n[25] Moreover, it is important to remember that discrimination is usually not direct, overt or intentional. As was held in Basi v. Canadian National Railway, 1988 CanLII 108 (CHRT) (\u201cBasi\u201d), direct evidence is not required and neither is it necessary to prove an intention to discriminate (see also Bombardier, supra, at paragraphs 40 and 41). The Tribunal therefore has to analyze the circumstances to determine whether the subtle scent of discrimination permeates the matter. In the case of circumstantial evidence, an inference of discrimination may be drawn where the evidence offered in support of the allegations renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses (see Basi, supra; see also Chopra v. Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare), 2001 CanLII 8492 (CHRT)).\n[26] If the Complainant meets her burden of proof, the Respondent has the burden of presenting its own evidence to refute the Complainant\u2019s allegations of discrimination. Where there is a prima facie case of discrimination, the Respondent may demonstrate that the alleged discrimination did not occur as alleged by the Complainant or that the conduct was not discriminatory within the meaning of the Act (see Maillet v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 CHRT 48, at paragraph 4). The Respondent may, moreover, establish a defence under the Act, specifically section 15 of the Act. Finally, the Complainant has the burden of establishing that the Respondent\u2019s explanations are pretextual and that the true motivation behind the Respondent\u2019s actions was in fact discriminatory (see, for example, Basi, supra, and Israeli v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), 1983 CanLII 6 (CHRT)).\n[27] In this matter, Horizon did not rely on the exceptions set out in section 15 of the Act to explain the alleged discriminatory practices. However, it did present its own evidence to refute the Complainant\u2019s allegations that discrimination took place. Having said that, and since the Respondent did not rely on a defence available under the Act, the Tribunal will focus solely on the analysis of the testimonial and documentary evidence submitted by the parties to determine whether this is a prima facie case of discrimination.\nV. Preliminary remarks\nA. Witness David Yach\n[28] The Tribunal is in an unusual position with regard to Mr. Yach\u2019s testimony. According to the Respondent, Mr. Yach was paid by Ms. Temple to make false statements to the Commission. Horizon therefore called Mr. Yach as a witness so that he could explain the situation to the Tribunal. Ms. Temple categorically denies these claims.\n[29] I would like to start by noting that Mr. Yach\u2019s testimony raises many questions. Under oath, Mr. Yach admitted that he had lied and made false statements to the investigators of the Commission. When the Tribunal assessed his testimony, Mr. Yach succinctly answered general questions, even under examination-in-chief. However, when Ms. Welsh addressed the issue of the false statements, the witness quickly became hesitant in his replies and started stammering. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 also testified that Mr. Yach had worked for the Company in the past. Mr. Yach had billed fancy accessories for his truck to the Company\u2019s account. The Tribunal understands that he had not been authorized to do this. Moreover, Mr. Yach\u2019s truck was in deficit. Horizon and Mr. Yach therefore reached an agreement: the Company was to recover the truck to cover its expenses. However, Mr. Yach removed the fancy accessories before returning the truck to the Company, contrary to the agreement. Horizon therefore terminated his employment contract, and they ended their relationship on bad terms.\n[30] These events occurred several years ago. The Tribunal nonetheless questions Mr. Yach\u2019s credibility. Moreover, no evidence corroborating Mr. Yach\u2019s testimony was adduced at the hearing. It is Mr. Yach\u2019s word against that of Ms. Temple, who formally denies the allegations. I also find that, even though the Respondent is attempting to challenge Ms. Temple\u2019s credibility, Ms. Temple supported many elements of her testimony with documents, email exchanges and texted conversations. The Tribunal has no reason to question Ms. Temple\u2019s credibility at this stage. I would also like to note that other than the question of credibility, Mr. Yach\u2019s testimony was neither useful nor necessary for making a decision.\n[31] After considering these factors, the Tribunal therefore decided to disregard Mr. Yach\u2019s testimony.\nB. Objection under advisement\n[32] On the last day of the hearing, Ms. Temple asked for the Tribunal\u2019s permission to file a document from someone named Avi, who works at Rigmaster Truck & Trailer Repairs Inc. This document was not included in the documents sent to the Respondent or the Tribunal. According to Ms. Temple, it represents another example of her being forced to go on the road even though her truck was being repaired. She stated that the document should have been part of the documents she submitted to the Tribunal. Ms. Temple is not comfortable using technology, particularly, computers. She therefore needed support throughout the quasi-judicial process, including in the filing of her documentary evidence and the creation of binders. Also, the Complainant was not represented and did not benefit from the support of counsel.\n[33] Ms. Welsh strongly objected to the filing of this document. First, she told the Tribunal that the procedure for filing documents as evidence was explained to the Complainant on several occasions. According to Ms. Welsh, the instructions were clear throughout the process. She added that the document had not been authenticated, and was undated and anonymous. Lastly, she submitted that the admission of such a document at this stage was very prejudicial to the Respondent and it would not be fair to admit its contents without the Respondent having an opportunity to make a full and complete defence.\n[34] As Ms. Temple\u2019s request was made on the last day of the hearing, right before arguments, the evidence was closed and all witnesses had testified, I asked the parties whether they would agree to my reviewing the document before ruling on the objection. The parties agreed to this request. The Tribunal noted the parties\u2019 submissions and reserved its decision.\n[35] The rules and admissibility of evidence before the Tribunal are less formal than those before a court of law. The Tribunal may therefore receive and accept any information by any means that it sees fit under section 50(3)(c) of the Act. The procedure for filing documents with the Tribunal is set out in Rule 6 of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (the \u201cRules\u201d). Under Rule 9, the Panel may, at the request of a party, allow the filing of certain documents that were not filed in accordance with the procedure set out in Rule 6. However, this leave must be given in respect of the purpose described in paragraph 1(1) of the Rules, more particularly the right to full and ample opportunity to be heard.\n[36] Under section 50(3)(c) of the CHRA, the Tribunal has broad discretion in administering evidence. Hear-say can be admitted and documents do not necessarily have to be authenticated. However, the Tribunal is also guided by the principles of natural justice and fairness. I am mindful of the Complainant\u2019s arguments. However, I believe that admitting such a document would be highly prejudicial to the Respondent and given the very late filing, the Respondent was unable to take any means to mitigate this prejudice.\n[37] Consequently, I reject the Complainant\u2019s request to file this document. Regardless of this decision, I would like to note that even if the document had been filed with the Tribunal, its contents would not have had a major impact on my decision.\nVI. Analysis and positions of the parties\nA. Prohibited grounds\n[38] As mentioned previously, the prohibited grounds of discrimination relied upon by Ms. Temple are sex and disability. Neither ground was challenged by the parties.\n[39] \u201cDisability\u201d is defined at section 25 of the Act as \u201cany previous or existing mental or physical disability. . .\u201d. The Tribunal interpreted and expanded this definition in Audet v. Canadian National Railway, 2005 CHRT 25, at paragraph 39, which essentially reiterates the interpretation of disability provided in Desormeaux v. Corporation of the City of Ottawa, 2005 FCA 311 (CanLII), at paragraph 15, which defines disability as \u201ca physical or mental impairment, which results in a functional limitation or is associated with a perception of impairment\u201d.\n[40] It is clear to the Tribunal that Ms. Temple\u2019s injury is consistent with this interpretation of disability.\nB. Adverse differential treatment and refusal to continue to employ\n[41] Ms. Temple described several events to the Tribunal that, in her eyes, are displays of discriminatory practices by the Respondent. In her statement of particulars, Ms. Temple had already attempted to be concise by putting these events into different categories. On behalf of the Respondent, Ms. Welsh did the same. I will therefore review the different categories and elements to determine whether this is a prima facie case of discrimination. Where appropriate, I will look at the connection between the prohibited ground and the adverse impact in the subsequent section.\n(i) Tolls\n[42] First, Ms. Temple alleges that she suffered adverse differentiation in regard to the toll charges on the Port Mann Bridge, British Columbia. She submits that the male truck operators are not charged toll fees, but that Horizon deducted these amounts from her earnings. She compared her case to that of two truck operators, Yves Carriere and Pat Nicholas. The Respondent submits that Mr. Carriere does not use this bridge and therefore does not incur these expenses and that Mr. Nicholas is an employee-operator of the Company and that his costs and expenses are therefore assumed by the Company. The Respondent further argues that the Complainant was reimbursed these amounts. Lastly, the Respondent argues that it made an administrative error in managing the toll charges, an error that was later corrected.\n[43] The evidence reveals that the Port Mann Bridge, which is in the Vancouver area, British Columbia, has tolls. An electronic system called TReO records the details of vehicles using the bridge and drivers then have to pay the toll charges. In Ms. Temple\u2019s case, the charges were billed to the Company. Between December 22, 2012, and October 9, 2013, the Complainant incurred $523.90 in toll charges. The Company billed her for part of the sum, $300.00, on October 31, 2013. It also billed her $69.80 and $36.30 for new toll charges on her statement dated November 30, 2013. She was billed a total of $406.00 in charges.\n[44] Ms. Temple talked to Mr. Carriere and Mr. Nicholas to find out whether they, too, were being debited their toll charges, to which they replied no. She therefore asked Luc Dub\u00e9 to clarify why she was being billed these amounts. Luc Dub\u00e9 had to discuss the matter with Horizon\u2019s president, Gilbert Dub\u00e9, who was out of the province at the time. A few weeks went by, and the Company finally reimbursed the Complainant $406.00 on February 28, 2014. Luc Dub\u00e9 told the Tribunal that British Columbia\u2019s TReO toll charges were a relatively new situation for Horizon. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 had no recollection of receiving such invoices from the province previously. He also explained that the charges incurred by owner-operators, including tolls, are usually made at their own expense. The Tribunal notes that this is indeed what the employment contract indicates. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 nonetheless decided to pay the charges and to assume them in the future. The evidence establishes that this was a business decision on the part of the Company.\n[45] Furthermore, Mr. Carriere, who drives the same routes as the Complainant, between Manitoba and British Columbia, testified that he only rarely takes the Port Mann Bridge. Instead he uses a different route, without tolls or charges. As for Mr. Nicholas, it was established that he is an employee-operator for Horizon. He therefore does not incur such charges. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 also informed the Tribunal that if one of his employee-operators incurred toll charges, the Company would pay for them as planned.\n[46] Ms. Temple stated that Horizon was set on no other truck operator taking the Port Mann Bridge and incurring this type of charge. She referred to the Company\u2019s history of TReO charges, which clearly shows that one other driver took the bridge between January and March 2013. This was during the same period she accumulated $523.90 in toll charges. It was demonstrated that an administrative error was made in managing the toll charges. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 admitted that he had taken it for granted that the toll charges had all been incurred by the Complainant and had not really looked at the licence plate numbers associated with the charges. Ms. Temple was therefore debited $69.80 even though it had not been incurred by her. This sum plus the other amounts debited were reimbursed, and she was not subsequently charged for tolls. The fact that the $406.00 reimbursement was made four months later and that the other operator was not billed these charges, as a result of an error, is not adverse differential treatment in itself.\n[47] Regarding the British Columbia toll charges, I therefore find that, on a balance of probabilities, the evidence does not show that the Company differentiated adversely in relation to the Complainant.\n(ii) Working harder than male operators\n[48] Ms. Temple alleges that she had to work harder than her male colleagues to earn the same income. Horizon respectfully submitted to the Tribunal that no evidence was submitted for this. After reviewing the evidence, I must indeed find that the Complainant has not met her burden. In the factual background, I explained how the earnings of owner-operators are calculated. A number of factors affect this calculation, including the number of pick-ups and deliveries made, mileage, maintenance and repair costs, gas, insurance and permits. I also note that the Company cannot guarantee routes or pick-ups and deliveries. Other aspects must also be taken into consideration, including efficiency and even business opportunities. Without overwhelming evidence clearly showing that it is more probable than not that Ms. Temple had to work harder to earn the same income as the male operators, I cannot draw this conclusion.\n[49] I therefore do not believe that, in the course of employment, the Company differentiated adversely in relation to the Complainant as far as this aspect is concerned.\n(iii) Forced to deliver and drive\n[50] Ms. Temple alleges that, in contrast to the male truck operators, the Company forced her to deliver goods when she was unavailable to do so. Once again, the Respondent attempted to refute these allegations. Some witnesses explained the expression \u201cforced to deliver\u201d to the Tribunal in their own words. Generally speaking, they all agreed that \u201cforced to deliver\u201d the goods referred to the Company forcing a truck operator to go on the road when he or she was unable to go on the road or when the Company put the operator in a position where the operator felt that he or she had no other choice but to go on the road. Being unable to drive can mean a number of things, for example when an operator is on a mandatory break or leave, or when he or she is too tired to drive. Ms. Temple attempted to establish several situations to the Tribunal where she had been forced to deliver goods by Horizon. For the sake of brevity, I will not review all of these situations. She explained, moreover, that she had been afraid of losing her job if she refused to go on the road even when she was unable to do so.\n[51] It is clear to me that the Complainant generally agreed to drive when the Company asked her to do so, even when she was unable to do so. Ms. Temple made several statements about this subject and often repeated the same expression, saying that she had not wanted to \u201crock the boat\u201d and drove when she was asked to do so. Luc Dub\u00e9 confirmed this in his testimony, describing the Complainant as being compliant. The Complainant\u2019s colleague, Mr. Carriere, whose testimony is absolutely credible, also explained to the Tribunal that he had trouble understanding why she agreed to every load Horizon gave to her. He explained that he had refused loads from the Company and that the president, Gilbert Dub\u00e9, had also contacted him because he had refused a load. When he was asked whether Horizon had ever threatened him with dismissal when he refused a load or refused to drive, Mr. Carriere clearly replied no. Lastly, Mr. Carriere testified that he had refused several loads that Ms. Temple had accepted.\n[52] Having said that, two situations involving the Complainant feeling forced to make a delivery or to go on the road attracted the Tribunal\u2019s attention. The first occurred on July 21 and 22, 2014. Ms. Temple, who was in British Columbia, informed her supervisor, Luc Dub\u00e9, on Sunday, July 21, 2014, that her truck had a mechanical problem. She told him in advance that she would take her 36 hours of mandatory leave on Tuesday, July 23, 2014, and would reset her working hours. On Monday, July 22, 2014, Luc Dub\u00e9 informed her that she had to go on the road and pick up three loads, including some scheduled for July 24, 2014. The Complainant told Luc Dub\u00e9 that this would not allow her to do her 36-hour reset. She accepted the load anyway, but it forced her to switch from the 70-hour cycle to the 120-hour one. Counsel for the Respondent alleges that Ms. Temple\u2019s hours were complying with statutory requirements and that she could switch cycles. I do not find the evidence to be as clear as Ms. Welsh sees it. It is apparent that the Complainant informed her supervisor by text message that her hours were violating statutory requirements and that she could attempt to organize herself so as to be able to pick up the load as requested. Nothing in the evidence allows me to question what the Complainant has said about the situation. Having said that, the load was maintained, by both Ms. Temple and the Company.\n[53] The Respondent noted several times that the duty to comply with the law with regard to driving hours was the responsibility of the truck operators. The Tribunal understands the idea that an operator should not go on the road if it is unlawful to do so within the operator\u2019s hours of work. However, the Tribunal has trouble understanding how the Company could dispatch a load when the operator tells it that he or she has to rest or take a break and indicates numerous times that it would be unlawful to drive. The Company was already aware on the day before that Ms. Temple had to reset her cycle. I would add that Ms. Temple took the time to explain to her supervisor, Luc Dub\u00e9, that she had the feeling that the Company was questioning her work and her efficiency. Should she have said no to the load? Probably. Was she under the impression that she had no other choice but to take the load? For a number of reasons, this is very possible. When the Complainant explained to the Tribunal that she had felt pressured to drive, in the circumstances, her statement does not seem unreasonable.\n[54] Another similar incident took place a few weeks later, on September 26, 2014. Ms. Temple had to pick up a load in Winnipeg, and the president of the Company, Gilbert Dub\u00e9, had to load the truck. A new delivery had to be made in Alberta, by Ms. Temple, on her way west. The evidence reveals that the Complainant was threatened with dismissal by Gilbert Dub\u00e9 via text message if she did not take the load as requested. The Tribunal can understand that, for a number of reasons, Gilbert Dub\u00e9 was irritated by the situation, in part, because of the existing tension between them. What is clear is that Ms. Temple took the load under threat of dismissal if she decided otherwise. When looking at the situation from a broader perspective, this incident was a continuation of the events of July 21 and 22, 2014. Ms. Temple felt under pressure and that she had to take the loads or risk consequences.\n[55] The Tribunal understands that Horizon is a small family company and that its directors want to provide their clients with excellent service. This cannot, however, justify such treatment. The Respondent mentioned that Ms. Temple never refused a load. Indeed, she repeated a few times that she wanted to make money and that she did not want to refuse the loads offered by the Company. These arguments do not supersede the fact that she had been threatened by the Respondent if she did not go on the road. Even though there are several reasons why she accepted most of the offered loads, the pressure remains one of the many factors to consider.\n[56] Horizon also mentioned that Ms. Temple never made a written complaint about the matter. This argument has no basis as nothing in the evidence suggests that there was an obligation to make a written complaint to the employer. I would also add that it is clear that on July 22, 2014, Ms. Temple described to her supervisor, Luc Dub\u00e9, that she felt pressured to accept loads and that the Company was questioning her work and her efficiency. The Company was therefore well aware of the Complainant\u2019s feelings.\n[57] Even though Gilbert Dub\u00e9 testified that he monitored all his operators in the same manner, supervised them when necessary and sometimes used profanity with his employees, nothing in the evidence suggests that he threatened other drivers with dismissal if they did not take loads. On the contrary, the evidence reveals that Mr. Carriere refused loads and was not threatened with dismissal. Ms. Temple feared dismissal. This was adverse differential treatment.\n[58] I would like to add that it is clear to me that the relationship between the Complainant and the Respondent deteriorated considerably over time. The Tribunal understands that frustrations built up on both sides. In addition, the evidence reveals that Ms. Temple required more supervision than certain other operators. However, I reiterate that this in itself does not justify Horizon threatening her with dismissal if she did not take loads given that it did not threaten the other truck operators. It is not sufficient for the Respondent to explain to the Tribunal that the Complainant could have simply said \u201cno\u201d and refused the loads.\n[59] Based on a balance of probabilities, I find that the Company treated the Complainant adversely in the course of employment. I will deal with the question of the connection between the prohibited ground and the adverse differential treatment later.\n(iv) Less time allocated\n[60] Ms. Temple alleged that Horizon assigned her less time for her trips than her male truck operator colleagues. The Respondent contradicts these allegations and submits that the Complainant did not prove her allegations on a balance of probabilities. The only evidence is the short testimony by Jonathan Temple, who stated that, in her last months of work, his mother had less time to stop in Calgary. This factor alone does not allow her to meet the burden of a balance of probabilities. Therefore there is insufficient evidence that, in the course of employment, the Company differentiated adversely in relation to Ms. Temple in this regard.\n(v) Additional loads\n[61] The Complainant alleged that she suffered adverse differential treatment because the Company assigned her new loads and deliveries while she was already driving a planned route. The Respondent confirms that Horizon follows this type of practice to make trips effective. It noted that it could not wait for an operator to return to Winnipeg to give the operator new loads: the goal was profitability. Ms. Temple was not specific about which situations she is criticizing Horizon for. She addressed this subject in general terms in her testimony. I understand that the trucking industry is constantly moving, that loads and deliveries can change or be added quickly. The fact that loads and charges are added to planned loads and deliveries is not in itself a discriminatory practice.\n[62] What the Tribunal must look at, rather, is the impact of such additions on the Complainant and if this resulted in adverse differential treatment in the course of employment. Unfortunately, Ms. Temple was unable to establish that the addition of loads during trips resulted in adverse differential treatment for her. On a balance of probabilities, there is no evidence for this.\n(vi) Difference in privileges (debts and truck lease)\n[63] The Complainant also described as adverse differential treatment the fact that she did not enjoy the same privileges as the male truck operators. More specifically, she referred to the management of her financial debt to the Company, the renting of a replacement truck and the financing of a personal loan. I will discuss these three privileges separately.\n[64] First, the Company accepts owner-operators charging certain expenses to its account. The Company then deducts these amounts from the owner-operators\u2019 earnings at the end of the month. The evidence shows that, in late September 2014, the Complainant owed Horizon $78.16 and that, in late October, she owed zero. Ms. Temple\u2019s accident occurred on October 14, 2014, and she stopped working until early December 2014. Consequently, the sums she incurred to repair the truck started accumulating in the Company\u2019s account. At the end of November 2014, the Complainant owed $5,835.91. She started working again in mid-December 2014 and made a few deliveries. However, on December 17, 2014, the Complainant brought her truck to the garage for new repairs. There were more repairs than expected, and new expenses were incurred. The Company terminated her contract on December 18, 2014. On December 31, 2014, Ms. Temple owed $10,264.40.\n[65] Ms. Temple explained to the Tribunal that the Company dismissed her and in the course of employment, differentiated adversely in relation to her on the pretext that she owed them a great deal of money and that she was unable to reimburse it. She submits, however, that the male owner-operators, including Mr. Carriere, also had debts to the Company, but that they were not dismissed or made to suffer adverse differential treatment. First, I note that Mr. Carriere is in the same situation as the Complainant: he is an owner-operator and charges expenses to the Company\u2019s account. Some of his equipment statements were adduced before the Tribunal, specifically those of October, November and December 2014. Like Ms. Temple, Mr. Carriere also had an accident in mid-October 2014, and he stopped working until November 22, 2014. In October 2014, he owed Horizon $7,381.48. In November, he owed $24,653.26. However, Mr. Carriere started working again in late November. In December 2014, he succeeded in reducing his debt to $15,917.55 and did not take the advance during this month.\n[66] Gilbert Dub\u00e9 testified on this subject at the hearing. He explained that when Mr. Carriere incurred the charge of over $12,000.00 in November 2014, he was unaware that the charge would be so high. He explained that the Company did not assume these repair costs. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 allegedly asked Mr. Carriere to take out a personal loan to pay for these expenses and referred him to an acquaintance working for a financial institution. The testimonies are contradictory. Mr. Carriere testified that when he has major repair work done to his truck, he asks for the Company\u2019s permission before incurring such expenses. He then confirmed that the Company did pay for this repair of almost $13,000.00. That is indeed what appears from his equipment statement dated November 30, 2014. As mentioned previously, on this date, he owed $24,653.26. When cross-examined, Gilbert Dub\u00e9 changed his mind and confirmed that the Company did seem, in fact, to have paid for these repairs, and eventually attempted to explain the situation. He added that Mr. Carriere had the capacity to reimburse the Company and that he owned a house and his truck. Yet Mr. Carriere confirmed to the Tribunal that his truck was financed through a financial institution. Moreover, when the Tribunal consulted Mr. Carriere\u2019s equipment statement from December 2014, nothing suggested that he reimbursed the Company a large part of his debt, through a personal loan he might have taken out, for example, as requested by Gilbert Dub\u00e9. In the circumstances, I find Mr. Carriere\u2019s testimony to be more coherent in light of the evidence before me at the hearing.\n[67] Once again, the Tribunal is mindful of the fact that Horizon is a small family company. As mentioned by Gilbert Dub\u00e9 and corroborated by Luc Dub\u00e9, the Company assumes many expenses of owner-operators and is not reimbursed these sums before the end of every month, if the owner-operators have sufficient earnings. Otherwise, it assumes the balance of the debt until it has been reimbursed in full. However, I wonder how the Respondent can say that the Complainant was unable to reimburse her debt even though she had been working for Horizon for over two years and the evidence clearly reveals that she had always reimbursed what she owed the Company. Moreover, on October 31, 2014, she did not owe the Company anything.\n[68] Because of the accident and the repairs to her truck, it is clear that charges would be made to the Company\u2019s account. When Gilbert Dub\u00e9 contacted the garage on December 17, 2014, to find out what could be done to repair the truck as quickly as possible, he learned that there would be additional expenses in the amount of $5,000 to $10,000. It is clear that Gilbert Dub\u00e9 made a business decision to prevent the situation from worsening. However, the Company accepted the risk with Mr. Carriere, but not with Ms. Temple. The Respondent adds that Mr. Carriere refused advances from Company funds in December 2014 and that he generated excellent earnings in the same month in order to reimburse his debt as quickly as possible. The evidence does indeed reveal that Mr. Carriere reimbursed almost $9,000 of his debt in December 2014. Having said that, Horizon did not give the Complainant the same opportunity to reimburse her debt because it terminated her employment contract.\n[69] Consequently, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Complainant suffered adverse differential treatment by the Respondent in the management of her debt.\n[70] The Complainant states that the Company helped and supported Mr. Carriere in applying for personal financing to reimburse his debt and that she had not been entitled to this type of privilege. The Respondent refutes these allegations. There seems to be some confusion here. It is not clear whether Ms. Temple is criticizing the fact that Horizon referred Mr. Carriere to one of its contacts in a financial institution or that Horizon guaranteed his application for financing. The evidence reveals that the Respondent did not guarantee his application: Gilbert Dub\u00e9 suggested to Mr. Carriere that he meet with an agent he knew in a financial institution. Moreover, the Tribunal cannot find that between October 2014 and December 18, 2014, based on Mr. Carriere\u2019s equipment statements, a financing application allowed Mr. Carriere to reimburse his debt to the Company.\n[71] This issue has not been established on a balance of probabilities, and I find that there was no adverse differential treatment by the Company.\n[72] Lastly, Ms. Temple testified that the Company did not support her in renting a truck even though it supported Mr. Carriere. She is referring to a situation where Luc Dub\u00e9 took steps to rent a truck for Mr. Carriere. The Company attempted to refute these allegations and stated that there had been no adverse differential treatment. The evidence reveals that on August 7, 2014, the Complainant\u2019s truck broke down, and she was therefore unable to pick up the planned loads. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 succeeded in postponing the loading time so that the truck could be repaired. However, the garage could not do the work quickly because it did not have the part needed for the repair. Ms. Temple therefore proposed a solution, namely, renting a truck. With the rented truck, she would have been able to pick up the planned loads. However, there was a misunderstanding between her and Gilbert Dub\u00e9: while she believed that he was renting the truck, he had understood the opposite.\n[73] Ms. Temple alleges that she suffered adverse differential treatment because Luc Dub\u00e9 had previously rented a truck for Mr. Carriere, but Gilbert Dub\u00e9 did not do the same for her. The evidence reveals that Luc Dub\u00e9 was at the office when the situation with Mr. Carriere came about. It was therefore easy for him to take the necessary steps. It appears that, at the time of the August 7, 2014 incident, Luc Dub\u00e9 was not in the office. In addition, Gilbert Dub\u00e9 was not physically present at the office that day, and the dispatcher, Mr. Savage, was on vacation. The Respondent told the Tribunal that the Complainant had been in the best position to rent the truck. In the end, Ms. Temple did rent the truck herself and pay for the related expenses. Mr. Carriere also paid for his truck rental. Did this incident result in Ms. Temple being adversely differentiated against in the course of employment? The Tribunal believes that this situation was the result of a unique set of circumstances.\n[74] I therefore find that this incident does not constitute adverse differential treatment of the Complainant by Horizon.\n(vii) MPI claim\n[75] Ms. Temple claims that the Company differentiated adversely in relation to her in how it managed her MPI and WorkSafeBC claims. She argues that the delays are the fault of the Company, which did not act quickly, and that she suffered the consequences. She cites as an example Mr. Carriere\u2019s claims, which, according to her, were managed swiftly by Horizon. The Respondent refutes these allegations.\n[76] I will review the MPI claim first. As explained above, when a truck operator has an accident, MPI may cover some of the damage to the truck, trailer and load. The accident happened on October 14, 2014. The evidence reveals that the Complainant and the Respondent were in touch quickly to discuss the situation. Ms. Temple did not need an ambulance or the police. She felt able to complete her deliveries, which she did. On October 16, 2014, she and the Company discussed the estimated damage to the truck, among other things. At the same time, she told Luc Dub\u00e9 that she would have to see a doctor about her thumb. Luc Dub\u00e9 asked her to report to him when she had seen the doctor. On October 17, 2014, she informed Luc Dub\u00e9 that the doctor had asked to go for an x-ray. Luc Dub\u00e9 therefore confirmed to Ms. Temple that she would be off for the weekend. He also told her again that he needed an estimate for the damage to the truck. On Monday, October 20, 2014, Luc Dub\u00e9 reiterated his request to the Complainant to provide him with the necessary information concerning the accident. Ms. Temple gave him some details and told him that she would send other information shortly. On October 22, 2014, Luc Dub\u00e9 reminded the Complainant, once again, that he was still waiting for information from her. She replied that she had received the video of the accident and that she had given his email address to the garage assessing the damage. On October 23, 2014, Ms. Temple verified with Luc Dub\u00e9 whether he had received the requested documents and information, which he confirmed. However, on November 3, 2014, the MPI claim had still not been completed. The evidence reveals that there had been communication errors between the various parties involved in the claim, including at MPI. On November 4, 2014, the claim was finally completed. Luc Dub\u00e9 testified that he had acted as quickly as he could, as soon as he had received all the information needed to complete the claim. The Tribunal does not question Luc Dub\u00e9\u2019s credibility. A delay did indeed occur in the processing of the Complainant\u2019s claim. However, this delay was partly due to the time needed to gather and send information and the communication problems between the various parties. The delay was not caused by the Respondent alone.\n[77] Nothing in the evidence suggests that the Company differentiated adversely against Ms. Temple\u2019s claim. I therefore find that the Complainant did not meet her burden of proof regarding this issue.\n[78] Ms. Temple claims that the Respondent should have asked MPI to reimburse certain other expenses in the claim, which it did not do. Horizon contradicts these allegations. The parties explained to the Tribunal that, when an employer completes a claim to MPI, there is a subrogation: MPI subrogates itself to the employer in the claim. The Respondent explained that it therefore no longer had the authority to claim a reimbursement of the additional expenses from MPI because MPI had subrogated its rights. The Tribunal listened to the parties give broad interpretations of the concept of subrogation. No MPI representative was called as a witness to explain the subtleties of this process. No acts, regulations, policies, procedures or other documents governing MPI and its processes were filed at the hearing. It is therefore difficult for the Tribunal to position itself on the concept of subrogation and on what the Company should or could have done, without any concrete evidence to this effect.\n[79] I find that Ms. Temple has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that the Company differentiated adversely in relation to her in this regard.\n(viii) WorkSafeBC claim\n[80] The Complainant further claims that Horizon adversely differentiated in relation to her by not submitting the WorkSafeBC claim before December 2014. The Company defended itself, arguing that Ms. Temple did not inform it of the seriousness of her injury. The Company\u2019s representatives believed her injury to be minor and not requiring a claim. I note that the accident happened on October 14, 2014. The evidence reveals that the Company asked Ms. Temple whether emergency services had been required, which had not been the case. However, the Complainant did inform Luc Dub\u00e9 on October 16, 2014, that she actually had to see a doctor and do so quickly. Luc Dub\u00e9 told her to inform him of any developments. On October 17, 2014, she told him that the doctor had asked her to go for x-rays. Luc Dub\u00e9 replied that she was therefore definitely off for the weekend, which he had already anticipated. It was established that the WorkSafeBC claim was not made until December 18, 2014.\n[81] Gilbert Dub\u00e9 testified about the WorkSafeBC claim. He told the Tribunal that he did not know that Ms. Temple had injured herself during the October 14, 2014 accident and that he had not been sent an incident report for WorkSafeBC. Moreover, he had not realized that the injury was so serious that it required leave from work. He finally explained to the Tribunal that he had received a letter from WorkSafeBC in December 2014 asking him for an incident report. It was at that point that he contacted the Complainant for further information. In turn, Luc Dub\u00e9 stated he took care of this type of claim for the Company. According to him, the injured employee has to initiate the claim by telling him (or Gilbert Dub\u00e9) that he or she is injured and intending to claim compensation. He then explained that he is not in the habit of asking his employees whether they will claim compensation for an accident. He justified this by stating that he did not wish to interfere in his employees\u2019 private lives and that if his employees did not want to disclose their injuries, he had no control over their affairs. The evidence also establishes that on December 4, 2014, Ms. Temple sent an email to Luc Dub\u00e9 and asked him for her WorkSafeBC claim number. Luc Dub\u00e9 testified that he was unaware at that date that Ms. Temple had initiated a claim. He had read the message quickly and taken for granted that she was asking for her MPI claim number.\n[82] Having said that, and even if I accept the fact that the Company\u2019s president, Gilbert Dub\u00e9, was unaware that the Complainant had injured herself in the October 14, 2014 accident, it is clear to me that his son, Luc Dub\u00e9, Horizon\u2019s general manager, was aware of the injury. Ms. Temple had told him a few times that she had to see a doctor about her thumb, that she might have dislocated it and that she had to go for x-rays. The Tribunal can imagine that Ms. Temple did not specifically insist on the fact that the injury was a major one or that she wanted to make a WorkSafeBC claim, but I do not feel that Horizon was particularly proactive in managing this work-related injury. Luc Dub\u00e9 testified that out of respect for his employees\u2019 privacy, he does not question them about their injuries. I find this practice questionable. Ms. Temple filed a document from WorkSafeBC\u2019s website. It clearly mentions that when one of their employees injures themselves at work or becomes ill, employers are responsible for taking them somewhere where they will receive medical care. These costs are borne by the employer. In addition, employers have to report injuries within three days of the incident. The WorkSafeBC employer form for reporting a work-related injury also clearly notes at the beginning of the form that employers are required to report the incident even if they disagree with the claim. The form also states that by submitting the form promptly, employers will avoid penalties.\n[83] Employers therefore have every interest to report an employee injury as quickly as possible, however serious the injury and regardless of whether they agree with the claim. I would add that the incident report employers have to submit is very short. Most of the questions are multiple choices and can be answered with a check mark. The other questions concern basic personal information. The section for describing the incident and injury in question is short compared with the rest of the form. Consequently, only a brief description can be provided. In reviewing the form completed by Horizon on December 18, 2014, I note that the description of the incident is no more than four lines and a few words long. Horizon may well request written injury reports from its employees, but I do not believe that this is required to initiate a claim. Nothing in the evidence allows me to draw such a conclusion. Furthermore, the description of the injury given by Horizon to WorkSafeBC does not contain any more information than the information available to Luc Dub\u00e9 in October 2014. It is hard for the Tribunal to understand how the Company can say that it did not have enough information on the accident and that it needed a written report when it essentially knew what happened.\n[84] The evidence reveals that Mr. Carriere\u2019s claim was completed quickly and smoothly. Horizon stated that Mr. Carriere had quickly given it a written injury report, which is why the claim was completed immediately. The evidence does not reveal whether Mr. Carriere clearly told the Company that he intended to claim compensation for his injuries. Having said that, the fact is that, like Ms. Temple, he had an accident around the same time, he was injured, the truck had to be repaired and he was unable to work. In all of these aspects, his situation was identical to that of the Complainant. But the manner in which his claim was processed is disproportionate.\n[85] For these reasons in particular, I find that Ms. Temple suffered adverse differential treatment by the Company in the management of her WorkSafeBC claim.\n(ix) Time to make repairs denied\n[86] The Complainant claimed that she suffered adverse differential treatment because Horizon did not give her the necessary time for carrying out repairs on her truck. According to her, the male truck operators do not have this kind of problem. Horizon attempted to refute these allegations. According to Horizon, it is the owner-operators\u2019 responsibility to ensure that repairs on trucks are properly carried out and not the Company\u2019s. It therefore submits that the Complainant should have refused loads in order to have her equipment properly repaired. Ms. Temple referred to a situation where her truck caught fire due to oil deficiency. Repairs were necessary. According to Ms. Temple, the Respondent planned a load even though the problem on the truck had not yet been identified. She stated that she had not wanted to \u201crock the boat\u201d and accepted the load despite the repairs on her truck not having been completed. This incident occurred in February or March 2014. I do not find the evidence here to be exhaustive and it is difficult to conclude that the Company differentiated adversely in relation to Ms. Temple. I reiterate that the Complainant has the burden of establishing her case on a balance of probabilities.\n[87] I attempted to identify other incidents of this kind in the evidence. Another incident occurred on December 17, 2014, when Ms. Temple announced to Luc Dub\u00e9 that she was taking her truck to the garage to have the engine warning light inspected. On the following day, December 18, 2014, Ms. Temple\u2019s contract was terminated. It is therefore impossible for the Tribunal to conclude that the Company did not give her the necessary time to have her truck repaired. Moreover, there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that, between the October 14, 2014 accident and mid-December 2014, the Complainant did not have the time she needed for her repairs.\n[88] On these occasions, I do not believe that the Respondent differentiated adversely in relation to Ms. Temple.\n[89] The last incident is that of July 21 and 22, 2014, when Ms. Temple told Luc Dub\u00e9 that she was taking her 36-hour break and having her truck repaired. I already dealt with this event in the previous section. I already determined that Ms. Temple felt pressured to take the load and that she was therefore treated adversely by the Company. The incident is the same but has to be examined from a different angle, that of the repairs. The Company did not directly deny the Complainant the right to carry out repairs on her truck. However, the indirect result was that Ms. Temple was unable to carry out the repairs. She therefore suffered adverse differential treatment.\n[90] On this occasion, I find that in the course of employment, the Respondent differentiated adversely in relation to the Complainant.\n(x) Adverse differential treatment and mistreatment by dispatchers\n[91] The Complainant also argued that some of the Company\u2019s employees differentiated adversely in relation to her or treated her improperly. She is referring to the Company\u2019s two dispatchers, Mr. Wyatt and Mr. Boulanger. According to Ms. Temple, the dispatchers only sent partial information to the president of the Company. The Respondent refutes these allegations. It is undeniable that there were communication problems between Horizon, Ms. Temple and the employees. The evidence also reveals that they relied greatly on text messaging as a communication tool, which does not seem to have simplified exchanges, on the contrary. On many occasions, a simple phone call could have clarified any ambiguities. Ms. Temple also stated that the dispatchers mistreated her. Mr. Boulanger was not called as a witness. Ms. Temple\u2019s testimony alone did not satisfy the Tribunal on this subject. As for Mr. Wyatt, the only evidence on file in this regard is a text message exchange dated October 3, 2014, between him and Ms. Temple. He sent her information for a new load and asked her whether she could take it or not. Ms. Temple took over an hour to confirm whether she would take it, and Mr. Wyatt seemed to lose patience. He told her that he thought that she would once again mess up the plans. He added that it was no longer worth assigning her loads as the Company looked like an idiot in front of its clients by not fulfilling its obligations.\n[92] Mr. Wyatt and another dispatcher, Mr. Matthews, testified at the hearing. They told the Tribunal that they both decided to stop acting as dispatcher for Ms. Temple because she required too much supervision and because her truck was often broken. They added that it was not the first time they refused to work with truck operators for the same reasons. This is why Luc Dub\u00e9 and particularly Gilbert Dub\u00e9 were involved in supervising Ms. Temple and her trips. It is the Tribunal\u2019s understanding that Ms. Temple was happy no longer dealing with the dispatchers. Inversely, she also alleged that she was being micro-managed by Gilbert Dub\u00e9. The Tribunal realizes that no situation is perfect. However, this is the solution that was implemented by the Company to resolve the matter.\n[93] Once again, it is undisputable that the members of Horizon, including the dispatchers, were frustrated, and that this frustration seemed to be firmly entrenched in October 2014. Certain exchanges were less cordial than others. Does this in itself constitute adverse differential treatment? I cannot draw such a conclusion. The evidence does not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that information was transmitted only partially. For these reasons, I find that there was no adverse differential treatment by the Company.\n(xi) Time for medical appointments denied\n[94] Finally, the last allegation of discrimination raised by Ms. Temple involves the Company not allowing her the necessary time for her medical appointments. Horizon refutes her allegations. In assessing the evidence, the Tribunal identified two specific events related to her medical appointments.\n[95] The first event occurred on August 26 and 27, 2014. The Complainant was in Langley, British Columbia. Luc Dub\u00e9 told her that he would contact her on the morning of August 27, 2014, to inform her whether there would be a new load for her or not. She agreed and told him that she would stay in Langley. She also asked him to let her know as early as possible because she would take the day off otherwise. Luc Dub\u00e9 replied in the affirmative. On the morning of August 27, 2014, the Complainant asked Luc Dub\u00e9 whether he had a delivery for her. He replied not for the time being. Later, Luc Dub\u00e9 contacted her because there was finally a load. He then provided her with the information for the load. Ms. Temple replied that she was at the doctor\u2019s, on the waiting list. She told the Tribunal that the Company had not given her time for her medical appointment. Ms. Temple and Luc Dub\u00e9 both testified on this subject. The Complainant stated that, for her, it was clear that they had agreed that she would take the day off if no load had been scheduled by early the next morning. Luc Dub\u00e9 told the Tribunal that when Ms. Temple wrote to him on August 27, 2014 to verify whether there was a load for her, this meant that she wanted and was asking for a load. He therefore assigned her a load once confirmed by the client. Once again, the Complainant and the Respondent had trouble communicating and understanding one another. The Tribunal also wonders why Ms. Temple did not tell M. Dub\u00e9 that she was going to the doctor\u2019s when she decided to go there. Would it not have been easier to clarify the situation? Once again, text messaging and communication problems lead to a misunderstanding. This in itself is not adverse differential treatment.\n[96] I therefore find that the Company did not differentiate adversely in relation to Ms. Temple on this occasion.\n[97] The other situation occurred on December 18, 2014, when Ms. Temple went to Chilliwack Hospital for her CT scan. The Tribunal has already reviewed the facts in a previous section and there is no need to repeat them at this stage. However, I have already found that the Company differentiated adversely in relation to Ms. Temple on this occasion.\nC. Connection between the ground and the adverse differential treatment\n[98] I will review the adverse differential treatment suffered by the Complainant to determine whether sex and disability were one of the many factors of the impugned actions and their adverse impacts. There is no need for a \u201ccausal connection\u201d: the connection between the prohibited ground of discrimination and the impugned action does not have to be an exclusive one (see Bombardier, supra, at paragraphs 44 to 52). The demonstration, on a balance of probabilities, of a simple \u201cconnection\u201d or \u201cfactor\u201d suffices. For the sake of brevity and to avoid redundancy, the Tribunal will not reiterate all the facts set out in the previous section and will limit itself to determining whether the Complainant has made a connection between the ground and the adverse differential treatment.\n[99] First, I determined that the Complainant suffered adverse differential treatment in the course of employment by the Company when she was forced to make deliveries or to go on the road. I also found that she felt pressured to take loads to avoid dismissal. Did the Complainant establish, on a balance of probabilities, that this adverse differential treatment was connected either to her sex or her disability? I cannot conclude that Ms. Temple established this connection between either of the grounds and the impugned actions. The evidence reveals that the Company had many reasons to act as it did, including built-up frustration, low revenues and unreliability, and performance and communication issues, to name but a few. I would add, however, that some of these reasons are questionable and do not justify the threats of dismissal. However, was the fact that Ms. Temple is a woman or disabled a factor in how she was treated? The evidence does not allow me to answer this in the affirmative.\n[100] I also determined that Ms. Temple was treated adversely in how her debt to the Company was managed. Once again, I must determine whether this treatment is connected to the prohibited grounds of discrimination. The Complainant did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that her sex or her disability was a factor in the impugned action of the Company. It is clear for the Tribunal that in October 2014, the relationship between the Complainant and the Respondent deteriorated considerably. This relationship ended on December 18, 2014, because of several factors. Some of these factors were listed above. Sex and disability were not part of the factors of how her debt was managed.\n[101] I now have to determine whether there is a connection between Ms. Temple\u2019s sex and disability and the manner in which her WorkSafeBC claim was processed. I have already mentioned that, in my opinion, Horizon had enough information to initiate a claim and that I have trouble understanding why this was not done swiftly. However, this is not a determining factor in a case of discrimination. At issue is whether sex and disability were a factor in the Company\u2019s processing of her WorkSafeBC claim. The evidence does not suggest that these factors played a role in how the claim was processed. The processing delay was caused by a variety of factors, including the fact that the Company wanted to respect its employees\u2019 privacy, the requirement to file a written report and the perception of the seriousness of the injury. Whether these explanations are justified is not at issue. It is clear for the Tribunal that Ms. Temple\u2019s sex and disability were not factors in the impugned act, and I therefore find that there is no connection between them.\n[102] Regarding the incident of July 21 and 22, 2014, and the fact that Ms. Temple was unable to have her truck repaired, I also have to determine whether she established that her sex or her disability were a factor in Luc Dub\u00e9\u2019s conduct. As for the issue of whether the Company forced the Complainant to take loads because she was a woman or disabled, here, too, I cannot find that there is a connection between the grounds and the impugned actions.\n[103] I determined that the Company differentiated adversely in relation to Ms. Temple on December 18, 2014, when she had a medical appointment for a CT scan. Also, Ms. Temple stopped being employed by the Company on December 18, 2014. At issue is whether the refusal to continue to employ the Complainant and the adverse differential treatment are connected to her sex or her disability.\n[104] In short, Ms. Temple was dismissed by Gilbert Dub\u00e9 on December 18, 2014, while she was at her medical appointment. She had notified Luc Dub\u00e9 of this appointment a few times several days in advance. The Tribunal also notes that Ms. Temple had to take her truck to the garage on the afternoon of December 17, 2014, to have an engine warning light checked. The evidence reveals that the problem was more serious than anticipated and that the truck could not go back on the road. Ms. Temple decided not to contact the Company on December 17 considering the time and the time difference. She informed the Company on the morning of December 18, 2014, that her truck was being repaired. The load could not be picked up, and Gilbert Dub\u00e9 decided to terminate Ms. Temple\u2019s employment contract. I have to determine whether, on a balance of probabilities, Ms. Temple\u2019s sex or disability was one of the many factors in the adverse differential treatment. I cannot conclude that this was the case. The Complainant was unable to establish a connection between either of the grounds and the adverse differential treatment. I do find that there was adverse differential treatment. The Company certainly put Ms. Temple in a very delicate spot. It consciously took the chance that the load might not be picked up. But did Horizon do this because the Complainant is a woman and had an injured thumb? Based on the evidence, such a conclusion cannot be drawn on a balance of probabilities.\n[105] As for the dismissal, the Tribunal must once again ask itself whether the fact that Ms. Temple is a woman or injured her thumb was a factor in the refusal to continue to employ her. The time chosen by Gilbert Dub\u00e9 to dismiss Ms. Temple was not ideal as she had to go to her medical appointment. Having said that, the Tribunal has to analyze the evidence before it to determine whether the subtle scent of discrimination permeates the dismissal. I would like to note that Ms. Temple\u2019s truck had to be repaired on December 17, 2014. On December 18, 2014, the truck could therefore not go on the road and the load could not be picked up by the truck. Did Gilbert Dub\u00e9 dismiss Ms. Temple because she was at the hospital or because she had an injured thumb? Did Gilbert Dub\u00e9 dismiss her because she was a woman? The evidence does not allow me to answer in the affirmative. The fact that Ms. Temple was at the hospital did not affect the Company\u2019s decision to dismiss her. The Complainant could have been at a funeral, a family appointment or an activity with her son: the result would have been the same. December 18, 2014, was the breaking point and the point of no return in the professional relationship between the parties. The Company decided to end this relationship for many reasons, including performance, delays, a lack of communication and interpersonal problems. Sex and disability were not part of these factors.\nVII. Complaint not substantiated\n[106] The Tribunal understands that Ms. Temple could have felt under pressure from the Company and feared being dismissed, which resulted in stress and anxiety in her work on a day-to-day basis. The built-up frustrations, misunderstandings and communication problems merely aggravated the situation. These factors necessarily contributed to the Complainant\u2019s impression that the Company and its members differentiated adversely in relation to her. The Tribunal is also mindful of the fact that she was the only female truck operator at Horizon at the time of the events. It is true that Ms. Temple is working in a traditionally male environment. Discrimination is rarely direct or intentional. The Tribunal therefore has to search for the subtle scent of discrimination and assess the circumstances surrounding the impugned actions. The Tribunal is also bound by the evidence on file, and the decision must be made on the basis of the balance of probabilities. I do not believe that Ms. Temple\u2019s sex or disability played a part in the acts Horizon is accused of.\nVIII.

Both the Complainant and the Respondent are involved before a civil court in a matter closely related to the matter before this Tribunal.\n[4] No agreement as to a draft confidentiality order was reached, and on August 18, 2017, the date I had set for the Respondent to disclose the Manulife Agreement, the Respondent filed a motion for a confidentiality order.\n[5] On September 6, 2017, we held a Case Management Conference Call (CMCC) to hear oral arguments from each party on that motion.\n[6] The Commission, although not participating at the hearing, did participate in the CMCC, but did not oppose the motion for a confidentiality order.\n[7] During the CMCC, Ms. Anita Shearer, Director, Total Rewards for the Respondent, and as such responsible for the application of the Manulife Agreement, was questioned by the Respondent\u2019s counsel on that document and its content. Both the Complainant and the Commission had an opportunity to ask Ms. Shearer questions.\n[8] Ms. Shearer confirmed that the Manulife Agreement, the subject of the motion for the confidentiality order, is a commercial agreement between Manulife and the Respondent, describing among other things the benefits of eligible employees. It contains confidential and sensitive financial and commercial information which, if disclosed to the public, would, according to Ms. Shearer, cause undue hardship to both the Respondent and Manulife.\n[9] Ms. Shearer also confirmed that the Manulife Agreement contains a confidentiality provision requiring the parties to keep some information confidential, and that public disclosure of such information would constitute a breach of the agreement.\n[10] The Complainant had a few questions for Ms. Shearer. Following one question from the Complainant, the Respondent\u2019s lawyer agreed to provide her with a copy of the Collective Agreement which sets out Compensation and Benefits. The Commission had no questions for Ms. Shearer.\n[11] Following Ms. Shearer\u2019s testimony, I heard oral submissions from Respondent\u2019s counsel.\n[12] I also heard the Complainant\u2019s submissions, but as the Complainant was unable to continue with the CMCC due to a scheduling conflict, I suggested and all parties agreed that the Complainant be able to file written submissions by September 13, 2017. As the Commission was not opposing the motion, it chose not to file any written arguments. The Respondent filed its reply to the Complainant\u2019s submissions on September 15, 2017.\nII. Analysis\n[13] Pursuant to s. 52 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA), the Tribunal has the ability, in certain prescribed circumstances, to make any order it considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the inquiry.\nA. Timing of the motion for a confidentiality order\n[14] The Complainant is raising the question of the timing of the motion submitted by the Respondent. She argues that the question of the confidentiality of the Manulife Agreement should only be raised during the hearing, in the event the document is actually used by the Complainant and presented to the Tribunal as evidence. I disagree with that argument.\n[15] The Respondent tried to obtain the Complainant\u2019s consent to its proposed confidentiality order when it sent her a draft of the order. It is only after not receiving any response from the Complainant, and because the deadline of August 18, 2017 \u2014 the deadline I had set for disclosing the Manulife Agreement \u2014 was fast approaching, that the Respondent chose to submit the motion to the Tribunal.\n[16] More importantly, I agree with this Tribunal\u2019s ruling in Eadie v. MTS Inc., 2013 CHRT 5 (Eadie) where it states at paragraph 12:\n[12] While I understand the Commission\u2019s position that the Tribunal can more appropriately address these confidentiality concerns as they arise in the course of the hearing, I am of the view that delineating the manner in which documents may be designated as confidential in an order will help the smooth progression of the proceedings.\n[17] I agree with the Respondent that it would be counter-intuitive to declare a document confidential during a hearing after it has been disclosed without any form of protection during the disclosure process.\n[18] I would even add that I would prefer declaring a document confidential during the disclosure process and changing its designation at the hearing \u2014 if an objection is raised and a convincing argument is made before me during the hearing \u2014 than the other way around. Ordering confidentiality is a reversible decision. Authorizing disclosure is less so.\n[19] For those reasons, I believe the motion for a confidentiality order is not premature and has been submitted in duly time by the Respondent.\nB. The designation of a document as being confidential\n[20] The Respondent\u2019s arguments for disclosure of the Manulife Agreement to be subject to a confidentiality order are based on the following grounds:\nTo prevent the breach of a contract between the Respondent and Manulife;\nTo prevent harm to both the Respondent and Manulife, as the document contains financial information which, if disclosed, would prejudice their competitive position; and\nTo minimize the risk of collateral use.\n[21] The Respondent has demonstrated, through the testimony of Ms. Shearer, that the Manulife Agreement contains financial information which, if disclosed, could prejudice the competitive position of Manulife. Her testimony has also established that the Manulife Agreement does contain a confidentiality provision requiring the parties to keep some information confidential, and that public disclosure of such information would constitute a breach of the agreement.\n[22] Those characteristics of the Manulife Agreement correspond to the categories established by this Tribunal in Eadie, supra, as to when a document can be designated confidential by a party. I refer here to paragraph 14 of the ruling:\n[14] [\u2026] if it falls into one of the following categories:\ni. Information that is a trade secret;\nii. Financial, commercial, scientific or technical information that is confidential and that is treated consistently in a confidential manner by the person who submitted it; or\niii. Information the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected\n1. To result in material financial loss or gain to any person;\n2. To prejudice the competitive position of any person; or\n3. To affect contractual or other negotiations of any person.\n[23] As such, the characteristics of the Manulife Agreement falls under s. 52(1)(c) of the CHRA, which gives the Tribunal the ability to declare a document confidential if \u201cthere is a real and substantial risk that the disclosure of personal or other matters will cause undue hardship to the persons involved such that the need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public\u201d.\nC. Implied undertaking of confidentiality\n[24] The Complainant is also arguing that a confidentiality order is not necessary and that the implied undertaking rule of confidentiality, which all parties are subjected to when documents are disclosed, is sufficient to protect the Manulife Agreement. She also seems to be asserting that the confidentiality order would deny her the use of counsel.\n[25] I disagree with the Complainant. After hearing the Respondent\u2019s witness and reading all the parties\u2019 submissions, I am of the view that the \u201cimplied undertaking rule\u201d would not be sufficient to protect the document from the risk of collateral use in another litigation matter or from the risk of disclosure to the public of confidential information contained therein. I note the remarks made by this Tribunal in Public Service Alliance of Canada (Local 70396) v. Canadian Museum of Civilization Corp., 2004 CHRT 38 at paragraph 12:\n[12] All parties agree that the \"implied undertaking rule\", applies to any documents or information disclosed by the Museum. The rationale for this rule is that a party to litigation should have the full right of disclosure and inspection of relevant information, including that which is confidential, as is necessary to dispose fairly of the case. However, a party cannot use this right of disclosure for any purpose collateral to the litigation. If there is a real risk of such use despite the undertaking, additional restrictions can be imposed on how the disclosed information can be used. (See Zellers Inc. v. Venta Investments Ltd. [1998] O.J. No. 2118, (O.C.J.); Reichmann v. Toronto Life Publishing Co. [1990], 44 C.P.C. (2d) 206, 207-210 (H.C.J.); Alberta (Treasury Branches) v. Leahy [2000] A.J. No. 993, pp. 54-55 (Q.B.).\n[Emphasis added]\n[26] Since there is another matter involving the Complainant and the Respondent before a civil court, it is important that both matters proceed under their respective, separate rules of disclosure. This means that if the Manulife Agreement is sought by the Complainant in the other file, she should make a request for it pursuant to the disclosure rules of that civil court.\n[27] Finally, I am of the opinion that the confidentiality order would not deny her the use of counsel, as it would not prevent disclosure to the lawyer she has retained for the hearing of this matter.\nIII. Conclusion\n[28] I am satisfied that the Respondent has established a real and substantial risk of undue hardship under s. 52(1)(c) of the CHRA if the document is disclosed without any form of confidentiality protection, such that the need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public.\n[29] I order that the Manulife Agreement be designated as confidential as per s. 52 of the CHRA, with the following rules:\nthat the Respondent shall disclose the Manulife Agreement to the Complainant and Commission, and their respective counsels on or before October 11, 2017;\nthat the Complainant and the Commission shall not disclose the Manulife Agreement to any other person, without prior consent from this Tribunal;\nthat the confidential designation of the Manulife Agreement continues in effect until the Tribunal orders otherwise, including for the duration of all Tribunal proceedings, related judicial review and appeals, and after final judgment therein;\nthat a party wishing to use the Manulife Agreement during the hearing should advise the Tribunal in advance and the Tribunal may then decide, at its discretion under s. 52 of the CHRA, to pursue the discussion in camera;\nthat the Complainant must return the Manulife Agreement to the Respondent at the final disposition of this matter, once all judicial review and appeal recourses have been exhausted;\nthat the Commission, as a government institution, will preserve the confidential nature of the Manulife Agreement in accordance with applicable governmental policies and directives on the conservation and safeguard of confidential proprietary information.Alternatively, the Commission may return the Manulife Agreement to the Respondent on the same terms as the Complainant;\nfinally, that the Manulife Agreement, and any other confidential documents in the Tribunal's possession shall be sealed in accordance with Tribunal practice, and shall not be disclosed to any person.\nIV. Request for disclosure of other documents\n[30] The Complainant\u2019s written objections to the confidentiality order also include a request for disclosure of other documents which have not been requested before.\n[31] The first three documents are documents referred to by the Respondent\u2019s witness, Anita Shearer, during the CMCC, as separate from the Manulife Agreement (the Master Agreement), but still part of it. They were referred to as ASO plans by Ms. Shearer and covered 1) Non-union health and dental benefit entitlements; 2) Insured plans and 3) Long Term disability plans.\n[32] According to Ms. Shearer\u2019s testimony, the other documents are two stand-alone documents, entitled \u201cBenefits at a glance\u201d for unionized employees, and \u201cFlex Benefits at a glance\u201d for non-unionized employees.\n[33] Although those five documents should have been requested by the Complainant through a separate request for additional disclosure, in the interests of an expeditious inquiry, and having regard to the Respondent\u2019s alternative argument, I am granting the Complainant\u2019s request, but I order that disclosure be subject to the same conditions as stated above for the Manulife Agreement.\nV. Additional time for the complainant to file her reply\n[34] The Complainant is requesting additional time to file her reply Statement of Particulars. I am granting the Complainant\u2019s request and giving her until November 10, 2017 to do so.\nSigned by\nAnie Perrault\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nOctober 4, 2017\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT2126\/4215\nStyle of Cause:\nNicole Grace Valenti v.

The Complaint 1\nII. The Facts 2\nIII. The Argument 4\nIV. The Decision 7\nI. The Complaint\n[1] The Complaint is brought against the Canadian Armed Forces (\u201cCAF\u201d or \u201cRespondent\u201d) for reason of its policy that psychiatrists employed by the CAF, be certified as specialists with the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (\u201cRCPSC\u201d), alleging it is a discriminatory practice on the part of the CAF. The Complainant, Dr. Arthur Keith relies on section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985 c H-6. (the \u201cAct\u201d or \u201cCHRA\u201d) and alleges that he was discriminated against, on the grounds of national origin.\n[2] The Complainant is an American-born physician receiving all of his medical training and specialty training in psychiatry in the United States of America (\u201cU.S.\u201d).\n[3] The Complainant alleges that this hiring policy of the CAF precludes members of fully qualified specialists of non-Canadian origin from being considered for employment, and subjects the Complainant to discriminatory exclusion from employment opportunities, and therefore, discrimination having an adverse effect.\n[4] The Respondent\u2019s position is that by adopting the RCPSC standard, the CAF ensures that its psychiatrists meet a nationwide recognized standard for proficiency in psychiatry, and is therefore a bona fide occupational requirement (\u201cBFOR\u201d) and denies that this requirement is discriminatory.\n[5] The Complainant argued that the CAF adopted a hiring standard (fellowship in RCPSC) that leads to discrimination under the CHRA.\n[6] If there is no prima facie evidence of direct or adverse effect discrimination by the federally regulated employer, the matter need not be investigated further. [1]\nII. The Facts\n[7] The Complainant, Dr. Arthur Keith a U.S. citizen received his medical training in the U.S., firstly as a general practitioner and subsequently as a qualified psychiatrist in the U.S. on the completion of his Residency program in 1983. [2]\n[8] Dr. Keith, born in 1950, had an impressive U.S. military career serving as a member of the U.S. Army Special Forces. Later he attended medical school receiving a medical school scholarship from the U.S. Air Force (\u201cUSAF\u201d).\n[9] He was a physician with the USAF in various capacities from 1979 to 1986, having completed his residency in psychiatry in 1983. He was voluntary certified as a specialist in psychiatry in 1987, with the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (\u201cABPN\u201d). [3]\n[10] While residing in the U.S., in 1989, Dr. Keith sought Canadian recognition as a specialist in psychiatry from the RCPSC.\n[11] At the time of seeking this RCPSC recognition, he had not moved to Canada, nor had he sought employment with the CAF.\n[12] After reviewing the Complainant\u2019s credentials and recognizing most of his American training, the RCPSC determined to meet its recognition, Dr. Keith needed only to take and pass a written examination, complete a six month residency in child psychiatry and pass an oral examination in psychiatry.\n[13] The Complainant\u2019s evidence was that the certification process by the ABPN and the RCPSC was similar, consisting of a written and oral examination both of which were \u201cvirtually identical, with not substantial differences\u201d.\n[14] In 1990, Dr. Keith undertook the written examination administered by the RCPSC, but he was unsuccessful. He subsequently passed the written examination in 1992. However he was unsuccessful with the oral examinations, on three separate occasions, the last being in 1993. After the third failed attempt, his eligibility for the examination had expired.\n[15] To complete the oral exams a further time, would require an application to the Credentials Committee of the RCPSC for a renewal of eligibility. Dr. Keith declined to make that application.\n[16] At the time of Dr. Keith\u2019s complaint, all physicians, regardless of their national origin or training, to obtain specialist accreditation, were required to take standard examinations set by the RCPSC.\n[17] Dr. Keith having moved to Ontario in 2004, sought certification by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (\u201cCPSO\u201d), which was then providing certificate designation for specialists for those qualified by the CPSO, but not RCPSC so designated. While CPSO designation was recognized in many Provinces, it was not uniformly recognized across Canada, unlike certification by RCPSC. In 2007, CPSO granted Dr. Keith recognition as a specialist in psychiatry.\n[18] The CPSO specialist status is not equivalent to a fellowship with the RCPSC. The CPSO register provides doctor-specific information about physicians in Ontario, including whether the physician is a specialist and the body that accredited the physician\u2019s specialty.\n[19] At all material times, the health services for the CAF (DND) was provided by Calian Ltd., which as an independent third party, advertises and recruits physicians for various locations and positions as required by the CAF.\n[20] The standards for candidates hired by Calian Ltd. were set by the CAF.\n[21] As requested by the CAF, Calian Ltd. advertised for psychiatrists for the CAF bases in Cold Lake, Alberta and in Petawawa, Ontario. It indicated that a mandatory requirement for either position was RCPSC certification.\n[22] In 2008, notwithstanding knowing of the RCPSC certification requirement, the Complainant applied to Calian Ltd., for psychiatry positions at either location and submitted his formal application for the Petawawa position.\n[23] Calian Ltd. was subsequently advised by CAF that RCPSC certification was a requirement for the psychiatric positions on CAF bases and as a result the Complainant\u2019s application did not proceed.\n[24] In 2005, CPSO commenced a process to recognize specialists on a \u201cpractice based assessment\u201d, (the \u201celigibility route\u201d) for those foreign trained specialists who had practiced their specialty for a number of years. This method of qualifying specialists in Ontario is not standard in all ten Provinces of Canada.\n[25] While the RCPSC adopted the practice eligibility route in 2011, as an alternative to the examination route, it was not available to RCPSC certification when Dr. Keith applied, then only using the examination route.\nIII. The Argument\n[26] The complaint is brought under section 7(b) of the CHRA which states:\n7. It is a discriminatory practice directly or indirectly\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ and individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to any employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[27] Section 3(1) of the CHRA states that national or ethnic origin is a proscribed ground of discrimination. Having been born and educated in the U.S., equating place of education with national origin.\n[28] Dr. Keith alleges discrimination contrary to the protection of the CHRA on the basis of the CAF\u2019s refusal to assess his application for two psychiatric positions in Petawawa and or Cold Lake Alberta, for reasons that CAF require certification by the RCPSC as a fundamental requirement. This requirement disadvantages foreign trained doctors where by foreign education is often an accepted extension of national origin. Bitonti v. College of Physicians & Surgeons of British Columbia [1999] B.C.H.R.T.D. No. 60 (\u201cBitonti\u201d).\n[29] Relying on the jurisprudence which has held that place of education is equivalent to or an extension of place of origin, Dr. Keith claims that a prima facie case of discrimination has been established.\n[30] The Respondent relies upon section 15(1)(a) of the CHRA on the basis that the certification by the RCPSC is a BFOR of the CAF; and pursuant to section 15(2), to accommodate the requirement of Dr. Keith would impose an undue hardship on the CAF as it is not qualified to determine the equivalency of the certification by the CPSO with that of the RCPSC.\n[31] Both the Complainant and Respondent refer to the leading case of Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61 (\u201cMoore\u201d) as the test for prima facie discrimination.\n[32] Moore provided, at paragraph 33, that to demonstrate prima facie discrimination, complainants are required to show that they have a characteristic protected from discrimination under the CHRA, in that:\n[33]\u2026 they have experienced an adverse impact with respect to the service; and the protected characteristic was a factor in the adverse impact. Once a prima facie case has been established, the burden of proof shifts to the Respondent to justify the conduct or practice within the framework of the exemptions available under the human rights statutes. If it cannot be justified, discrimination will be found to occur.\n[33] The Complainant states that being born in the U.S. and having obtained his medical degree and psychiatric speciality in the U.S., meet the first test for prima facie discrimination relying on the case of Bitonti, supra.\n[34] The Respondent\u2019s position that the place of training may be a proxy for \u201cplace of origin\u201d, can be relied upon only when the circumstances where more onerous certification or licensing requirements are imposed based on a negative assumptions about an individual\u2019s place or origin, citing Fazil v. National Dental Examining Board of Canada, 2014 HRTO 1326 (\u2018Fazil\u201d) at paragraphs 39 \u2013 40.\n[35] The Respondent\u2019s position is that Bitonti must be read with the decision in Gould v. Yukon Order of Pioneers [1996] 1 SCR 571 (\u201cGould\u201d). Place of origin to include place of education is too liberal an interpretation. The Court stated that such a broad interpretation would amount to rewriting the Act.\n[36] Dr. Keith argued that American trained doctors are at a disadvantage in writing the RCPSC and American trained doctors are overwhelmingly American by birth, discrimination is effected by national origin.\n[37] The Respondent argued that \u201ccommon sense also dictates that place of training cannot be automatically equivalent to \u201cnational origin\u201d.\u201d The Respondent stated that had the Complainant chosen to complete his medical education in Canada, would his \u201cnational origin\u201d then become \u201cCanadian\u201d? Place of education and national origin cannot automatically be a proxy for the other.\n[38] The Complainant argued that his American credentials placed him at a disadvantage and therefore discriminatory. The Executive Director of the RCPSC on cross \u2013 examination by the Complainant\u2019s able Counsel, stated that attending a Canadian Medical School was \u201cone of the best mechanisms\u201d to prepare for the RCPSC examinations. But that does not by implication devalue the Complainant\u2019s American education.\n[39] The Respondent argued that Dr. Keith\u2019s American education did not put him in a disadvantage to Canadian trained doctors, referred to decision in Keith v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario [2013], OHRTD No. 1646 (\u201cKeith-CPSO\u201d), wherein the Complainant unsuccessfully challenged the CPSO\u2019s distinction on its website between CPSO and RCPSC specialist as discriminatory based on place of origin because most CPSO specialist are foreign born. The Ontario Human Rights Tribunal (\u201cOHRT\u201d) found that American credentials are on occasion valued higher if not on par with Canadian credentials.\n[40] The Respondent led evidence that over 90 per cent of specialists in Ontario are RCPSC certified even if they are foreign born or foreign trained.\nIV. The Decision\n[41] As required under the CHRA, the Complainant must first make a prima facie case of discrimination under the grounds enumerated under the Act, that the CAF requirement of RCPSC certification is a prima facie case of adverse effect discrimination.\n[42] The recent decision of Mihaly v. The Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta, 2016 ABQB 61 (\u201cMihaly\u201d) stated at paragraph 73:\nUnder the Moore test, establishing a prima facie case of adverse effect discrimination requires complainants to show that they have a characteristic that is protected from discrimination; that they experienced an adverse impact, and that the protected characteristic was a factor in the adverse impact.\n[43] Dr. Keith\u2019s American birth, born outside of Canada, could therefore argue that being foreign born and therefore his place of origin is a prohibited ground of discrimination. Discrimination on the grounds of place of origin is prohibited under the CHRA. Dr. Keith argued that his U.S. medical education is an accepted extension of \u201cplace of origin\u201d.\n[44] I do agree that one\u2019s place of origin, may well serve as an appropriate ground for finding discrimination in the work force and in society as a whole, and therefore an appropriate prohibition under the CHRA. However, I do not subscribe to the theory that merely born and educated outside of Canada leads to discrimination having an adverse impact and therefore automatically protected under the CHRA.\n[45] While the extension of \u201cplace of origin\u201d to include place of foreign education may be appropriate in some circumstances, such as educational degrees from some third world universities. I agree that automatic extension of the definition of \u201cplace of origin\u201d was not the intention of Bitonti, and the finding expressed in Fazil is the proper interpretation. There was no evidence before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (\u201cTribunal\u201d) that RCPSC certification process was more onerous due to Dr. Keith\u2019s American birth and education.\n[46] I subscribe to the opinion expressed in Grover v. Alberta (Human Rights Commission), [1996] AJ No. 667 (Alta QB) and affirmed [1968] AJ No 924 (Alta CA) in discussing origin of education as an extension of \u201cplace of origin\u201d, the Court stated at paragraphs 47- 48 that \u201cit must give a fair, liberal but faithful interpretation to the phrase \u201cplace of origin\u201d. That phrase \u2011 place of origin of a person \u2013 cannot be stretched to include the place where a person received their PhD degree\u201d.\n[47] I do not accept that the policy of the CAF requiring RCPSC certification was based on discriminatory assumptions and no evidence was provided to the Tribunal that Dr. Keith\u2019s ABPN certification was inferior to RCPSC certification and therefore creating the extension of \u201cplace of origin\u201d with \u201cplace of education\u201d. Dr. Keith argued that they were substantially similar.\n[48] Further if place of training is to serve as a proxy for place of origin, then the emphasis, must be on the place of training to extend the place of origin to include place of training. No evidence was advanced by the Complainant that American trained physicians are substantially of American origin, therefore equating American trained as therefore American origin or therefore foreign trained.\n[49] I find the Mihaly case most helpful, in the case before me. Mr. Mihaly was born and educated in the former Czechoslovakia. He obtained a M.Sc. Diploma with a specialization in Technology of Fuels and Thermal Energy from the Slovak Technical University, in Bratislava; and a further Certificate in Corrosion Engineering from the Institute of Chemical Technology in Prague in 1981 (Mihaly at paragraph 40).\n[50] After immigrating to Canada, Mr. Mihaly applied to the Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta (\u201cAPEGA\u201d), and notwithstanding his high level of education, he was required to write the National Professional Practice Exam (\u201cNPPE\u201d). Similar to Dr. Keith, he failed the exams on three occasions, filing a complaint with the Alberta Human Rights Commission pursuant to the Alberta Human Rights Act, RSA 299, c A-35.5 alleging that the APEGA discriminated against him based on his place of origin when it denied him registration as a professional engineer.\n[51] The CAF required all medical applicants to pass and acquire the RCPSC credentials. Similar to Mihaly, the Complainant did not provide any compelling evidence that his national origin was a factor in any disadvantage that he may have had obtaining RCPSC certification.\n[52] The Court in Mihaly stated at paragraph 106:\nThere was no finding and no basis for a finding that the requirement to pass the NPPE constituted adverse discrimination. The NPPE is required of all applicants wherever they were educated. While there was evidence that Mr. Mihaly failed this examination three times, there was no evidence that this was in any way related to his place of origin. There was, for example, no evidence that the requirement to take the NPPE disproportionately excludes foreign engineering graduates from registration with the APEGA.\n[53] Whether Canadian born or foreign born, the CAF required all doctors to be certified by the RCPSC. The Respondent Counsel correctly, in my view, stated that there was no evidence that the requirement to take the RCPSC certification was in any way related to place of origin. Whether he was Canadian, American or other, CAF required the same qualification.\n[54] I found no compelling evidence that Dr. Keith was treated differentially as a result of his educational qualifications from any other party as a result of being American. I do not find that his place of origin resulted in an adverse effect on his ability to pass the requirements of the RCPSC.\n[55] I do not find any compelling reasons for a basis for a finding that the requirements to pass the RCPSC, constituted adverse discrimination on the part of the CAF. As in Mihaly at paragraph 106, \u201cwhile there was evidence that Mr. Mihaly failed the [the NPPE] examination three times, there was no evidence that this was related to his place of origin\u201d.\n[56] The evidence of Dr. Jeffrey Reitz, accepted as an expert witness on behalf of the Complainant provided evidence as to the differential treatment of immigrants and ethnic minorities. However his research was based on visible minorities and did not provide any substantial evidence as to education and place of origin for white American born and American trained physicians. His evidence was accepted that immigrants with foreign credentials are often discriminated against in favour of Canadian trained applicants.\n[57] Dr. Keith by his own accepted evidence was highly trained in his medical education and will accomplish in his other endeavours. By his own admission, he believed his American accreditation was equal to if not superior to Canadian medical education.\n[58] I find that Dr. Reitz\u2019s evidence was not persuasive to advance the Complainant\u2019s allegation of discrimination based on his foreign birth and by extension, his education. One cannot automatically apply the principal that foreign education is an extension of foreign birth. It is not absolute; otherwise it would also be a separate heading for discrimination under the CHRA. While the Tribunal has wide discretion in interpretation, it is entitled to limit what otherwise might apply in a case of dissimilar facts.\n[59] The Complainant is unsuccessful in establishing that the CAF\u2019s requirement of RCPSC certification is discriminatory against foreign born and trained. I accept the Respondent\u2019s evidence produced by the National Physicians\u2019 Survey administered by the Canadian Medical Association, which found that most specialists in Ontario are RCPSC certified to the extent that 99.2% of Ontario specialists who are born outside Canada are RCPSC certified.\n[60] Similarly I do not accept that the CAF\u2019s insistence on RCPSC certification is discriminatory, as it is equivalent to CPSO credentials. I accept the evidence of Mr. Dan Faulkner and Dr. Harris, as both the RCPSC and CPSO view the credentials differently. The RCPSC is recognized as a national standard, recognized across Canada.\n[61] The CAF\u2019s reliance on RCPSC credentials results in a standard to which it can rely across Canada. The Complainant argued that CPSO was equivalent. There was no credible evidence to this effect. While CPSO specialty accreditation is accepted in some of the Canadian Provinces but not all, no evidence was provided that it was accepted by the Province of Alberta. Dr. Ken Harris, Executive Director of the RCPSC testified that specialty certification is a national standard applicable in all provinces and is also accepted by all Provincial Colleges as having met the standard for specialty designation.\n[62] The OHRT found that the CPSO and RCPSC are not equivalent while the RCPSC develops national standards and the CPSO deals with licensing to practice medicine in Ontario. Keith-CPSO, supra, at paragraphs 46, 49 & 50.\n[63] I also accept that RCPSC is a BFOR. The Respondent referred to the three step test by the Supreme Court of Canada in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, 1999 CanLII 652 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 (\u201cMeiorin\u201d) at paragraph 54 to establish that an occupational requirement is bona fide:\n[\u2026]\n(1) that the employer adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job.\n(2) that the employer adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfilment of that legitimate work related purpose, and;\n(3) that the standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that legitimate work-related purpose. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, it must be demonstrated that it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship upon the employer.\n[64] I accept that it would be an unduly hardship on the CAF to be required to determine the qualifications of all of its medical practitioners. I accept the plain explanation of Colonel MacKay when he stated:\nBefore 2009, not all the provinces in this country would recognize the licence and certification from one province to another. If all of the provinces can\u2019t come to an agreement with respect to the certification process within each of those provinces hat level of confidences can I have in the process that was undertaken to certify them within that province? The Royal College of Canada\u2019s certification was recognized by every province at that time as it is today as an acceptable standard to assure high quality of care to be provided by health care providers.\n[65] As I find that the CAF did not discriminate against Dr. Keith within the requirements of the CHRA, having met the test set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Meiorin, and to suggest otherwise would place an undue hardship on the CAF and the health and standards of its employees.\n[66] As I find further that the Complainant has failed to establish that he has been the subject of discrimination under the CHRA, I need not address his claim for compensation.\n[67] For these reasons, I find that the complaint is not substantiated.\nSigned by\nRonald Sydney Williams\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nOctober 19, 2017\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT1981\/6113\nStyle of Cause:\nArthur Lee Keith v.

If this question is answered in the affirmative, should the Tribunal order their disclosure despite the Complainant\u2019s privacy concerns? 11\nI. Background\n[1] Canada Revenue Agency (Respondent) filed a motion pursuant to Rule 3 of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) (Rules) seeking an order to compel Ms. Pamela Egan (Complainant) to consent to the Respondent\u2019s use of confidential information for the purposes of the inquiry before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (Tribunal). The confidential information is contained in the Complainant\u2019s Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) and Workplace Safety and Insurance Appeals Tribunal (WSIAT) files and relates to a 2009 workplace injury, which the Complainant attributes to the Respondent\u2019s alleged failure to accommodate.\n[2] The Respondent is also seeking an order from the Tribunal that the Complainant produce a list of all health care professionals she has attended for reasons of symptoms or treatment for her visual impairment, chronic pain and psycho traumatic disability (post-traumatic stress disorder and depression) or any other health problems for which she is attributing blame to the Respondent, and that she produce to the parties any arguably relevant medical documents in her possession or that come into her possession during the course of this inquiry.\n[3] During a Case Management Conference Call (CMCC) held on September 6, 2017, the Respondent stated that the disclosure of medical documents it seeks related to the Complainant\u2019s visual impairment from late 2000. This covers the time period from just before the Complainant returned to work after two years off following a non-workplace injury. That injury eventually led to her complaint in this matter in May of 2003, alleging that the Respondent had discriminated against her by failing to accommodate her visual impairment and chronic pain.\n[4] The parties each filed and exchanged submissions for this motion including a Reply submission from the Respondent. During the CMCC held on September 6, 2017, the Tribunal asked the parties to clarify their positions on the issue of confidentiality. Following the Tribunal\u2019s questions, counsel for the Complainant requested additional time to review the issue and provide written submissions by way of a Sur-Reply as he had not raised this issue in his submissions. The Tribunal granted this request and allowed Respondent\u2019s counsel to file its own Sur-Reply to respond to the Complainant\u2019s further submissions.\nII. Facts\n[5] In June 1997, the Respondent hired the Complainant through an Employment Equity Initiative as an employee with a visual impairment.\n[6] In February 1999, the Complainant sustained injuries to her neck and upper back as a result of a fall off a ladder at home while she was on leave without pay. As a result, she was off work for two years. She returned to work on a gradual basis beginning January 29, 2001.\n[7] On May 21, 2003, the Complainant filed a human rights complaint against the Respondent alleging that it discriminated against her by failing to accommodate her visual impairment and chronic pain contrary to sections 7 and 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (Act).\n[8] The Complainant sustained a workplace injury in February 2009 that occurred as a result of her use of specialized equipment and she subsequently applied for worker\u2019s compensation benefits under the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 1997, S.O. 1997, c. 16, Sched. A (WSIA).\n[9] The WSIB granted the Complainant\u2019s entitlement under the claim. She was awarded lost time and other medical benefits for approximately 40 months from January 14, 2009 for her right elbow, right shoulder and neck conditions related to the workplace injury. In mid-2012, the WSIB ceased to provide these benefits to the Complainant.\n[10] The Complainant also sought entitlement from the WSIB for chronic pain disability and psycho traumatic disability (including post-traumatic stress disorder and depression), alleging that these disabilities developed as a direct result of her employment with the Respondent in its failure to provide accommodation. The WSIB denied entitlement to these disorders on the basis that they were pre-existing medical conditions and not compensable under the WSIA. This decision was appealed to the WSIAT.\n[11] In the course of the appeals process relating to the 2009 workplace injury, both the Respondent and Complainant received a full copy of the Complainant\u2019s WSIB\/WSIAT file. The file includes medical documentation not previously disclosed to the Respondent. The WSIAT also disclosed addenda containing updates to the WSIB\/WSIAT file. The WSIB\/WSIAT file and addenda are marked \u201cconfidential\u201d and to be used \u201c\u2026for Workplace Insurance Purposes Only\u201d.\n[12] The Respondent alleges that it was only through the appeals process before the WSIAT that it became aware that the Complainant suffered from various health conditions and had attributed the development of her chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression to the Respondent.\n[13] In the context of the present proceeding, the Complainant has given notice to the Tribunal that she intends to demonstrate that the Respondent\u2019s alleged failure to accommodate caused her to suffer chronic pain disability, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.\nIII. Position of the Parties\nA. Tribunal\u2019s authority to make an order compelling consent\n[14] The Respondent acknowledges that the Complainant had previously agreed to the use of some of the documents forming part of the WSIB\/WSIAT file, but she refuses to consent to the use of others for the purpose of the present inquiry. In her Response submissions, the Complainant had agreed to allow the Respondent to use additional documents in the WSIB\/WSIAT file that were requested by the Respondent. In its Reply submissions, the Respondent withdrew its request for several of the requested documents. However, the Complainant argues that the remaining documents in her WSIB\/WSIAT file ought not to be used (disputed documents). The disputed documents are identified in the Respondent's submissions as Documents 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 28 and 29 and are described therein.\n[15] The Respondent requests the Tribunal to make an order compelling the Complainant to consent to the use of the disputed documents for the purpose of the present proceedings. The Complainant questions the Tribunal\u2019s authority to issue an order compelling a party to consent to the use of confidential documents. The Respondent, in Reply, argues that subsection 48.9(1) and section 50 of the Act confer broad powers on the Tribunal including the power to make an order compelling the Complainant to consent to the use of confidential information. In the alternative, the Respondent submits, and the Complainant accedes, that the Tribunal has the power to order the Complainant to disclose and produce the disputed documents pursuant to paragraph 50(3)(a) of the Act and asks that if the Tribunal does not agree that it has the authority to compel the Complainant to consent to the use of the disputed documents that it order the Complainant to disclose the disputed documents.\nB. Disputed Documents\n[16] The Respondent argues that the disputed documents ought to be disclosed because they are highly relevant to the present inquiry since the Complainant has put her 2009 workplace injury at issue. Notably, the Complainant alleges that she suffers chronic pain disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression as a direct result of the Respondent\u2019s alleged failure to accommodate. Thus, the Respondent argues that there is a nexus between the documents and matters at issue in the current proceedings.\n[17] The Respondent also argues that some of the disputed documents are arguably relevant for the Tribunal\u2019s assessment not only of liability but also of remedies in order to avoid the potential of double recovery as the Complainant received amounts from the WSIB in connection with the 2009 workplace injury. The Respondent further argues that certain disputed documents are arguably relevant as they are necessary for the Respondent to put forward its case that the Complainant has not been fully cooperative in providing relevant information to the Respondent for the purposes of accommodation. Finally, the Respondent argues that some of the documents are relevant to demonstrate the challenges that it has faced in relation to the use of health records, including information related to injuries and illnesses previously not disclosed and which the Complainant attributes to the Respondent's failure to accommodate.\n[18] The Complainant submits that the rules of disclosure do not justify the blanket disclosure of the entire contents of the WSIB\/ WSIAT files. She argues that the Respondent has not justified the request for disclosure of the disputed documents with sufficient particularity. In any event, she contests the disclosure of the disputed documents on the grounds that they are not arguably relevant. She further submits that some of the disputed documents are merely internal WSIB and WSIAT forms with no substantive content, while others constitute correspondence between the parties and the WSIB and WSIAT, which relate solely to administrative or procedural matters and have no substantive content related to the issues of liability or remedy. Further, the Complainant argues that the addenda are not arguably relevant because they do not contain any medical or substantive information related to the appeals. Instead, they contain correspondence related to procedural issues in the WSIAT proceeding.\n[19] The Tribunal notes that the Complainant does not contest the use of the disputed documents on any ground related to confidentiality.\nC. Medical Documents\n[20] The Complainant does not object to the Respondent's request for a list of health care professionals who have treated her for chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression. She also agrees to produce all arguably relevant medical documentation in her possession in relation to those conditions.\n[21] However, the Complainant argues that there is no basis for her to provide a list of professionals that have treated her visual impairment, or to produce medical information in relation to her visual impairment (medical documents). She argues that this information is not arguably relevant because the Complainant does not allege that the Respondent's failure to accommodate caused her visual impairment. In essence, the Complainant argues that her visual impairment is not at issue and that the disclosure request represents a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d.\n[22] In response, the Respondent argues that the medical documents are highly relevant as her impairment is at the heart of the human rights complaint and inquiry. In effect, the Respondent\u2019s position is that the complaint rests on the allegation that the Respondent refused to accommodate the Complainant\u2019s visual impairment.\nD. Complainant\u2019s Privacy Interest\n[23] In addition to the arguable relevance argument, the Complainant alleges for the first time in her Sur-Reply that her privacy interest in her medical information, especially information related to her visual impairment, outweighs the Respondent\u2019s interest in disclosure and that production would cause her an undue prejudice.\n[24] While the Complainant does not explain how disclosure would negatively affect her right to privacy to the point of causing an undue prejudice, the Complainant submits that the Tribunal ought to consider undue prejudice in deciding whether the medical information requested ought to be disclosed in accordance with a five-fold test set out in an Ontario labour arbitration decision, West Park Hospital v. Ontario Nurses' Assn. (1993), 37 L.A.C. (4th) 160 (West Park Hospital).\n[25] The Complainant also alleges in her Sur-Reply that in deciding the issue, the Tribunal ought to consider the Personal Health Information Protection Act, SO 2004, c. 3, schedule A (PHIPA). In effect, the Complainant contends that her physicians are bound by the privacy provisions in PHIPA and would not be able to disclose the requested medical information in any event as the Respondent\u2019s disclosure request oversteps the provisions in PHIPA.\n[26] The Respondent submits in its Sur-Reply that the disclosure of the medical documentation is necessary for the Tribunal to ascertain the extent of the Complainant\u2019s visual impairment, her accommodation needs and whether the Complainant communicated her needs to the Respondent for the purposes of accommodation. It argues that any privacy interests were thus waived by the Complainant when she put her visual impairment at issue.\n[27] Additionally, the Respondent submits in its Sur-Reply that neither PHIPA nor the five-step test set out in West Park Hospital is applicable in this case. In effect, PHIPA provides that it does not apply to the power of a tribunal to compel the production of documents. Regarding West Park Hospital, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal ought to apply its own three-step test that it has developed for disclosure requests.\nIV. Issues\n[28] The issues to be determined in this Ruling are as follows:\nDoes the Tribunal have the authority to make an order compelling the Complainant to consent to the Respondent\u2019s use of the Complainant\u2019s WSIB\/WSIAT file in the course of the present proceedings?\nAre the disputed documents arguably relevant to the present proceedings?\nAre a list of all health care professionals attended by the Complainant for her visual impairment and production of related medical documents in her possession since the year 2000 arguably relevant?If this question is answered in the affirmative, should the Tribunal order their disclosure despite the Complainant\u2019s privacy concerns?\nV. Applicable Legal Principles\n[29] The right to a fair hearing requires that the \u201c...affected person be informed of the case against him or her, and be permitted to respond to that case. (see Charkaoui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 SCC 9 at para. 53; Leslie Palm v. International Longshore and Warehouse Union et al., 2012 CHRT 11 at paras. 9-11 (Palm)).\n[30] Subsection 50(1) of the Act provides that the parties before the Tribunal must be given a full and ample opportunity to present their case. This right includes the disclosure of arguably relevant evidence between the parties (see Grand Chief Stan Louttit in a representative capacity on behalf of the First Nations of Mushkegowuk Council and Grand Chief Stan Louttit in his personal capacity v. Attorney General of Canada Ruling, 2013 CHRT 3 at para. 10). Along with the facts and issues presented by the parties, the disclosure of information allows each party to know the case they must meet and be adequately prepared for the hearing (see Guay v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2004 CHRT 34 at para. 40 (Guay); Almalki v. Air Canada, 2016 CHRT 3 at para. 11 (Almalki)).\n[31] Where a rational connection exists between a document and the facts, issues, or forms of relief identified by the parties in a matter, the information ought to be disclosed pursuant to paragraphs 6(1)(d) and 6(1)(e) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules (see Guay at para. 42; Rai v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2013 CHRT 6 at para. 28 (Rai); Almalki at para. 11). The burden of proving the rational connection rests with the moving party, but the threshold for the test of \u201carguable relevance\" is low and the jurisprudence has acknowledged that the tendency is towards more rather than less disclosure (see Warman v. Bahr, 2006 CHRT 18 at para. 6).\n[32] However, there are a few limits to this rule. Notably, pursuant to subsection 50(4) of the Act, the Tribunal cannot admit or accept as evidence any information that is privileged. Moreover, a request for disclosure must not be speculative or amount to a \"fishing expedition\" (see Guay at para. 43).\n[33] In addition, the disclosure of arguably relevant information does not mean that this information will be admitted in evidence or that significant weight will be afforded to it (see Telecommunications Employees Association of Manitoba Inc. v. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 CHRT 28 at para. 4).\n[34] Where medical documents are concerned, this Tribunal has held that where confidentiality or privacy is at issue, these interests are overridden by the respondent's right to \u201cknow the grounds and scope of the complaint against it\u201d (Guay at para. 45). As stated in Guay, \u201c[i]n human rights proceedings, justice requires that a respondent be permitted to present a complete defence to a Complainant's arguments. If a complainant bases the case on his\/her medical condition, a respondent is entitled to relevant health information that may be pertinent to the claim\u201d (see Guay at para. 45; see also Palm at para. 11).\nVI. Analysis and Rulings\nA. Issue i) Does the Tribunal have the authority to make an order compelling the Complainant to consent to the Respondent\u2019s use of the Complainant\u2019s WSIB\/WSIAT file in the course of the present proceedings?\n[35] In my opinion, the Tribunal does not possess the authority to make an order compelling the Complainant to consent to the use of the Complainant's WSIB\/WSIAT file in the course of the present proceedings.\n[36] The Tribunal is a creature of statute. As such, its powers are derived from and prescribed by the provisions of the Act. Nowhere in the Act, in my opinion, is there any authority given to the Tribunal to issue an order compelling a person to consent to anything, including to the use of confidential documents.\n[37] The sections of the Act cited by the Respondent as authority for the Tribunal to make such an order do not, in my opinion, provide such authority. Subsection 48.9(1) of the Act provides for the conduct of the hearing to be informal and expeditious. Subsection 50(1) of the Act provides for the inquiry to be conducted fairly.\n[38] The Tribunal understands that the parties rely on subsection 50(3) for disclosure and production in this case instead of subsection 50(1) as both parties are already in possession of the disputed documents. Subsection 50(3) of the Act provides members with certain specified additional powers in relation to a hearing of the inquiry. These powers do not include the power to compel a party to provide consent to use documents. However, the Tribunal does have the power under paragraph 50(3)(a) of the Act to order the Complainant to disclose and produce the disputed documents at the hearing, provided that they are arguably relevant to the present proceedings.\nB. Issue ii) Are the disputed documents arguably relevant to the present proceedings?\n[39] In my opinion, the disputed documents which are in the WSIB\/WSIAT files concerning the 2009 workplace injury are arguably relevant to the present proceedings and are hereby ordered to be produced pursuant to paragraph 50(3)(a) of the Act.\n[40] As noted above, the jurisprudence for determining disclosure requests generally relies on the following criteria:\nPursuant to section 50(1) of the Act, parties before the Tribunal must be given a full and ample opportunity to present their case.\nTo be given this opportunity, parties require, among other things, the disclosure of arguably relevant information in the possession and care of the opposing party prior to the hearing of the matter.\nAlong with the facts and issues presented by the parties, the disclosure of documents allows each party to know the case they are up against and, therefore, adequately prepare for the hearing.\nFor that reason, if there is a rational connection or nexus between a document and the facts, issues or forms of relief identified by the parties in the matter, the document should be disclosed pursuant to sections 6(1)(d) and 6(1)(e) of the Rules.\nThe party seeking the disclosure must demonstrate that the nexus exists and the documents are probative and be arguably relevant to an issue in the hearing, which is not a particularly high standard.\nThe request for disclosure must not be speculative or amount to a \"fishing expedition\".The documents should be identified with reasonable particularity.\nThe disclosure of arguably relevant documents does not mean that this information will be admitted in evidence at the hearing of the matter or that significant weight will be afforded to it in the decision-making process.\n[41] The Complainant has put the 2009 workplace injury at issue in this inquiry in alleging that it is a direct result of the Respondent's failure to accommodate and that the workplace injury is relevant to both liability and remedy in this inquiry. The Complainant has been attempting, through the WSIB\/WSIAT process, to have it recognized that she developed chronic pain, depression, anxiety and post \u2013traumatic stress disorder as a result of the Respondent's failure to accommodate. But for the WSIB\/WSIAT process which resulted in the Respondent receiving the files from these agencies, it would not have become aware of certain elements of the Complainant's situation that may be relevant to this inquiry. In particular, whether medical issues unknown to the Respondent contributed to the delay in providing accommodation.\n[42] It is the Tribunal\u2019s view that the Respondent adequately particularized the disputed documents at paragraphs 12, 13 and 14 of its Reply submissions for the purposes of establishing the necessary nexus to satisfy the onus of proving that they are arguably relevant to the issues in this proceeding with respect to both liability and remedies. As such, procedural fairness requires use of the disputed documents to provide the Respondent with a fair opportunity to make its case.\nC. Issue iii) Are a list of all health care professionals attended by the Complainant for her visual impairment and production of related medical documents in her possession since the year 2000 arguably relevant? If this question is answered in the affirmative, should the Tribunal order their disclosure despite the Complainant\u2019s privacy concerns?\n[43] First, it must be noted that pursuant to section 6 of the Rules, a party\u2019s obligation to disclose is limited to documents that are \u201cin the party\u2019s possession\u201d (see also Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 42 at para. 17). Thus, in the absence of evidence that a list of health care professionals that attended to the Complainant\u2019s visual impairment already exists, the Respondent\u2019s request is denied.\n[44] Second, the Tribunal finds that the extent to which the Complainant\u2019s visual impairment required accommodation is directly in issue and essential for the effective resolution of this matter. The Tribunal notes the Complainant\u2019s assertion that her medical records extend for decades. This may be true, but the Respondent made precisions that it would require her medical documents from late 2000. The Tribunal finds that this request for disclosure is arguably relevant for the Respondent\u2019s defence that the Complainant refused to provide it with sufficient information about her limitations, which prevented it from providing the Complainant with accommodation in a timely manner. It therefore cannot be said that the request amounts to a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d or is not sufficiently particularized.\n[45] Finally, the Tribunal is of the view that the Complainant\u2019s right to privacy over the medical documents is not a bar to disclosure in this case.\n[46] Regarding the five-step disclosure test set out in West Park Hospital that the Complainant wishes the Tribunal to apply in this case, the Tribunal prefers to apply the case law it has developed with respect to disclosure. But for the \u201cundue prejudice\u201d criterion, the other criteria in the West Park Hospital test are already well established in the Tribunal\u2019s case law and have already been considered in the present ruling. Moreover, considering the arbitrator\u2019s comments at paragraph 20 in fine in West Park Hospital, it appears that the arbitrator considers that the \u201cundue prejudice\u201d criterion ought to be considered within the wider context of the Wigmore test. The Tribunal is reticent to recognize West Park Hospital as a governing authority on the law of privilege given the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in A.M. v. Ryan, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 157 (Ryan) (see notably paragraphs 24-38). In effect, the Wigmore test, as adopted in Ryan, is also consistently applied by the Tribunal (see for example Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada v. Bell Canada, 2003 CHRT 19 at para. 11; McAvinn v. Strait Crossing Bridge Ltd., 2001 CanLII 38296 (CHRT)). While the Wigmore test is dealt with in the following paragraph, the Tribunal has nonetheless considered \u201cundue prejudice\u201d as a standalone factor and finds that the Complainant\u2019s bald assertion is simply not enough to establish a prejudice to her right to privacy in this case.\n[47] It is well established at law that the party opposing disclosure has the burden of demonstrating that the documents should be privileged (R. v. National Post, 2010 SCC 16 at para. 60, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 477; see also R. v. Gruenke, [1991] 3 SCR 263 at 293). After a careful review of the Complainant\u2019s submissions, the Tribunal finds that the Complainant\u2019s submissions are silent on this issue. As such, the Complainant failed to meet her burden of proof. In any event, the Tribunal finds that by putting accommodation of her visual impairment at the center of the complaint, the Complainant has waived any right to privacy she may have had in the medical documents as they pertain to the diagnosis, prognosis and accommodation of her disability that would be necessary on a return to work (Guay at para. 45; Rai at para. 30; Palm v. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500, Richard Wilkinson and Cliff Willicome, 2013 CHRT 19 at paras. 44-45).\n[48] Furthermore, the Tribunal rejects the Complainant\u2019s submissions that such a disclosure order oversteps the provisions in PHIPA. Even if the Tribunal were to assume, without deciding, that PHIPA applies to federal bodies such as itself, subsection 9(2) of PHIPA provides that it does not interfere with the power of a tribunal to compel the production of documents. Thus, it is apparent that the Tribunal\u2019s disclosure order does not go beyond PHIPA\u2019s provisions.\n[49] Given the above, the Tribunal orders the disclosure of the medical documents as of December 31st, 2000. Again, the Tribunal reminds the parties that the disclosure order is subject to any objections going to admissibility raised at the hearing. In effect, pursuant to paragraph 50(3)(c) of the Act, the medical documents are not placed on the hearing record unless admitted into evidence.\n[50] Despite the Tribunal\u2019s ruling, the Tribunal is mindful of the Complainant\u2019s concerns as to the scope and use of the medical documents as stated in her Sur-Reply. If the Complainant\u2019s privacy concerns remain following this ruling, she may discuss this with the Tribunal so that the Tribunal can decide appropriate terms and conditions, if any, in order to protect the Complainant\u2019s privacy.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Background\n[1] The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) was convened to hear a motion by Tracy Polhill (the \u201cComplainant\u201d) to amend her complaint and initial Statement of Particulars filed in December 2015. Before considering this motion, the Tribunal deems it necessary to provide a brief summary of the background to the aforementioned motion.\n[2] On April 28, 2014, the Complainant filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) on the grounds that the Keeseekoowenin First Nation (Respondent, \u201cNation\u201d or \u201cKFN\u201d) had engaged in discriminatory practices based on race or national or ethnic origin, contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (\u201cCHRA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d)\n[3] On June 24, 2015, the Commission referred the complaint to the Tribunal for inquiry under section 44(3)(a) of the CHRA. The Commission is fully participating in the hearing.\n[4] The Complainant and the Commission filed their respective documentation in December 2015, including their Statements of Particulars. The Respondent, for its part, did not participate at any stage of the proceedings. Between January 24, 2016, and April 6, 2017, the Tribunal sent the Nation 22 items of correspondence with confirmation of receipt. The Nation did not respond to any of them.\n[5] That said, the hearing was nevertheless scheduled to be held over a period of four days, from April 25 to April 28, 2017, in Onanole, Manitoba. Without advising the Tribunal or the Registrar of its intentions, the Respondent attended on the first day of the hearing, represented by counsel. Counsel for the Respondent asked the Tribunal for a brief adjournment so that the parties could discuss a possible agreement. If they failed to reach an agreement, counsel would request an adjournment of the hearing to allow the Respondent to file its submissions. The parties informed the Tribunal that the minutes of settlement had been signed but that the settlement had to be approved by the Nation\u2019s band council. Considering the representations of the parties, the Tribunal adjourned the hearing.\n[6] On May 9, 2017, the Commission formally informed the Tribunal that ultimately, the agreement was not reached. The Tribunal therefore asked the parties to provide it with information on their availability over the coming months so that the hearing could resume as soon as possible. On June 12, 2017, the Complainant sent an email to the parties and the Tribunal, indicating her intention to amend her complaint and her Statement of Particulars of December 2015.\n[7] On June 13, 2017, a conference call took place, and the Complainant formally notified the Tribunal of her intention to amend her complaint and Statement of Particulars. The Tribunal therefore reached an agreement with the parties regarding the process to be followed. The Complainant was required to clearly highlight or underline all the amendments or additions to her Statement of Particulars. She was also required to indicate the reasons for requesting these amendments, notably by submitting a simple cover letter. Obviously, the Respondent and the Commission reserved the right to respond to these amendments or additions. On July 24, 2017, the Tribunal received the Complainant\u2019s amendments. The Respondent replied on August 10, 2017, and the Commission, on August 11, 2017.\n[8] That said, the Tribunal must rule on the Complainant\u2019s motion to amend.\nII. Positions of the parties\n[9] For the purposes of brevity and efficiency, the Tribunal will not repeat each and every one of the arguments submitted by the parties, but will summarize the main arguments as follows.\nA. The Complainant\n[10] In her amended Statement of Particulars, the Complainant made relatively significant changes to her initial complaint and Statement of Particulars. It is the Tribunal\u2019s view that these amendments fall into four categories.\n\u00b7 First, the Complainant alleges three new violations of the CHRA by the Nation, more specifically of sections 6(b), 14 and 14.1 of the CHRA.\no In her opinion, the resolution which the Band Council adopted against her deprived her of sources of income and forced her to leave the community and her husband\u2019s home. She was therefore subjected to adverse differential treatment by the Respondent in the provision of residential accommodation under section 6(b) of the CHRA.\no With respect to section 14 of the CHRA concerning harassment, the Complainant alleges that she was the subject of many forms of harassment by the Respondent, one of its agents or members of the community affiliated with the Respondent. She attributes the cause of this harassment to the Respondent\u2019s actions;\no Lastly, the Complainant claims that under section 14.1 of the CHRA, the Respondent engaged in acts of retaliation against her, her daughter and her husband, Wes Bone (who will also be a witness at the hearing). In the interest brevity, the Tribunal will not repeat all the details provided by the Complainant. She most notably alleges that:\n\u00a7 The Respondent intimidated her special needs daughter and engaged in actions intended to have an adverse effect on her finances;\n\u00a7 The Respondent, one of its agents or members of the community affiliated with the Respondent, intimidated and engaged in acts of retaliation and defamation against her husband via Facebook and email;\n\u00a7 The Respondent engaged in acts of retaliation against her and her partner in managing a flood in their home\u2019s basement, and in managing hay cutting around their home and the sweat lodge fire;\n\u00a7 The Respondent engaged in acts of retaliation by contacting the Royal Canadian Mountain Police (RCMP) about the management of her horses and did so in an effort to cause her prejudice;\n\u00a7 A few days after the hearing, the RCMP went to the Complainant\u2019s home to inform her that she was being accused of fraud. She alleges that someone had made false statements about her and attributes responsibility for this situation to the Respondent and its actions.\n\u00b7 Second, she seeks additional relief under section 53 of the CHRA for a number of additional discriminatory practices, most notably $20,000 for each violation of section 14.1 and $20,000 for the violation of section 6(b) of the CHRA. She is also asking for the amount of $20,000 under section 3(1) of the CHRA.\n\u00b7 Third, she alleges a multitude of new facts in support of her complaint. The vast majority of these facts are general in nature and provide a context for the basis of her complaint. These facts are summarized as follows:\no Details about her daughter\u2019s health and financial circumstances;\no Details about her relationship with Mr. Bone, her husband, their lifestyle and their relationship with the community;\no Details about Mr. Bone\u2019s ex-wife, Dianne Blackbird, and her actions against Ms. Polhill and Mr. Bone\u2019s other ex-partners;\no The adoption of the band council resolution at Ms. Blackbird\u2019s request with the assistance of Karen Blackbird and their attempts to disclose the content of the aforementioned resolution to the community;\no The discriminatory remarks that both of the Blackbirds made publicly against the Complainant.\n\u00b7 Lastly, she made two other changes to her Statement of Particulars concerning new applications for subpoenas and the modification to the summary of Wes Bone\u2019s testimony;\no The Complainant asks the Tribunal to subpoena Facebook or one of its departments for the purpose of revealing the true identity of the person who fraudulently opened an account in her husband\u2019s name;\no The Complainant asks the Tribunal to subpoena Google (Gmail) or one of its departments for the purpose of revealing the true identity of Brian Sharpe, the person who has been sending emails to her husband subjecting him to intimidation and retaliation;\no The Complainant asks the Tribunal to investigate the identity of the person who made false statements about her daughter to the BC Employment and Assistance Office in Abbotsford, British Columbia, in April 2017;\no With respect to the modifications to Wes Bone\u2019s testimony, she adds that the latter will also testify about the band council resolution; Dianne Blackbird, their relationship and her history; the intimidation and retaliation experienced via Facebook and email; the management of hay cutting around their house and the sweat lodge fire; and the traditional methods used to help and support the Complainant;\nB. The Respondent\n[11] In its response, the Respondent objected to any and all of the amendments, additions or modifications requested by the Complainant. The Tribunal can summarize the Respondent\u2019s representations as follows:\n\u00b7 The Respondent alleges that the Complainant did not respect the Tribunal\u2019s instructions and requirements, most notably by failing to highlight all the amendments made and particularly by failing to justify their addition;\n\u00b7 The Respondent alleges that the Complainant\u2019s statements keep changing over time;\n\u00b7 The Respondent alleges that the Complainant did not provide the list of documents in support of her application and did not forward the documents in her possession;\n\u00b7 With respect to the allegations of retaliation, the Respondent finds that the addition requested by the Complainant is frivolous and fails to meet the applicable legal test;\n\u00b7 The Respondent claims that the Complainant did not provide the Tribunal with solid and tangible evidence that would justify amending the complaint to include acts of retaliation;\n\u00b7 The Respondent argues that there is no nexus between the new facts and the original complaint;\n\u00b7 The Respondent indicates that some of the new facts occurred during the same period as the original complaint. However, the Respondent argues that a complaint of retaliation requires much more than just a coincidence;\n\u00b7 The Respondent is also opposed to the addition of paragraph 6(b) of the CHRA, alleging that it did not provide the Complainant with accommodation and that there is no information in the complaint that would justify such an addition.\nC. The Commission\n[12] I would first like to mention that the Commission did a good job of providing the Tribunal with a concise response. That said, the Commission\u2019s position is divided according to the element in question. Its position can be summarized as follows:\n\u00b7 The Commission states that it is not necessary to amend the Statement of Particulars to request subpoenas or provide a new summary of testimony. It proposes revisiting these elements at a later date;\n\u00b7 With respect to the new violations of the CHRA and the relief being sought, the Commission distances itself from the application submitted by the Complainant and does not request that the proceedings be amended as proposed;\n\u00b7 The Commission informed the Tribunal that it will focus primarily on the elements raised in the initial complaint and more specifically on the actions relating to section 5 of the CHRA;\n\u00b7 With respect to the proposed new facts in the complaint, the Commission does not take any position on the proposed factual additions. It states that these facts are rather related to the factual context of the case. Accordingly, and in the event that the Tribunal decides against authorizing the amendments to the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars, the Tribunal could authorize the Complainant to refer to this information during her testimony at the hearing (as authorized in Serge Lafreni\u00e8re v. Via Rail Canada Inc., 2017 CHRT 12);\n\u00b7 The Commission also gave the Tribunal an overview of the legal framework concerning amendments to a complaint, a Statement of Particulars and retaliation;\n\u00b7 The Commission emphasizes that at this stage of the proceedings, the Respondent has still not filed a Statement of Particulars, a list of documents or a list of witnesses. Under these circumstances, the questions surrounding prejudice or fairness do not really come into play, since the Respondent will be given a full and ample opportunity to respond to the allegations;\n\u00b7 The Commission reminds the Tribunal that if it agrees to add the discriminatory practices to the complaint pursuant to paragraph 6(b) and section 14.1 of the CHRA, it should consequently give the Complainant an opportunity to amend the relief sought;\n\u00b7 The Commission also submits that subsection 3(1) of the CHRA sets out the prohibited grounds for discrimination, but does not give rise to relief per se.\nIII. Applicable law\n[13] It is important to remember that the original complaint does not serve the purposes of a pleading (Casler v. Canadian National Railway, 2017 CHRT 6 at para. 9 [Casler]; see also Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 1 at para. 10 [Gaucher]). Moreover, as explained in Casler:\n[8] . . . [I]t must be kept in mind that filing a complaint is the first step in the complaint resolution process under the Act. . . . As the Tribunal stated in Gaucher, at paragraph 11, \u201c[i]t is inevitable that new facts and circumstances will often come to light in the course of the investigation. It follows that complaints are open to refinement\u201d.\n[14] The Tribunal enjoys considerable discretion in terms of hearing the complaint under sections 48.9(1), 48.9(2), 49 and 50 of the CHRA. It has been confirmed repeatedly that the Tribunal has the power to amend the original complaint referred to it by the Commission (Canada (Attorney General) v. Parent, 2006 FC 1313 at paras. 30, 41, 43).\n[15] The decision in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canadian Association of Telephone Employees, 2002 FCT 776, also helps to establish the general principles that guide the Tribunal with regard to applications for amendments:\n[T]he general rule is that an [application for] amendment [filed before the Tribunal] should be allowed at any stage of an action for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties, provided, notably, that the allowance would not result in an injustice to the other party not capable of being compensated by an award of costs and that it would serve the interests of justice. (Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canadian Association of Telephone Employees, 2002 FCT 776 at para. 31, referring to Canderel Ltd. v. Canada, 1993 CanLII 2990 (FCA), [1994] 1 F.C. 3 (F.C.A.)).\n(see also Attaran v. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (formerly Citizenship and Immigration Canada), 2017 CHRT 21 at para. 16 [Attaran]; Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation v. P.S.A.C. (Local 70396), 2006 FC 704 at paras. 40, 50 [Museum Corporation]; Gaucher at para. 10).\n[16] Furthermore, the proposed amendments cannot, by themselves, amount to a brand new complaint that was not initially referred by the Commission (Museum Corporation at paras. 40, 50). These amendments must necessarily be linked in fact or law to the original complaint: this is what is referred to as a nexus (see Blodgett v. GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy Canada Inc., 2013 CHRT 24 at paras. 16-17; see also Tran v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2010 CHRT 31 at para. 17).\n[17] The addition of allegations of retaliation is based on the same guidelines outlined above for the addition of both prohibited grounds of discrimination and discriminatory practices. It has been confirmed repeatedly that it \u201cwould be impractical, inefficient and unfair to require individuals to make allegations of reprisals only through the format of separate proceedings\u201d (see for example Kavanagh v. C.S.C. (May 31, 1999), T505\/2298 (C.H.R.T.); First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada). 2012 CHRT 24 at para. 14). The Tribunal should generally authorize an amendment to add an allegation of retaliation unless it is plain and obvious that the allegations in the amendment sought could not possibly succeed (see Virk v. Bell Canada, 2004 CHRT 10 at para. 7 [Virk]; see also Palm v. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500, et al., 2015 CHRT 23 at para. 12; Saviye v. Afroglobal Network Inc. and Michael Daramola, 2016 CHRT 18 at para. 15 [Saviye]). The Tribunal must also ensure that sufficient notice is given to the Respondent so that it is not prejudiced and can properly defend itself (see for example Virk, cited above at para. 8; see also Saviye, cited above at para. 17).\n[18] Lastly, when the Tribunal is required to analyze an application to amend and modify a complaint, the Tribunal should not embark on a substantive review of the merits of these amendments and modifications (see Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2004 CHRT 2 at para. 6 [Bressette]). The merits of the allegations should be assessed at the hearing when the parties have full and ample opportunity to provide evidence (see Saviye at para. 19, referring to Bressette at para. 8). Including these amendments does not in itself establish a violation of the CHRA: The Complainant must still meet the burden of proof, on the balance of probabilities.\nIV. Analysis\nA. Failure to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s instructions\n[19] Proceedings before the Tribunal are intended to be as expeditious and informal as possible (section 48.9 of the CHRA and rule 1(1)(c) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules (03-05-04) (\u201cRules\u201d). On July 23, 2017, the Complainant forwarded an email to the parties and to the Tribunal. A cover letter and her proposed amendments were attached to this email. In this message, she indicated that she had included the reasons for these amendments. Further to the response by the Respondent, the Complainant submitted a reply on August 18, 2017, in which she reiterated her reasons for requesting the amendments.\n[20] The Respondent alleges that the Complainant did not comply with the Tribunal\u2019s instructions by failing to justify why the amendments had not been included in the initial Statement of Particulars. I would remind everyone that the Complainant is not represented, and I believe that she complied with the Tribunal\u2019s requests to the best of her abilities. Judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings can be complex. It is a rare occurrence for individuals who appear before the Courts to be involved in these types of proceedings during their lifetime. We cannot expect that they will suddenly be able to act like officers of the court and produce work of the same calibre. The Tribunal understands the general idea behind the Complainant\u2019s amendments. I am satisfied with her application and her explanations. I will therefore dismiss the Respondent\u2019s objection concerning this matter and examine the elements of the proposed amendments in further detail.\nB. Prejudice to the Respondent\n[21] I will first address the notion of prejudice to the Respondent because I believe that this issue can be dealt with quickly. As explained earlier, amendments should generally be allowed if they remain within the spectrum of the initial complaint and do not cause the Respondent to suffer any prejudice. If prejudice is caused, how can we limit or remedy it?\n[22] In this case, I agree with the Commission\u2019s contention that the Complainant\u2019s amendments are not prejudicial to the Respondent. Indeed, I believe that the Complainant\u2019s request comes at the right time: the Respondent has not yet filed its Statement of Particulars, its list of documents or its list of witnesses. It will therefore have ample opportunity and latitude to refute the initial or amended allegations and raise the defences provided for in the Act, where applicable. The Commission will also have an opportunity to amend the Statement of Particulars it filed initially, and the Complainant may also file a reply, if she chooses to do so. I believe that this clearly respects the principles of natural justice and fairness.\n[23] Since I have decided that the Respondent did not suffer any prejudice, I will instead examine the amendments from the point of view of whether they have a nexus with the original complaint. With respect to retaliation, I will also consider whether the request is defensible or tenable as stipulated in Virk, cited above.\nC. Section 6(b) of the CHRA \u2013 Adverse differential treatment in the provision of accommodation\n[24] In her original complaint, the Complainant alleges that she did not receive the food and housing benefits she was entitled to receive. Furthermore, she indicates that the band council adopted a resolution stating that she did not have the right to live on the Nation\u2019s territory. In her Statement of Particulars, she also states that she was forced to leave the territory and the home she shared with her husband for several reasons attributable to the Respondent, most notably due to the council\u2019s resolution, issues with benefits, harassment, pressure, etc.\n[25] At this stage, the Tribunal should not embark on a substantive review of the merits of the amendments and facts. Since the issue of prejudice has already been addressed, I must simply determine whether there is a link between this amendment and the original complaint. I believe that there is in fact a nexus. The issues related to housing benefits, the resolution prohibiting the Complainant from living on the reserve, the harassment and pressure, etc., were enough to force the Complainant to leave her home. Consequently, I authorize the addition of an allegation of discriminatory practice to the complaint under section 6(b) of the CHRA.\n[26] However, I must emphasize the fact that the reference to section 6(b) of the CHRA as a result of an added allegation does not in itself establish a violation of the CHRA. I am not concerned with assessing the evidence based on a balance of probabilities. This will be done at the hearing in light of the evidence filed. The Complainant is still required to demonstrate to the Tribunal that there was a violation, in accordance with the burden of proof on a balance of probabilities. The Respondent will have an opportunity to refute these allegations or raise a defence under the Act.\nD. Section 14 of the CHRA \u2013 Harassment\n[27] Since the filing of her original complaint, the Complainant has claimed that she was subjected to intimidation and harassment via Facebook, within the community, in the offices of the Respondent, etc., and she attributes the cause of these incidents to the actions of the Respondent, the Respondent\u2019s agents or people affiliated with the Respondent.\n[28] The notion of harassment is not defined in the CHRA. However, the case law provides some guidance on the matter, particularly Siddoo v. International Longshoremen\u2019s and Warehousemen\u2019s Union, Local 502, 2015 CHRT 21 at paras. 45-47. Not all insensitive, unintelligent, impertinent or vulgar comments give rise to the right to file a complaint under section 14 of the CHRA. Harassment must be assessed on a case-by-case basis from the perspective of a reasonable person in the circumstances. This analysis must be conducted in light of the facts and evidence presented at the hearing. However, this is not the point where I should assess the merits of the actions or the violation.\n[29] From the beginning of this case, the Complainant has alleged that she was intimidated and harassed by the council, its members or people affiliated with the council. Section 14 of the CHRA concerning harassment is only the next logical step to these supposed allegations. Consequently, I believe that there is a nexus between the addition of an allegation under section 14 of the CHRA and the original complaint.\n[30] At the risk of repeating myself, the Complainant must still meet the burden of proof, on a balance of probabilities, regarding this element, and once again the Respondent will have an opportunity to refute the allegations or present a defence provided by the Act.\nE. Section 14.1 of the CHRA \u2013 Retaliation\n[31] With respect to retaliation, the Tribunal must determine not only whether there is a nexus between the allegations and the original complaint, but also whether the application is defensible or tenable. It is important to remember that in this case, the complaint is filed against the Nation itself. Therefore, the Complainant bears the burden of proving that there is a link between the alleged acts of retaliation and the actions taken by the Nation or agents of the Nation.\n[32] Subsection 14.1 of the CHRA concerns victims of retaliation or anyone acting on the victim\u2019s behalf. The Tribunal reviewed the initial complaint and Statement of Particulars submitted by the Complainant and the Commission. It is clear to me that the victim of the complaint is Ms. Polhill personally: her daughter and husband are not referred to as victims in the original complaint. However, the Tribunal is of the opinion that it is not clear whether the inquiry should end here. Historically the Tribunal has dealt with the issue of retaliation as it is directed at an individual who has filed a complaint or the alleged victim (see Warman v. Winnicki, 2006 CHRT 20 at para. 113). Without deciding the merits of the issue in this ruling, the Tribunal is of the view that an argument can be made that an act against a third party, such as the Complainant\u2019s husband or daughter, can be considered to be an act of retaliation against the Complainant herself. On this point, the Tribunal would like to draw the parties\u2019 attention to the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Singh (Re), [1989] 1 F.C. 430 at 442, where the Court stated as follows:\nThe question as to who is the \"victim\" of an alleged discriminatory practice is almost wholly one of fact. Human rights legislation does not look so much to the intent of discriminatory practices as to their effect. That effect is by no means limited to the alleged \"target\" of the discrimination and it is entirely conceivable that a discriminatory practice may have consequences that are sufficiently direct and immediate to justify qualifying as a \"victim\" thereof persons who were never within the contemplation or intent of its author.\nGiven the above, the Tribunal is not convinced that the allegations of retaliation related to acts committed against Mr. Bone or the Complainant\u2019s daughter have no reasonable chance of success on the merits. The Tribunal therefore allows the Complainant\u2019s proposed amendments to her Statement of Particulars as they relate to the fake Wes Bone Facebook page, e-mails from Brian Sharpe and the benefits lost by the Complainant\u2019s daughter. The Tribunal looks forward to receiving the parties\u2019 submissions on this issue at the hearing.\n[33] The Complainant also describes other situations of alleged retaliation which affected her personally, most notably the situation concerning the flooding of the basement, the cutting of hay around the house and the matter relating to the horses. With respect to the first situation, it is the Tribunal\u2019s understanding that the Complainant claims that the Nation failed to act properly or quickly, which according to her constitutes retaliation. Secondly, she alleges that the Chief of the council interfered with a contractual agreement that she could have reached with a third party for hay cutting. With respect to the third situation, she claims that the Chief tried to cause her prejudice by informing her that her horses had possibly escaped from their enclosure. These incidents occurred after she had filed her complaint in April 2014. I reiterate that I am not able to express an opinion on the merits of these allegations. However, I must determine whether they are defensible. Is it \u201cplain and obvious that the allegations sought could not possibly succeed\u201d (see Bressette, cited above, at para. 6)? Without having an opportunity to hear all of the evidence relating to these allegations, it is not so plain and obvious that they would be deemed to be unfounded. I will therefore authorize the addition of these amendments. Nevertheless, the Complainant must still prove these elements on the balance of probabilities. The Respondent will have an opportunity to refute the allegations or present its defence.\n[34] Lastly, the Complainant alleges another act of retaliation perpetrated recently. Someone allegedly made false statements to the RCMP. An officer reportedly went to the Complainant\u2019s home to inform her that she was being charged with fraud. The Complainant attributes this situation to the actions of the Respondent but was not able to identify the person who made these statements. In the case of the other allegations, the Complainant provided a rather clear explanation of the involvement of the Nation or its agents. In the situation involving the RCMP, it is very difficult for the Tribunal to establish the link between the person who allegedly made false statements and the Respondent, despite the summary analysis of the circumstances and the inferences that could be made. In this situation, I believe that the allegations are not tenable, and for these reasons, I will not authorize the amendments relating to this specific aspect.\n[35] The Tribunal would like to remind the parties that the Complainant has the onus of establishing retaliation against her on a prima facie basis. As such, for each allegation made, the Complainant must demonstrate (i) that she experienced adverse treatment following the filing of her complaint against the Nation or by any person acting on the Nation\u2019s behalf; and, (ii) that the human rights complaint was a factor in the adverse treatment (see Tabor v. Millbrook First Nation, 2015 CHRT 18 at para. 6).\nF. Other amendments\n[36] The Complainant also made other amendments to her Statement of Particulars. In my opinion, these amendments generally relate to the factual background already established initially. The Complainant clarified certain situations or corrected certain errors, such as the year 2014 instead of 2013. As explained in Gaucher and Casler, cited above, the complaint filed with the Commission only provides a synopsis; it will essentially become clearer during the course of the process. The conditions for the hearing are defined in the Statement of Particulars. Since the amendments do not substantially change the essence of the file, and as I have already determined that there was no prejudice to the Respondent, I will authorize these various amendments. The burden of proving these allegations at the hearing rests with the Complainant.\nG. Relief\n[37] I authorized the Complainant to amend her original complaint to add the discriminatory practices, with certain limitations, under sections 6(b), 14 and 14.1 of the CHRA. At the same time, the Complainant should have an opportunity to amend her relief accordingly. As stated by Member Marchildon and Member Lustig in First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada). 2012 CHRT 2 at para. 469:\n[469] It is also important to reiterate that the CHRA gives rise to rights of vital importance. Those rights must be given full recognition and effect through the Act. In crafting remedies under the CHRA, the Tribunal\u2019s powers under section 53(2) must be given such fair, large and liberal interpretation as will best ensure the objects of the Act are obtained Applying a purposive approach, remedies under the CHRA should be effective in promoting the right being protected and meaningful in vindicating the rights and freedoms of the victim of discrimination (see CN v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1987] 1 SCR 1114 at p. 1134; and, Doucet-Boudreau at paras. 25 and 55).\nWhen the Tribunal finds that a party has violated the CHRA and engaged in a discriminatory practice, the Act provides for remedies that may be ordered to correct the situation. Without relief, the purpose of the Act cannot be achieved.\n[38] That said, I am not very clear about the specific relief that the Complainant is requesting. Indeed, she is requesting $20,000 for each violation of sections 3(1), 6(b) and 14.1 of the CHRA. I would first point out that section 3(1) of the CHRA does not in itself give rise to relief under the CHRA because this is the section which sets out the prohibited grounds for discrimination. It does not concern a discriminatory practice that gives rise to relief under section 53(2) of the CHRA. Consequently, I will not authorize this amendment. With respect to the two other claims for $20,000 under sections 6(b) and 14.1 of the CHRA, the Complainant did not indicate whether she was claiming these amounts under section 53(2)(e) of the CHRA for the pain and suffering she allegedly experienced, or under section 53(3) of the CHRA for allegedly willful or reckless conduct.\n[39] I do not believe that these omissions are fatal at this stage of the proceedings, but the Complainant will have to clarify her intentions before the Respondent presents its Statement of Particulars. The latter has the right to have a clear understanding of the facts alleged and the relief sought. I would like to point out that there is a difference between damages for pain and suffering and damages for willful or reckless conduct. The evidence to be submitted by the Respondent will therefore be adapted accordingly. This question will therefore need to be clarified in a conference call following the publication of this judgment, and this will need to be done before the Respondent prepares its Statement of Particulars.\nH. Summary of Mr. Bone\u2019s testimony\n[40] The summary of testimony provided by the parties is simply a cursory outline of the facts on which the witness will testify during the hearing (see section 6(1)(f) of the Rules). The Complainant nevertheless decided to include detailed information on Mr. Bone\u2019s testimony in her amended Statement of Particulars and asked the Tribunal to amend the summary of this testimony. The Complainant is claiming new facts and new discriminatory practices and has informed the parties that Mr. Bone will testify in that regard during the hearing. Given the Complainant\u2019s request at this stage, I will authorize this amendment. Since the Respondent has yet to file its Statement of Particulars, it will still have an opportunity to respond to such allegations, produce its documents and summon witnesses accordingly.\nI. Subpoenas\n[41] Pursuant to section 50(3)(a) of the Act, a member possesses the discretionary power to issue a subpoena if the member considers it necessary for the full hearing and consideration of the complaint (Canadian Telephone Employees\u2019 Association v. Bell Canada, 2000 CanLII 20416 [Bell Canada]; see also Schecter v. Canadian National Railway Company, 2005 CHRT 35 at para. 20 [Schecter]). Generally, the purpose of a subpoena is to compel a third party to give oral or written evidence on oath or to produce documents and items in their possession. In rendering its decision, the Tribunal weighs factors such as, whether there is a rational connection between the information sought and the facts, issues and forms of relief identified by the parties\u2019 submissions, whether the request amounts to a fishing expedition and whether the request is oppressive in that it subjects an individual outside the litigation to an onerous and far ranging search for the documents (see Bell Canada).\n[42] It is evident that the identity of the author of the Facebook page and Gmail account are relevant for imputing liability on the Respondent or one of its agents. However, it is not clear to the Tribunal whether Facebook or Gmail have the information sought by the Complainant. For example, if the person(s) can only be identified by their IP address, the cooperation of the internet service provider is required. The Complainant may have to reach out to the internet provider to ask it to reveal the identity or the address of the individual. Additional subpoenas may be required.\n[43] The Tribunal is not aware if the Complainant has already taken steps to contact these third parties nor if she already identified a person or specific department for the service of the subpoenas. The Tribunal will not issue a subpoena for the attendance of a witness or the production of a document or other material in this proceeding without first being provided with more details. Given the lack of particulars, the Tribunal is of the view that it is not in a position to rule on the necessity of the subpoena against Facebook or Google at this time. This matter can be discussed between the parties and the Tribunal at the next CMCC.\n[44] In the same vein, the Tribunal has difficulty finding that issuing a subpoena against BC Employment and Assistance Office is necessary at this time as it is unclear whether the office is in possession of the requested information. First, the Complainant has not identified the employee who received the anonymous call. Second, it is not clear whether the employee would have to rely on her memory alone to identify the anonymous caller by voice or if there is a recording of the alleged conversation that can be produced. Given that the Tribunal lacks the particulars necessary to decide whether the subpoena is necessary at this stage, the Tribunal will not issue a subpoena at this time. Again, this matter can be discussed between the parties and the Tribunal at the next CMCC.\n[45] The Tribunal reminds the parties that pursuant to section 50(6) of the Act any person \u201csummoned to attend the hearing is entitled in the discretion of the member or panel to receive the same fees and allowances as those paid to persons summoned to attend before the Federal Court\u201d (see Day v. Canada (National Defence), 2003 CHRT 7 at paras. 2-3). Thus, pursuant to Rules 41, 42 and Tariff A of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR\/98-106, each witness summoned to testify is entitled to a witness fee of $20 per day plus reasonable travel expenses incurred by the party who subpoenaed the witness\u2019 attendance.\nJ. Disclosure of documents by the Complainant\n[46] The Respondent argued that the Complainant did not provide the parties with the list of documents in her possession which may potentially be relevant to the dispute. The Respondent asks that the Complainant submit said documents and the corresponding list.\n[47] Indeed, having reviewed the file, I note that the Commission filed its list of documents on November 13, 2015, and a list of additional documents dated October 26, 2016. The Complainant did not file such a list. The Tribunal has also not been informed of the various aspects of disclosure between the parties. It is at this stage that one of the parties has submitted such a request to the Tribunal.\n[48] In short, I would remind the parties of section 50(1) of the CHRA, which states among other things that the parties have the right to a full and complete hearing where they are entitled to present evidence and make representations. This right also includes the disclosure of evidence: the parties have an obligation to disclose the evidence that is in their possession or under their control (Guay v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2004 CHRT 34 at para. 40 [Guay]). This right is also provided in sections 6(1)(d) and 6(1)(e) of the Rules. All the documents that are potentially relevant to the dispute must be disclosed (Bushey v. Sharma, 2003 CHRT 5 at para. 4; Hughes v. Transport Canada, 2012 CHRT 26, at para. 20, 25-26; see in the alternative Guay at para. 40, cited above; Day v. Department of National Defence and Hortie, decision No. 3, 2002\/12\/06; Warman v. Bahr, 2006 CHRT 18 at para. 7 [Warman]; Seeley v. Canadian National Railway, 2013 CHRT 18 at para. 6; Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 42 at paras. 10-11). I would point out that the threshold for arguable relevance is very low (Warman, cited above, at para. 6).\n[49] The Complainant is therefore required to disclose all of the documents with arguable relevance that she has in her possession to the Respondent and the Commission. She is also required to compile a list of these documents that includes a very short description of the documents. Any documents for which the Complainant is claiming privilege (for example, mediation, settlement or litigation privilege) should be compiled in a separate list that also includes a short description of the document(s). I reiterate that these documents should not be disclosed since privilege is being claimed. I refer the Complainant to the lists provided by the Commission dated November 13, 2015, and October 26, 2016, as good examples of the types of lists to be forwarded to the parties.\n[50] The Complainant\u2019s deadlines for filing these lists and disclosing the documents will be determined during a conference call following the release of this decision.\nV. Additional remarks\n[51] I will take advantage of this opportunity to remind the parties that fundamental rights and freedoms are intrinsic to every individual as a human being. Guaranteeing these inherent rights is of paramount importance in a democratic, egalitarian and just society. These guarantees help to safeguard human dignity. As the Supreme Court of Canada described it in Law v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497, 1999 CanLII 675 (SCC) at para. 53:\n[53] . . . Human dignity means that an individual or group feels self-respect and self-worth. It is concerned with physical and psychological integrity and empowerment. Human dignity is harmed by unfair treatment premised upon personal traits or circumstances which do not relate to individual needs, capacities, or merits. It is enhanced by laws which are sensitive to the needs, capacities, and merits of different individuals, taking into account the context underlying their differences. Human dignity is harmed when individuals and groups are marginalized, ignored, or devalued, and is enhanced when laws recognize the full place of all individuals and groups within Canadian society. Human dignity within the meaning of the equality guarantee does not relate to the status or position of an individual in society per se, but rather concerns the manner in which a person legitimately feels when confronted with a particular law.\n[52] The Tribunal is one of the few bodies that allow individuals to assert their right to \u201chave an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society\u201d, without being hindered by any considerations, characteristics or personal situation (section 2 of the CHRA). Issues that are brought before the Tribunal by complainants concern their dignity and self-esteem and can be profoundly sensitive in nature.\n[53] Each party has the right to a full and complete hearing before the Tribunal, which is guided by the principles of natural justice and fairness. In their defence, respondent parties have a right to disagree with the complainants and may respond to the allegations raised. As mentioned earlier, the subjects that are raised in the context of human rights and freedoms are sensitive and concern individuals. Consequently, submissions by the parties must show restraint and sensitivity. I therefore invite the parties to demonstrate restraint in the use of certain expressions.\n[54] Lastly, I will add that I do not agree with the Respondent\u2019s comments indicating that the Complainant\u2019s application is frivolous to the point of verging on wastefulness of the Tribunal\u2019s resources. I recall that the Respondent, over a period of more than a year and a half, did not participate in the Tribunal\u2019s quasi-judicial process. The Tribunal sent the Respondent 22 items of correspondence with acknowledgement of receipt in addition to serving the Notice of Hearing on the Respondent by bailiff. Lastly, the Tribunal, its Registrar (as well as the Commission) travelled to the venue of the hearing in order to inquire into the complaint, but this hearing was postponed. In so doing, the Tribunal has committed all of its resources in order to guarantee the rights of each of the parties: for the Respondent, for the Complainant as well as for the Commission, whose objective is to protect the interests of Canadian society.\nVI.

This agreement was based on the following principles:\nWhere professionals with clinical expertise have recommended a service for a First Nations child, it is the recommended service that should be considered for approval, and not an alternate service;\nCase conferencing:\nThere is a legitimate role for clinical case conferencing (discussions related to a service recipient\u2019s needs with professionals with relevant expertise involved in his or her case), where more information is reasonably necessary to understanding a First Nations child\u2019s clinical needs;\nWhere clinical case conferencing is reasonably necessary to understand a First Nation\u2019s child\u2019s clinical needs, and where professionals with relevant expertise are already involved in the First Nations child\u2019s case, those are the professionals that must be consulted;\nWhen clinical case conferencing takes place, the determination of the service request will be made within 12 hours of obtaining all necessary information in urgent individual cases and within 48 hours of obtaining all necessary information in non-urgent individual cases;\nAdministrative case conferencing (intragovernmental or intergovernmental discussions related to the mechanics of service delivery) must not delay the receipt of services by a First Nations child;\nIn cases where a service is available, Canada can consult, within the specified timeline for the type of case involved, with a First Nation\u2019s child\u2019s family, with a First Nation community, or with service providers, in order to fund the service;\nIn cases where a recommended service that is approved is unavailable, Canada will make every reasonable effort to ensure funding is provided as close to the specified timeline for the type of case involved.\nTimelines:\nIn certain cases, making service determinations within 48 hours, when a First Nations child\u2019s service needs are unclear, may not be in that child\u2019s best interest;\nIn urgent cases where irremediable harm is reasonably foreseeable, immediate action should be taken to put crisis intervention supports in place until an extended response can be developed and implemented;\nGroup cases (which address service gaps affecting large numbers of children) should be treated distinctly from individual cases and it is reasonable for group determinations to be made within one week in non-urgent cases, and within 48-hours urgent cases in which irremediable harm is not reasonably foreseeable;\nService delays arising due to a lack of information regarding a First Nation\u2019s child\u2019s clinical needs should be tracked and reported on as part of the Tribunal reporting process;\n[4] On October 31, 2017, the Caring Society made a motion in writing for an order varying certain provisions of the May 26th Orders, as proposed in Exhibit \u201cA\u201d to the Affidavit of Doreen Navarro, (\u201cthe Proposed Amendments\u201d). The Proposed Amendments give effect to an agreement reached between the Complainant Caring Society, the Complainant Assembly of First Nations, and the Respondent Canada in this regard. The Caring Society\u2019s motion materials assert that the Proposed Amendments would resolve the questions that are before the Federal Court in Canada\u2019s application for judicial review.\n[5] The Respondent Canada, the Assembly of First Nations, the Commission, the Chiefs of Ontario, the Nishnawbe Aski Nation and Amnesty international have all confirmed in writing that they consent to the relief sought in the Caring Society\u2019s motion.\n[6] According to the motion materials, the Proposed Amendments would help ensure that Canada is able to comply with the May 26th Orders that would address Canada\u2019s concerns in a way that would ensure substantive equality for First Nations children, bearing in mind the need to provide culturally appropriate services to First Nations children and to safeguard the best interests of First Nations children.\n[7] Upon consideration of the motion materials, and the consents filed by the AFN, Canada, the Commission, the COO, the NAN and Amnesty International, the Panel has decided to vary the May 26th Orders in accordance with the Proposed Amendments. In paragraph 4A of the May 26th Orders, the Panel retained jurisdiction to ensure that the terms thereof are effectively and meaningfully implemented and to further refine or clarify them if necessary. The Panel finds that the Proposed Amendments serve to refine or clarify the May 26th Order, and as such fall within the scope of its retained jurisdiction.\n[8] The Panel is encouraged to learn that all parties and Interested Parties involved in this case consent to the relief sought in the motion, and that they arrived to a resolution in the hopes of moving forward collaboratively without the need for judicial review proceedings. The present ruling incorporates that resolution and the agreed upon wording variations contained in the Proposed Amendments to the May 26th Orders of this Panel. The Panel adopts the Proposed Amendments as set out in the order below, and pursuant to section 53(2)(a) of the Act. The amendments to the May 26th Orders are indicated below in struck out text and underlined text. For ease of reference, a clean copy of the amended May 26th Orders is appended to this ruling.\n[9] Finally, the Panel wishes to clearly state that its acceptance of the parties\u2019 Proposed Amendments to the May 26th Orders should not be construed as otherwise modifying or changing any of the remedial measures previously ordered by the Panel.\nORDER\n[10] For the reasons given above the Panel hereby amends its Orders issued on May 26, 2017, contained in its ruling on immediate relief concerning Jordan\u2019s Principle (2017 CHRT 14), by replacing paragraph 135 of the ruling with the following :\n[135] Pursuant to the above, the Panel\u2019s orders are:\n1. Definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle\nAs of the date of this ruling, Canada shall cease relying upon and perpetuating definitions of Jordan\u2019s Principle that are not in compliance with the Panel\u2019s orders in 2016 CHRT 2, 2016 CHRT 10 , 2016 CHRT 16 and in this ruling.\nAs of the date of this ruling, Canada\u2019s definition and application of Jordan\u2019s Principle shall be based on the following key principles:\nJordan\u2019s Principle is a child-first principle that applies equally to all First Nations children, whether resident on or off reserve. It is not limited to First Nations children with disabilities, or those with discrete short-term issues creating critical needs for health and social supports or affecting their activities of daily living.\nJordan\u2019s Principle addresses the needs of First Nations children by ensuring there are no gaps in government services to them. It can address, for example, but is not limited to, gaps in such services as mental health, special education, dental, physical therapy, speech therapy, medical equipment and physiotherapy.\nWhen a government service, including a service assessment, is available to all other children, the government department of first contact will pay for the service to a First Nations child, without engaging in administrativecase conferring conferencing, policy review, service navigation or any other similar administrative procedure before the recommended service is approved and funding is provided.Canada may only engage in clinical case conferencing with professionals with relevant competence and training before the recommended service is approved and funding is provided to the extent that such consultations are reasonably necessary to determine the requestor\u2019s clinical needs. Where professionals with relevant competence and training are already involved in a First Nations child\u2019s case, Canada will consult those professionals and will only involve other professionals to the extent that those professionals already involved cannot provide the necessary clinical information. Canada may also consult with the family, First Nation community or service providers to fund services within the timeframes specified in paragraphs 135(2)(A)(ii) and 135(2)(A)(ii.1) where the service is available, and will make every reasonable effort to ensure funding is provided as close to those timeframes where the service is not available. Once After the recommended service isapproved and funding is provided, the government department of first contact can seek reimbursement from another department\/government;\nWhen a government service, including a service assessment, is not necessarily available to all other children or is beyond the normative standard of care, the government department of first contact will still evaluate the individual needs of the child to determine if the requested service should be provided to ensure substantive equality in the provision of services to the child, to ensure culturally appropriate services to the child and\/or to safeguard the best interests of the child. Where such services are to be provided, the government department of first contact will pay for the provision of the services to the First Nations child, without engaging in administrative case conferring conferencing, policy review, service navigation or any other similar administrative procedure beforethe recommended service is approved and funding is provided. Clinical case conferencing may be undertaken only for the purpose described in paragraph 135(1)(B)(iii). Canada may also consult with the family, First Nation community or service providers to fund services within the timeframes specified in paragraphs 135(2)(A)(ii) and 135(2)(A)(ii.1) where the service is available, and will make every reasonable effort to ensure funding is provided as close to those timeframes where the service is not available. Once After the recommended service is provided, the government department of first contact can seek reimbursement from another department\/government.\nWhile Jordan\u2019s Principle can apply to jurisdictional disputes between governments (i.e., between federal, provincial or territorial governments) and to jurisdictional disputes between departments within the same government, a dispute amongst government departments or between governments is not a necessary requirement for the application of Jordan\u2019s Principle.\nCanada shall not use or distribute a definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle that in any way restricts or narrows the principles enunciated in order 1(b).\nCanada shall review previous requests for funding that were denied, whether made pursuant to Jordan\u2019s Principle or otherwise, dating from April 1st, 2009, to ensure compliance with the above principles. Canada shall complete this review by November 1st, 2017.\n2. Processing and tracking of Jordan\u2019s Principle cases\nCanada shall develop or modify its processes surrounding Jordan\u2019s Principle to ensure the following standards are implemented by June 28, 2017:\nThe government department of first contact will evaluate the individual needs of a child requesting services under Jordan\u2019s Principle or that could be considered a case under Jordan\u2019s Principle.\nThe initial evaluation and a determination of the request requests by individuals shall be made within 12-48 hours of its receipt the initial contact for a service request. In a situation where irremediable harm is reasonably foreseeable, Canada will make all reasonable efforts to provide immediate crisis intervention supports until an extended response can be developed and implemented. In all other urgent cases, the evaluation and determination of the request shall be made within 12 hours of the initial contact for a service request. Where more information is reasonably necessary to the determination of a request by an individual, clinical case conferencing may be undertaken for the purpose described in paragraph 135(1)(B)(iii). For non-urgent cases in which this information cannot be obtained within the 48-hour time frame, representatives from the Government of Canada will work with the requestor in order to obtain the needed information so that the determination can be made as close to the 48-hour time frame as possible. In any event, once representatives from the Government of Canada have obtained the necessary information, a determination will be made within 12 hours for urgent cases, and 48 hours for non-urgent cases.\nii.1 The initial evaluation and determination of requests for groups shall be made within one week of the initial contact for a service request.

Lustig\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nNovember 2, 2017\nAnnex\n[135] Pursuant to the above, the Panel\u2019s orders are:\n1. Definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle\nAs of the date of this ruling, Canada shall cease relying upon and perpetuating definitions of Jordan\u2019s Principle that are not in compliance with the Panel\u2019s orders in 2016 CHRT 2, 2016 CHRT 10, 2016 CHRT 16 and in this ruling.\nAs of the date of this ruling, Canada\u2019s definition and application of Jordan\u2019s Principle shall be based on the following key principles:\nJordan\u2019s Principle is a child-first principle that applies equally to all First Nations children, whether resident on or off reserve. It is not limited to First Nations children with disabilities, or those with discrete short-term issues creating critical needs for health and social supports or affecting their activities of daily living.\nJordan\u2019s Principle addresses the needs of First Nations children by ensuring there are no gaps in government services to them. It can address, for example, but is not limited to, gaps in such services as mental health, special education, dental, physical therapy, speech therapy, medical equipment and physiotherapy.\nWhen a government service, including a service assessment, is available to all other children, the government department of first contact will pay for the service to a First Nations child, without engaging in administrativecase conferencing, policy review, service navigation or any other similar administrative procedure before the recommended service is approved and funding is provided.Canada may only engage in clinical case conferencing with professionals with relevant competence and training before the recommended service is approved and funding is provided to the extent that such consultations are reasonably necessary to determine the requestor\u2019s clinical needs. Where professionals with relevant competence and training are already involved in a First Nations child\u2019s case, Canada will consult those professionals and will only involve other professionals to the extent that those professionals already involved cannot provide the necessary clinical information. Canada may also consult with the family, First Nation community or service providers to fund services within the timeframes specified in paragraphs 135(2)(A)(ii) and 135(2)(A)(ii.1) where the service is available, and will make every reasonable effort to ensure funding is provided as close to those timeframes where the service is not available. After the recommended service isapproved and funding is provided, the government department of first contact can seek reimbursement from another department\/government;\nWhen a government service, including a service assessment, is not necessarily available to all other children or is beyond the normative standard of care, the government department of first contact will still evaluate the individual needs of the child to determine if the requested service should be provided to ensure substantive equality in the provision of services to the child, to ensure culturally appropriate services to the child and\/or to safeguard the best interests of the child. Where such services are to be provided, the government department of first contact will pay for the provision of the services to the First Nations child, without engaging in administrative case conferencing, policy review, service navigation or any other similar administrative procedure beforethe recommended service is approved and funding is provided. Clinical case conferencing may be undertaken only for the purpose described in paragraph 135(1)(B)(iii). Canada may also consult with the family, First Nation community or service providers to fund services within the timeframes specified in paragraphs 135(2)(A)(ii) and 135(2)(A)(ii.1) where the service is available, and will make every reasonable effort to ensure funding is provided as close to those timeframes where the service is not available. After the recommended service is provided, the government department of first contact can seek reimbursement from another department\/government.\nWhile Jordan\u2019s Principle can apply to jurisdictional disputes between governments (i.e., between federal, provincial or territorial governments) and to jurisdictional disputes between departments within the same government, a dispute amongst government departments or between governments is not a necessary requirement for the application of Jordan\u2019s Principle.\nCanada shall not use or distribute a definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle that in any way restricts or narrows the principles enunciated in order 1(b).\nCanada shall review previous requests for funding that were denied, whether made pursuant to Jordan\u2019s Principle or otherwise, dating from April 1st, 2009, to ensure compliance with the above principles. Canada shall complete this review by November 1st, 2017.\n2. Processing and tracking of Jordan\u2019s Principle cases\nCanada shall develop or modify its processes surrounding Jordan\u2019s Principle to ensure the following standards are implemented by June 28, 2017:\nThe government department of first contact will evaluate the individual needs of a child requesting services under Jordan\u2019s Principle or that could be considered a case under Jordan\u2019s Principle.\nThe initial evaluation and a determination of requests by individuals shall be made within 48 hours of the initial contact for a service request. In a situation where irremediable harm is reasonably foreseeable, Canada will make all reasonable efforts to provide immediate crisis intervention supports until an extended response can be developed and implemented. In all other urgent cases, the evaluation and determination of the request shall be made within 12 hours of the initial contact for a service request. Where more information is reasonably necessary to the determination of a request by an individual, clinical case conferencing may be undertaken for the purpose described in paragraph 135(1)(B)(iii). For non-urgent cases in which this information cannot be obtained within the 48-hour time frame, representatives from the Government of Canada will work with the requestor in order to obtain the needed information so that the determination can be made as close to the 48-hour time frame as possible. In any event, once representatives from the Government of Canada have obtained the necessary information, a determination will be made within 12 hours for urgent cases, and 48 hours for non-urgent cases.\nii.1 The initial evaluation and determination of requests for groups shall be made within one week of the initial contact for a service request. In a situation where irremediable harm is reasonably foreseeable, Canada will make all reasonable efforts to provide immediate crisis intervention supports until an extended response can be developed and implemented.

The need for any further reporting pursuant to this order shall be revisited on May 25, 2018.\n3. Publicizing the compliant definition and approach to Jordan\u2019s Principle\nBy June 09, 2017 Canada shall post a clear link to information on Jordan\u2019s Principle, including the compliant definition, on the home pages of both INAC and Health Canada.\nBy June 28, 2017, Canada shall post a bilingual (French and English) televised announcement on the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, providing details of the compliant definition and process for Jordan\u2019s Principle.\nBy June 09, 2017, Canada shall contact all stakeholders who received communications regarding Jordan\u2019s Principle since January 26, 2016 and advise them in writing of the findings and orders in this ruling.\nBy July 27, 2017, Canada shall revisit any agreements concluded with third-party organizations to provide services under the Child First Initiative\u2019s Service Coordination Function, and make any changes necessary to reflect the proper definition and scope of Jordan\u2019s Principle ordered in this ruling.\nBy July 27, 2017, Canada shall fund and consult with the Complainants, Commission and the Interested Parties to develop training and public education materials relating to Jordan\u2019s Principle (including on the Decision and subsequent rulings), and ensure their proper distribution to the public, Jordan\u2019s Principle focal points, members of the Executive Oversight Committee, managers involved in the application of Jordan\u2019s Principle\/Child First Initiative, First Nations communities and child welfare agencies and any other applicable stakeholders.\n4.

Background\n[1] Mr. Kouroush Alizadeh-Ebadi filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) dated May 30, 2010 against Manitoba Telecom Services Inc. (MTS), alleging that it had discriminated against him while he was employed by MTS between mid-2001 and April 2009 on the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin and religion under section 3(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) by engaging in the discriminatory practices of adverse differentiation and harassment that he described in his complaint, contrary to sections 7(b) and 14(1)(c) of the CHRA.\n[2] Sections 3(1), 7(b), 14(1)(c), 41(1)(e), 49(1) and (2), 50(1), 53 and 65(1) and (2) of the CHRA are relevant to this case and provide as follows:\nProhibited grounds of discrimination\n3 (1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, family status, genetic characteristics, disability and conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.\nEmployment\n7 It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nHarassment\n14 (1) It is a discriminatory practice,\n(c) in matters related to employment,\nto harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nCommission to deal with complaint\n41 (1) Subject to section 40, the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint it appears to the Commission that\n(e) the complaint is based on acts or omissions the last of which occurred more than one year, or such longer period of time as the Commission considers appropriate in the circumstances, before receipt of the complaint.\nRequest for inquiry\n49 (1) At any stage after the filing of a complaint, the Commission may request the Chairperson of the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint if the Commission is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry is warranted.\nChairperson to institute inquiry\n(2) On receipt of a request, the Chairperson shall institute an inquiry by assigning a member of the Tribunal to inquire into the complaint, but the Chairperson may assign a panel of three members if he or she considers that the complexity of the complaint requires the inquiry to be conducted by three members.\nConduct of inquiry\n50 (1) After due notice to the Commission, the complainant, the person against whom the complaint was made and, at the discretion of the member or panel conducting the inquiry, any other interested party, the member or panel shall inquire into the complaint and shall give all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations.\nComplaint dismissed\n53 (1) At the conclusion of an inquiry, the member or panel conducting the inquiry shall dismiss the complaint if the member or panel finds that the complaint is not substantiated.\nComplaint substantiated\n(2) If at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may, subject to section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice and include in the order any of the following terms that the member or panel considers appropriate:\n(a) that the person cease the discriminatory practice and take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in future, including\n(i) the adoption of a special program, plan or arrangement referred to in subsection 16(1), or\n(ii) making an application for approval and implementing a plan under section 17;\n(b) that the person make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that are being or were denied the victim as a result of the practice;\n(c) that the person compensate the victim for any or all of the wages that the victim was deprived of and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice;\n(d) that the person compensate the victim for any or all additional costs of obtaining alternative goods, services, facilities or accommodation and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice; and\n(e) that the person compensate the victim, by an amount not exceeding twenty thousand dollars, for any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice.\nSpecial compensation\n(3) In addition to any order under subsection (2), the member or panel may order the person to pay such compensation not exceeding twenty thousand dollars to the victim as the member or panel may determine if the member or panel finds that the person is engaging or has engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly.\nInterest\n(4) Subject to the rules made under section 48.9, an order to pay compensation under this section may include an award of interest at a rate and for a period that the member or panel considers appropriate.\nActs of employees, etc.\n65 (1) Subject to subsection (2), any act or omission committed by an officer, a director, an employee or an agent of any person, association or organization in the course of the employment of the officer, director, employee or agent shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be an act or omission committed by that person, association or organization.\nExculpation\n(2) An act or omission shall not, by virtue of subsection (1), be deemed to be an act or omission committed by a person, association or organization if it is established that the person, association or organization did not consent to the commission of the act or omission and exercised all due diligence to prevent the act or omission from being committed and, subsequently, to mitigate or avoid the effect thereof.\n[3] By its letter dated October 5, 2012, the Commission requested the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) to institute an inquiry into the complaint under s. 49 of the CHRA.\n[4] The hearing of the case was originally scheduled to start in Winnipeg on the morning of June 18, 2014. The day before the hearing was to start, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi filed an amended Statement of Particulars to add new language to paragraph 17 of his Statement of Particulars that had been filed on June 12, 2013. The new language specifically referred to the prohibited ground of disability, which was not previously cited by Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi in his complaint. It covered a new allegation not included in his complaint alleging adverse differentiation on the basis of \u201crace and prior history of disability\u201d, through the failure by MTS to accommodate Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi with a gradual return to work program, as a result of injuries sustained in a car accident that was not his fault outside of the workplace in 2007, that resulted in him being away from work until 2009.\n[5] This proposed amendment was objected to by MTS, on a preliminary basis, at the outset of the hearing on June 18, 2014. MTS submitted that this allegation and the ground of disability was not mentioned in Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s complaint and, as such, was not investigated by the Commission and therefore was not part of what was referred by it to the Tribunal for an inquiry. MTS submitted that it was therefore not properly before the Tribunal for adjudication as part of the inquiry into the complaint requested by the Commission.\n[6] A recess took place to allow the parties to discuss this matter further with each other. After resuming the hearing later that morning Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi, on consent of MTS, requested an adjournment of the case to allow him to return to the Commission for the purpose of requesting the Commission to consider a further complaint respecting the new allegation referred to in the proposed amendment to paragraph 17, including the prohibited ground of disability. I granted Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s request for an adjournment sine die.\n[7] A letter was sent to the Tribunal by counsel for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi dated November 7, 2014 respecting the status of the case. In the letter counsel stated that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u201c...has filed an additional complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCHRC\u201d) relating, inter alia, to allegations that MTS discriminated against him on the basis of a disability...\u201d The letter referred to the fact that the Commission was reviewing the matter in relation to the possible application of section 41(1)(e) of the CHRA and that an investigation by the Commission of the additional complaint would only occur if the section 41 issue was resolved.\n[8] Subsequently, the Commission decided not to deal with the additional complaint of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi, on the basis that it was out of time under section 41(1)(e) of the CHRA. As such, the additional complaint was not investigated or referred to the Tribunal for an inquiry. There was no judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision to not deal with the additional complaint. Following the Commission\u2019s decision, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi filed a re-amended Statement of Particulars removing from paragraph 17, as amended, the language referring to the new allegation and the prohibited grounds of both race and disability related thereto. The three versions of Paragraph 17, in Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s original Statement of Particulars, in his proposed Amended Statement of Particulars, and in his Re-amended Statement of Particulars read as follows:\n1. Original Statement of Particulars\nBetween 2007 and early 2009, the Complainant was on an extended sick leave arising out of a serious motor vehicle accident that was not his fault. While he was away, his then TEAM leader, Brenda Coutts, removed his computer without saving the contents of the computer on a compact disk. When the Complainant expressed his dissatisfaction with this upon his return to work, Ms. Coutts told him \u201cshit happens - suck it up\u201d. When he took issue with this response, Ms. Coutts replied that he was \u201cbordering on insubordination.\u201d She later apologized for her comments.\n2. Proposed Amended Statement of Particulars\nBetween 2007 and early 2009, the Complainant was on an extended sick leave arising out of a serious motor vehicle accident that was not his fault. MTS required that the Complainant only return to work after he had fully recovered from the accident. MTS would not permit a gradual return to work or any other meaningful accommodation. This treatment by his supervisors, including Wayne Horseman and Brenda Coutts, was different than the treatment provided to other employees returning to work from a leave of absence which the Complainant attributes to his race and prior history of disability. While he was away, his then TEAM leader, Brenda Coutts, removed his computer without saving the contents of the computer on a compact disk. When the Complainant expressed his dissatisfaction with this upon his return to work, Ms. Coutts told him \u201cshit happens - suck it up\u201d. When he took issue with this response, Ms. Coutts replied that he was \u201cbordering on insubordination.\u201d She later apologized for her comments.\n3. Re-amended Statement of Particulars\nBetween April 26, 2007 and February 2009, the Complainant was on an extended sick leave arising out of a serious motor vehicle accident that was not his fault. From June 2007 to February 2009 this absence was without pay from MTS. The Complainant received income replacement indemnity benefits from Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation (\u201cMPI\u201d) from May 3, 2007 until April 11, 2008, Throughout the Complainant\u2019s absence from MTS, the Return to Work Coordinator, Des Hathaway, and MTS exchanged communication with respect to the Complainant\u2019s return to the workplace. While he was away, his then TEAM leader, Brenda Coutts, removed his computer without saving the contents of the computer on a compact disk. When the Complainant expressed his dissatisfaction with this upon his return to work, Ms. Coutts told him \u201cshit happens - suck it up\u201d. When he took issue with this response, Ms. Coutts replied that he was \u201cbordering on insubordination.\u201d She later apologized for her comments.\nFurther, it should be noted that Part B of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s original Statement of Particulars was never amended and has always read as follows, without any reference to the prohibited ground of disability:\nB. Complainant\u2019s Position on Legal Issues\n1. Did MTS fail to provide a harassment free work environment?\nThe Complainant\u2019s position is that MTS failed to provide a harassment free work environment.\n2. Did the Complainant receive adverse differential treatment which adversely impacted his career at MTS?\nThe Complainant asserts that he was treated in a differential manner on the basis of his race, national\/ethnic origin and religion and that his career was therefore adversely impacted.\n[9] The hearing was resumed and held in Winnipeg during the weeks of August 2nd and November 7th, 2016; and during the week of February 13th, 2017, and on May 19th, 2017. The evidence phase of the hearing was completed on February 17th, 2017. On May 19th, 2017 the parties made oral arguments, having agreed to exchange with each other and file with the Tribunal their written arguments on May 15th.\nII. Facts\n[10] Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi self identifies as an ethnic Azerbaijani (Azeri) Turk. He was born in the City of Urmia in the Province of West Azerbaijan, in Iran. His religious background is Islam. While in Iran he and his family were persecuted by the Farsi majority on account of his Turkish ethnicity. He moved from Iran to Turkey when he was 19 years old. In 1989 he moved to Canada and became a Canadian citizen in 1992.\n[11] Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was hired by MTS in March of 2000 as a co-op student from the University of Manitoba. He was initially hired to a term position and thereafter became a full time employee of MTS, working in its Corporate Information Systems department (CIS) later renamed the Information Technology Service Management department (ITSM). From March 2000 to December 2000 Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi worked as a Local Area Network (LAN) Administrator. From December 2000 to April 2001 he was a Technical Support Representative. From April 2001 to July 2009 he was an Information Services Specialist, later renamed a Client Support Specialist (CSS) \u201ctier 2\u201d. At all material times, he was the only Muslim in the ITSM department but there were employees of various races, ethnicities and religions there then. At all material times Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was a member of the Telecommunications Employees\u2019 Association of Manitoba (TEAM).\n[12] In the \u201ctier 2\u201d CSS role Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi provided support to MTS employees experiencing more complex problems with their computers than could be handled at the Service Desk by the front line \u201ctier 1\u201d CSSs.\n[13] Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi had a car accident outside of work in November of 2001 that was 100% not his fault. As a result of the injuries he sustained he was off work until January of 2002 and was then on a graduated return to work program, for the most part working half days, until May of 2003 when he returned to regular work hours.\n[14] Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi had another car accident outside of work that was also 100% not his fault in April of 2007. As a result of the injuries he sustained in this accident he was off work until he returned to work on February 23, 2009. Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was not on a graduated return to work program following this accident. From June 2007 to February 2009, this absence was without pay from MTS but Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi did receive income replacement benefits through the Manitoba Personal Injury Protection Plan.\n[15] After he returned to work he became ill on March 23, 2009 and, as a result, was off work on a leave of absence for illness until he resigned from MTS as at July 25, 2009.\n[16] MTS was acquired by BCE Inc. in March of 2017 before the last week of the hearing and is now known as Bell MTS. It is the primary telecommunications company in Manitoba and employs several thousand employees in Manitoba.\n[17] There is a series of events (the Events) during Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s career at MTS from about 2001 until 2009 that evidence was presented about at the hearing that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi feels establishes that MTS engaged in the discriminatory practices against him on the prohibited grounds, as alleged in his complaint. In his view, these Events ultimately caused him to suffer anxiety, nervousness and depression that resulted in him resigning from MTS, as of July 25, 2009.\n[18] Fourteen witnesses, who were all employees or former employees of MTS at some time during Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s career with MTS, testified at the hearing about these Events. The witnesses were as follows: For Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi, in addition to himself, Neil Wyrchowny, Ernest Desmarais, Qwin DeBrant and Ryan Bird testified at the hearing. For the Respondent, David Atwell, Stephen Grant, Glen Fryatt, Ryan Workman, Brenda Coutts, Brian Elliott, Rejean David, Caroline Taylor and Don Rooney testified.\n[19] Each of the Events are described by the following descriptive captions below, and will be elaborated on in further detail herein:\nRemarks made by David Atwell\nDenial of a second computer\nDenial of training requests\nUse of the \u201cnicknames\u201d \u201cCrash\u201d or \u201cKourash\u201d\nComments about Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s trips to Turkey and his work ethic\nRelegation to service desk\nHostile work environment\/TEAM meeting\nDenial of Promotion to Senior Client Support Specialist position\nFailure to provide accommodation for a disability through a gradual return to work program 2007-2009\nTreatment on return to work in 2009\nMTS Internal Investigation and Report\nEvent 1: Remarks made by David Atwell\n[20] David Atwell was a Supervisor in ISTM in the Hardware and Software Distribution division during part of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s career at MTS. He didn\u2019t actually directly supervise Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi, as he directly supervised employees who worked in the Hardware and Software Distribution division that provided hardware support to employees of MTS. Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi worked in the Workstation (Desktop) LAN Support division that, as stated, provided software support to computer users and was directly supervised by Neil Wyrchowny until 2003 and thereafter by Brenda Coutts (and by Brian Elliott in Brenda Coutts\u2019 absence) as his supervisors or \u201cTeam Leads\u201d.\n[21] The two divisions, while separate, fell under one Director. During the early part of the period of the complaint until about 2003 the Director was Ken Barchuck. He was followed by Rob Pettit until about 2005 who was then followed by Wayne Horseman. The two divisions had various interactions with each other in serving the information system technology needs of MTS employees. David Atwell thus interacted in the workplace with Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and they communicated with each other, from time to time, for both work related reasons and for casual reasons, such as breaks in the cafeteria for coffee and meals. MTS had several workplace locations in Winnipeg and both Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and David Atwell moved between some of these workplaces during the term of this complaint.\n[22] I accept the evidence at the hearing from Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and other witnesses that David Atwell made disparaging and offensive remarks to or about Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi, including remarks following the tragic events of the 9\/11 terrorist attack, that suggested that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was a member of Al-Qaeda and a terrorist.\n[23] The exact words that were used, the frequency that the remarks were made, the duration that the remarks continued for and whether management of MTS was aware of them, were the subject of varying accounts given by different witnesses. A number of the witnesses testified that, as a great deal of time had elapsed since the events took place, it was difficult for them to remember some things with complete clarity or certainty.\n[24] I find, on the evidence. that around the time of 9\/11 and for a period thereafter, David Atwell made remarks in the workplace to or about Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi along the lines of \u201cKouroush when are you going to show us your Al -Qaeda membership card?\u201d (on several occasions); and \u201cwe better check Kouroush\u2019s lunch to see if there is a bomb in there\u201d; and \u201cdon\u2019t get Kouroush angry or he will fly a jet into a building\u201d; and that Kouroush was a \u201csleeper cell\u201d; and that it would be best if \u201cwe bombed the Middle East back into the Stone Age\u201d. In addition to David Atwell making these remarks directly to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi, some of these remarks were also made in front of other employees and were known by a number of employees to have been made by David Atwell.\n[25] David Atwell claimed at the hearing that he didn\u2019t remember making the remarks to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi described in paragraph 24 above, as a result of certain memory deficiencies. He admitted that if other witnesses who gave evidence at the hearing, such as Neil Wyrchowny, said that he had made some of those remarks (like the Al-Qaeda remarks in particular) that he probably did make those remarks. He also admitted that it was possible that he made some of the other remarks referred to in paragraph 24 above. He admitted that it was wrong for him to have made those remarks; that he understands that the remarks were hurtful to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi; and that he is sorry for having made the remarks and for hurting Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi. He apologised to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi at the hearing as follows:\n\u201cMr. Ebadi, I know the things I said back then were hurtful and wrong. And I would like to apologize to you and I would like to sincerely ask for your forgiveness if you can find it. If you can\u2019t, I completely understand that, but I would like to apologize to you personally for that time in my life and yours.\u201d\nAfter making the above apology at the hearing in examination in chief, he later also stated as follows in response to questions in his cross examination:\n\u201cI admitted yesterday that the comments I made were inappropriate, were wrong, were hurtful. I stand by that apology and I hope that Kouroush can accept my apology. I hope that he can find it in his heart to forgive me at some point in his life, but again, I understand if he can\u2019t. I\u2019m not disputing that that was wrong.\u201d\n[26] MTS stated in its submissions that \u201cMTS does not dispute that in the days following 9\/11 and for a time thereafter that ended no later than 2003 ( the \u201cImpugned Period\u201d), Mr. Atwell made inappropriate comments to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi based on his ethnicity. MTS does not dispute that such comments amount to harassment under the Act.\u201d Further it also stated that \u201c...the reason that we have admitted harassment is because there are five or six comments about an Al-Qaeda card and I believe one about a bomb being brought to work by Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi in the wake of 9\/11, a very sensitive time. Those five or six comments at that time, constitutes harassment, we admit that. How far past that event, that is for the Tribunal to determine. We are not admitting anything further.\u201d\n[27] I accept the evidence given at the hearing that for a period of time David Atwell also regularly made derogatory and belittling comments, some of which were racist, about other people in the workplace. These comments included doing work \u201con Indian time\u201d, suggesting laziness in relation to an employee who was First Nations and comments to a Mennonite employee suggesting hypocrisy in the Mennonite teachings and practices in relation to liquor consumption.\n[28] There is no need to go into the further detail about the derogatory comments made by David Atwell about other people, as this case relates to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi, however, the facts are noted here for contextual purposes. David Atwell and many of the other witnesses at the hearing testified about his past inappropriate behaviour at MTS invoking descriptions of David Atwell as an \u201cequal opportunity jerk\u201d and a \u201cjunior high bully\u201d who would then regularly making ethnic remarks and other negative comments in the workplace that he considered to be \u201cjokes\u201d as part of a \u201clocker room\u201d atmosphere that existed then at MTS.\n[29] There was evidence from David Atwell and other witnesses that at that time he was loud, abusive and vulgar; that he would pick a target like Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and, if he got a rise, he would go after that person; and that he regularly made \u201cjokes\u201d about other people\u2019s ethnic backgrounds and race anywhere from 4 to 12 times a day. David Atwell stated in his evidence that he was then \u201cblissfully unaware of what he was doing and how it was affecting his co-workers.\u201d\n[30] In his evidence, David Atwell explained that he came from a military background. He was a member of the Canadian Army Reserves for 31 years. He retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in 2013. He was in command of the Fort Garry Horse Regiment in Winnipeg at the time of the 9\/11 terrorist attack and trained and supervised many of the soldiers from Winnipeg who served in Afghanistan. He explained that his behaviour at MTS at the time of 9\/11 and for a period thereafter, until he started to change with the help of mentoring by Wayne Horseman, was in part based upon this regimented military background and in part based upon personal problems he was having away from work and at home.\n[31] I find, on the evidence, including Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s evidence, that the remarks by David Atwell referenced in paragraph 24 above were made because of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s race, national or ethnic origin or religion and that they were serious, persistent and deeply hurtful to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi who complained about them to David Atwell and others.\n[32] Neil Wyrchowny, who witnessed the \u201cAl Qaeda membership card\u201d remarks, told Mr. Atwell, at the time, that those remarks were completely inappropriate and that he shouldn\u2019t be making remarks like that. Mr. Atwell laughed off Neil Wyrchowny\u2019s admonition about his remarks and continued his negative behaviour for some time thereafter, despite knowing that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi objected to the remarks.\n[33] Neil Wyrchowny did not report the \u201cAl Qaeda\u201d remarks to his supervisor Ken Barchuck or anyone else above him in management at MTS at the time because he felt that it would not make any difference if he did, given his view of management\u2019s indifferent attitudes about such things then.\n[34] There was no evidence that any written complaint was made to MTS management concerning David Atwell\u2019s disparaging comments and behaviour towards Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi prior to the internal complaint in 2009 that resulted in the Taylor internal MTS investigation discussed later in this decision, even though a number of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s colleagues knew about the comments and knew that the comments were not appreciated by Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi. There was evidence that management did discipline other employees, including Neil Wyrchowny, on occasions when they actually received written complaints about other employees\u2019 inappropriate behaviour that was contrary to MTS\u2019s Respectful Workplace Policy in effect at the time.\n[35] There was, however, evidence that management of MTS knew or ought to have known about David Atwell\u2019s behaviour towards Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi at the time the remarks were being made. In fact, David Atwell conceded in his cross examination that management \u201cshould have been aware\u201d. Stephen Grant, a credible witness called by MTS, testified that David Atwell\u2019s inappropriate actions \u201cmore than likely would have been known to management\u201d. Moreover, there was evidence that after Rob Pettit was replaced by Wayne Horseman in around 2005, Mr. Horseman mentored David Atwell in helping him to change his behaviour, suggesting that he knew that David Atwell\u2019s behaviour in the workplace needed to change. I accept the evidence from MTS\u2019 own witnesses that MTS knew or should have known about David Atwell\u2019s harassing behaviour towards Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi at the time as well as his intolerant attitude toward him because of his race, national or ethnic origin or religion, long before the internal investigation in 2009 by MTS.\n[36] I find on the evidence that it is probable that the frequency and persistence of hurtful comments and behaviour towards Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi by David Atwell based on his race, national or ethnic origin or religion was not limited to one or two or three specific instances such as the Al-Qaeda\/terrorist card comments. It was more frequent and persistent than that, particularly given David Atwell\u2019s own evidence about the frequency of his ethnic comments generally in paragraph 29 above, as well as Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and other witnesses\u2019 evidence about the frequency of comments to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi specifically.\n[37] While the open, direct, explicit racist or ethnic remarks by David Atwell about Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi being a member of Al Qaeda etc., as referred to in paragraph 24 above, appear to have stopped by sometime in 2003, I believe that David Atwell probably continued his bad behaviour to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi for some time after because at that time David Atwell was intolerant of his race, national or ethnic origin or religion.\n[38] I believe that David Atwell, by his own admissions about his behaviour generally at that time regarding making ethnic \u201cjokes\u201d frequently in the workplace and based upon his apology at the hearing, was then a racist and did not change or discontinue his offensive remarks and behaviour to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and others until some time later.\n[39] Exactly when that change started to take place was not absolutely clear from the evidence. Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi testified that the negative behaviour by David Atwell to him continued for a very long time after the events of 9\/11 although he gave few specifics besides the racist comments referred to in paragraph 24 above and the Events involving David Atwell related to the denial of a second computer and the training on the Win2K project and the use of the name \u201cCrash\u201d or \u201cKourash\u201d described later in this decision. There is no record of any racist comments by David Atwell either in the minutes of the TEAM union meeting in 2005, discussed later in this decision or in Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s comments about the workplace in his performance reviews (PP&Rs) that took place in 2004, 2005 or 2006.\n[40] There was a change in circumstances organizationally around 2003 that limited the verbal interactions between the David Atwell and Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi. Rob Pettit retired sometime in the first half of 2005 and was replaced by Wayne Horseman who began to mentor David Atwell to help him change his behaviour. One of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s witnesses testified that the harassing behaviour by David Atwell to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi continued until 2010 but that does not seem to be possible. A number of witnesses for both sides place the date of the change in David Atwell\u2019s behaviour some time in around 2004. My sense is that as of that date, or sometime shortly thereafter, David Atwell stopped harassing Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi.\n[41] A number of witnesses who testified about how deplorable David Atwell\u2019s behaviour was during the earlier part of the term of this complaint also testified that David Atwell was now a changed person and doesn\u2019t behave the way he used to and hasn\u2019t for some time. This was also David Atwell\u2019s evidence about himself. It is to be hoped that his apology and his regret for his past behaviour towards Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi as expressed at paragraph 25 above is genuine as is his claim that he is a changed person but still in the process of continuing to try to be a better person.\n[42] There was no evidence that any other person at MTS made disparaging racial, ethnic or religious remarks to or about Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi during his employment. Unfortunately, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was hurt by the intolerant remarks he suffered at the hands of David Atwell, based upon Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s race, national or ethnic origin or religion. I accept the evidence of David Atwell and Stephen Grant, who were both MTS\u2019s own witnesses, concerning MTS\u2019 knowledge of David Atwell\u2019s behaviour at paragraph 35 above. That evidence relates to a period of time when no action was taken by MTS to stop David Atwell\u2019s behaviour to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi--well before the internal investigation of David Atwell\u2019s comments and behaviour by MTS in 2009.\nEvent 2: Denial of a second computer\n[43] Soon after Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi became a permanent employee in June of 2001 he requested a second computer to do various tasks including testing new software systems and doing research for MTS and for educational purposes to assist him in maintaining his important Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer Certificate (MCSE). The above noted testing and research tasks were more efficiently done on a separate computer from the computer he was using to do his essential work of responding to work orders (\u201ctickets\u201d) to try to solve MTS employee computer problems. Many of the other CSS\u2019s had second computers for these purposes.\n[44] A request for a second computer was made on Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s behalf by Neil Wyrchowny to David Atwell, who controlled the issuance of hardware including second computers. The request was in accordance with the proper protocol for such requests as testified to by David Atwell --i.e. a request by the Team Lead. The request was for a used or recycled computer that was available, not for a new computer. MTS sold or disposed of its recycled computers but there were many at any time that were kept in storage pending sale or other disposal.\n[45] David Atwell refused the request from Neil Wyrchowny and subsequent requests made by Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi for a second computer. Various reasons were given for the refusal of the request to have a second computer, including directions from management to not provide second computers unless a solid business case was made and also to set an example.\n[46] David Atwell testified that the business case was not provided in enough detail, although the evidence was that Neil Wyrchowny requested it for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi in an email to David Atwell for what appears to be a legitimate business reasons--maintaining his valuable MCSE certification.\n[47] There were as many as 200-300 recycled computers in storage available at the time of the request. The evidence was that unlike Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi, many of his co-workers simply took second computers from storage and used them without asking David Atwell and without encountering any problem. One witness testified the David Atwell had actually told him to \u201cjust...take one.\u201d Neil Wyrchowny couldn\u2019t remember anyone else actually being refused a second computer when requested by a supervisor.\n[48] In my view, based on the evidence, the reasons for the refusal by David Atwell to issue the second computer at that time, are not convincing. I find that David Atwell\u2019s refusal, when many others in Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s position had recycled second computers for the same reasons he was requesting one, was at least, in part, a result of David Atwell\u2019s intolerant thinking at the time about Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi as a person because of his race, national or ethnic origin or religion, as borne out in the evidence about David Atwell\u2019s behaviour towards Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi at the time as described in Event I above.\nEvent 3: Denial of training requests\n[49] This Event was considerably narrowed at the hearing to relate to David Atwell\u2019s refusal of a request on behalf of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi by his supervisor Neil Wyrchowny to be put Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi on the \u201cWin2K\u201d project related Microsoft\u2019s then new software operating system.\n[50] David Atwell agreed in evidence that he could have put Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi on this project. This may have resulted in Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi being entitled to a second computer. On the evidence, in my opinion, there does not appear to be any factually based rationale for the refusal of this request made on behalf of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi by his supervisor at the time, Neil Wyrchowny.\n[51] In my opinion, David Atwell\u2019s refusal of this request is closely tied to his refusal of the request for a second computer explained above. This refusal by David Atwell, in my opinion, was based, in part, on David Atwell\u2019s intolerant attitude and behaviour at the time towards Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s because of his race, national or ethnic origin or religion. It was consistent with the inappropriate behaviour that David Atwell admitted to in his apology to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi referred to in paragraph 25 above.\nEvent 4: Use of the \u201cnicknames\u201d \u201cCrash\u201d or \u201cKourash\u201d\n[52] In June of 2001, before Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s first car accident, an email complimentary of his work was sent by one of his co-workers referring to his name as \u201cKurash\u201d. This may have been either a mistake or a play on his ethnic name but Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi let his co-workers know that he didn\u2019t appreciate the name and it stopped for awhile.\n[53] After his first car accident, when he was on graduated return to work, the name \u201cKrash\u201d, or \u201cCrash\u201d or \u201cKourash\u201d began to be used by various persons including David Atwell and others.\n[54] The use of the \u201cnicknames\u201d was not appreciated by Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and he complained to his co-workers that he did not like their use of these names but they continued to be used intermittently during his career at MTS.\n[55] The last use of the \u201cnickname\u201d was in the subject line of an email Glen Fryatt forwarded to him through Brenda Coutts on his return to work in 2009, concerning the loss of his administrative access identification explained later.\n[56] Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi testified that he felt that that use of the names made him a \u201claughing stock\u201d and brought back bad memories of very serious and painful injuries he suffered in car accidents that were not his fault.\n[57] Several witnesses at the hearing including Brenda Coutts, Glen Fryatt and David Atwell testified that in retrospect they understood that, as opposed to other \u201cnicknames\u201d used in the workplace that may have been lighthearted or even complimentary, these nicknames were not complimentary. They testified that in retrospect they could understand why Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi would not want to be called those names as they were insensitive and inappropriate given his serious car accidents and injuries.\n[58] Glen Fryatt testified that he apologized to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi in the hallway outside of the hearing for using the \u201cnicknames\u201d. Brenda Coutts testified that referring the Glen Fryatt email to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi with the subject line reference of \u201cKurash\u201d was worthy of an apology. David Atwell testified that he \u201ctried to stop\u201d but it is not clear when this occurred.\n[59] At all material times during the period of this complaint, MTS had a Respectful Workplace Policy in place. The \u201cnicknames\u201d might have offended the policy but there was no formal complaint made by Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi or anyone else about them under this policy until the internal MTS complaint was made in 2009 prompting the Taylor investigation discussed later in this decision.\n[60] I accept the evidence of the witnesses at the hearing that the use of the \u201cnicknames\u201d stemmed from Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s driving and his car accidents and were not related to his race, ethnicity or religion. I also accept the fact that, as they related to his car accidents from which he suffered serious injuries, that they were hurtful and unacceptable to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi to hear.\nEvent 5: Comments about Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s trips to Turkey and his work ethic\n[61] In his complaint and Re-amended Statement of Particulars, the Complainant alleges that Brian Elliott made a number of negative and disparaging comments in the workplace about Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u201cfaking\u201d illness and taking trips to Turkey during his sick leave absences and about having a poor work ethic.\n[62] The time period referred to in the complaint that these comments were made by Brian Elliott was after his first car accident and also specifically in the Fall of 2005. It was alleged by Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi in his complaint that at that time another employee overheard Brian Elliott say that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was \u201cfaking it and probably taking a trip to Turkey\u201d when he was on sick leave.\n[63] At the hearing there was evidence by several witnesses that Brenda Coutts also made disparaging and negative comments in the workplace suggesting that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was faking injuries and taking trips to Turkey when he was on sick leave and questioning his work ethic and commitment to his job. Brian Elliott and Brenda Coutts both denied making these comments in their evidence.\n[64] Brian Elliott admitted in evidence that he wasn\u2019t a \u201cfan of Kouroush\u2019s work ethic\u201d in the early years, even though he didn\u2019t supervise him and couldn\u2019t explain his rationale or impression for forming that opinion based on anything concrete.\n[65] Several of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s peers testified that there was a lot of gossip and chatter among his co-workers about a perception that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was faking illness and taking trips to Turkey while he was on sick leave. There was evidence that, as a result of this perception, some of his peers resented Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi because his sick leave absences resulted in them having to do more work and be under greater pressure to make up for his absence from work.\n[66] There was no evidence presented that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s absences from work for illness were in any way unjustified from a medical stand point or that his injuries from the car accidents were not real or that any trips he took to Turkey, including to visit his mother who was ill, were in any way illegitimate. Further, there was no evidence from his supervisors Neil Wyrchowny or Brenda Coutts that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was a poor performer or had a poor work ethic. His performance reviews by Brenda Coutts were generally positive.\n[67] There was conflicting evidence about this Event. On balance, I find Brian Elliott and Brenda Coutts\u2019 denials about having made these comments to be credible and more consistent and convincing than the accounts of this Event by others. Brian Elliott and Brenda Coutts did not appear to waiver in their evidence in this regard and in my opinion were credible in their denials.\n[68] On the other hand, there was vagueness and inconsistency with respect to the evidence of others about who made the comments and when and where they were made. For example, Ryan Workman who Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi claimed to have overheard the 2005 comments by Brian Elliott, could not recall in his evidence that this actually occurred. Neil Wyrchowny gave very vague evidence where he suggested that he only recently remembered such comments having been made by Brian Elliott but couldn\u2019t remember where or when. Neil Wyrchowny had told a Commission investigator years earlier that he didn\u2019t recall these comments.\n[69] In any event, I can find no evidence that even if these comments were made that they would have been made in relation to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s race, ethnicity or religion. There was no evidence presented that either of Brian Elliott or Brenda Coutts made racist, ethnic or anti-Muslim comments to or about Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi. Nor am I able to infer that they were influenced by the racist comments made by David Atwell referred to in paragraph 24 above so as to discriminate against Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi on the basis of his race, national or ethnic origin or religion.\nEvent 6: Relegation to Service Desk\n[70] As noted above, there were two \u201ctiers\u201d of CSSs. Tier 1 CSSs worked at the \u201cService Desk\u201d and attempted to solve problems encountered by computer users at the \u201cfront line\u201d so to speak. If the problem couldn\u2019t be solved by the Service Desk it would be sent to the Tier 2 CSSs who would receive a \u201cticket\u201d (i.e. work order) to attempt to solve the problem. As such, by and large, the more complex work was done by the Tier 2 CSSs and the perception was that the Service Desk was a \u201cstep down\u201d for Tier 2 CSSs.\n[71] The Complainant raised this matter in his complaint, referring to a period in 2005 where he alleged that Brenda Coutts, Brian Elliott and Rob Pettit were attempting to \u201cshove\u201d him into the Service Desk position but that it didn\u2019t happen as a result of efforts by his co-workers to prevent it. There was no mention of this matter in his Re-amended Statement of Particulars.\n[72] At the hearing there was evidence that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was one of several of the Tier 2 CSSs who took a turn at the service desk for several months.\n[73] The suggested corporate purpose at the time of this initiative was to cross train CSSs to improve their experience and knowledge in order to better serve the users. However, it was also the evidence of some witnesses the that the people chosen first by MTS to do their stint on the service desk were those perceived to be on management\u2019s \u201cshit list\u201d and that this was punishment for poor performance and troublemaking.\n[74] Brenda Coutts, who made the selection of who served on the service desk from her group, testified that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was not in conflict with her at that time but he was one of the employees who did a turn for several months there.\n[75] Although the matter was not grieved, it was clear that there were concerns and opposition expressed by a number of the employees affected by the service desk initiative. MTS terminated the initiative around 2005 in part, as a result of these concerns and opposition.\n[76] It is to be noted that that both Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and another witness who did a turn on the service desk expressed the opinion that their experience on the service desk was actually helpful. Further, the group that did their turns included employees who had no distinguishing protected characteristics.\n[77] The evidence was that it was a group, not Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi alone, who were chosen for this initiative. I am not able to find on the evidence that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was sent to the service desk because of his race, national or ethnic origin or religion.\nEvent 7: Hostile Work Environment\/TEAM meeting\n[78] This is not an Event, as such, but rather relates to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and other witnesses\u2019 perceptions about conditions in their department during the Rob Pettit period that some described as \u201ctoxic\u201d. It was not included as an item in either the complaint or in the Re-amended Statement of Particulars.\n[79] On September 14, 2004 a meeting was held by Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and a number of his co-workers who were also members of TEAM. The Minutes of the meeting were part of the evidence at the hearing. A number of the employees who attended the meeting, including Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi, Neil Wyrchowny, Stephen Grant, Ryan Workman, Qwin DeBrant, and Ernest Desmarais were witnesses at the hearing. According to the Minutes, the following items were raised with the TEAM Executive reps who also attended the meeting:\n1. Job titles changes-combining pay scales\n2. Acting assignments-selection and length\n3. Selection and compensation for CSSs who were appointed as site primes for particular work location\n4. Bullying-actively encouraged by Rob Pettit - \u201cdog house\u201d system of discipline for taking any contrary stand and then becoming a target-\u201cfavored\u201d employees given job opportunities and opportunities to advance\n5. Training-lack of relevant training and training given to \u201cfavored\u201d people\n6. Compensation differences\n7. Innovation thinking not accepted\n8. Unrealistic expectations for job performance\n9. Different rules for BT&IT\n10. Process driven not Client Driven-- Rob Pettit has an unchanging closed door policy\n11. Lack of confidence in ITSM management team\n12. Staffing issues-vacancies not filled or filled with \u201cActing\u201d jobs resulting in \u201cunbearable\u201d stress levels\n[80] Items 1 and 6 above were the only two items that were covered under the heading \u201cPriorities\u201d in the Minutes of the meeting.\n[81] Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s comments at the meeting were covered in the Minutes as follows: \u201cNew jobs (promotions-advancements) usually created as acting positions\u201d\n[82] None of the matters that were discussed at the meeting were grieved under the collective agreement with MTS. Brenda Coutts gave evidence that she became aware of the meeting and the Minutes after it was held and that management were probably aware of the items but that no follow up was taken by MTS to address any of the items other than to terminate the service desk rotation initiative.\n[83] Ryan Workman testified that Brian Elliott told him not to grieve the service desk issue and \u201cnot to rock the boat\u201d. Ryan Workman testified that after Rob Pettit retired the work atmosphere improved.\n[84] There was evidence given Ryan Workman, who was a very credible witness, that at the time of the meeting, the conduct of some of the so called \u201cBad Dog Box\u201d group that included him, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and several others, may have been somewhat less than exemplary for doing things like taking longer lunches and other breaks than permitted.\n[85] The Minutes and the evidence about the meeting clearly indicate that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and his co-workers at the time were unhappy and frustrated about some of the conditions that existed arising out of actions or inactions by management of MTS-- in particular by the leadership of Rob Pettit.\n[86] Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and some of his co-workers who gave evidence at the hearing felt that they were on a \u201cshit list\u201d of management and were not treated well or fairly as a result, leading to their perception that the atmosphere there then was \u201ctoxic\u201d.\n[87] None of the items described in paragraph 79 above, however, were particular to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi as opposed to the group of concerned employees, most of whom had no distinguishing protected characteristics. Nor were the matters specifically related to grounds specified in the complaint. As such, I do not feel that this Event establishes behaviour by MTS against Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi based upon his race, national or ethnic origin or religion.\nEvent 8: Denial of Promotion to Senior Client Support Specialist (Site Prime) position\n[88] In the various MTS locations or sites in Winnipeg that CSSs worked there were CSSs identified as \u201cSite Primes\u201d who, as the term implies, were ranked above the other CSSs. There was a pay differential for taking on this added responsibility and it was seen as a promotion. Prior to 2006, the positions were all established in an acting capacity. As such, the acting Site Primes had been appointed on the recommendations of Brian Elliott and Brenda Coutts, as the two Team Leads that supervised the acting Site Primes, not through a job competition process. Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi served for two months in an acting Site Prime position to fill a temporary absence on one occasion but for the most part the incumbents were in the acting positions for much lengthier periods of time.\n[89] In 2006 MTS decided to fill these positions on a permanent basis and opened a competition for the jobs of which there were six positions to be filled.\n[90] Article 8 of the Collective Agreement between Team and MTS governs the posting and filling of vacant positions in the bargaining unit.\n[91] MTS has a process that is to apply in job competitions. Pursuant to that process MTS:\nposts the job vacancy in accordance with the Collective Agreement;\nreceives and assesses all applicants for the vacancy against the criteria identified in the particular posting;\npre-screens out those applicants whose applications indicate they do not possess the criteria set out in the job posting or whose attendance levels or work performance is unacceptable;\ninterviews those applicants whose applications indicate they meet the criteria in the job posting and have acceptable attendance levels and work performance;\nawards the position.\n[92] In 2006 Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi, among others, applied to fill approximately six vacant Site Prime positions. To fill the vacancies MTS executed the process outlined in paragraph 91.\n[93] Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi met the criteria set out in the job posting and had acceptable attendance levels and work performance. As such, along with eight other applicants he was interviewed by a three person panel consisting of Brian Elliott, Brenda Coutts and Cathy Hanischuk-Morris, a Human Resources recruiting specialist whose duties included recruiting both internal and external applicants for vacancies. The panel interviewed applicants who were not pre-screened out of the process.\n[94] Normally, MTS would use a three person panel consisting of the supervisor for the job vacancy, a \u201cneutral\u201d person from another department who was not involved with the job and an HR specialist to guide the process. Since the applicants for these particular six jobs were going to be supervised separately by both Brenda Coutts and Brian Elliott (three each), as the two Team Leads for these positions, it was decided by MTS that it would be more efficient to have both Team Leads on the panel and not use a neutral person from another department on the panel.\n[95] Most, if not all, of the incumbent acting Site Primes, all of whom had been recommended for the existing acting positions by either Brenda Coutts or Brian Elliott, applied for the permanent positions and were granted interviews.\n[96] The process involved the following:\nThe qualifications for the job description were prepared by Brian Elliott and Brenda Coutts based on an existing precedent for the Site Prime position;\nIn advance of the interviews, the interview questions were drafted, as was an interview key which indicated what constituted a good answer. There were two types of questions: technical and core competency. Brenda Coutts and Brian Elliott drafted the technical questions and answer and Cathy Hanischuk-Morris drafted the core competency question;\nIn advance of the interview, a scoring system based on 100 points was created, 5 points were allocated to the presentation of the interview, the remaining 95 points were allocated to responses to interview questions. Of those remaining points, approximately 60 percent were allocated to technical questions and 40 percent to core competency questions. Each question was allocated a maximum point value that varied from question to question. Brian Elliott and Brenda Coutts determined the point values for the technical questions. Cathy Hanischuk-Morris determined the point values for the core competency questions. In order to obtain the position the applicant would have to pass a pre-determined scoring threshold;\nIn advance of the interviews, Cathy Hanischuk-Morris instructed the panel that the same question had to be asked of each applicant in the same order by the same person and there was to be no prompting or other assistance given;\nCathy Hanischuk-Morris explained how the interview process would be conducted to each applicant immediately before the applicant started;\nEach applicant\u2019s interview would be scored immediately after it ended and before the next applicant would be interviewed. All three members of the panel had equal input on the scoring of each individual question and the panel would come to a consensus on a score for each question. During the process the panel compared notes on how the applicant\u2019s answers compared to the answer key. A final score for the interview was arrived at by adding up all the individual scores;\nOnce all of the applicants were interviewed and scored, the panel met again to consider if the scoring adjustments were necessary. The purpose of this meeting was to ensure consistency in scoring throughout all of the interviews such that the applicants were not penalized for their scoring depending on when they were interviewed relative to other applicants;\nUltimately a final ranking of candidates was arrived at on the interview scores. Since there were six available Site Prime positions, the top six ranked applicants would be offered the positions, provided they passed the scoring threshold.\n[97] Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was not offered a position. The positions were offered and accepted by the six acting Site Prime applicants. Rejean David was ranked 7th in the competition, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was ranked 8th and Qwin DeBrant was ranked 9th. A number of months after the competition, a Site Prime vacancy opened up and MTS appointed Rejean David to fill the vacancy without a competition.\n[98] The results of the job competition were not grieved and the documentation relating to the job competition, including documents showing what the actual interview scores were or how they were calculated was no longer available for the purposes of this inquiry.\n[99] Evidence at the hearing about this Event was given by Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi, Brenda Coutts, Brian Elliott and Don Rooney who was the MTS Director of Labour Relations, Safety and Environment at all material times and still holds that position.\n[100] Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s evidence was that the competition was predetermined by Brenda Coutts and Brian Elliott to assist and advance their favourites--the incumbents whom they had appointed to the acting positions and were thereby placed in an advantageous position in the competition. Further, he felt that the decision was impacted by previous negative jokes and comments made about him by David Atwell and Brenda Coutts including those in reference to his trips to Turkey and his absences for work on sick leave and his work ethic.\n[101] Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi also questioned the process of not having a truly neutral third panel member involved rather than either Brenda Coutts or Brian Elliott who he claimed didn\u2019t like him. Finally, he questioned the results in terms of his greater seniority over some of the successful applicants and in terms of his superior technical knowledge, education, and competence in comparison to some of the other successful applicants in his opinion.\n[102] Brenda Coutts\u2019 evidence was that the process described in paragraph 96 above was strictly followed in this case and that despite there being no \u201cneutral\u201d person it was carried out exactly the same way as in previous competitions that she was involved in.\n[103] Brenda Coutts\u2019 evidence was that while the incumbents likely had an advantage because of their experience in acting in the Site Prime positions for extended periods of time, the results of the competition were based entirely on the interview scores and not predetermined or based on any favouritism toward incumbents or upon the race, religion or ethnicity of any applicant. She testified that half the six successful applicants were visible minorities (two were Filipino and one was Aboriginal) and that two thirds of the applicants who were unsuccessful were Caucasian males.\n[104] Specifically, Brenda Coutts testified that while Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s score met or exceeded the minimum threshold qualifying him to hold the position, his score was 8th out of the 9 applicants who were interviewed. She testified that while he scored well on the technical questions he did not score as well on the on the core competency questions.\n[105] Brian Elliott\u2019s evidence corroborated Brenda Coutts\u2019 evidence. He also testified that the panel composition was dictated by HR. Further, he testified while that Cathy Hanischuk-Morris only scored the core competency questions as she was not familiar with the technical questions. Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi performance was stronger on the technical questions than on the core competency questions. He testified that while Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was better than Rejean David on the technical side, Mr. David scored higher than Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi in the interview. He testified that seniority played no role in the interview process and that he did not bring any biases about Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi into the interview process.\n[106] Don Rooney did not participate in the 2006 Site Prime job competition but he gave evidence about the process in general terms from an HR perspective. He confirmed that the process for the 2006 competition was completely in conformity with the process for all other MTS competitions during the period from 1989 to 2015 across three bargaining units at MTS.\n[107] Don Rooney testified that this was not the first time there was more than one hiring manager on a job completion. It happens in all three bargaining units at MTS where there are multiple vacancies that span across two managers. He was not aware that it had happened in a TEAM bargaining unit prior to 2006 but it has happened since. When there are two hiring managers with respect to a job competition the composition of the interview panel is each hiring manager and the HR person. This is dictated by the HR representative. It saves MTS resources to conduct job competitions in this manner rather than having more than one set of job competitions conducted for the same positions.\n[108] I found the evidence of Brenda Coutts, Brian Elliott and Don Rooney to be very clear and consistent about this Event. I found all of these witnesses to be credible in their evidence about the Event. Their evidence was not contradicted, in my opinion, by anything presented by Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and did not leave me with any impression that the manner by which the process and interviews were handled was unfair or biased against Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi in any way.\n[109] I found Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s evidence to be self-serving and impressionistic about this Event. He didn\u2019t convince me that any of the applicants, including Rejean David, who were offered positions as a result of their performance on the interview were equally qualified or less qualified than he was but lacked the distinguishing feature which is the gravamen of his complaint.\n[110] Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi also testified at the hearing about his view that he was treated unfairly in not being assigned to acting Prime Site roles by Brenda Coutts other than the one time mentioned above. He testified that he felt that this was proof of a bias by Brenda Coutts against him as she made the appointments for the group of CSSs he was a part of who reported to her. He had cited \u201cacting positions\u201d as a problem during the TEAM meeting described in Event 7 above, although the Minutes on this are not specific. He said he felt that these acting opportunities that turned out to be long term improved the actors\u2019 chances for training and moving up in the organization. In any case, it doesn\u2019t appear that he raised this issue with Brenda Coutts in any of his performance reports or with Neil Wyrchowny who he was very close with and who was the originator of the acting Site Prime positions. He was not able to identify an acting opportunity that went to anyone equally qualified or less qualified than him but lacking the distinguishing feature which is the gravamen of his complaint.\n[111] Brenda Coutts testified that she was unaware of his concern in this regard and that after his acting turn she wrote very favourably to Wayne Horseman about that assignment and alluded to his good work in his next performance evaluation. She also testified that following his unsuccessful application for the permanent Site Prime positions he wrote an email about his disappointment and she spoke with him and counselled him to improve his skills that were lacking and to keep trying. Wayne Horseman also counselled him in the same way. Brenda Coutts testified that her choices of acting Site Primes were limited but were not based on race, ethnicity or religion. I believe she was credible in her evidence and accept that evidence for this Event.\nEvent 9: Failure to provide accommodation for a disability through a gradual return to work program 2007-2009\n[112] As noted in paragraphs 4 to 8 inclusive above, this Event and the prohibited ground of disability was not included in Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s complaint or his Re-amended Statement of Particulars. The Commission decided not to deal with an additional complaint to cover this Event, filed by Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi after the adjournment of this hearing on June 18, 2014. The additional complaint was therefore neither investigated or referred by the Commission to the Tribunal for an inquiry. The Commission\u2019s decision was not judicially reviewed. After the Commission\u2019s decision, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi removed language relating to this Event including both the prohibited grounds of race and disability from his proposed amended Statement of Particulars in a new re-amended Statement of Particulars. The Event is included herein as an Event, despite the foregoing, because after the evidence phase of the hearing had concluded, counsel for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi included it in his written arguments filed and exchanged with MTS on May 15, 2017 and also in his oral arguments that were made on May 19, 2017.\n[113] MTS provided a gradual return to work program for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi after his first car accident in 2001, as described in paragraph 13 above. MTS did not provide a gradual return to work program for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi after his second car accident, as described in paragraph 14 above.\n[114] Des Hathaway was assigned by MTS in May 11, 2007 to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi as a Return to Work Coordinator from an outside independent firm. He was not called as witness at the hearing, although various correspondence and a summary of notes he kept during the period from 2007 to 2009 were attached to the Agreed Statement of Facts of the parties that was entered as an Exhibit at the hearing. These notes were not referred to at the hearing in any significant way.\n[115] From the evidence at the hearing, it appears that on the direction of Wayne Horseman, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was not provided a graduated return to work program until he was deemed to be 100% fit to return to work. However, there was scant evidence at the hearing of what actually transpired with respect to graduated return to work opportunities for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi at the time and his capacity and willingness to return on a graduated basis. Wayne Horseman was not called as a witness at the hearing nor were any medical practitioners, nor, as stated was Des Hathaway.\n[116] Don Rooney, who was not involved in this Event, testified, in part, as follows:\n\u201cNo. I think in this case -- I mean I don\u2019t know -- I wasn\u2019t involved in this case back then, I wasn\u2019t involved in the decision-making process. From what I see, Mr. Horseman, who is no longer with the company, was allowed to say, \u2018I\u2019m putting my foot down. We\u2019re not accommodating.\u2019 If that decision was brought up to Bill Kominsky for example, who I would think was looking after the accommodation piece at that time, he would have brought it to me and we absolutely would have said, \u2018Wayne Horseman, you're wrong. I know you have budgets to meet, but this is bigger than your departmental budget. You must accommodate him.\u2019\u201d\n[117] Don Rooney also testified that MTS\u2019 practice during 2007 to 2009 was to accommodate employees who required a graduated return to work program from a disability.\nEvent 10: Treatment on return to work in 2009\n[118] This Event captures number of incidents that occurred after Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s return to work on February 23, 2009 that he feels demonstrates that MTS was insensitive and unwelcoming to him as an employee who was returning to work after almost two years off because of serious injuries sustained in a car accident that was not his fault. He feels that this treatment is further evidence of discrimination.\n(a) no Administrative Level Access provided\n[119] On his first day back at work on February 23, 2009 Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi discovered that he did not have full Administrative Level Access to all of the MTS systems. Such access was necessary in order for him to do his job. Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi had to spend some time and effort to get this fixed. Brenda Coutts sent Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi an email early that afternoon to confirm that Glen Fryatt had reset the access for him. The subject of her email was \u201cKrash\u2019s Admin ID\u201d. Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi felt that this reference was insensitive to him after suffering serious injuries and showed that MTS was not serious about his return to work.\n(b) initial refusal of holidays for Turkish holiday of Nevruz\n[120] As well, on his first day back to work on February 23, 2009 Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi had a meeting with his supervisor Brenda Coutts who was not well that day but came in to work to meet with Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi. A memo summarizing that meeting was prepared by Brenda Coutts and emailed to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi that day. The email included references suggesting that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi ask for assistance, if needed, with respect to lifting things; about the expectation that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi not request time off for the next two weeks during his retraining as such requests would not be approved; and that Brenda Coutts would be away on holidays until March 16, 2009. Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was also informed by Brenda Coutts that he needed to take his 5 days of accumulated holidays before the end of April that year or they would be lost.\n[121] On or about March 10, 2009 Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi advised Brian Elliott, who was acting as his supervisor while Brenda Coutts was still on holidays, that he wished to book vacation on March 12 and 13, 2009 to observe the traditional Turkish cultural holiday of Nevruz, celebrating the New Year. Nevruz is the spring equinox that actually falls on or about March 21 but it is celebrated on four Wednesdays before the actual date none of which would have fallen on March 12 or 13 in 2009. There was some conflicting evidence between Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and Brenda Coutts about whether he had initially requested the days off for Nevruz or for a personal matter.\n[122] Brian Elliott initially refused the request on the basis of his mistaken understanding that it was contrary to Brenda Coutts\u2019 directive about not requesting time off and also because it was too late in order to adequately deal with employee scheduling. A heated exchange of emails between Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and Brian Elliott ensued. Eventually, after elevating the refusal of the request, Wayne Horseman granted Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi the holidays. After Brenda Coutts returned from her holiday she admonished Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi in an email about the tone of his emails to Brian Elliott and Wayne Horseman.\n[123] Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi felt that the initial refusal was unreasonable and unfair and would not have happened but for his ethnicity. He felt it made him feel stressed and anxious about his return to the workplace.\n(c) inadequate retraining\n[124] As noted in paragraph 120 above, there was an expectation that there would be a period of retraining for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi when he returned to the workplace on February 23, 2009 after being away from work for so long.\n[125] There was no formal retraining program put in place, rather Brenda Coutts expected that for the first two weeks, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi would \u201cself-train\u201d by asking his Site Prime, Rejean David, questions and by taking \u201ceasy\u201d tickets. While Brenda Coutts advised a number of CSS\u2019 to be aware of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s return to work and to assist him she didn\u2019t actually sit down with Rejean David and give him direction on her expectations.\n[126] What occurred, from Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi perspective, was that he was not given meaningful retraining despite needing help in technical matters as the world of technology changed so rapidly in the period of time that he was away from the workplace. He testified that Rejean David was not really available to him when he needed help and that, while he got some help from some of his colleagues, it was insufficient and showed MTS\u2019 lack of interest in him. As a result he looked incompetent to his colleagues and the user community and he felt depressed.\n[127] Rejean David, who was a very credible witness, testified that he did not receive any specific instructions from Brenda Coutts about a retraining program for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi. He testified that he was often too busy to answer questions but he also testified that he felt that when Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi returned to work he seemed very withdrawn and unhappy. He also testified that the retraining given to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was essentially the same that he had observed with other people coming back to work. He had a cubicle right beside Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and he testified that whenever he asked Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi how things were going Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi simply said he was \u201cOK\u201d.\n[128] Brenda Coutts\u2019 testimony with respect to this incident included the following:\nshe made arrangements for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi that were consistent with how Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi, on a previous return to work from a disability and others returning from medical leave or being introduced or re-introduced into the workplace are treated; and\nshe was unaware of a need to provide Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi with any additional support or training as Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi had never informed her of such a need and had left a message with Des Hathaway on March 3, 2009 that \u201cMTS was being lenient and that he had no complaints\u201d and had emailed Brian Elliott indicating that he had caught up quickly; and\nshe had directed Rejean David to assist and mentor Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and had approached other peers of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi to assist and support him on his return to work; and\nshe was told after she returned from her holidays by Rejean David and others that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s transition was not as smooth as she had been led to believe but the information she received was that he wasn\u2019t engaging and seemed detached.\n(d) loss of computer hard drive information\n[129] When Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was away his computer was given to another employee. Typically, when an employee is absent for a prolonged period of time his or her computer is assigned to another employee but the contents of the hard drive are supposed to be stored on a compact disc so that when the employee returns he can access the data again. Normally the data goes back to the manager of the employee who returns it to the employee on his return. Some employees don\u2019t use the hard drive but store their data on a server but that was not the case for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi.\n[130] Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s computer was reassigned in compliance with normal procedure but the contents of his hard drive were not stored on a compact disc, contrary to company policy. This deprived Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi of important information both for professional and personal reasons and he was frustrated and upset by this.\n[131] Brenda Coutts had given James Dondo another CSS the task of saving Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s hard drive information but, unknown to Ms. Coutts, Mr. Dondo failed to carry out this task. She did not follow up with him to retrieve Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s stored data on a disc until the request by Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi on his return to work. After checking into this Ms. Coutts realized that the data had not been saved by Mr. Dondo on a disc as he was instructed to do.\n[132] When Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi raised this problem with Brenda Coutts, on the first day of her return to work from her holidays on March 16, 2009, a heated exchange of emails ensued. Initially after Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi asked about it, Ms. Coutts responded that Mr. Dondo had not archived the data as he was supposed to. Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi then sarcastically responded \u201cWay to go ISTM\u201d to which Brenda Coutts then responded \u201cSuck it up...shit happens\u201d. Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi then responded \u201c\u2026act like a lady if you don\u2019t wanna act like a manager\u2026\u201d to which Brenda Coutts responded by warning Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u201cCareful you are bordering on insubordination. There is nothing I can do\u201d.\n[133] Subsequently, on the same day Brenda Coutts and Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi had a meeting where she apologised to him for her comments and Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi claims he also apologised to her which Brenda Coutts denies. After the meeting, Brenda Coutts sent him an email summarizing the meeting which included her apology and acknowledgment to him that her comments were unprofessional and that she understood his frustration. She did not mention any apology from him to her. Further, the email went on to admonish him for his emails to her and his requests for vacation time while she was away. This made Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi feel unwelcome again and that he was being discriminated against.\n[134] Later that day after receiving Brenda Coutts\u2019 email, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi left work complaining of chest pains and attended St. Boniface General Hospital. He was discharged from the hospital on that day.\n[135] Between February 23, 2009 and March 23, 2009, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was at work for 14 days between absences for illness and holidays. Of these dates Brenda Coutts was at work for 5 of those days. Des Hathaway reported on March 3, 2009 that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi had expressed to him that his return to work after the initial week with accommodated duties had gone \u201cok\u201d. Mr. Hathaway reported on March 5, 2009 that when he spoke to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi that day about an illness that he was away from work for on March 3rd and 4th he received information that the problem was apparently resolving itself.\n[136] On March 23rd Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi departed from work during the day leaving Brenda Coutts a note simply saying that he was ill and was going to his doctor. On that date a letter was issued by Dr. Groohi of the Red River Medical Clinic in Winnipeg saying that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi would need to be off work from March, 24 to April, 24, 2009 \u201cdue to his illness\u201d. March 23rd was Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s last day on the job. Des Hathaway spoke to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi on March 25th and reported that his illness then was not related to his previous illnesses.\n[137] By April of 2009 Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi had moved to Vancouver and was being treated there by Dr. Samborski. Initially, through contacts that Des Hathaway made with Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and with Dr. Samborski on April 16, 2009, he thought that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi would be able to return to work on about April 24, 2009, and efforts were underway for his return to work. However, on April 26, 2009 Dr. Samborski issued a note saying that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi would be off work \u201cdue to illness\u201d until July 25th.\n[138] On May 15, 2009 Des Hathaway wrote to Dr. Samborski asking for information to help MTS make arrangements for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi to return to work with accommodation if necessary. Des Hathaway noted that it appeared that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s absence then was not related to physical problems but rather due to stress from work conditions. He forwarded a Return to Work program form for Dr. Samborski to complete.\n[139] Dr. Samborski completed and signed the form on May 22, 2009. In his comments he indicated that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was being treated for a non-physical ailment and while he hoped that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi could return to work at some time in the next 4-6 weeks but that he would not be able to return to his old job and was not \u201cplanning on a return to MTS\u201d.\n[140] I accept Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s evidence that the actions of Brenda Coutts and others at MTS in the incidents described in this Event frustrated and upset him and made him feel unwelcome on his return to work. Mistakes were made and inappropriate and heated emails were exchanged. I cannot, however, infer or find, from the evidence before me, that any of these incidents were related to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s race, national or ethnic origin or religion. In reviewing the evidence, I also do not believe that anyone at MTS other than David Atwell exhibited racist behaviour towards Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi during his employment with MTS.\nEvent 11: MTS internal investigation and report\n[141] On March 25, 2009 Team wrote a letter on behalf of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi to Sandy Adelman, MTS\u2019 Employment Equity Specialist, advising her among other things, that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi believes he was subjected to racial harassment, bullying and discrimination for many years. The letter included references to the David Atwell comments; the \u201cCrash nickname\u201d; the \u201cunwelcome\u201d reception upon his return in 2009; the initial refusal of holidays for Nevruz; the lack of advancement opportunities; the refusal of the second computer--all resulting in him being on sick leave at that time for anxiety and depression. There was no mention in the letter of Event 9 described herein.\n[142] The letter was considered an Internal Complaint under MTS\u2019 Harassment and Respectful Workplace Policy that was in place during the entire period of this complaint. It was referred to Caroline Taylor, who was then MTS\u2019 Senior Specialist, HR Policy and Governance, based in Toronto, for an investigation.\n[143] On April 7, 2009 Ms. Taylor conducted a phone interview with Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi to try to formulate a list of items that he felt she should investigate. She prepared notes from the call that she sent to him for his review and comments. Thereafter, she prepared a document listing the subjects of his complaints and describing them on the basis of her call with him. She then sent him the documents and requested his comments. She spoke with him again by phone and exchanged emails with him between April 7 and April 16. He suggested a number of revisions to the document which she incorporated into the final version of the document.\n[144] The final version of the document included the following subjects with descriptions of each of the subjects. \u201cDenial of Request for Second P.C for research purposes\u201d; \u201cDisrespectful Comments in 2001\/2002\u201d; \u201cLack of Technical Training in 2002\u201d; \u201cLack of Advancement in 2006\u201d; \u201cLack of Retraining following extended absence after the second car accident--February 2009\u201d; \u201cRequest for Turkish Cultural Holidays Declined in March 2009\u201d; and \u201cDisrespectful Comment relating to Removal of P.C. Contents During Extended Absence--March 2009\u201d. There was no mention in the document of Event 9 (ie lack of accommodation for disability) described herein.\n[145] Ms. Taylor then had phone interviews with Wayne Horseman, David Atwell, Brenda Coutts, Brian Elliott, Qwin DeBrant between April 20th and May 19th, 2009 respecting the Internal Complaint and made notes of her interviews. She did not interview any former employees such as Neil Wyrchowny or Ernest Desmarais.\n[146] On May 20, 2009 Ms. Taylor delivered a report of her findings with respect to the Internal Complaint. The Summary and Recommendations read as follows:\n\u201cSummary of Findings:\nWhile some discriminatory comments appear to have been made over five years ago, a review of the complaint itself and the Emails provided by Kouroush do not provide evidence of current discrimination on the basis of race or national or ethnic origin. Interviews with those alleged to have discriminated against Kouroush in many cases provide alternative explanations for decisions made.\nIt appears that Kouroush\u2019s expectations for resources, training, advancement and time off with little notice are unrealistic and have not been met for reasons unrelated to race or national origin.\nKouroush\u2019s tone in Emails to management that he himself provided is disrespectful and antagonistic and has provoked on at least one occasion an unprofessional response from management but this is not seen as discrimination.\nThe above findings were reviewed with Mark Eklove, Legal Counsel and Daniele Malcolm, Director, HR Policy & Governance on May 20th, 2009 and the following recommendations have been developed:\nRecommendations:\n1. Management to be reminded to communicate professionally with Kouroush at all times.\n2. Kouroush to be coached to be respectful and courteous in all dealings with management.\n3. Kouroush to be coached on possible strategies for meeting his career goals as part of the PP &R process.\u201d\n[147] Caroline Taylor\u2019s report included the following about the David Atwell disparaging comments:\n\u201cItem 2: Disrespectful Comments\nA. AI Qaeda Membership card comment in 2001\nKouroush alleges that Team Leader Dave Atwell asked him two or three times when he was going to reveal his AI Qaeda membership card following 9\/11. Dave denies doing so, however Qwin De Brant confirms that he overheard Dave make two or three AI Qaeda references to Kouroush between 2001 and 2004. Qwin has heard no other disrespectful comments from Dave to or about Kouroush. Qwin stated that Dave has made derogatory comments about others as well in the past but that he has not done so in a very long time.\nThese comments were made over five years ago with no prior complaint having been lodged and Kouroush\u2019s confirmation that he did not ask Dave to stop these comments.\nB \u201cCrash\u201d Nickname in 2002\nKouroush states that Dave began calling him \u201cCrash\u201d in front of others after his car accident in 2002. Dave admits to doing this and indicated he picked up the nickname from Kouroush\u2019s peers. The nickname Crash did not relate to race or national origin but rather to driving record.\u201d\n[148] Following her release of the report Ms. Taylor emailed Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi a copy of the report and had a discussion with him about it on May 27, 2009.\n[149] Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s reaction to the report is captured in an email that he sent to MTS on July 9, 2009, resigning from his employment effective July 25, 2009.\n\u201cHi Don,\nConsidering the fact that I was discriminated against for so long and, following the biased internal investigation that blamed me for faults, I am left with no choice but to resign.\nThe anger and frustration that I have after a \u201cprotective\u201d investigation result, is causing me anxiety and nervousness, I do not want to end up in hospital again.\nEven imagining or a thought of returning to that environment makes me ill and I am willing to throw my years of hard work in order to gain my mental and physical wellbeing.\nThis is to inform you and MTS that following my sick leave (that ends on July 25th) I will not return to work, so therefore this should be considered as my notice.\nThanks,\nKouroush\u201d\n[150] Brenda Coutts filled out an exit report on Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi in which she noted her views at that time that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi had high absenteeism was difficult to train and was not performing at the level as other members of the team. While Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi did have high absenteeism there is no evidence that any absences were unjustified. Further, while it seemed that at the end of his work he was withdrawn there was no evidence to corroborate Brenda Coutts\u2019 opinion at that time that he was difficult to train or not performing satisfactorily under the circumstances.\n[151] MTS no longer uses in house personnel to conduct investigations of Internal Complaints but hires independent third parties to carry them out.\nIII. Legal Framework-Liability\n[152] The complainant has the initial burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one that covers the allegations made and which, if the allegations are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent. The prima facie case is decided on the basis of the complainant\u2019s evidence alone-the respondent\u2019s answer is not a factor in the assessment.\nOntario (Human Rights Commission) and O\u2019Malley v. Simpson Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 (\u201cO\u2019Malley\u201d).\n[153] The applicable standard of proof is the civil standard of the balance of probabilities.\nQuebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier Aerospace Training Center), 2015 SCC 39, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 789.\n[154] Complainants are not required to prove that respondents intended to discriminate in order to establish a prima facie case. Indeed, it is often said that discrimination is not a practice that would ordinarily be displayed openly and direct evidence is often not available to a complainant in cases of discrimination. As a result, one must examine all of the circumstances to determine if there exists what has been described by the Tribunal as the \u201csubtle scent of discrimination\u201d. Such a determination may involve drawing an inference from circumstantial evidence. An inference of discrimination may be drawn where the evidence offered in support of it renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses.\nBasi v. Canadian National Railway Co. (1988), 9 CHRR D\/5029 (\u201cBasi\u201d).\n[155] A prima facie case cannot be supported by mere sincere allegations or allegations that are supported by evidence that lacks specifics. The allegations have to be \u201ccomplete and sufficient\u201d. Evidence that is vague, impressionistic and consisting primarily of personal opinions is insufficient to establish a prima facie case.\nKhiamal v. Greyhound Canada Transportation Corporation, 2007 CHRT 34; Hill v. Air Canada, 2003, CHRT 9 (\u201cHill\u201d); Morin v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 CHRT 41 (\u201cMorin\u201d).\n[156] In order to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under section 7(b) of the CHRA, the Complainant must establish that the Respondent adversely differentiated in its treatment of the Complainant compared to others and that there was a connection between the adverse differential treatment and a prohibited ground of discrimination under section 3 of the CHRA. Differential adverse treatment requires a distinction between the Complainant and another employee(s) which is harmful or hurtful towards the Complainant.\nOpheim v. Gaigan Gill & Gillco Inc., 2016 CHRT 12; Chaudhary v. Smoother Movers, 2013 CHRT 15.\n[157] In job competition cases under section 7(b) of the CHRA, where the Complainant is not hired and someone else is, the Tribunal has established a three part test as a useful guide. In such cases, the Complainant must show that he was qualified for the job at issue; he was not given the job at issue; and someone no better qualified, but lacking the distinguishing feature which is the gravamen of the human rights complaint, was given the job. This test, however, is not to be applied in a rigid or arbitrary fashion, rather the circumstances in each case need to be weighed. Ultimately, the question will be whether the Complainant has satisfied the O\u2019Malley test, that is: if believed, is the evidence before the Tribunal complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in favour of the Complainant, in the absence of an answer from the Respondent.\nPremakumar v. Air Canada, 2002 CanLII 23561 (CHRT)\n[158] Once the complainant has met his burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the respondent to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that there is a reasonable explanation for what appears to be discriminatory behaviour. The answer or explanation must be believed and not shown to be a pretext. It is not necessary that discriminatory consideration be the sole reason for the decision or conduct at issue in order for a complaint to succeed. It is sufficient if discrimination was a factor, even if other factors were also at play.\nBasi, supra.\n[159] The Tribunal's authority to institute an inquiry into a complaint is derived from the Commission\u2019s decision to request the Tribunal to institute an inquiry pursuant to section 49 of the CHRA. If the Commission decides not to deal with a complaint pursuant to section 41(1)(e) of the CHRA, an investigation into the complaint will not occur and no request by the Commission to the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint pursuant to section 49 will take place. As such, there is no authority for the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into a complaint that the Commission has decided not to deal with.\n[160] Section 50(1) of the CHRA provides that parties to an inquiry before the Tribunal shall have the full and ample opportunity to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations. That a party to a hearing is entitled to know the allegations against him and be able to have a fair opportunity to respond is a matter of procedural fairness in accordance with the principles of natural justice embodied in this section of the CHRA.\n[161] The duty of procedural fairness provides that parties affected by a decision should have the opportunity to present their case fully and fairly, and have decisions affecting their rights, interests or privileges made using a fair, impartial and open process, appropriate to the statutory, institutional and social context of the decision. The Courts and the Tribunal have recognized this duty in many decisions.\nBaker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817; Prassad v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 569; Culic v. Canada Post Corporation, 2007 CHRT 1; Durrer v Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 2007, CHRT 6; Fahmy v. Greater Toronto Airports Authority, 2008 CHRT 12; Whyte v. Canadian National Railway, 2009 CHRT 33.\n[162] While proposed amendments to complaints and pleadings that are disputed can be decided by the Tribunal on motions brought by the party seeking the amendment, the Tribunal has held in such cases that amendments sought on motions of this kind will be decided based on both jurisdictional and fairness considerations, namely 1) whether or not there is a logical nexus between the amendment sought and the original complaint, so that the proposed amendment does not create a new complaint that has not been dealt with by the Commission, investigated and properly referred to the Tribunal to institute an inquiry; and 2) whether there will be unacceptable prejudice to the respondent to the motion if the amendment is granted, depriving him of a fair hearing. However, these cases always arise within the context of a motion for an amendment by a complainant actually being brought before the Tribunal before the end of the evidence phase of the hearing when the respondent still may have a fair opportunity to respond.\nAttaran v. IRCC,2017 CHRT 21; Tran v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2010 CHRT 31;Cook v. Onion Lake First Nation, 2002 CanLII 61849 (CHTR);Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 1; Canada v. Pitawanakwat (1991) 43 F.T.R.47.\n[163] Section 14(1)(c) of the CHRA makes it a discriminatory practice to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination in matters of employment. While the CHRA does not define the term \u201charassment\u201d the Tribunal and the Courts have provided guidance with respect to the application of this term that are relevant to this case, including the following:\nthe conduct has to be unwelcome by the victim and related to a prohibited ground of discrimination that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse job related consequences for the victim;\nMorin, supra.\nthe gravamen of harassment lies in the creation of a hostile work environment which violates the personal dignity of the complainant;\nDawson v. Canada Post Corporation, 2008 CHRT 41 (\u201cDawson\u201d).\nin certain circumstances a single incident may be enough to create a hostile work environment and in others some element of repetition or persistence is required.Accordingly, the nature of the conduct should be calculated according to the inversely proportional rule: the more serious the conduct and its consequences are, the less repetition is necessary; conversely, the less severe the conduct, the more persistence will have to be demonstrated;\nDawson, supra.\nharassment does not include expressions that are rude and offensive but not connected to a particular characteristic.Conduct can be offensive and based on personal circumstances, but not repetitive enough or serious enough to constitute harassment under the CHRA;\nMorin, supra.\nin determining whether the conduct is unwelcome, an objective standard must be applied based on what a reasonable person would perceive from the perspective of the victim;\nHill, supra.\nin assessing the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the conduct at issue, the touchstone is the usual limits of social interaction in the circumstances.The following more specific factors are relevant in the determination:the nature of the conduct; the workplace environment; the pattern of prior conduct between the parties; whether the alleged harasser is in a position of authority over the complainant; and whether an objection has been made.\nHill, supra.\nby virtue of section 65 of the CHRA any act or omission committed by an employee of an association or organization, in the course of employment of said employee, shall, for the purposes of the CHRA, be deemed to be an act or omission committed by that association or organization.This remains the case unless the association or organization did not consent to the commission of the act or omission and exercised all due diligence to prevent the act or omission from being committed and subsequently, to mitigate or avoid the effect thereof;\nemployers have an obligation to their employees to create and maintain a discrimination-free work environment and their duty of diligence exists once it becomes aware of an act that, by reason of its intrinsically offensive, humiliating or degrading character, would likely degenerate into harassment if it were subsequently repeated.\nDawson, supra.\nthe existence of an anti-harassment policy itself is not enough to release the employer from all due diligence.There is a positive duty upon an employer to take prompt and effectual action when it knows or should know of the conduct in the workplace amounting to racial harassment and to avoid liability, the employer is obliged to take reasonable steps to alleviate, as best it can, the distress arising within the workplace and to reassure those concerned that it is committed to the maintenance of a workplace free of racial harassment.\nHinds v. Canada 1988 CarswellNat 993.\nIV. Issues\n[164] The issues in this case are as follows:\ni) Should the Tribunal decide allegations of discrimination with respect to Event 9 described above,based upon the prohibited grounds of race and\/or disability?; and\nii) Should the Tribunal decide any allegations of discrimination with respect to any of the other Events described above, based upon the prohibited ground of disability?\nHas Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi discharged his onus of proving a prima facie case of discrimination with respect to any of the Events described above that the Tribunal is deciding?\nIf Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi has discharged his onus of proving a prima facie case of discrimination with respect to any of the Events described above that the Tribunal is deciding, has MTS discharged it\u2019s onus by proving a reasonable explanation that is not a pretext?\nWhat, if any, remedies should be ordered in this case?\nV. Analysis-Liability\nA. Issue 1\n[165] In spite of the facts set out in paragraphs 4 to 8 inclusive above and referenced again in paragraph 112 above, counsel for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi submitted written arguments to support allegations of discrimination by MTS against Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi, with respect to Event 9 described above, not only based on the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin and religion but also based on the prohibited ground of disability. As well, counsel for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi submitted written arguments in support of allegations of discrimination by MTS against Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi with respect to other Events described above, based on prohibited grounds that included the prohibited ground of disability. At no time prior to submitting these arguments was there any motion brought before the Tribunal to amend Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s complaint or the pleadings, neither of which referenced Event 9 or cited disability as a prohibited ground with respect to any Event.\n[166] As noted in paragraph 9 above, the written arguments of both parties were exchanged by agreement between counsel for the parties several days before oral arguments were heard. Counsel for MTS did not include in their written arguments any reference to Event 9 or any reference to the prohibited ground of disability in relation to any other Event described above. MTS' written submissions referred to the Events (other than Event 9 which was not mentioned) as \u201cincidents\u201d and analysed them each in relation to the prohibited grounds listed in the complaint, namely-- race, national or ethnic origin and religion but not to disability which was not mentioned in Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s complaint or pleadings.\n[167] In his oral arguments on May 19, 2017, counsel for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi acknowledged that counsel for MTS had not referred to Event 9 described above or to the prohibited ground of disability in their written arguments with respect to any of the Events. Counsel for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi also acknowledged in his oral arguments that MTS had a \u201cget out of jail card\u201d for Event 9 described above, as a result of the Commission\u2019s decision not to deal with Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s additional complaint.\n[168] However, counsel for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi submitted in his oral arguments that the Tribunal should, in deciding this case, consider \u201cprior history of disability\u201d as a prohibited ground for the alleged discrimination by MTS in relation to some of the other Events described in the complaint, even though disability is not mentioned in the complaint or pleadings as a prohibited ground. \u201cPrior history of disability\u201d was part of the language removed by Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi from his amended Statement of Particulars (together with race) in relation to Event 9 described above, after the Commission refused to deal with it as an additional complaint. That ground, according to counsel for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi in his oral arguments, arises out of the fact that while Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was accommodated by MTS by providing him with a graduated return to work program for about one and a half years after his first car accident in 2001, Brenda Coutts and Brian Elliott and other managers at MTS allegedly did not believe that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was disabled at that time and made comments in the workplace that he was \u201cfaking\u201d and was probably taking trips to Turkey during his prior disability and therefore that he had a poor work ethic.\n[169] In his oral arguments, counsel for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi submitted that this alleged conduct on the part of Brenda Coutts and Brian Elliott and other MTS managers of not believing that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s the prior disability was true and of making related unsubstantiated comments about his work ethic and trips to Turkey, was a factor in a number of the alleged discriminatory actions by MTS against Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi, including the use of the name \u201cKrash\u201d and of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi not being promoted in 2006. Put another way, even though disability as a prohibited ground is not mentioned in the complaint or pleadings, nevertheless, according to counsel for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi in his oral arguments, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s disability resulting from the first car accident (for which he was accommodated) was a factor in a number of the allegedly discriminatory Events by MTS that followed that accident because Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s prior disability was not believed by managers of MTS. The Tribunal, according to the oral submissions of counsel for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi, should now take this into consideration in deciding this case.\n[170] Counsel for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi cited the case of Egan v. Canada Revenue Agency (2012) CHRT a ruling that I made in a case that I am still seized of. In that case I allowed an amendment to a complaint because I found that there was a logical nexus between the amendment and the original complaint and that there would be no prejudice to the respondent as it would have ample time to respond. My ruling in that 2012 case, unlike this case, was decided by me on a preliminary motion brought by the complainant long before the hearing started. In fact, the hearing in that case has only very recently started.\n[171] As noted in paragraph 166 above, counsel for MTS did not refer to Event 9 described above and the prohibited ground of disability with respect to any of the Events in their written arguments exchanged with counsel for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi a few days before the last day of the hearing when oral arguments were scheduled to take place. Counsel for MTS in their oral arguments disagrees with counsel for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi with respect to Issue 1 on the basis that, 1) Event 9 and the prohibited ground of disability with respect to any of the Events is not properly before the Tribunal to decide, as it wasn\u2019t part of the complaint dealt with by the Commission and was therefore neither investigated or referred to the Tribunal; and 2) at this late stage when the evidence in the hearing has been completed, it would be unfair for the Tribunal to decide that either Event 9 or the prohibited ground of disability with respect to any Event is properly before the Tribunal to decide.\n[172] I accept the arguments of MTS with respect to Issue 1 for the following reasons.\n[173] Failure to accommodate any disability was not alleged by Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi in his complaint or his pleadings and no reference to the prohibited ground of disability appears in any of these documents.\n[174] The Commission refused to deal with Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s additional complaint alleging failure to accommodate Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi for a disability by providing him with a graduated return to work program after the 2007 accident. That additional complaint was made on the basis of the prohibited grounds of race and prior history of disability after a proposed amendment to add this allegation to his Statement of Particulars was objected to by MTS.\n[175] It must be assumed that in requesting the adjournment of this hearing in June of 2014 and filing the additional complaint thereafter, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi had concluded that Event 9 described above and the grounds of race and prior history of disability in relation to it were not included in the original complaint. There was no judicial review taken of the decision of the Commission nor was there a motion made to the Tribunal to amend the complaint or the pleadings. After the Commission\u2019s decision not to deal with the additional complaint and before the hearing resumed in June of 2016, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi removed the words \u201crace and prior history of disability\u201d from the proposed amendment to the Statement of Particulars together with any allegation of failure to accommodate a disability with respect to the 2007 car accident.\n[176] As such, with respect to the first part of Issue 1, in my opinion, based on the facts in this case and on paragraph 159 above, Event 9 described above, is not properly before the Tribunal for determination and the Tribunal should not decide allegations of discrimination with respect to Event 9 on the basis of race and\/or disability.\n[177] Counsel for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi argues that the Tribunal should decide that MTS discriminated against Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi in a number of the other Events described above, based, in part, on the prohibited ground of disability related to the alleged disbelief by certain managers of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s prior history of disability following his first car accident for which Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was accommodated by providing him with a graduated return to work program. The Tribunal is being asked to make this determination at the argument phase of this hearing after the evidence phase has long ago been concluded, without any motion having been made to the Tribunal to amend the complaint or the pleadings. As previously noted, there is no reference in the complaint or the pleadings to the prohibited ground of disability or to an allegation of failure to accommodate any particular disability.\n[178] In my opinion, at the close of the evidence phase of the hearing, MTS had every reason to believe that allegations based upon the prohibited ground of disability were not part of this inquiry, given the facts set out in paragraphs 4 to 8 inclusive above and also the references to those facts in paragraph 112. MTS presented its case on that basis and it would be unfair and contrary to the principles of natural justice to now change the scope of the inquiry in this case because of arguments made by counsel for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi that the prohibited ground of disability is part of this inquiry.\n[179] As such, with respect to the second part of Issue 1, in my opinion, based on the facts in this case and on paragraphs 160, 161 and 162 above, it would be unfair to decide any allegations of discrimination with respect to any of the other Events described above on the basis of the prohibited ground of disability.\nB. Issues 2 and 3\nEvent 1: Remarks made by David Atwell\n[180] Based on the evidence in this case, including my findings in paragraphs 22, 24, 27, 31, 35, 36, 37 and 40 above, in my opinion, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi has discharged his onus of proving a prima facie case of discrimination against MTS pursuant to section 14(1)(c) of the CHRA, on the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin or religion with respect to Event 1 described above.\n[181] As noted in paragraphs 25 and 26 above, David Atwell apologised for his behaviour to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and MTS admitted that Mr. Atwell\u2019s conduct in making certain derogatory comments to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi in the workplace over a period of time amounted to harassment under the CHRA.\n[182] MTS\u2019s explanations for this conduct are essentially that (i) there was a limited number of comments and a limited time during which they were made and therefore the harassment was not of a serious or persistent nature; and (ii) that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi is too sensitive about the comments and exaggerated them in his evidence and (iii) the Event was not reported to management until the Taylor internal Report and therefore MTS is exculpated under section 65(2) of the CHRA.\n[183] In my opinion, the evidence and my findings including those in paragraphs 31, 35, 36 and 40 above counters the explanations of MTS referred to above. Regarding section 65(2) of the CHRA, on the basis of my findings at paragraph 35 above, according to MTS\u2019 own witnesses there was or should have been knowledge by MTS\u2019 management of Mr. Atwell\u2019s harassing behaviour towards Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi long before Caroline Taylor\u2019s report.\n[184] As such, MTS should have acted positively to deal with the harassment when the disparaging remarks by David Atwell occurred. It failed in its duty to take prompt and effectual action in line with the legal principles set out in paragraph 163 (viii) and (ix) above.\nEvent 2: Denial of a Second Computer\n[185] Based on the evidence in this case, including my finding in paragraph 48 above, in my opinion, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi has discharged his onus of proving a prima facie case of discrimination against MTS pursuant to section 7(b) of the CHRA, on the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin or religion with respect to Event 2 described above.\n[186] In my opinion, David Atwell, at the time of this Event, was intolerant of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi because of his race, national or ethnic origin or religion and adversely differentiated against him in refusing his legitimate request through his supervisor Neil Wyrchowny for the same privilege to have a second computer necessary to him as most of his peers had. The reasons for the refusal advanced by David Atwell in his evidence are not believable or reasonable in my view as a second computer was a necessary tool for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi to do his work and the request made for one from his supervisor Neil Wyrchowny was legitimate from a business case point of view.\n[187] MTS\u2019s explanations of this conduct are that i) Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was not treated differently than others; and ii) the refusal was not based on a prohibited ground specified in the complaint. I do not accept these explanations based on the evidence. Clearly, on the evidence, there was adversely differential treatment of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi compared to his peers in refusing a second computer where virtually none of them had been refused. Further, David Atwell, at that time, was intolerant of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s race, ethnicity or religion as per my findings in Event 1 and his attitude towards Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi, in my opinion, was a pervasive factor in all of his dealings with him.\n[188] In my view the legal principles as set out in paragraph 154 above are supportive of my reasoning with respect to Event 2 on the basis of an inference that I have made that the \u201csubtle scent of discrimination\u201d is present in this Event in the actions of David Atwell.\nEvent 3: Denial of training requests\n[189] Based on the evidence in this case, including my finding in paragraph 51 above, in my opinion, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi has discharged his onus of proving a prima facie case of discrimination against MTS pursuant to section 7(b) of the CHRA, on the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin or religion with respect to Event 3 described above.\n[190] Exactly the same reasoning set out in paragraphs 186, 187 and 188 above with respect to Event 2 is applicable to Event 3 in the sense that, in my opinion, David Atwell at the time of this Event was intolerant towards Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi on the basis of his race, national or ethnic origin or religion. As a result, he adversely differentiated on the basis of those prohibited grounds in refusing the Win2K project training request made on behalf of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi while not refusing this training to other peers of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi who did not have his personal characteristics. Once again, I am able to draw the inference from the evidence with respect to this Event that the \u201csubtle scent of discrimination\u201d is present in the actions of David Atwell.\nEvent 4: Use of the \u201cnicknames\u201d \u201cCrash\u201d or \u201cKourash\u201d either section\n[191] Based on the evidence in this case, including my findings in paragraph 60 above, in my opinion, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi has not discharged his onus of proving a prima facie case of discrimination against MTS pursuant to either section 14(1)(c) or section 7(b) of the CHRA, on the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin or religion with respect to Event 4 described above.\n[192] These \u201cnicknames\u201d were not pleasant for Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi to hear or read in view of the injuries he sustained in his car accidents. The use of these plays on his name showed insensitivity and disrespect for a person who had been through painful injuries as a result of accidents that were not his fault. Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi made it known to his colleagues that he didn\u2019t appreciate the use of these names and yet they persisted until the end of his career with MTS. However, the arguments advanced by Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi in respect of this Event specifically relate to the prohibited ground of disability that, for the reasons detailed above in Part V. Analysis Issue 1, is not before the Tribunal for determination in this case.\nEvent 5: Comments about Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s trips to Turkey and his work ethic\n[193] Based on the evidence in this case, including my findings in paragraphs 67, 68 and 69 above, in my opinion, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi has not discharged his onus of proving a prima facie case of discrimination against MTS pursuant to either section 14(1)(c) or section 7(b) of the CHRA, on the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin or religion with respect to Event 5 described above.\n[194] In my opinion, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s supervisor Brenda Coutts as well as Brian Elliott, who supervised him in Ms. Coutt\u2019s absence, were not tainted by their association with David Atwell so as to make discriminatory comments about Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi. They may or may not have been good managers but, as noted above, I accept their evidence and denials, that they did not make these comments. I found their evidence to be credible and consistent on this Event. I found that the evidence of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and other witnesses who suggested that they did make these comments was vague, inconsistent and impressionistic.\n[195] Finally, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s arguments with respect to this Event related these comments to the prohibited ground of disability that, for the reasons detailed above in Part V. Analysis Issue 1, is not before the Tribunal for determination in this case.\nEvent 6: Relegation to Service Desk\n[196] Based on the evidence in this case, including my finding in paragraph 77 above, in my opinion, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi has not discharged his onus of proving a prima facie case of discrimination against MTS pursuant to section 7(b) of the CHRA on the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin or religion with respect to Event 6 described above.\n[197] The evidence with respect to this Event is clear, in my opinion, that the actions taken by MTS were not directed at Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi alone but were directed to a group of employees including Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi and some of his peers. It may have been a poor decision by MTS to try out this program and may also have been, in part, directed to a group of employees, some of whom were not held in high esteem for their performance by management. However, in my opinion, it was not directed at Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi alone and not based upon the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin or religion. Many of the group of peers affected by the program had no distinguishing protected characteristics.\nEvent 7: Hostile work environment\/TEAM meeting\n[198] Based on the evidence in this case, including my finding in paragraph 87 above, in my opinion, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi has not discharged his onus of proving a prima facie case of discrimination against MTS pursuant to either section 14(1) (c) or section 7(b) of the CHRA, on the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin or religion with respect to Event 7 described above.\n[199] The meeting that was the subject of the Event, indicates that a number of unionized workers with their representatives met to discuss a number of issues that may have indicated a bad work atmosphere at the time in the ITSM Department because of various actions or inactions by management of MTS. Management actions complained of at the meeting did not include discrimination under the CHRA. The \u201cBad Dog Box\u201d group that was referred to in the Minutes of the meeting was not applicable to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi alone but a group of his peers including him. Many of whom had no distinguishing protected characteristics.\n[200] I my opinion, similar to my reasoning in paragraph 197 above concerning Event 6, this Event does not constitute discrimination as it was not directed to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi alone or related to the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin or religion.\nEvent 8: Denial of Promotion to Senior Client Support Specialist (Site Prime) position\n[201] Based on the evidence in this case, including my findings in paragraphs 108, 109 and 111 above, in my opinion, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi has not discharged his onus of proving a prima facie case of discrimination against MTS pursuant to section 7(b) of the CHRA on the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, or religion with respect to Event 7 described above.\n[202] The evidence in this Event was very clear to me that a decision was made by the three person panel based on a fair assessment of all applicants\u2019 performances in response to a set of test questions that were fairly and consistently administered and scored. Nothing about the competition leaves me with the impression that it was biased against Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi in any way. I can find no \u201csubtle scent\u201d of discrimination against Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi by MTS with respect of this Event.\n[203] Moreover, as noted in paragraphs 108, 109 and 111 above, in my opinion, the evidence of Brenda Coutts, Brian Elliott and Don Rooney was very credible while the evidence of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was very vague and impressionistic about this Event nor did it establish in any way that the three part test guide referred to in paragraph 157 above had been satisfied with respect to the job competition for the Site Prime positions or any other acting opportunities that were not awarded to him.\nEvent 10: Treatment on return to work in 2009\n[204] Based on the evidence in this case, including my findings in paragraph 140 above, in my opinion, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi has not discharged his onus of proving a prima facie case of discrimination against MTS pursuant to either section 14(1)(c) or section 7(b) of the CHRA on the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, or religion with respect to Event 10 described above.\n[205] The evidence with respect to this Event indicates to me that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s supervisors and some of his peers were not as sympathetic or helpful to him as they should have been given his circumstances at that time. Undoubtedly, this made him feel unwanted, frustrated and depressed. I also believe, based on the evidence, that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was not a particularly happy or motivated employee at that time and acted accordingly for reasons pertaining to his recent injuries, time off work and his unwelcome reception in the workplace. The combination of these factors, in my opinion, led to some of the unfortunate and inappropriate actions and behaviour between management and Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi, much of which demonstrated poor management on the part of MTS and Brenda Coutts in particular.\n[206] Although no medical witnesses were called at the hearing, it is likely, based on the report from his intake and discharge at the St. Boniface General Hospital on March 16, 2009, that the incidents that day concerning his loss of computer information and the heated exchanges on that subject with Brenda Coutts, caused him to leave work and go to the hospital complaining of chest pains and stress. I do not, however, detect the \u201csubtle scent of discrimination\u201d against Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi in the incidents described in this Event. As noted at paragraph 140 above, I am unable to infer or find that any of these incidents were related in any way to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s race, national or ethnic origin or religion.\nEvent 11: MTS Internal Investigation and Report\n[207] Obviously, for the reasons set out paragraphs 180 to 188 above, I do not agree with the findings with respect to Items 1 and 2 in the Investigation and Internal Report (which are Events 2 and 1 above) or with the recommendations related thereto. In my opinion, as noted above, MTS failed in its obligation to create and maintain an harassment free environment by failing to take prompt and effectual actions against David Atwell at the time of the harassment and the unfair actions against Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi by Mr. Atwell with respect to these Items, when it knew or ought to have known about them. Both the findings and the recommendations of Caroline Taylor related to these Items are, in my opinion, erroneous and ineffective in concluding that, as the harassment by David Atwell had occurred in the past and without any official internal complaint having been filed there was nothing more to be done about it. As such, remedial orders with respect to these Items are being issued below.\n[208] Moreover, I feel that the Internal Investigation and Report was undertaken in a somewhat superficial manner and without proper objectivity. In that regard, in my opinion, the investigation should have included former key employees such as Neil Wyrchowny and Ernest Desmarais who would not be influenced by an existing employment relationship with MTS, rather than relying only on current internal employees of MTS (some of whom, including David Atwell, appear to have given Caroline Taylor a somewhat different version of the evidence than I heard). Further, having an investigator who also works for the company and having her report reviewed by internal company lawyers before its release, is also problematic in terms of ensuring objectivity and fairness in this type of exercise. I assume that MTS, by changing its practices in this regard, as noted in paragraph 151 above, agrees with this latter point.\n[209] Notwithstanding paragraphs 206 and 207 above, based upon the evidence before me, in my opinion, the undertaking of the Internal Investigation and Report and its findings and recommendations by Caroline Taylor, do not themselves represent adverse differential treatment or harassment towards Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi by Ms. Taylor or MTS under the CHRA, on the basis of the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin or religion. As noted above, I disagree with certain aspects of the manner by which the Internal Investigation and Report was undertaken and with some of the findings and recommendations. I also understand that the results of the Internal Investigation and Report upset and disappointed Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi. However, I am unable to conclude on the evidence before me that Caroline Taylor or MTS acted in a discriminatory manner towards Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi in undertaking the Internal Investigation and Report or producing its findings and recommendations.\nVI. Decision\n[210] For the foregoing reasons, I find that the complaint is substantiated with respect to:\n(a) Event 1 described above, pursuant to section 14(1)(c) of the CHRA, on the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin or religion;\n(b) Event 2 described above, pursuant to section 7(b) of the CHRA, on the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin or religion;\n(c) Event 3 described above, pursuant to section 7(b) of the CHRA, on the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin or religion.\n[211] For the foregoing reasons, I find that the complaint is not substantiated with respect to Events 4 to 8 inclusive described above and 10 and 11 described above, and I hereby dismiss same. Event 9, described above, is not properly before me as previously explained and the complaint in respect of it is therefore also dismissed.\nVII. Legal Framework-Remedies\n[212] Section 53(2) of the CHRA, as set out in paragraph 2 above, provides that if at the conclusion of the inquiry the member finds that the complaint is substantiated, subject to section 54, the member may make an order against the person found to have engaged in the discriminatory practices and include in the order terms that the member considers appropriate as set out in clauses (a) to (e) inclusive.\n[213] When evidence establishes pain and suffering, an attempt to compensate for it must be made. Awarding the maximum amount allowed under section 53(2)(e) of the CHRA is reserved for the most egregious discriminatory practices.\nGrant v. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc. 2012 CHRT 10 (\u201cGrant\u201d).\n[214] Section 53(3) of the CHRA is a provision intended to provide a deterrent and to discourage those who deliberately discriminate. A finding of willfulness requires that the discriminatory act and the infringement of the person\u2019s rights under the Act is intentional. A finding of recklessness generally denotes acts that disregard or show indifference for the consequences such that the conduct is done wantonly or heedlessly. The award of the maximum under the section should be reserved for the very worst cases.\nGrant, supra.\n[215] The Tribunal has the discretion pursuant to section 53(2)(b) of the CHRA to order reinstatement of an employee who has lost his job as a consequence of discrimination against him by his employer. In order for the Tribunal to exercise this discretion, it must be satisfied that there is at least a serious possibility, if not probability that the Complainant would be in that position but for the discrimination and whether reinstatement is appropriate in the circumstances, as well as analyzing the link between the discriminatory practice and the loss claimed.\nGrant, supra.\n[216] While the Tribunal has wide discretion to order remedies under section 53(2) of the CHRA if a complaint is substantiated in order to put the complainant in the position he would have been had the discrimination not occurred, the use of the words \u201cas a result of\u201d means there must be a causal connection between the remedy awarded and the discrimination. Therefore, careful consideration of all surrounding facts, on a case by case basis, must be considered by the Tribunal to determine whether a sufficient causal connection exists to justify the remedy.\nCanada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), [2001] F.C.J. No. 1922. (\u201cCarter\u201d).\n[217] The onus is on the Complainant to prove entitlement to the remedies claimed. He must prove that had the discrimination not occurred, he would have obtained the payments and benefits he is seeking in remedies (or in the case of seeking reimbursement, would not have been out those expenses). To discharge this onus the Complainant must prove on a balance of probabilities that there is a serious possibility that the conduct which violated the CHRA caused the damage for which the Complainant claims compensation.\nCulic v. Canada Post Corporation, 2007 CHRT 1.\n[218] The Tribunal is to be guided by common sense which requires that limits be placed upon liability for the consequences flowing from an act, absent bad faith. Common sense tells us that consequences which appear down the chain of causality but are too remote are to be excluded.\nCarter, supra.\nVIII. Analysis-Remedies\nC. Issue 4\n[219] In the argument phase of the hearing in this matter, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi argued that all of the Events described above had been proved and that his complaint should be substantiated. Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi also provided his submissions on remedies at the same time, obviously not knowing then what my decision would be on liability in the case. He advanced the position that, given the facts of this case, I should make an order under section 53(2) and (3) of the CHRA against MTS including the following terms:\nGeneral damages for his pain and suffering resulting from the discriminatory practices, for the maximum amount of $20,000.00, pursuant to section 53(2)(e) of the CHRA.\nSpecial compensation for having willfully or recklessly engaged in discriminatory practices, for the maximum amount of $20,000.00, pursuant to section 53(3) of the CHRA;\nReinstatement of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi to a similar position to the one he had before he resigned, pursuant to section 53(2)(b) of the CHRA;\nPursuant to section 53(2)(b)(c) and (d) of the CHRA\u2013\nan award for lost wages from February 23, 2009 until June 30, 2015 (the latter date agreed to by the parties in their Agreed Statement of Facts), in the amount of $161,180.00 for the difference in total wages (including Variable Pay Plan, Employee Share Ownership Plan, Dental charges and bonus amounts under the Collective Agreement) between what Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi would have earned at MTS if he was employed by MTS during the period and the income he actually did earn during the period;\nas well as an award for an amount for lost pension to be quantified later;\nas well as an award for relocation expenses to relocate he and his family to British Columbia in the amount of $12,419.30 (comprised of $4000.00 moving expenses and $8,419.30 for a mortgage payout penalty on his home in Winnipeg).\nMr. Alizadeh-Ebadi argues that all of the foregoing losses and expenses would not have occurred or been incurred had he remained an employee of MTS which would have been the case, but for the discrimination by MTS that caused him to have to resign from his job.\nAn award of interest on all heads of damages at the Bank of Canada Rate from the date of loss to June 30, 2015 or as otherwise determined by the Tribunal, pursuant to section 53(4) of the CHRA.\nPursuant to section 53(2)(a) of the CHRA order MTS to provide its front-line managers with sensitivity training and training about discrimination and its obligations under the CHRA.As well, order MTS to work with the Commission to ensure that it has appropriate policies in place, especially those related to harassment, discrimination and respectful workplace.\nMr. Alizadeh-Ebadi argues that these orders are required because it is not clear that MTS has learned from this experience and that it needs to change its ways with respect to how it deals with discrimination in the workplace going forward.\n[220] Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi argues that this case is about an accumulation of all of the discriminatory Events described above, culminating with Events 10 and 11 that finally caused him to resign from MTS to protect himself and his well-being. He argues that he had to leave work and go to the hospital with chest pains and stress following his unwelcome return to work by his colleagues in February of 2009, after an absence of two years as a result of injuries sustained in an accident that was not his fault. He says he then had flashbacks of all of the previous Events described above that he felt were all discriminatory. When he finally complained internally about these Events under MTS\u2019 Respectful Workplace Policy, he was rebuffed by MTS in what he felt was a \u201cwhitewashed\u201d Internal report. He says he realized then that he could not return to work at MTS because of this accumulation of discriminatory behaviour by MTS over the years that was not being addressed and was making him feel depressed, anxious and unwell while working at MTS. So after he had left MTS and moved to British Columbia, despite Des Hathaway\u2019s attempts during this time to try to accommodate him back into the workforce, he resigned. He argues that, but for the Events described above that he believes were all discriminatory, he would not have resigned from MTS. Hence, Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi argues that the remedies described in paragraph 219 above should be ordered against MTS on the basis that the discriminatory Events at MTS were hurtful, harmful and deliberate and caused him to resign from his job at MTS.\n[221] MTS argues that only in Event 1 has discriminatory behaviour been established and only for a relatively short period a long time ago. MTS argues that it is not liable for Event 1 because it didn\u2019t consent to it pursuant to section 65(2) of the CHRA, as it received no complaint about it. It further argues that in each of the other Events discrimination has not been established on the basis of the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin or religion or that if it has been established, MTS has provided a reasonable explanation for the behaviour that is not a pretext. Hence it argues that no remedies should be ordered.\n[222] I have found that the complaint is substantiated with respect to Events 1, 2 and 3 described above, as set out in paragraph 210 above, but that the rest of the complaint, with respect to Events 4 to 11 inclusive as described above is dismissed, as set out in paragraph 211 above.\n[223] In essence, I have found that the discrimination by MTS against Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi in this case relates specifically to the behaviour of David Atwell during the earlier part of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s employment, because he was then intolerant of Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s race, ethnic or national origin or religion and engaged in the discriminatory practices referred to in Events 1, 2 and 3 as described above; that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was very upset and distressed because of these Events and let others know about his feelings; that MTS knew or should have known about these discriminatory practices by David Atwell and should have then acted appropriately to ensure that they did not continue; and that MTS failed in its duty to do so.\n[224] As such, I find that an order ought to be made against MTS in respect of the discrimination I have found with respect to Events 1, 2 and 3 described above because they were willfully discriminatory and caused Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi serious pain and suffering. I think the conduct of David Atwell in these Events was deliberate and very hurtful and harmful to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi. MTS should have stopped it many years ago as it knew or ought to have known what was going on. Accordingly, I find that the amount of $20,000.00 for each of the two heads of damages in section 53(2)(e) and section 53(3) of the CHRA is justified and appropriate in this case and should be ordered to be paid by MTS to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi for these Events of discrimination, together with interest as prescribed in section 53(4) of the CHRA on the each of the two $20,000.00 amounts calculated and payable from January 1, 2002 until June 30, 2015.\n[225] In essence, I have found that Events 4 to 8 inclusive and Events 10 and 11 were upsetting and distressful to Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi, for various reasons that are quite understandable. In some cases they involved poor management by MTS and in some other cases they involved poor behaviour by employees of MTS towards Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi. However, in my opinion, they did not involve discriminatory behaviour against Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi by anyone at MTS on the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin or religion. As such, I am unable to find that there is a causal relationship between these Events and Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s resignation based on discrimination that would justify me to order the remedies under the CHRA that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi seeks in paragraph 219 (c) (d) and (e) above with respect to these Events. Nor is there, in my opinion, a reasonable or logical causal relationship between Events 1, 2 and 3, described above and Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi\u2019s resignation, given the lapse in time between those Events and the resignation, that would justify these remedies for those Events. In other words, while I feel that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi was justified in not wanting to continue to work at MTS for his own health and well-being because of his feelings about the atmosphere for him at MTS in 2009, I do not feel that the atmosphere there then was based upon discrimination by MTS against Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi. As such, I will not make the orders that Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi seeks in paragraph 219 (c) (d) and (e) above.\n[226] I am, however, concerned that David Atwell may still need some assistance in recognizing how to be respectful to other people in the workplace, despite the evidence I heard that he had changed his ways some time ago. I am also concerned that MTS does not yet fully understand that it must be more proactive in responding to circumstance like Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi faced with respect to Events 1, 2 and 3 above and may need to change its policies to achieve better results in that regard. As such, I am ordering MTS, to consult with the Commission to address these two areas.\nIX. Orders\n[227] For the foregoing reasons, I hereby order MTS\nto pay Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi the amount of $20,000.00 for pain and suffering, pursuant to section 53(2)(e) of the CHRA, together with interest thereon calculated from January 1, 2002 to June 30, 2015, pursuant to section 53(4) of the CHRA; and\nto pay Mr. Alizadeh-Ebadi the amount of $20,000.00 for special compensation, pursuant to section 53(3) of the CHRA, together with interest thereon calculated from January 1, 2002 to June 30, 2015, pursuant to section 53(4) of the CHRA; and\nto consult with the Commission in order to enroll David Atwell in an appropriate educational and training course(s) dealing with respectful behaviour in the workplace and discrimination and to also consult with the Commission in order to have its various policies relating to harassment, respectful behaviour in the workplace and discrimination reviewed by the Commission and amended accordingly where necessary.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Complaints\n[1] Pursuant to s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act), Ms. Ashraf Karimi alleges her employer, formerly MTS Allstream Inc., now Zayo Canada Inc. (Zayo), singled her out and treated her adversely on the basis of her sex and disability. The adverse conduct she alleges includes unfair criticisms; assigning her an overwhelming volume of tasks and tasks beyond her disability related physical limitations; denying her training opportunities; and, ultimately, demoting her. Ms. Karimi claims this treatment caused her to suffer stress, anxiety and depression, and required her to go on short term disability multiple times. When her short term disability benefits were exhausted, she went on long term disability. Despite attempts to return to work thereafter, Ms. Karimi contends Zayo denied her all forms of accommodation.\n[2] Ms. Karimi also alleges, under section 14.1 of the Act, that Zayo\u2019s unwillingness to accommodate a return to work is retaliation for her having filed a complaint about her alleged discriminatory treatment in the workplace.\n[3] During closing oral submissions, counsel for Ms. Karimi raised, for the first time, an allegation of discrimination pursuant to paragraph 10(b) of the Act. As this ground does not form part of the original complaints filed by Ms. Karimi and since Zayo was not provided with a proper opportunity to respond as the issue was raised for the first time in closing submissions, the Tribunal finds it would be improper for it to address this issue. As such, the allegation of discrimination made pursuant to paragraph 10(b) of the Act is not dealt with in these reasons.\n[4] For the reasons that follow, I dismiss Ms. Karimi\u2019s complaints.\nII. Hearing Process\n[5] This matter was originally heard by former Member B\u00e9langer. The evidentiary portion of the hearing was completed on September 17, 2014. Final submissions were provided in writing and were supplemented with oral final submissions in April of 2015. Sadly, Member B\u00e9langer passed away on November 27, 2015.\n[6] Shortly after Member B\u00e9langer\u2019s death, the parties were contacted by the Tribunal Chairperson to notify them of his death and furthermore, to discuss how to move forward with this case. I was subsequently assigned to this case to carry it forward to completion. Written submissions were provided by each of the parties for a decision on whether the Tribunal could decide the case on a hearing de novo or based on the existing record. Upon receipt of the submissions, a series of Case Management Conference Calls (CMCCs) were held with the parties in order to discuss the submissions, seek\/obtain clarifications and move forward with a decision on how to complete this matter.\n[7] Before a decision was made by the Tribunal, the parties came to an agreement that a new evidentiary hearing would not be required and that the matter should proceed based on the record of the case. The parties agreed that the record of the case would include: all oral evidence presented at the hearing, all of the evidence (exhibits) previously tendered during the hearing, as well as, all oral and written submissions to date. Furthermore, my review of the evidence would be based on both the written transcripts and the audio recordings of the hearing.\n[8] Ms. Karimi had sought to re-testify before me, but such request was withdrawn on May 30, 2016. There was an agreement by the parties that should I have any questions or require some clarifications upon completing my review of the evidence, that the parties would respond to such a request by, for example, facilitating the recall of a witness to answer the questions, and if that occurred, both parties would be given an opportunity to ask their own questions of the witness relating to my questions. Finally, it was agreed that parties would be given an opportunity to make opening statements, what was referred to as an \u201coverview\u201d of the case, before I commenced my hearing and careful review of all of the evidence, including the audio-recordings of the hearing presided over by Member B\u00e9langer, and the written submissions filed by the parties. That overview occurred on October 26, 2016.\n[9] Unfortunately, the oral closing submissions that had commenced before Member Belanger had not been completed before his passing. On November 9, 2017, after my completion of the review of the record of the case, including the said recordings, the parties agreed that no further oral submissions were required. The parties agreed that their previously filed written closing submissions were sufficient.\nIII. Preliminary Matter\n[10] As a preliminary matter, I shall deal with Zayo\u2019s letter to the Tribunal dated April 8, 2015, which sets out its objection to Ms. Karimi\u2019s written Reply submissions dated March 31, 2015, on the grounds that the Reply is improper for introducing new arguments and for relying on facts that are not in evidence.\n[11] Following a careful review of the record of the case, I agree with Zayo\u2019s characterization of Ms. Karimi\u2019s Reply. As such, the new arguments advanced by Ms. Karimi will not be considered for being improperly introduced in Reply. In any event, I find that the new arguments made in Reply are not material for the resolution of the complaints. The Reply arguments based on facts unsupported by evidence not in the record will not be considered either. Contrary to Ms. Karimi\u2019s assertions in her letter dated April 14, 2015, I am not convinced that exceptional circumstances exist in this case allowing for the application of special remedial measures as set out at paragraphs 64, 69-78 of First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Canada), 2014 CHRT 2 (Caring Society 2014). In Caring Society 2014, the admissibility of over fifty thousand documents was at issue. It appears that the Tribunal in that case conceived of the remedy in large measure because of the sheer volume of potentially relevant documents. Moreover, at the time the Tribunal issued the remedial measure in Caring Society 2014, the evidentiary portion of the inquiry remained ongoing. In this case, the Complainant\u2019s request amounts to effectively asking the Tribunal to re-open the evidence gathering portion of the inquiry over six months following the close of same. I also note that Ms. Karimi seems to have abandoned the position taken in her letter dated April 14, 2015, as she more recently agreed that the matter ought to proceed on the record of the case alone (see para. 7 above). Moreover, based on my reading of the impugned Reply submissions, I find that in addition to being improper, even if the evidence supporting same had been properly before me, it would not have affected my decision on the final outcome of the complaints.\nIV. Circumstances giving rise to the complaints\nA. Critical treatment and scrutiny from manager\n[12] The company now known as Zayo provides communication and internet services to businesses. Ms. Karimi was hired in 2000 as a Level 2 Communication Technician (CT) and worked in the Internet Department, also referred to during the hearing as the CTAC Department. From 2000 to 2006, her performance reviews indicate she was rated as having met her expectations. Zayo used a low-solid-high rating system and Ms. Karimi appears to have rated in the \u201csolid\u201d range during this period.\n[13] In December 2005, Mr. Paul Picard took over as manager of the Internet Department. As of April 2006, Ms. Karimi was the only female working in the Internet Department. It is at this time that Ms. Karimi alleges Mr. Picard began to single her out and began a campaign of unfounded criticism of her work performance and punctuality.\nCustomer Complaints\n[14] Ms. Karimi gave evidence with regards to three customer file matters where she was subsequently spoken to by Mr. Picard, about her performance on those files. I have referred to the customers\u2019 names using acronyms in order to protect their privacy interests as third parties to this proceeding. The three incidents were in relation to dealings with FA which occurred in February 2006, DEL which occurred in March 2006 and ABXL which occurred in March \u2013 April 2006. Ms. Karimi alleges she was unfairly criticized for errors or issues arising in dealings with these customers when in fact the errors or issues were caused by either other employees or the customers themselves.\n[15] The FA matter arose from a complaint by the customer with regards to the setup and installation of network services in February 2006. Ms. Karimi was one of the individuals servicing this customer. One of the customer\u2019s emails implied that Ms. Karimi had not been provided all the information on the scope of the installation, which she required in order to complete the job. In that email from FA dated February 23, 2006 at 11:36 pm (email between two FA employees and subsequently forwarded to Zayo), it appears that after Ms. Karimi thought she had completed the work and had informed the customer, Ms. Karimi was surprised to learn (from the customer) that there was more that had to be done. The customer indicated that Ms. Karimi then became \u201cmad\u201d with him. The installation ultimately took several hours, instead of the 30 minutes that Ms. Karimi had anticipated. The following day, a Senior Manager of Zayo wrote to Paul Picard requesting he gather details on what the issue was so that the customer could be informed. Furthermore, the customer was not pleased with the cost of the installation which it felt should have been less had Zayo and its employees been properly prepared and informed of the scope of the installation of service.\n[16] By email, the next day, Mr. Picard asked Ms. Karimi for her feedback on what the issue was on this file, as the customer had indicated that the installation could have been handled better. Notable from Ms. Karimi\u2019s reply is that she considered the installation successful because the customer did not suffer any downtime. Mr. Picard also communicated with a co-worker of Ms. Karimi\u2019s, who had also worked on the service installation. In an email to Mr. Picard, the co-worker indicated that the work was very complex, that he did not work directly with the customer, and thus had no comment on the customer\u2019s view of the service. He added that there was always room for improvement and the company could use the customer\u2019s feedback to try to make their next experience better.\n[17] Mr. Picard wrote back to the Senior Manager indicating that he had spoken with Ms. Karimi and another co-worker, that there were issues with the installation, and that his group had not been aware of all the changes needed. Furthermore, Mr. Picard indicated that Ms. Karimi could improve her communication, and that she had admitted as much during a coaching session he held with her. Mr. Picard also indicated that they had received a subsequent email from the customer thanking Ms. Karimi for her help, and that everything was working. The Senior Manager replied back with a thank you to Mr. Picard and made it clear he was not looking for anyone to punish or point fingers at, but rather, an opportunity for improvement.\n[18] Mr. Picard, in his testimony, indicated that he took customer complaints very seriously, as the company had experienced and was still experiencing difficult times financially when he was employed there, and it could not afford to lose any customers. While he could not recall the specifics of any meeting with regards to this incident that occurred between him and Ms. Karimi, he did indicate that he would have met with Ms. Karimi in his cubicle, and that it was his usual practice to follow-up discussions with an email to confirm what had been discussed. Mr. Picard indicated that part of his responsibilities were to follow-up with employees about customer complaints, in order to address performance issues, provide coaching, lead, guide and correct. Finally, no other actions were taken as a result of this incident.\n[19] The DEL matter arose in March 2006 and involved a customer whose service installation was in jeopardy of not being completed in time by Zayo. Ms. Karimi cited this instance as evidence of unfair criticism, since she had done all she could on this file and she was not to blame for any errors. Through a series of emails between Ms. Karimi and Mr. Picard, Ms. Karimi brought to his attention that there would be consequences for both the client and Zayo if the service could not be installed the next day. Ms. Karimi requested that Mr. Picard escalate the matter, as she took the position she did not have the authority to do so. Mr. Picard suggested that Ms. Karimi escalate the matter and subsequently told Ms. Karimi who she should get in contact with. The email exchange continued, with Ms. Karimi indicating she could not escalate, as escalation had to be from manager to manager. Mr. Picard then requested that another employee take over the file. On March 29, 2006, after Mr. Picard had asked Ms. Karimi to give the details of the DEL matter over to her colleague, Ms. Karimi wrote to that colleague and indicated there was \u201c\u2026no guaranty [sic] that we can get a tech without a higher push\u201d.\n[20] Mr. Picard subsequently, in a discussion with Ms. Karimi, raised Ms. Karimi\u2019s performance on this customer file as an example of a file that demonstrated Ms. Karimi\u2019s need to improve her performance. On April 12, 2006, Mr. Picard wrote to Ms. Karimi indicating that he was following up on discussions the two of them had with regards to Ms. Karimi\u2019s need for improvement on her performance. DEL and another customer (ABXL, discussed below) was mentioned in the email. Specifically, Mr. Picard wrote that Ms. Karimi\u2019s performance was below standard, that she needed to take accountability for the status of her orders, to ensure that the customer and sales teams were proactively communicated with, and that she should focus on making improvements.\n[21] The ABXL customer incident occurred in March and April 2006, and involved a customer service request that had been dealt with incorrectly by another employee of Zayo, at the incoming customer ordering stage. It appeared that another employee had mistakenly coded or processed the file initially, and had not forwarded it properly to the CTAC Department. Thus, the customer was not going to have installation on the day it had requested and needed it. Ms. Karimi had received the file on March 22, 2006.\n[22] Ms. Karimi gave evidence that she was not to blame for any errors on this customer file, and that management was at fault for not paying closer attention to the order requirements. Mr. Picard testified that he was concerned as the customer had spoken to Ms. Karimi on March 30, 2006 and thus, Ms. Karimi should have done a better job at keeping the customer informed of the status of its requested service.\n[23] No other witnesses gave evidence regarding how or whether, when compared to Ms. Karimi, they were treated differently by Mr. Picard in respect of any mistakes or issues on customer installations and files.\nPunctuality emails\n[24] Ms. Karimi also alleges that she was singled out and frequently criticized for her lack of punctuality in front of other employees. According to Ms. Karimi, this did not occur to other employees. The evidence showed that on two occasions, April 20, 2006 and April 24, 2006, Mr. Picard wrote to Ms. Karimi after her 8 am start time had come and passed and indicated to her that she was to call if she was going to be late. It was Mr. Picard\u2019s testimony that it had been his practice to send follow-up emails after having had conversations with employees about performance issues. In the email of April 24, 2006, Mr. Picard followed up on a conversation he had with Ms. Karimi that day, where he wrote that should she not be able to make it for 8 am, they could discuss and try to adjust her shift schedule if that was needed. Mr. Picard testified that Ms. Karimi was the only employee scheduled, and on duty, between 8 am and 9 am.\n[25] Ms. Karimi replied by email to Mr. Picard stating that the April 24, 2006 conversation had not occurred in private, that she felt she was being singled out for being late, and this had an impact on her health. Mr. Picard replied back on the same day, indicating that their discussions had been in private. Mr. Picard testified that others would not have been able to hear discussions in his cubicle, even if the volume of the conversation was louder than average, because his cubicle had higher walls than others, it was surrounded by empty cubicles, and because of where the Internet Department was located.\nOther Alleged Unfair Criticism\n[26] On April 12, 2006, Mr. Picard sent an email to Ms. Karimi outlining very briefly a number of performance issues, including the observation that Ms. Karimi had been found asleep at her desk which was not acceptable. Mr. Picard testified that he had been walking around the cubicle area and had found Ms. Karimi with her arms folded and head down, and that she had been startled when she woke up. Ms. Karimi testified that she had not been asleep. Rather, she was not feeling well and had her arms folded, with her head on her arms. No further actions were taken by Mr. Picard or management as a result of this incident.\n[27] During a meeting on April 25, 2006, Ms. Karimi complained to Mr. Picard about his treatment of her. According to Ms. Karimi, Mr. Picard told her that it would not help her to go to her union to discuss employment issues. Ms. Karimi grieved this incident to her union. Mr. Picard denied that he had told Ms. Karimi not to go to the union. The grievance was denied and not subsequently pursued by the union.\n[28] In an email on April 26, 2006, with the subject line \u201cDisruptive Behaviour\u201d, Mr. Picard wrote to Ms. Karimi, indicating that the day previous marked the second occasion on which Ms. Karimi had yelled at him during a discussion, that there were mutual respect policies in place, and that yelling was not acceptable. Mr. Picard wrote that the \u201cyelling episodes\u201d disrupted the team, that this type of behaviour had been discussed previously, that Ms. Karimi needed to work on controlling her anger, and that should she wish to discuss issues in a calm manner, a time could be arranged to do so.\n[29] Only one witness recalled there ever having been yelling between Ms. Karimi and Mr. Picard. Mr. Muktar was a colleague of Ms. Karimi\u2019s. He worked for the Data Group while Ms. Karimi worked for the Internet Department. Both groups reported to Mr. Picard. Mr. Muktar\u2019s cubicle was closest to Mr. Picard\u2019s. Mr. Muktar indicated that he had one recollection of Ms. Karimi going to Mr. Picard\u2019s cubicle, after which Mr. Picard could be heard yelling at Ms. Karimi. Under cross-examination, he indicated that Ms. Karimi was probably yelling too, and furthermore, that he could not hear what subject matter the yelling was about.\n[30] Except for Mr. Muktar, no other witnesses gave any evidence with regard to any yelling or any excessively loud discussions between Ms. Karimi and Mr. Picard.\n[31] According to Ms. Karimi, her interactions with Mr. Picard caused her much stress and anxiety and resulted in her having to go on short term disability benefits for ten days beginning April 27, 2006. She returned to work on May 8, 2006.\nB. Assignment of an overwhelming volume of tasks and tasks beyond disability-related physical limitations\n[32] Upon her return on May 8, 2006, Ms. Karimi claims Mr. Picard overwhelmed her with a large volume of work. The evidence tendered on this point was an email Mr. Picard sent to all members of the Internet Department (including Ms. Karimi), wherein he asked other members of the team to return Ms. Karimi\u2019s orders to her, along with an indication of their status. The email went on to thank everyone for covering the orders on top of their regular workload, and further thanked everyone for their teamwork and customer service.\n[33] That same afternoon, Ms. Karimi testified, Mr. Picard also assigned her the task of router inventory which involved heavy lifting, that she could not perform based on her physical disabilities. Ms. Karimi had a previous medical restriction which limited her physical abilities. This task involved providing assistance to Peter Allaert, who had been Ms. Karimi\u2019s manager from 2002 \u2013 2005, and at the time of the request was the Senior Manager of the Internet Provisioning Group. Mr. Picard indicated to her that the task was a good fit due to Ms. Karimi\u2019s morning shift. Ms. Karimi replied to Mr. Picard by email, that due to her back and wrist condition it was not a suitable task for her. She went on to indicate that if the assistance did not require heavy lifting, she would be happy to help.\n[34] Mr. Picard had been unaware that Ms. Karimi had any medical limitations. Upon receiving Ms. Karimi\u2019s email, Mr. Picard wrote to Mr. Allaert, asking if there was a medical note on file and also enquired what the lifting requirements were for the task. The following morning, May 9, 2006, Mr. Picard also wrote to a Senior Manager in Human Resources (HR) asking if there was a medical note on file with respect to Ms. Karimi\u2019s medical conditions. Later that same day, prior to receiving the medical confirmation from HR, Mr. Picard wrote to Ms. Karimi with more details on the types of routers that he required someone to handle on the morning shift. Those details had been provided by Mr. Allaert. Mr. Allaert had written to Mr. Picard that the equipment was identical to the equipment that Ms. Karimi was currently handling, and he provided a manual which set out the specifications of each type of router, including physical size and weight.\n[35] On May 10, 2006, Mr. Picard was provided confirmation from HR that there was a medical note on Ms. Karimi\u2019s file confirming she had some restrictions. Both Mr. Picard and Mr. Allaert testified that the routers involved were the same ones that Ms. Karimi had already been provisioning and handling since 2000. Mr. Allaert agreed that the assistance request came from himself, and that it was Mr. Picard who had assigned the employee. Ms. Karimi testified that despite confirming that she had a doctor\u2019s note in her employee file regarding her physical limitations, Mr. Picard repeated his request that she engage in work relating to router inventory. Ms. Karimi added that this function was normally performed by another department.\n[36] Mr. Picard\u2019s testimony was that the 8 am shift was a less busy time in the call centre, and that he tried to keep employees productive. He selected Ms. Karimi to assist with router inventory because of her 8 am start time. He indicated the task was a \u201cshift specific\u201d task, as opposed to a person specific task. Had someone else been working during that shift, they would have been assigned the task.\n[37] A week after the initial task assignment had been made, on May 16, 2006, Ms. Karimi and Mr. Allaert were still discussing the task. Mr. Allaert indicated that he would ensure there was no heavy lifting involved, and that the routers would be brought to her desk and removed from her desk upon being dealt with. These discussions, via email, led to Ms. Karimi indicating that due to her own workload, she could not assist. Evidence from Ms. Karimi and Mr. Picard confirmed that Ms. Karimi did not end up performing the task.\n[38] The next incident giving rise to an allegation of discrimination occurred almost one year later.\nC. Reassignment and denial of training opportunities\n[39] On April 23, 2007, Ms. Karimi was temporarily reassigned from the Internet Department to the Design Department. At the time of her reassignment, Ms. Karimi was still the only female employee in the Internet Department. Zayo submits that the manager of the Design Department, Tim Richardson, requested that an employee with internet experience be moved into the department to do cross-training. Emails from Anna Di Nuccio, Mr. Richardson\u2019s Director, show that some responsibilities from the Internet team had been moved to the circuit design team a year earlier. In the Calgary office, a decision was made to train someone to do the work. Now, the goal was to align Toronto\u2019s operations with Calgary and the thought was it would be easier to bring someone in with the knowledge and skillset rather than train a new individual from scratch. Furthermore, it was felt this would be a good developmental opportunity and Ms. Karimi would be a good candidate for it. Tim Richardson, Peter Allaert, Paul Picard and Anna Di Nuccio testified to the reasoning behind the assignment, i.e. to align operations in Toronto with Calgary, to introduce skillsets from the Internet Department, to expand the work and expertise in the Design Department, and to cross-train individuals. As Ms. Karimi had expressed a desire to develop her skills, a decision was made to offer her the opportunity to be temporarily reassigned to the Design Department. According to Zayo, Ms. Karimi was under no obligation to accept the temporary reassignment, but voluntarily agreed to it, along with her union.\n[40] While Ms. Karimi expressed some concern, via email, to her union officials in going to the Design Department on the re-assignment, she asked the union officials not to convey that to management, as she did not want to appear to have been forced to take the position. She indicated she would accept the re-assignment. A union official did indicate informally to management that Ms. Karimi was not interested in expanding her skills, but, the union and Ms. Karimi took no further steps to discuss the matter with Zayo management. Thus, Ms. Karimi never informed management that she did not want to take the temporary assignment.\n[41] She claims that while her collective agreement provided for reassignments based on seniority, she was selected by Mr. Picard for the reassignment despite having more seniority than other male colleagues in the Internet Department. The testimony of shop steward Dylan Gadwa, and the documentary evidence of union officials Camilla Leblanc and Ken Burton, indicated there was no seniority requirement when it came to temporary assignments within the collective agreement. The documentary evidence consisted of emails between Ms. Karimi and her union officials, wherein they provided their interpretation of the applicable collective agreement provisions. Mr. Gadwa was both a colleague of Ms. Karimi\u2019s, working within the same occupational classification, and in the same workgroup.\n[42] Ms. Karimi was concerned about her seniority rights and status, should there be lay-offs in the Design Department. She sought assistance from her union in order to confirm her rights. Zayo submits that its HR Department made it clear to Ms. Karimi that as the reassignment was temporary she was still part of the Internet Department. Zayo further confirmed that should there be any restructuring at Zayo, such as lay-offs in the Design Department, Ms. Karimi would return to her home position\/department. Ms. Karimi had also expressed a concern that she would have lower seniority within the Design Department as she was the newest member of that group.\n[43] According to Ms. Karimi, Mr. Picard told her that on reassignment her skill set would be used, and that she would get training and development opportunities. However, Ms. Karimi claims she was assigned unskilled tasks and was denied training opportunities afforded to male colleagues. Specifically, she claims that male colleagues in the Internet Department received further training that Ms. Karimi missed by virtue of being in the Design Department. Furthermore, she argues she was not afforded training equivalent to her male colleagues in the Design Department.\n[44] Zayo submits that the reason why Ms. Karimi was not getting formal or course delivered training was because part of the rationale for the temporary assignment was to provide internet knowledge to the Design Department. However, she did receive informal training in the form of job shadowing. Zayo also submits that, while Ms. Karimi wanted to do more complex design work, she failed to appreciate or accept that before she could learn the more complex work, she first had to learn the less complex design work.\n[45] Tim Richardson testified that the method of training that was primarily given in the Design Department was side-by-side shadowing or training. There was no formal training program or series of courses that one ordinarily took to work in the Design Department. There may have been the occasional course when a new technology or product was involved. Mr. Richardson further testified that all others in the Design Department would have been trained the same way, that is, via side-by-side training. Ms. Karimi provided evidence that she was not happy with this form of training, and that she preferred instructor-led courses or courses that came with some sort of certification; she found it difficult to learn by spending time with co-workers. That being said, the parties led no evidence of any training that had been offered to others in the Design Department, either prior to Ms. Karimi joining the department or during her time there, and that had been denied to Ms. Karimi. There was uncontradicted evidence introduced during the hearing showing that Ms. Karimi was trained the same way as any individual who had previously joined the group or would join the group.\nD. Demotion\/Rebalancing\n[46] Ms. Karimi claims she was demoted to the position of a Level 1 CT on November 28, 2007. Zayo described the transfer as a rebalancing of the workforce. Ms. Karimi claims, based on seniority, that more junior male colleagues should have been demoted before her.\n[47] According to Zayo, the work change was a form of business-related \u201crebalancing\u201d carried out pursuant to the collective agreement. The rebalancing was announced to the Internet Department via an email on November 14, 2007. Under the rebalancing exercise, two employees were moved from the Internet Department to the Order Management group because there was a need for additional resources in that group. In accordance with the provisions of the collective agreement, in the absence of volunteers for the rebalancing, the junior employees (those with the lowest seniority) in the affected department were rebalanced to the other area. Ms. Karimi and a male colleague, as the two most junior employees in the Internet Department, were rebalanced. As the new work they would be performing was at a different classification from their previous jobs, they were reclassified from CT2s to CT1s. However, they benefitted from salary protection, ensuring that Ms. Karimi would continue to be paid as a CT2.\n[48] Ms. Karimi filed a grievance over the rebalancing, but it was withdrawn by her union after Zayo and the union discussed the matter at a grievance meeting and the union was satisfied that the rebalancing had been carried out in accordance with the provisions of the collective agreement.\n[49] While Ms. Karimi\u2019s complaint alleged she was higher up the seniority list and thus, should not have been rebalanced, during her testimony, she acknowledged that she was indeed one of the two most junior employees on the seniority list. This was also confirmed by the testimony of Mr. Gadwa, who was her union representative at the time.\n[50] Mr. Picard testified that he played no role in who got rebalanced as the exercise was based on seniority. Furthermore, he did not have a role in making the decision to rebalance, as that decision was made by a higher level of management within Zayo.\n[51] Jennifer Bazinet, Manager of Service Delivery \u2013 Data and Internet, testified that rebalancing occurred because the Order Management group was going to be taking on additional functions, some of which had been previously performed by the CTAC Department. The Order Management group fell under her area of responsibility. Under the rebalancing, some of the tasks performed by CTAC at the completion of an order would now be done by the Order Management group. The tasks in question were similar to work already being performed by Order Managers (OM), and Zayo felt it was more appropriate for it all to be handled by the Order Management group. The transfer of tasks from CTAC to the Order Management group necessitated the rebalancing of employees between these groups.\n[52] After the rebalancing, Ms. Bazinet became Ms. Karimi\u2019s direct manager in the Order Management group. Ms. Bazinet described Ms. Karimi as having been reluctant and at times contradictory when it came to training. There were times when Ms. Karimi would say she needed training. At other times she indicated she knew what she was doing and did not need training, as she had worked in CTAC when the Order Management group did not even exist, and CTAC had performed a similar function. However, Ms. Bazinet testified that the work in the Order Management group was different with different systems, different methodologies and different groups.\n[53] The training provided was job shadowing or side by side, with experienced OM\u2019s sitting with less experienced OM\u2019s as they performed basic orders. Then, gradually, the number of orders and the complexity of orders would be increased for the new OM. This is how all new OM\u2019s were trained. The other employee rebalanced at the same time as Ms. Karimi was trained in the same way. Ms. Bazinet testified that there had been in the past another employee from CTAC who had been rebalanced in, for whom it had taken about a year to learn the job. Ms. Karimi was progressing slowly compared to others, according to Ms. Bazinet.\n[54] Ms. Bazinet described how at various points in time, several months after Ms. Karimi had started in the section, Ms. Karimi had asked for several orders to be reassigned, as Ms. Karimi was not working with the specific technologies. Ms. Bazinet felt that at that point in time, Ms. Karimi was behind where she should have been in her knowledge, as she was still working on basic orders. Furthermore, the volume of orders that Ms. Karimi was working on was minimal, compared to how many Ms. Bazinet thought she should have been taking on. Finally, Ms. Bazinet testified as to errors and mistakes that Ms. Karimi made in handling some files during this period, which Ms. Bazinet described as basic errors tied to knowing the function of the job. Ms. Bazinet found it discouraging that two months into the position, Ms. Karimi was making such errors.\n[55] Ms. Bazinet testified that in conversations with Ms. Karimi, Ms. Karimi expressed the view that the work was below her skill level. Ms. Bazinet attempted to reassure Ms. Karimi that the decision to move her had not been personal, but a business decision.\nE. Failure to accommodate and retaliation\n[56] Following Ms. Karimi\u2019s demotion\/rebalancing, she began experiencing symptoms of depression. In or about April 2008, she went on sick leave and, following a brief return to work for one week, went on short-term disability from around July 8, 2008.\n[57] One day in early October 2008, Ms. Karimi provided Zayo with three separate medical notes, which can be summarized as follows:\nA July 2008 note indicating that Ms. Karimi required modified duties on a permanent basis;\nA note dated September 2, 2008, indicating that Ms. Karimi could not work for the foreseeable future at her usual workplace; and,\nA note dated October 2, 2008, from Dr. Aaron Malkin indicating that she could gradually return to work by the end of that month. This note indicated that it would be necessary for Ms. Karimi to work from home in order to return to work.\nZayo relied on the most recently dated note in assessing possible accommodation for Ms. Karimi and ultimately found that it could not accommodate Ms. Karimi working from home. She remained on short-term disability benefits for approximately 8 months, until March 2009.\n[58] According to Zayo, it could not accommodate Ms. Karimi\u2019s request to work from home because of operational requirements. Zayo indicated that Ms. Karimi had only received three months of training on her new duties prior to her sick leave, which was not enough training to enable her to perform the work independently. She had also been progressing in her training very slowly.\n[59] Mr. Van Horne, who had held various HR positions within Zayo, including as an HR Advisor and Senior Manager of Labour Relations, gave evidence on behalf of the Respondent. Mr. Van Horne testified that Ms. Karimi\u2019s accommodation request could not be met, and that she also did not qualify for the Teleworking Policy. However, he acknowledged that the company\u2019s Workplace Accommodation Policy did allow for an employee to work from home. The two policies were separate and independent from each other.\n[60] Ms. Bazinet and Mr. Van Horne discussed the accommodation request together, before communicating to Ms. Karimi. Ms. Bazinet testified that Ms. Karimi did not meet some of the key criteria under the Teleworking Policy such as; (i) that the employee be a self-motivated worker; (ii) that the employee does not require a high level of supervision; (iii) that the employee be comfortable working in isolation, and; (iv) that the employee\u2019s past and current performance must meet or exceed expectations. Ms. Bazinet testified that:\nMs. Karimi was not able to work independently without a high level of supervision;\nMs. Karimi had not been fully trained;\nthe training was not in a classroom environment, as it was on the job training which would require Ms. Karimi to be in the office;\nthe training usually took 6 months or more;\nMs. Karimi had performance issues during her first 3 months and would need the immediate support of her peers to help her as she learned the process, and how to handle any problems with orders that might arise.\n[61] Under the Workplace Accommodation Policy, similar criteria were considered to find that Ms. Karimi could not be accommodated to work from home under that policy either.\n[62] For these reasons, Zayo made the decision that Ms. Karimi could not be accommodated to work from home.\n[63] Furthermore, Ms. Bazinet testified that Ms. Karimi had not been performing well during the 3 months she had worked in the Order Management group. There were new systems and new processes for her to learn and while there were some similarities with her former department, there were many differences as well. Zayo says it further determined that it could not provide Ms. Karimi with a gradual return to work in her regular role, because work in the Order Management group was highly time-sensitive, with a significant potential for very costly errors. Each order was handled by an individual employee who was the only contact person for the customer, and who had to be available in order to address any errors. OMs were required to carry the file from the beginning to the end. Accordingly, the Order Management team could not accommodate a part-time employee.\n[64] On or about March 30, 2009, Ms. Karimi exhausted her short-term disability benefits and applied for long-term disability benefits. On March 30, 2009, Ms. Karimi returned to work at Zayo pursuant to an Individual Work Plan\/Return to Work Plan that had been prepared by Great-West Life, which still required approval and discussion with Zayo. Ms. Karimi\u2019s return to work was unexpected by Ms. Bazinet, as no one from Great-West Life had informed her that Ms. Karimi would be returning. Only that afternoon did Ms. Bazinet and a representative of Great-West Life speak, at which time it was confirmed that Ms. Karimi would return to work. Ms. Bazinet claimed she had not seen the Individual Work Plan on the day Ms. Karimi returned. Ms. Bazinet, who was still Ms. Karimi\u2019s manager, offered Ms. Karimi short-term computer database clean-up work, to be performed three days a week, which accorded with Ms. Karimi\u2019s limitations.\n[65] According to Zayo, this was a temporary work assignment created for the purpose of accommodating Ms. Karimi in the short-term, and was not intended to be permanent. Zayo submits Ms. Karimi accepted the accommodation and performed the work without any apparent difficulty. Ms. Karimi says she was given the unskilled task of record clean- up, when she could have been given some training, as was provided for in the Individual Work Plan\/Return to Work Plan. Ms. Bazinet testified that such work provided an opportunity for Ms. Karimi to become familiar again with the various systems and orders, while Zayo waited for her to return to full-time Order Management duties. Ms. Bazinet described the assignment as the exact same type of work an OM would do, but without the time sensitivity and customer impact. Thus, she viewed the assignment as a type of training. Ms. Bazinet indicated that Ms. Karimi was not assigned OM customer order work because of the nature of the work. The work required one OM to manage or \u201cown\u201d the order from start to finish; customers and other departments involved were to have a single point of contact should any issues arise, which would not have been possible had Ms. Karimi been working on the orders part-time and only several hours a day.\n[66] On October 26, 2009, Ms. Bazinet told Ms. Karimi that she would have to return to work on a full-time basis the following week. Zayo had been informed by Great-West Life that Ms. Karimi no longer qualified for short-term disability, and there were no further medical concerns that necessitated her to be on an accommodated schedule. Around this time, Ms. Bazinet determined that there was no further computer clean-up work available to be performed. The evidence was not clear on whether the information from the insurance provider arrived first or whether it arrived subsequent to the near completion of the records clean-up work.\n[67] According to Ms. Karimi, at that time she could not physically or mentally tolerate full-time duties in the workplace. A problem, Ms. Karimi submits, that could have been avoided had she been entitled to work from home.\n[68] On October 27, 2009, Ms. Karimi, through her legal counsel, advised Zayo that she was not able to return to work full-time, and provided a copy of a note from her treating physician, dated October 22, 2009, advising that she \u201c\u2026is in no physical or mental condition to return to work full-time. She should be on long-term disability.\u201d A meeting was subsequently scheduled between Ms. Karimi, management and her union.\n[69] On November 19, 2009, Ms. Karimi met with Zayo representatives and a representative of her union. Zayo informed Ms. Karimi that it would no longer accommodate her working 3 days per week, as it had done since March 31, 2009. Zayo told Ms. Karimi that she was expected to return to work full-time starting December 7, 2009, failing which she would not be allowed to work at all.\n[70] Given that Ms. Karimi was still pursuing long-term disability benefits (Ms. Karimi was appealing the insurer\u2019s findings that she did not qualify for long-term disability benefits), Zayo submits it was willing to place Ms. Karimi on a temporary unpaid leave of absence until: (i) there had been a decision on her claim\/appeal; or, (ii) she could return to work full-time; or, (iii) Zayo was able to identify an alternative accommodation for her with a 3 day work week. In order to provide Ms. Karimi with an income bridge during her appeal process, Zayo provided evidence it had advised Ms. Karimi that she would be permitted to use her outstanding vacation pay. Zayo also placed Ms. Karimi on a paid leave of absence from December 29, 2009 to January 1, 2010, in order to permit her to address difficulties with her medical documentation.\n[71] Zayo says it actively undertook an accommodation search for suitable positions for Ms. Karimi. As part of the accommodation process, on December 2, 2009, Zayo offered Ms. Karimi a part-time position involving evening hours during the week, and night hours on the weekend, at another location (in Etobicoke). At the same time, despite having allowed her to work 3 days per week for over 8 months without requiring medical documentation, Ms. Karimi provided evidence that Zayo demanded medical documentation from her before it would permit her to do any more work. According to Ms. Karimi, the offer of a part-time position in Etobicoke was a feeble attempt by Zayo to appear accommodating. She claimed she declined the position because the position was far from her home, and claimed her back condition prevented lengthy travel, and sleep problems prevented her from working night shifts.\n[72] According to Zayo, the offer was a legitimate offer to accommodate her with part-time work, and as far as it was aware, the position met Ms. Karimi\u2019s medical restrictions. When the accommodation offer was made, Zayo did request Ms. Karimi to obtain and provide medical confirmation that she was able to work. This was because the most recent medical information it had in its possession, the October 22, 2009 note, indicated that she was not able to work full-time and she should be on long term disability. Following Ms. Karimi declining the position in Etobicoke, Zayo submits it was unable to identify another position that accommodated her previously-stated restrictions of part-time work with some physical limitations. According to Zayo, it was therefore unable to permit Ms. Karimi to return to work in any capacity after December 4, 2009, absent new medical documentation with respect to her restrictions. Zayo would continue to look for accommodated positions and if one were found, then Ms. Karimi would be required to provide updated medical documentation.\n[73] With respect to the medical documentation request, Zayo indicated that it required such documentation, given that Ms. Karimi was pursuing her long-term disability claim on the basis that she was totally disabled from working, while at the same time requesting accommodation to return to work. Witnesses for Zayo testified that they were unclear about the Complainant\u2019s ability to work.\n[74] On December 7, 2009, Zayo informed Ms. Karimi that she would be paid for three days per week until the end of 2009, through a combination of vacation and holiday pay. Despite Ms. Karimi\u2019s objection to using her vacation and holidays in such a way, Zayo indicated she had no say in the matter, and was not welcome at work unless she received medical clearance. December 9, 2009, was Ms. Karimi\u2019s last day of work at Zayo, and she has been on a leave of absence since then.\n[75] On December 17, 2009, Ms. Karimi, through her legal counsel, sent Zayo a note from her doctor, a portion of which reads as follows:\nFirst, let me re-state my advice dated Oct. 22\/09 that Ms. Karimi should be on long term disability. Since this position appears to be unacceptable to her employer, I am prepared to suggest the following compromise.\nI am prepared to support Ms. Ashraf Karimi working three days per week, with flexible hours, on a trial basis under my observation at a location other than her current workplace. Working significant hours at her current location would exacerbate her condition. An alternative location closer to home would be helpful in light of her physical limitations.\n[76] Ryan Stammer, a Labour Relations Specialist with Zayo at the time, had been working on Ms. Karimi\u2019s matter since the summer of 2009. It was his role to become involved with any matters that could result in a matter becoming a labour relations issue, for example, by ensuring that any steps taken by a manager complied with the collective agreement. With respect to finding an accommodated position for Ms. Karimi in December 2009, Mr. Stammer took a number of steps as part of the accommodation search. These steps included emailing various HR colleagues across the company to ask if any had vacancies within their business units, if any had work that could be performed by an employee working from home, or if they were aware of any job duties that could be combined from multiple jobs or separated from existing jobs. He testified that he followed up at least once a week, seeking positions that could accommodate Ms. Karimi, with no success. He attributed part of the lack of success to there having been a number of lay-offs in the company leading up to that time period, and therefore, there were fewer positions within the company.\n[77] Mr. Van Horne had testified about the number of lay-off notices that had gone out from late 2008 to early 2010. In his estimation, there were significant lay-offs. Approximately 20% or more of the various CT positions (CT1 to CT3) were eliminated, representing over 100 employees. Mr. Stammer testified that he did not continue to look for further accommodating positions beyond February 2010, when Ms. Karimi\u2019s disability benefits were reinstated and she was approved for long-term disability.\n[78] On January 11, 2010, Ms. Karimi filed a grievance alleging ongoing disability discrimination by Zayo and a refusal to accommodate. The grievance was denied by Zayo at step 1 and the union did not progress the grievance to step 2.\n[79] Ms. Karimi was ultimately approved for long-term disability benefits in or around February 2010, retroactive to July 6, 2009. She has been in receipt of those benefits since that date.\nV. Issues\nThe questions I was called upon to decide can be summarized as follows:\nWas the Complainant discriminated against by the Respondent, Zayo, on the basis of sex and\/or disability contrary to s. 7 of the Act, pursuant to her first complaint?\nIf the Complainant establishes a prima facie case of discrimination based on sex and\/or disability, can the Respondent prove that the impugned restrictions were based on a bona fide occupational requirement (\u201cBFOR\u201d) pursuant to paragraph 15(1)(a) and ss.15(2) of the Act?\nWas the Complainant discriminated against by Zayo on the basis of disability pursuant to her second complaint?\nIf the Complainant establishes a prima facie case of discrimination based on disability, can the Respondent prove that the impugned restrictions were based on a BFOR pursuant to paragraph 15(1)(a) and ss. 15(2) of the Act?\nWas the Complainant retaliated against by Zayo within the meaning of s. 14.1 of the Act?\nVI. Legal Framework\n[80] Ms. Karimi has the burden to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is \u201c...one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent-employer\u2026\u201d (see Ont. Human Rights Comm. v. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 SCR 536 at para. 28, 23 DLR (4th) 321).\n[81] To establish prima facie discrimination under s. 7 of the Act, complainants are required to show that they: (1) have a characteristic or characteristics protected from discrimination under the Act; (2) that they experienced an adverse impact with respect to employment under s. 7 of the Act; and, (3) that the protected characteristic or characteristics were a factor in the adverse impact (see Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61 at para. 33, [2012] 3 SCR 360). All three elements must be established on a balance of probabilities (see Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier Aerospace Training Center), 2015 SCC 39 at paras. 56, 65, [2015] 2 SCR 789 (Bombardier)).\n[82] Similarly, to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, complainants are required to show: (1) that they previously filed a human rights complaint under the Act; (2) that they experienced an adverse impact following the filing of their complaint; and, (3) that the human rights complaint was a factor in the adverse impact (see First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (Representing the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Canada), 2015 CHRT 14 at paras. 3-30 (Caring Society 2015); and, Millbrook First Nation v. Tabor, 2016 FC 894 at paras. 54-64, 270 ACWS (3d) 451 (Tabor FC)).\n[83] A respondent may defend against an allegation of prima facie discrimination by calling evidence to show its actions were not discriminatory, by establishing a statutory defense that justifies the discrimination, or by doing both (see Bombardier at para. 64). In response to Ms. Karimi\u2019s allegations of discrimination on the basis of sex, during the period leading up to her request for accommodation, Zayo submits its actions were not discriminatory. With respect to her allegations of discrimination based on disability, Zayo argues it did not retaliate against Ms. Karimi and invokes paragraph 15(1)(a) of the Act, which provides that it is not a discriminatory practice if \u201cany refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement\u201d. Subsection 15(2) of the Act further provides that, for any practice mentioned in paragraph 15(1)(a) to be considered a bona fide occupational requirement, Zayo must establish that accommodation of Ms. Karimi\u2019s needs would impose an undue hardship on it, considering health, safety and cost.\nVII. Analysis\nA. Was the Complainant discriminated against by the Respondent, Zayo, on the basis of sex and\/or disability contrary to s. 7 of the Act, pursuant to her first complaint?\n[84] Before going into the merits of the complaint, the Tribunal notes the position expressed by Zayo in its Statement of Particulars (SOP) that discrimination based on disability did not form part of the first complaint referred to the Tribunal. Zayo indicated, prior to the commencement of the evidentiary portion of the hearing, that it intended to argue the issue on the first day of the hearing. It did not do so. Following a review of Ms. Karimi\u2019s complaint form, I am prepared to accept that it alleges disability based discrimination, but only with respect to the incident involving the assignment of work following her return to work from medical leave and the router inventory task assignment. Therefore, I find that disability based discrimination on those two issues are properly before the Tribunal. However, the Complainant\u2019s closing submissions only highlighted these issues under the ground of sex discrimination. Despite this, the Tribunal will consider these instances through the lens of both sex and disability discrimination.\na. Critical treatment and scrutiny from manager\n[85] Ms. Karimi claims that, as the only female employee in the Internet Department, Mr. Picard singled her out and treated her differently, including criticizing her performance and punctuality, assigning her an overwhelming volume of tasks and denying her training opportunities made available to male colleagues. Ultimately, she says her gender influenced the decision to reassign her to the Design Department and to demote her. In terms of disability, Ms. Karimi also claims Mr. Picard overwhelmed her with work, and assigned her work involving heavy lifting when he knew she had disability related limitations that prevented her from doing such tasks.\n[86] Zayo submits Mr. Picard did not engage in unfounded criticism of Ms. Karimi\u2019s work or punctuality. While Mr. Picard did speak to Ms. Karimi periodically about the need to attend work on a timely basis, it was because her punctuality was poor. Despite this, there was never any written or other discipline imposed on Ms. Karimi, whether for performance or punctuality reasons. Any critique of her work and punctuality was done on an informal basis, as with any other employee. Overall, Zayo submits Ms. Karimi had a high opinion of her abilities, and had difficulty getting along with co-workers and managers who critiqued her work, both before and after the arrival of Mr. Picard.\n[87] Zayo takes the position that there were additional female employees who reported to Mr. Picard from the Data Section, and that CTAC Data and Internet operated together. Regardless of whether they were operating together, there were additional female employees who reported to Mr. Picard. None were called to testify.\n[88] Sex is a prohibited ground of discrimination under the Act. While the first two criteria are met, the Tribunal finds that Ms. Karimi failed to meet her burden on the third aspect of the prima facie test, i.e. she failed to establish a connection between her gender and the treatment she experienced.\n[89] The Tribunal understands and sympathises with Ms. Karimi\u2019s precarious position at Zayo, as she was working there at a time when the company was under economic stress and undergoing much re-organization, which required her to move between departments and learn new tasks. However, there was insufficient evidence provided by Ms. Karimi to demonstrate that gender was a factor in any of the adverse impacts she experienced. The fact that she may have been the only female working within the Internet Department, does not, on its own or in combination with any of the other evidence in this case, meet the balance of probabilities threshold required to demonstrate that decisions were made adverse to her interest and that her gender was a factor in those adverse impacts. There was no evidence, direct or indirect, presented which established that Ms. Karimi\u2019s gender played any role in the differential treatment she received.\nCustomer Complaints\n[90] With respect to the allegations of improper scrutiny of Ms. Karimi\u2019s work, specifically with respect to the criticisms of Ms. Karimi\u2019s performance on the various customer files discussed earlier in this decision, I see no evidence that her gender was a factor in such scrutiny. While some of the criticism may have been incorrectly placed, in that it appears Ms. Karimi was not to blame for some of the errors, again, there was no evidence before me, other than the subjective feelings of Ms. Karimi, indicating that gender was a factor in the treatment she received from Mr. Picard. The evidence is clear to me that there were some issues with Ms. Karimi\u2019s performance, and it was appropriate for her Manager, Mr. Picard, to address them with her. For example, in the DEL matter, the email messages between Ms. Karimi and Mr. Picard demonstrate that she did have the authority to escalate the matter, but simply felt that pressure from someone higher would be better. In fact, Ms. Karimi acknowledged in an email to her union, dated April 13, 2006, that she could have escalated the matter, but didn\u2019t because she felt the request would have been acted upon more quickly had a manager made the request.\n[91] Zayo provided reasonable explanations for why Mr. Picard felt it important to bring to the attention of Ms. Karimi that there had been mistakes made and lapses in correctly servicing those specific files and customers. The email evidence, which captured the concerns of the customers, was quite clear. Mistakes were made, the customers were unhappy, and the customers\u2019 concerns needed to be followed up on.\n[92] Zayo gave evidence that it took customer complaints very seriously as there was much competition from other businesses and it was important to improve customer service in order to retain customers. Following a careful review of the email exchange between Mr. Picard and Ms. Karimi, it is my view that the tone and focus of Mr. Picard\u2019s messages to Ms. Karimi did not appear to be about laying blame on an employee with the end goal of punishing or penalizing. Rather, the focus was on identifying issues so that practices could be improved, and ensuring that customers had a positive experience. For example, with regards to the DEL matter, following the re-assignment of the matter to one of Ms. Karimi\u2019s colleagues, Mr. Picard requested from Ms. Karimi a summary of the key dates, in order to assess how service on customer files could be improved. There were no repercussions or reprimands rendered against Ms. Karimi.\n[93] Additionally, the chain of emails involving the FA incident clearly demonstrates that Mr. Picard, and the Senior Manager responsible for the customer account, were focused on improving service going forward, and not on gathering any information for the purposes of reprimand. Ultimately, there was no further action taken by Zayo in respect of any of Ms. Karimi\u2019s performance issues.\nPunctuality emails\n[94] With respect to the various interactions involving her punctuality, I cannot find any evidence to support the allegation that Mr. Picard was critical of such punctuality in whole or in part based on Ms. Karimi\u2019s gender. I find that Mr. Picard was concerned with ensuring that Ms. Karimi was at work at the start time of her shift, and that he had an employee available to perform duties for the Internet Department during the appropriate time. Ms. Karimi was the only employee scheduled to work between 8 am and 9 am, and he needed to ensure someone was available to take customer calls. Furthermore, Mr. Picard indicated in one of his email messages that if there was a substantive issue that interfered with Ms. Karimi from arriving at work on time, the two of them could discuss a possible shift change if applicable. No evidence was presented that Ms. Karimi sought such a shift change.\n[95] Ms. Karimi, during the hearing, requested that Zayo conduct a search of its records of Mr. Picard\u2019s emails in order to find examples of Mr. Picard sending similar emails to other employees when they were late for work or had any issues with respect to punctuality. Zayo consented and conducted a search which resulted in no such emails being found. Zayo indicated a number of possible reasons for the negative search results, including, that Mr. Picard ceased employment with Zayo in 2012, and company policy was that former employee emails are deleted within 3 months. Other technical explanations were also offered. Ms. Karimi asks that I draw an adverse inference from the negative search result. I decline to do so as I find that Zayo\u2019s explanation that such emails were no longer available due to company retention policies was reasonable. Moreover, while there was no documentary evidence provided by Zayo indicating that other employees received similar emails for being late for work, Mr. Picard\u2019s testimony regarding his communication practices on punctuality was not contradicted by any other witness at the hearing.\n[96] In light of the foregoing, I find that the evidence does not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that gender discrimination was a factor in the alleged adverse treatment (Bombardier at paras. 56, 65).\nOther Alleged Unfair Criticism\n[97] With respect to the allegation that Mr. Picard attempted to dissuade Ms. Karimi from speaking to the union, the evidence is inconclusive as to the accuracy of Ms. Karimi\u2019s characterization of this event. Ultimately, she did grieve the incident and such grievance was denied and not further grieved to the next level.\n[98] With respect to the incidents involving the disruptive behaviour and yelling, the evidence is that they both may have yelled at each other. Mr. Picard invoked the workplace respect policies when he followed up with Ms. Karimi via email.\n[99] Regarding the incident when Ms. Karimi was communicated to about her having slept at her desk, or simply having had her head down in her arms, it was appropriate for Mr. Picard to raise the incident as a performance issue.\n[100] In addition to viewing these incidents individually, when all these incidents of critical treatment are considered as a whole, I cannot conclude that gender was a factor in the treatment Ms. Karimi received from Mr. Picard.\n[101] While it may be that Mr. Picard and Ms. Karimi did not like each other, or that one or both of them had personal challenges when dealing with the other, nothing leads me to believe that such challenges or issues had any connection to discriminatory grounds.\nb. Reassignment and denial of training opportunities\n[102] The Tribunal again notes that both Ms. Karimi\u2019s initial complaint and SOP characterized the denial of training as sex discrimination. However, her closing submissions only dealt with training as part of the disability and refusal to accommodate portion of her second complaint. Despite this, the Tribunal considered whether Ms. Karimi was denied training based on both sex and disability discrimination while she was working within the Design Department.\n[103] With respect to the re-assignment of Ms. Karimi to the Design Department, I find there to be no evidence that the decision was made in relation to Ms. Karimi\u2019s gender. While Ms. Karimi did call a witness, Ian Cameron, to testify about whether the collective agreement was applied properly, I give his evidence little weight. He was not directly involved in any of the events giving rise to Ms. Karimi\u2019s complaints, he did not have all the facts to assess the situation, and he did not handle grievances involving the interpretation of collective agreement provisions. This witness ultimately agreed that seniority was not a consideration when it came to an employee being temporarily assigned to another department. Furthermore, evidence presented of communications between the union Vice-President and a Senior Manager of Labour Relations demonstrates that the appropriate provisions were followed, and that seniority was not a consideration when selecting who to temporarily re-assign to Design. I therefore accept that the collective agreement rules were properly followed.\n[104] Zayo provided convincing evidence as to the business rationale behind the decision as outlined in paragraph 39 above. Moreover, Ms. Karimi had an opportunity to voice objections to the re-assignment, yet she did not clearly and unambiguously do so. While an official from Ms. Karimi\u2019s union did unofficially inform management that Ms. Karimi was not interested in the assignment, Ms. Karimi did not take any steps to inform management officially nor request that the union take any formal actions to grieve the decision of re-assigning her. Instead, Ms. Karimi indicated to Mr. Picard that she was looking forward to the assignment as evidenced by an email she sent to Mr. Picard where she stated that she \u201cloved the learning opportunity\u201d. As previously stated, the burden is on the complainant to demonstrate that gender discrimination was a factor in the temporary assignment to Design. That link has not been demonstrated in this case.\n[105] I find that Ms. Karimi was not denied any training while she was in the Design Department for any reason related to her gender or disability. The evidence was clear that Ms. Karimi was being trained using the exact same methodologies that had been used to train other employees in Design. There was no evidence of training that had been provided to other Design Department employees, which was denied to Ms. Karimi. The evidence did show that Ms. Karimi was unhappy with the method of training, but there was no evidence she was denied the training necessary to do the work in the Design Department and no evidence that she was denied training based on her gender.\n[106] During the temporary assignment of Ms. Karimi to the Design Department, she was for all intents and purposes a member of that department. As such, had there been some training offered to her colleagues in the Internet Department, she would have missed out on such training. No evidence was provided by Ms. Karimi on what, if any, training she missed out on, and what the possible impacts on her were. Therefore, I find that while on assignment, she experienced no adverse impact in the form of missed training.\nc. Demotion\/Rebalancing\n[107] Ms. Karimi admitted that she was one of the two most junior employees in terms of seniority in the Internet Department, and as such, was properly identified for rebalancing by Zayo according to the collective agreement.\n[108] I accept Zayo\u2019s explanation that the rebalancing of personnel was for reasons related to the restructuring of its business operations. The rebalancing notice indicated that 4 employees were to be rebalanced. The first two employees to be rebalanced were clearly identifiable as they were the lowest on the seniority list (Ms. Karimi and a male colleague). While there was a discussion by Mr. Picard and Mr. Van Horne about targeting two additional employees (employees 3 and 4) for rebalancing, that discussion was clearly not about Ms. Karimi. Accordingly, I find that the Complainant has failed to demonstrate that gender was a factor in Zayo\u2019s decision to restructure its operations, which necessarily resulted in a rebalancing of employees (both Ms. Karimi and a male colleague were rebalanced), including the amalgamation of various groups.\nd. Assignment of an overwhelming volume of tasks and tasks beyond disability-related physical limitations\n[109] With respect to the assignment of work upon Ms. Karimi\u2019s return to work on May 8, 2006, I find nothing improper about Mr. Picard re-assigning Ms. Karimi\u2019s original files back to her. There was no evidence that Ms. Karimi was assigned more files than usual, or more than what any other employees were carrying in their workload. She simply had her files returned to her, now that she was back at work. There did not appear to be anything arbitrary, punitive or malicious in the return of her files. Despite Ms. Karimi\u2019s claim that she felt overwhelmed, no evidence was presented that Ms. Karimi required or requested a gradual return to work, or had any new limitations that could impact her workload. Again, I find no link between Ms. Karimi\u2019s gender or disability, and her being given back her files upon returning to work after her sick leave.\n[110] To the extent that Ms. Karimi claims disability and gender discrimination as a result of the router inventory assignment, I find that she has not established that she suffered an adverse effect as a result of this assignment. Ultimately, she did not perform the task, nor was she forced to perform the task.\n[111] It is clear that Ms. Karimi did have an accommodation need due to her medical condition (her back and wrist condition restricting heavy lifting). Zayo provided reasonable explanations for why Ms. Karimi was asked to perform the router inventory task, namely, that the work was shift specific, and that Ms. Karimi was the only person who worked that shift. Furthermore, once Mr. Picard had been notified and received confirmation that Ms. Karimi did have a condition in need of accommodation, he attempted to accommodate Ms. Karimi. The device manuals were checked for the weight of the routers to ensure that they were similar in weight to what Ms. Karimi had already been dealing with. Finally, Mr. Allaert took steps to ensure Ms. Karimi could perform the task without any heavy lifting, as he arranged for someone else to bring her the routers and remove them once configured.\n[112] I accept the evidence of Mr. Picard and Mr. Allaert that the task was assigned to Ms. Karimi because it was a shift-specific task. While Ms. Karimi claimed that the beginning of her shift was a busy period for her, due to her being the only employee working at that time. I accept the evidence of Zayo that it was not a particularly busy time receiving incoming calls from customers. Had that been the case, I expect that Zayo would have had more employees scheduled to start at 8 am. Furthermore, the email communications at the time demonstrated that Ms. Karimi raised the physical limitations issue as her reason for not being able to perform the task; she had in fact indicated that she would have liked to assist with the task, had it not been for her physical limitations. Given the above, I find that there was no evidence that Ms. Karimi was treated adversely because of her disability. Also, there was nothing that Mr. Picard or Mr. Allaert said or did, directly or indirectly that could possibly lead one to believe Ms. Karimi was requested to do the task because of her gender. In the end, the key element lacking here is the alleged adverse effect on Ms. Karimi, because she never did perform the task and did not experience an adverse impact for failing to perform same.\nB. Was the Complainant discriminated against by Zayo on the basis of disability pursuant to her second complaint?\n[113] For the disability aspect of Ms. Karimi\u2019s complaint, as already found and not disputed, Ms. Karimi did develop an additional disability: depression. She suffered an adverse impact in that she was not permitted to work from home after her request in 2008 and, subsequently, was not allowed to continue working beyond November 2009. Despite requests to accommodate her disability-related limitations, she was not allowed to return to work. Therefore, I find that Ms. Karimi has met her prima facie burden as her disability was a factor in the adverse treatment she experienced.\nC. If the Complainant establishes a prima facie case of discrimination based on disability, can the Respondent prove that the impugned restrictions were based on a BFOR pursuant to paragraph 15(1)(a) and ss. 15(2) of the Act?\n[114] To establish a BFOR and corresponding undue hardship, Zayo must, on a balance of probabilities, prove (i) that it adopted the standard in question, for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job; (ii) that it adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of that legitimate work-related purpose; and, (iii) that the standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that legitimate work-related purpose. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, it must be demonstrated that it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship upon the employer (British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 SCR 3 at para. 54). The Supreme Court of Canada further clarified in Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec v. Syndicat des employ\u00e9\u2011e\u2011s de techniques professionnelles et de bureau d\u2019Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec, section locale 2000 (SCFP\u2011FTQ), 2008 SCC 43 at para. 16, [2008] 2 SCR 561 (Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec), that the standard is not one of impossibility:\nThe test is not whether it was impossible for the employer to accommodate the employee\u2019s characteristics. The employer does not have a duty to change working conditions in a fundamental way, but does have a duty, if it can do so without undue hardship, to arrange the employee\u2019s workplace or duties to enable the employee to do his or her work.\n[115] Moreover, in Canada (Human Rights Commissions) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2014 FCA 131 at para. 21, [2015] 3 FCR 103 (Cruden), the Federal Court of Appeal clarified that there is no separate procedural right to accommodate under the Act.\n[116] The Complainant argues that the Teleworking Policy, and more specifically, the criterion of requiring an employee to have 2 years of experience in a position before being allowed to telework, is the standard that must be assessed. I disagree. Teleworking is a form of accommodation, and as such I find that the standard that must be analyzed is Zayo\u2019s standard of requiring OMs to train and work from the office.\n[117] I find that Zayo\u2019s standard of requiring OMs to train and work from the office to be rationally connected to the functions of the job, in that it serves to minimize potentially costly errors on customer matters. Zayo believed that OMs required training, guidance and support from their peers within the OM Group that could only be provided \u201con the job\u201d, and that such training, guidance and support could only be given at Zayo\u2019s premises due to the nature and pace of the work. Zayo\u2019s goal was to minimize errors to customer services and\/or orders while new employees were being trained. OM\u2019s trained on live customer orders, not closed or old files.\n[118] I further find that Zayo adopted the standard in good faith. The nature of the work in the OM Group was similar to a call centre environment. Calls came in from customers, various software systems had to be checked, orders logged, instructions noted, tasks coordinated and assigned between various sections of Zayo, and both hardware and software had to be configured. There were a multitude of issues that could arise on any given order, and it was only after spending time working with the support of colleagues that someone would become sufficiently proficient to handle the job on their own. Ms. Bazinet\u2019s experience was that it took at least 6 months for an employee to get a good grasp of all the various issues that one could encounter when performing the tasks. In some instances, it could take 2 years to fully learn the role to the point that one was \u201cself-sufficient\u201d. There was no standard duration for training. Much of the training for this role involved one OM learning side by side from another OM. Additionally, with the Complainant working from home, physically out of the office, she would not have the ability to turn to a colleague beside her and simply ask for assistance, should an issue arise while speaking with a customer or a technician. The Tribunal accepts the uncontradicted testimony of Ms. Bazinet that this aspect of the work environment was crucial for the performance of the job. Customers\u2019 orders were time sensitive in many instances, and customers generally needed to speak to the OM who was handling their order from beginning to end, in order to minimize errors, as well as to ensure a functioning service. Commercial customers whose orders or connections were not serviced properly could potentially lose revenue if they were without the necessary internet services required to conduct their business. Some businesses had threatened Zayo with lawsuits for errors committed by Zayo.\n[119] Looking at Ms. Karimi specifically, in the few months that Ms. Karimi had been learning her new OM role, Zayo considered Ms. Karimi to be progressing slowly with her training. According to Ms. Bazinet, the Complainant was still making errors at a basic level, had not progressed to more complex files, and finally, had not progressed to a level of understanding such that she could perform the role on her own, with minimal support or without direct supervision. Ms. Bazinet also gave detailed evidence about errors made by Ms. Karimi that demonstrated Ms. Karimi was not able to function proficiently and that she required the support and supervision of colleagues at Zayo\u2019s premises. The Tribunal finds that there was no reason to believe that Ms. Karimi would perform better without any on-site support and supervision, had she been working from home. Ms. Bazinet testified that Ms. Karimi could not be provided with peer support, had she been working and training from home, because other OM\u2019s could have been on their own calls at the time Ms. Karimi may have needed assistance via email or phone. Thus, Zayo considered whether Ms. Karimi could be both trained at home, and work as an OM from home. There was no evidence provided by Ms. Karimi that contradicted Ms. Bazinet\u2019s assessment of Ms. Karimi\u2019s performance, or that disputed other aspects of Ms. Bazinet\u2019s testimony.\n[120] While there was evidence provided that another Zayo employee working in the OM Group was allowed to work from home, those circumstances were completely different. Ms. Bazinet testified to this other employee having worked from home. That employee was an experienced OM who had been working in the group and on the OM systems for a decade. While the employee did work in the OM group, their job was quite distinct and very different from all the other OMs. The employee was an expert on a specific task, having performed it for many years. The employee was not someone new to the OM group who required training, guidance or support in order to perform the required tasks. Furthermore, in 2008, an attempt was made to train the employee to work from home on some of the same tasks that Ms. Karimi and other OMs performed. The employee found the training too difficult to accomplish from home, and as such, the training was abandoned.\n[121] Moreover, Zayo did not look at accommodating Ms. Karimi in another role or at another location at this time, as the latest medical note provided by Ms. Karimi dated October 2, 2008 was quite clear that it would be necessary for her to work from home in order to return to work on a gradual basis.\n[122] Given the above, I find that Zayo met its burden of demonstrating that requiring an OM to work and train from the office location was reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of its legitimate work related purpose, namely, to both minimize errors (and the costs associated with those errors), and to assist OMs in gaining proficiency to carry out the job. Accordingly, I find that it would have caused Zayo an undue hardship to accommodate Ms. Karimi by allowing her to train and work from home as an OM.\n[123] After Zayo notified Ms. Karimi that it could not accommodate her to work from home in her OM position, Ms. Karimi made no further communications to Zayo. The accommodation process required all parties involved, here the employee and the employer (and perhaps the union, but that was never argued by either of the parties), to engage in discussions about needs, limitations and options. Ms. Karimi argued that Zayo had a responsibility to explore other accommodation options including whether Ms. Karimi could work from another location or another position. The Tribunal rejects this argument, because accommodating Ms. Karimi at another location (other than her home) was contrary to the medical restriction communicated to Zayo by her doctor. Had Ms. Karimi\u2019s circumstances changed so that she would have been able to work in a different location or position, then Zayo's duty to accommodate may have been re-engaged. That is simply not the case here.\n[124] Ultimately, Ms. Karimi continued receiving disability benefits after her request to work from home was denied. Great-West Life prepared the Individual Work Plan\/Return to Work Plan prior to Ms. Karimi returning to work on March 30, 2009. The next time Ms. Karimi was in contact with Zayo was in March 2009, when she returned to work on a gradual basis, working three days per week in accordance with the terms of the Individual Work Plan\/Return to Work Plan.\n[125] Upon Ms. Karimi returning to work with restrictions on a graduated basis, the Tribunal finds that Zayo made every effort to accommodate Ms. Karimi. It provided her with records clean-up work for over eight months, in order to accommodate her restrictions. This work was with the same systems she would have been using had she been working full-time in Order Management, and thus, it allowed her to train on those systems in an environment without the time sensitivity of dealing with live files.\n[126] As described previously, there were two reasons why the accommodated work and position came to an end. First, Great-West Life had concluded there were no longer any medical restrictions that supported Ms. Karimi requiring accommodated work and it communicated this conclusion to Zayo. Secondly, the accommodated work task that Zayo had assigned was complete. When no additional records clean-up work was available to be performed, Zayo engaged in discussions with Ms. Karimi and undertook an accommodation search. Subsequently, Ms. Karimi was offered on December 2, 2009, part-time work in a Control Desk position at another location (Etobicoke), which met her medical conditions of part-time reduced hours, which Zayo was still willing to honour. However, Ms. Karimi refused to accept that accommodation, for she claimed the position was far from her home, and claimed her back condition prevented lengthy travel, and that sleep problems prevented her from working night shifts. However, the Tribunal finds that there was nothing in her previously filed medical documentation to indicate these further limitations or restrictions.\n[127] In any event, Zayo did indicate, at the time of offering the accommodated position, that it required Ms. Karimi to provide updated medical clearance to work, since previous medical documentation indicated that Ms. Karimi should be on long-term disability. I find that Ms. Karimi had an opportunity and an obligation to provide further information on her restrictions at this point. To put it simply, Zayo was confused. Ms. Karimi was requesting accommodated part-time work, thus indicating that she was able to perform work, while she was also claiming long-term disability benefits through Great-West Life. According to Zayo, it was entitled to confirmation that Ms. Karimi could safely return to work, as well as information that would enable it to meet its duty to accommodate. I agree, as it is to be recalled that the \u201c\u2026 goal of accommodation is to ensure that an employee who is able to work can do so\u201d (Hydro Qu\u00e9bec at para. 14 relying on Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Montr\u00e9al (City); Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Boisbriand (City), 2000 SCC 27, [2000] 1 SCR 665).\n[128] Zayo submits that Ms. Karimi should have accepted the offered Control Desk work at the Etobicoke location, because it was a reasonable accommodation that met her restrictions. According to Zayo, Ms. Karimi is entitled to reasonable accommodation, not perfect accommodation; and, Zayo should not be required to create or maintain non-productive work for Ms. Karimi. I agree (see Hydro Qu\u00e9bec at paras. 14-16; and Waddle v. Canadian Pacific Railway et al, 2017 CHRT 24 at para. 109).\n[129] Ms. Karimi had plenty of time to have articulated via her medical documentation what her restrictions and limitations were. Nothing in the medical documentation provided up to that point indicated that there was any type of driving distance limitation, night shift limitation or other limitation that would interfere with Ms. Karimi working in the Etobicoke position. I conclude this was a reasonable accommodation offer, made with the best of intentions, which was based on the last medical note provided by Ms. Karimi dated October 22, 2009, and that, subject to updated medical documentation showing that Ms. Karimi was capable of fulfilling the position, ought to have been accepted by Ms. Karimi. As stated in Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 SCR 970 at p. 995, 95 DLR (4th) 577:\nWhen an employer has initiated a proposal that is reasonable and would, if implemented, fulfil the duty to accommodate, the complainant has a duty to facilitate the implementation of the proposal. ...The other aspect of this duty is the obligation to accept reasonable accommodation. This is the aspect referred to by McIntyre J. in O'Malley. The complainant cannot expect a perfect solution. If a proposal that would be reasonable in all the circumstances is turned down, the employer's duty is discharged.\n[130] Other than an assertion by Ms. Karimi\u2019s union representative, there was no evidence that Zayo knew the Etobicoke position was a bad fit due to location. Furthermore, Ms. Karimi, by email to her union representative, Mr. Gadwa, indicated on December 1, 2009, that if Markham was not an option, then any other location than her current location was an option.\n[131] Evidence of discussions between Ms. Karimi and her union representatives with Zayo showed that Ms. Karimi had a preference for a position in the Markham office. Both the employer and Ms. Karimi\u2019s union representative took steps to inquire into positions and work at the Markham location, and both concluded that the work at that location involved heavy lifting and responsibilities beyond Ms. Karimi\u2019s limitations. I find that in making this inquiry, Zayo fulfilled its duty to make reasonable efforts to accommodate Ms. Karimi at the Markham location.\n[132] Ms. Karimi, through her lawyer at the time, provided a medical note on December 17, 2009, that supported Ms. Karimi returning to work part-time at a location other than her current position, and went on to indicate that an alternative location for work closer to home for Ms. Karimi would be helpful due to her physical limitations. This note, which came several weeks after the offer of the Control Desk position, triggered a new duty to accommodate for Zayo.\n[133] Zayo submits that it diligently searched for another position that would accommodate Ms. Karimi\u2019s restrictions, but was unable to find or create such a position. It specifically disputes Ms. Karimi\u2019s allegation that there were other positions available that met her restrictions. Evidence was provided by Ryan Stammer of the steps he took to look for accommodated positions. These steps included reaching out to various Zayo business units, asking if anyone had vacancies, whether any section had duties that could be bundled together to create a position, or separated from other duties in order to allow an employee to work at home, or to work at any other location other than the Complainant\u2019s current work location. Mr. Stammer testified that he followed up with managers weekly, on both the union and non-union side. His explanation for why there may not have been positions was that Zayo had gone through many lay-offs and cutbacks due to a decline in business.\n[134] The Tribunal is cognizant that Zayo was under financial hardship at the relevant time, and that it was in the process of cutting staff. Despite its financial difficulties and having had to cut over 100 CT positions which represented 20% of the bargaining unit, Zayo continued to seek out ways in which it could provide Ms. Karimi with work that accommodated her limitations. Unfortunately no other position at Zayo was capable of accommodating Ms. Karimi\u2019s needs. The Tribunal is satisfied that Zayo made reasonable efforts to accommodate Ms. Karimi\u2019s disability to the point of undue hardship.\n[135] For these reasons, I find that Zayo has met its duty to accommodate.\nD. Was the Complainant retaliated against by Zayo within the meaning of s. 14.1 of the Act?\n[136] It is important to recall that complainants are not required to adduce any particular type of evidence in establishing a prima facie case of retaliation:\nRather, in each case, it is a question of mixed fact and law whether the evidence adduced is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of retaliation (see Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 FCA 154 (CanLII), at para. 27). If sufficient evidence is presented to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, it is then the Tribunal\u2019s role to consider the complainant\u2019s evidence, alongside any evidence presented by the respondent, to determine whether it is more probable than not that retaliation has occurred.\n(see Caring Society 2015 at para. 29)\n[137] Following the alleged discriminatory treatment by Zayo, Ms. Karimi claims she developed a severe depression. After a leave of absence to deal with her depression, she claims Zayo failed to provide her with a suitable work environment and\/or the opportunity to work from home. She also claims the refusal to accommodate her medical condition was in retaliation for having filed a complaint against the treatment of her manager Paul Picard. In this regard, she says Zayo tried to eliminate her from the workforce by causing her financial hardship and mental distress. By preventing her from working at home, this limited her to working 3 days per week and denied her a full income. Further, she claims Zayo tried to force her back to work full-time when it was physically and mentally impossible for her to do so according to her physician.\n[138] Ultimately, Ms. Karimi submits that she was involuntarily placed on an unpaid leave of absence at the very time that Zayo knew she was not yet receiving disability benefits. Zayo also unilaterally determined what days would be used for Ms. Karimi\u2019s vacation time. Ms. Karimi submits that this was a cold and calculated plan by Zayo, in an effort to move her out of the workforce by putting her in a precarious position, where she would be forced to accept a severance package. Ms. Karimi claims Zayo\u2019s failure to accommodate her disability caused her to become further isolated from her former field, that was technical and rapidly changing in nature, and exacerbated her depression, that was caused by the circumstances leading to the original complaint.\n[139] There is no dispute that Ms. Karimi had previously filed a human rights complaint on October 28, 2008. Nor is it disputed that she suffered an adverse impact in that she was not permitted to work from home after her request in 2008, and that she was not allowed to continue working on an accommodated basis beyond November 2009.\n[140] While proof of intent is not necessary to make out a retaliation complaint, Ms. Karimi had the burden to provide the Tribunal with complete and sufficient evidence to demonstrate that her human rights complaint was a factor in the alleged adverse treatment she received from Zayo following the filing of her complaint, whether based on her reasonable perception thereof or otherwise (Caring Society 2015 at paras. 4, 29; Tabor FC at paras. 63-64).\n[141] In this case, Ms. Karimi did not provide any testimony in support of her allegation of retaliation. Despite this, I found no evidence, intentional or unintentional, that Zayo made any decisions wherein it factored in the filing of Ms. Karimi\u2019s first human rights complaint. Ms. Karimi argues that Mr. Van Horne was directly involved in both complaints. The fact that Mr. Van Horne was involved in the first complaint, and various events related to that complaint, does not lead me to conclude that Zayo made decisions due to Ms. Karimi having filed her first complaint. The inherent role of Mr. Van Horne as an HR Advisor and\/or Senior Manager of Labour Relations (he held various roles within Zayo at various times, all within HR) would require him to be involved, as his role entailed providing advice to various business unit managers and directors on matters pertaining to the collective agreement, various employer policies, and other HR related matters. Overall, I find that the filing of the first human rights complaint was not a factor in any subsequent decisions or actions taken by Zayo, nor could it reasonably be perceived to have been a factor.\n[142] As discussed above, Zayo made every effort to accommodate Ms. Karimi up to the point of undue hardship. Rather than showing that Zayo was intentionally trying to remove Ms. Karimi from the work force, the evidence demonstrates that Zayo continued to attempt to provide Ms. Karimi with accommodating work, so long as she could show that she was capable of working. In fact, Ms. Karimi is still employed by Zayo today. Accommodation efforts only ceased once Ms. Karimi went on long-term disability and her benefits were reinstated in February 2010. There was no evidence of a link between the failure of attempts at accommodation and the filing of the first complaint. Rather, no suitable position was found that could accommodate Ms. Karimi.\n[143] To paraphrase paragraph 54 of the Tribunal\u2019s recent decision in Tabor v. Millbrook First Nation, 2015 CHRT 18, an individual who feels they have been discriminated against may perceive all actions that impact them negatively as being retaliation for having filed a complaint. But, it is not necessarily the case that every adverse effect following the filing of a complaint is retaliation. That Ms. Karimi perceived that decisions taken by Zayo were due in part to her having filed a complaint is not enough to establish a finding of retaliation. As indicated by the Federal Court, the complainant\u2019s perception that retaliation has occurred must be reasonable. This was not the case here (Tabor FC at para. 64).\nVIII.

Section 52 of the CHRA 2\nB. The Access to Information Act 3\nC. Other reasons 4\nConclusion 4\nComplaint and motion\n[1] This is a preliminary motion by Serge Lafreni\u00e8re (the complainant) under section 52(1)(c) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) filed on November 20, 2017, asking the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to order that all of the documents filed on the Tribunal\u2019s official record in the above-mentioned case become confidential until June 2018.\n[2] The complainant\u2019s motion follows up on the request for access received by the Tribunal from a third party, who seeks to obtain copies of several documents filed as part of this case on the Tribunal\u2019s official record. The access request was made when the case was ready to be heard, but hadn\u2019t been heard yet.\n[3] I will not set out all of the facts alleged in the main dispute, but, this is essentially a complaint filed by the complainant in which he alleges that he was treated differently and that he unjustly received penalty points in his disciplinary file, which led to his dismissal on October 5, 2012. The ground for discrimination alleged in this file and accepted by the Tribunal is disability.\n[4] Via Rail Canada Inc. (the respondent) and the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) did not file any submissions regarding the motion for a confidentiality order filed by the complainant and took no position on the issue, relying on the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\nSection 52 of the CHRA\n[5] Section 52 of the CHRA provides that an inquiry should be heard by the Tribunal in public.\n[6] Section 52 of the CHRA also provides that the Tribunal may, in very specific circumstances and if it is satisfied, take any measures and make any order that it considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the inquiry. Those very specific circumstances are defined in s. 52(1) of the CHRA.\n[7] In this case, the complainant is basing his motion on the circumstances described in s. 52(1)(c):\n(c) there is a real and substantial risk that the disclosure of personal or other matters will cause undue hardship to the persons involved such that the need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public;\nAnalysis\nA. Section 52 of the CHRA\n[8] The rule is clear: an inquiry before the Tribunal must be heard in public. The hearing of an inquiry is public.\n[9] The Tribunal is of the opinion that conducting a hearing in public implies ensuring public access to the documents filed on the Tribunal\u2019s official record: complaint form, letters from the Commission to the Tribunal, amended particulars, motions, documents filed in evidence, audio recordings of the proceedings and reasons for decisions on motions as well as the final decision, if applicable. This is not an exhaustive list.\n[10] This is consistent with the principle of quasi-judicial transparency to which this Tribunal subscribes. According to this principle, the Tribunal must ensure that it does not deny the public access to our hearing proceedings.\n[11] Thus, the Tribunal would not make a decision based on who makes an access request, but rather in relation to the public interest in general. Section 52 of the CHRA is concerned with access to the file by any member of the public including potential future applicants. It does not govern the rights of particular individuals to access it. Thus, for the more general purposes of section 52, the identity of the requester of information (who may be followed by others) is irrelevant.\n[12] Let us return to the preliminary motion on which I must issue a decision. The complainant\u2019s motion is unfortunately not well supported. It simply states in a very general way why the complainant is seeking a confidentiality order from the Tribunal for all of the documents on the record.\n[13] Thus, the complainant states the following in his motion: [translation] \u201cThe documents covered by this request [for access to information] contain personal information that could jeopardise my chances of getting a suitable job pending my reinstatement at Via Rail Canada\u201d.\n[14] The complainant did not indicate which documents in particular could be detrimental to his interests. This motion pertains to all of the documents filed on the Tribunal\u2019s official record. This seems much too broad to me.\n[15] In addition, the complainant did not describe or explain his fears and in what way the disclosure of personal information contained in all of those documents poses a serious enough risk to him, which would enable the Tribunal to consider that this personal interest outweighs the interest that the hearing be conducted in public.\n[16] In my view, the very general information described by the complainant in one sentence in his motion does not constitute sufficient grounds for the Tribunal to warrant an order contrary to the general principle that hearings should be conducted in public.\n[17] I would also add that, at this stage in the proceedings, while this inquiry has not yet been heard, some of this information is only allegations that remain to be proven or rebutted before the Tribunal.\nB. The Access to Information Act\n[18] In his motion, the complainant also refers to the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act.\n[19] Although the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal is a tribunal under federal jurisdiction, it is no longer subject to these two acts (see the Economic Action Plan 2014 Act, No. 1, S.C. 2014, c. 20, sections 384 and 423).\n[20] However, when the Tribunal is faced with a request for access to documents filed on the official record, as is the case here, it responds to such requests by striking out very sensitive personal identifiers, which add nothing to the public\u2019s understanding of the proceedings, such as\ndates of birth\nhome addresses\npersonal email addresses\npersonal telephone numbers\ngovernment-issued ID numbers (e.g. SIN, passport number)\n[21] The Tribunal systematically redacts this information even without a motion for a confidentiality order.\nC. Other reasons\n[22] In addition, in this case, three decisions on preliminary motions have already been issued and published on the Tribunal\u2019s website. Those decision are public and everyone has access to them.\n[23] It seems to me that limiting access to documents filed on the Tribunal\u2019s official record in this case, as requested by the complainant, while three detailed decisions containing fairly specific information about this dispute are already public, would make no sense.\n[24] The first decision pertaining to a motion to strike by the respondent was made public and has been available on the Tribunal\u2019s website for over six months.\nConclusion\n[25] For all of these reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the complainant\u2019s motion for a confidentiality order.\n[26] The Tribunal orders that the documents that are subject to the access to information request by a third party be made accessible within 30 days of the date of this decision, unless there is a judicial review application regarding it. Personal and very sensitive information the nature of which is described at paragraph 20 of the reasons for this decision will be struck from the documents in question before being provided to the access requester.\nSigned by\nAnie Perrault\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nDecember 11, 2017\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT2162\/3616\nStyle of Cause:\nSerge Lafreni\u00e8re v.

Wirth\nComplainant\n- and -\nCanadian Human Rights Commission\nCommission\n- and -\nSaddle Lake Cree Nation\nRespondent\nRuling\nMember:\nGeorge E. Ulyatt\n[1] The Saddle Lake Cree Nation (\u201cSLCN\u201d or \u201cthe Respondent\u201d) has brought a Motion to adjourn this matter currently before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (\u201cTribunal\u201d), pending a decision from the Federal Court of Canada in related Federal Court Action T-364-14, as to whether SLCN\u2019s 2010 Election is a \u201cservice\u201d as the term is used in section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the \u201cAct\u201d).\n[2] In support of the Motion for Adjournment the Respondent has filed and is relying on the following:\nPleadings, affidavits, and orders from Federal Court File T-364-14, and the predecessor file, T-504-13.\nMotion for Summary Judgment filed in Federal Court File T-364-14.\nThe Affidavit of Finlay Moses, sworn November 22, 2016, and filed in Federal Court File T-364-14.\n[3] The Respondent is one of two constituent First Nations that compose the Saddle Lake Band, a Band that is defined by the Indian Act R.S.C., 1985, c. I-5. The Respondent holds elections every three years, and the process is governed by both written and oral customs, which have been referred to as \u201cthe Election Custom\u201d. The submission was that the Election Custom was established by past practices.\n[4] The Respondent submits that elections have never been held under the Indian Act\u2019s election process, and thus, section 74 of the Indian Act does not apply, nor has the Respondent \u201c\u2026reverted to customs under the requirements of any federal policy.\u201d\n[5] In June, 2010, the Respondent held an election under its Election Custom, and after the election the Complainant filed a complaint under the CHRA on the basis that the Respondent\u2019s electoral officers had removed the Complainant\u2019s name from the official candidate list or ballot.\n[6] The Complainant did not file an application for judicial review seeking the Court\u2019s opinion as to whether the removal was lawful under the Election Custom but did file a complaint under the Act.\n[7] The Complainant alleged that this was discriminatory under section 5 of the Act on the basis of marital or family status, due to the Complainant being barred from participating in the 2010 council election because she had been married to a white man.\n[8] The Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) referred the matter to the Tribunal for inquiry. In response to the said referral to the Tribunal, on March 22, 2013 the Respondent filed an Application for Judicial Review in the Federal Court. The basis of the Judicial Review Application is set forth in paragraph 17 of the Respondent\u2019s submission:\n\u201c17. In the Judicial Review, SLCN alleges, inter alia, that the Act does not apply to the Complaint as SLCN\u2019s 2010 custom election was not a \u201cservice\u201d as that term is used in section 5 of the Act.16 The application also alleges that the decision to refer the Complaint infringes upon existing Aboriginal rights of SLCN, which rights are protected under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.\u201d\n[9] Subsequent to the Application for Judicial Review, the Federal Court granted on January 22, 2014 a stay in favour of proceeding by way of a Statement of Claim. The Respondent in their Brief stated as follows:\n\u201c18. Pursuant to an order of the Federal court granted January 22, 2014, the Judicial Review was stayed in favour of proceeding by way of statement of claim. In granting the Order the Court noted that:\n[C]onversion is appropriate because the facts, including those of oral history, cannot be satisfactorily established by affidavits alone; that viva voce evidence will permit to better grasp the facts and weigh evidence; that the production, discovery and exchange of expert evidence inherent in a trial are necessary for a full and fair hearing of the issues;\u2026the constitutional issues appear beyond the scope of the complaint and impact a substantial number of third parties.\u201d\n[10] SLCN filed a Statement of Claim in Federal Court, wherein it seeks the following relief:\n\u201c21. In the FC Action, SLCN seeks a declaration that the Act does not apply to, and the Commission does not have jurisdiction over, SLCN\u2019s custom elections. The Statement of Claim states, that the Act doesn\u2019t apply to the Complaint because, inter alia:\n(a) SLCN\u2019s custom election is not authorized by Parliament and therefore the Complaint does not fall under section 2 of the Act which provides that the Act only applies to laws \u201cwithin the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament\u201d; and\n(b) that the Act does not apply as the SLCN\u2019s custom election is not a \u201cservice\u201d as that term is used in section 5 of the Act.\u201d\n[11] On November 4, 2016, the SLCN was granted leave to bring a Summary Judgment Motion, which was filed on November 30th, 2016, seeking an order from the court declaring that SLCN\u2019s Custom an election for Chief in Council is \u201cnot a service\u201d within the meaning of section 5 of the Act.\n[12] The Complainant did not file an Appearance in response to the original Application for Judicial Review. The Respondent states that, due to her lack of participation in those proceedings, she was not named as a party to the subsequent Action. The Commission was not named as a party to the Action either.\n[13] The submissions of the Commission at page 4, paragraph 10 of their Brief set forth the status of the Federal Court proceedings at the time the Motion materials were filed.\n\u201c10. At the same time that the Tribunal proceeding has been underway, SLCN has started various proceedings seeking different forms of relief in the Federal Court. As mentioned in the Affidavit of Finlay Moses, steps taken in the Federal Court have included the following:\na. SLCN filed an application for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision to refer (T-504-13, the \u201cApplication). Ms. Wirth did not file a Notice of Appearance. The Commission sought and obtained leave to intervene in the Application. SLCN delivered a notice of constitutional question. The Federal Court eventually ordered that the Application be stayed, pending the resolution of matters to be pleaded by SLCN in a fresh action.\nb. SLCN started an action, naming the Attorney General of Canada (\u201cAGC\u201d) as the sole defendant (T-364-14, the \u201cAction\u201d). In the Action, SLCN seeks various forms of declaratory relief, including declarations that Ms. Wirth\u2019s Complaint does not relate to the provision of services within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA, and that applying the CHRA to SLCN\u2019s custom election would infringe constitutionally-protected rights of aboriginal self-government. Neither Ms. Wirth nor the Commission is named as a party.\nc. The AGC filed a Statement of Defence, in which it takes no position on some of the issues raised in the Action, including whether Ms. Wirth\u2019s complaint relates to the provision of services under s.5 of the CHRA.\nd. The Federal Court dismissed a request by the Commission for leave to intervene in the Action, but left it open to the Commission to re-apply at a future date. The Federal Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from this order.\ne. The Federal Court granted SLCN leave to bring a motion for summary judgment on the \u201cservices\u201d question, and set deadlines for (i) SLCN to deliver a notice of motion and affidavit to the AGC (November 30, 2016), (ii) the AGC to advise whether it would take a position on the motion (December 15, 2016), and (iii) SLCN to deliver its motion record for summary judgment (January 31, 2017).\nf. SLCN delivered a Notice of Motion for summary judgment, seeking a declaration that SLCN\u2019s custom election for Chief and Council is not a \u201cservice\u201d within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA.\u201d\nRespondent\u2019s Position\n[14] The Respondent submits that the issues before the Tribunal are best resolved by the Federal Court, in order to properly determine the applicability of the Act and the definition of service. Also, the issue of electoral customs and the inherent right of self-government is important to be considered.\n[15] The Respondent submits that the Complainant will not be prejudiced, and if there is prejudice, that such prejudice could be satisfied by an order of compensation. The Respondent further submits that it should not be put to a substantial cost for a full hearing on aboriginal rights of self-government, and that the matter before the Tribunal is not ready for hearing.\n[16] The Respondent relies upon the decision of Renaud, Sutton and Morigeau v. Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, 2013 CHRT 30 (\u201cRenaud\u201d), wherein the Tribunal adjourned the matter before it.\nCommission\u2019s Position\n[17] The Commission submits that the Tribunal should proceed to a hearing, as Section 48.9(1) states as follows:\n\u201c48.9(1) Proceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\u201d\n[18] The Commission argues that only in exceptional circumstances should a matter be adjourned, that the Tribunal\u2019s policies and procedures are a better fit for an individual, and that no exceptional circumstances have been substantiated by the Respondent in the present circumstances.\n[19] The Commission further takes issue with the adjournment on the services question, in that neither the Complainant nor the Commission were parties before the Federal Court and the Attorney General of Canada was not taking a position on this question.\n[20] The Commission relies heavily on the case of Canada (Border Services Agency) v. C.B. Powell Limited, 2010 FCA at paragraph. 33.\n\u201cCourts across Canada have enforced the general principle of non-interference with ongoing administrative processes vigorously. This is shown by the narrowness of the \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 exception\u2026 Suffice to say, the authorities show that very few circumstances qualify as \u2018exceptional\u2019 and the threshold for exceptionality is high\u2026Concerns about procedural fairness or bias, the presence of an important legal or constitutional issue, or the fact that all parties have consented to early recourse to the courts are not exceptional circumstances allowing parties to bypass an administrative process, as long as that process allows the issues to be raised and an effective remedy to be granted\u2026As I shall soon demonstrate, the presence of so-called jurisdictional issues is not an exceptional circumstance justifying early recourse to courts.\u201d\nFurthermore at page 19 of the Commission\u2019s Submissions, it relies upon the Federal Court\u2019s judgment in Nipisihkopahk Education Authority of the Samson Cree Nation and Ermineskin Tribe v. Canada (A.G.), 2004 FC 1314, at paragraphs. 4-6, 8-10:\n\u201c[4]\u2026 there is no evidence in these files that the Applicants have suffered or will suffer any harm whatever from the proceedings before the Commission or the tribunal. Notably, the Applicants have not to date been ordered to do anything, let alone anything that they don\u2019t want to do, and they have not been ordered or restrained from doing anything that they think they have a right to do.\n[5] They argue that they are not subject to the Human Rights Act and of the Tribunal [sic]. But that question has not yet been determined one way or the other. The Applicants have simply been given the opportunity to defend themselves and to argue their constitutional position before the tribunal which is a body competent to decide the question.\n[6 ] That is no harm of any sort. If the Tribunal agrees with the Applicants the matter will end there. Even if the Tribunal disagrees and decides against them they still will not have suffered any harm whatever, unless and until, the tribunal after full enquiry issues an Order against the Applicants. That in my view will be time enough to decide if the Applicants\u2019 constitutional position and argument justifies seeking a stay of the Tribunal\u2019s final Order.\n\u2026..\n[8]\u2026to date, the Applicants have suffered and will suffer no more inconvenience than the relatively minor one of having an opportunity to litigate their position before a competent body\u2026\n[9] On the other hand the complainants have already been forced to see their complaints delayed for that same five-year period and time is moving on. Any enquiry by the Tribunal will become less effective as the time between the events complained of and the holding of the enquiry lengthens. That\u2019s a truism. Justice delayed is justice denied. And the complaints have had a serious inconvenience imposed on them by having their hearing postponed almost indefinitely.\n[10] There is also, and this is an aspect of what I have just said, an important public interest to be served and to be protected in having complaints before the Tribunal dealt with expeditiously.\u201d\n[21] The Respondent replies to the Commission\u2019s position, stating that the Attorney General of Canada is in fact the proper Respondent in this procedure before the Federal Court and that the Tribunal is not the proper forum, and that the Tribunal is not in a position to proceed with its hearing in the present circumstances. The Respondent submits that the Federal Court is the best situated forum to deal with this matter.\n[22] Since the filing of the parties\u2019 submissions, the Honourable Mr. Justice Phelan of the Federal Court issued an Order on March 2, 2017 which ordered inter alia as follows:\n\u201cUPON MOTION in writing by the Canadian Human Rights Commission [Commission] for intervener status for purposes of a motion to stay and if not granted, to participate in this action without costs;\nAND UPON the Defendant advising that it was taking no position on this motion;\nAND the Plaintiff not opposing intervener status but opposing a stay and the \u201cwithout costs\u201d request of the Commission;\nAND UPON the parties being in agreement that the Commission does not have jurisdiction over the matter in dispute but for different reasons;\nAND the parties having attempted to find an efficient and effective process by which to resolve the legal issue in dispute, the Plaintiff having brought a Motion for Summary Judgment;\nAND CONSIDERING that without the Commission\u2019s involvement there would be no effective opposition;\nAND CONSIDERING that the Commission\u2019s role in this matter is more akin to a litigant intervener than a public policy intervener;\nAND CONCLUDING that it is in the interests of justice to grant intervener status;\nTHIS COURT ORDERS that:\n1. the style of cause is amended to add the Canadian Human Rights Commission as an Intervener;\n2. the Commission is granted leave to intervene in these proceedings to respond to the Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment as if it was a party including but not limited to the right to serve and be served with documents, to file memoranda, to file evidence, to cross-examine and be cross-examined, to argue and to appeal.\u201d\n[\u2026]\nThe Motion for Summary Judgment brought by SLCN was heard before the Federal Court on October 3, 4, 2017. The decision is still pending.\nAnalysis\n[23] The Commission\u2019s position to dismiss the Respondent\u2019s motion would normally be persuasive. However, in the present circumstances, there are a number of issues that are counter balancing factors.\n[24] Firstly, the Respondent\u2019s position is not merely contesting the question of whether its custom elections are a \u201cservice under section 5 of the Act\u201d. It also challenges the constitutionality of the applicability of the Act, asserting an Aboriginal right to self-govern protected under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. Therefore, a finding of discrimination in the present circumstances assuming the Complaint is substantiated, would not resolve the present litigation. The Tribunal must be mindful that the Act\u2019s requirement for \u201cexpeditious\u201d hearing must be tempered in the best interest of the parties, and in the present circumstances, a Tribunal hearing on the applicability of section 5 of the Act would fracture and exacerbate the proceedings.\n[25] Secondly, the Order of Justice Phelan on March 2, 2017 arguably granted rights to the Commission to do more than simply contest the summary judgment motion on its merits.\n\u201c2. the Commission is granted leave to intervene in these proceedings to respond to the Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment as if it was a party including but not limited to the right to serve and be served with documents, to file memoranda, to file evidence, to cross-examine and be cross-examined, to argue and to appeal.\u201d\n[26] The foregoing suggests that the Commission could also contest the propriety of bringing such a Motion in the circumstances, as such Motion could pre-empt the operation of the administrative scheme. Mr. Justice Phelan\u2019s March 2, 2017 Order, adding the Commission as a party to ensure that there was representation and argument to deal with the issue of service, had not been issued at the time submissions were made in the present adjournment motion.\n[27] Thirdly, it is acknowledged that whilst Ms. Wirth is not a participant in the Federal Court proceedings, and the record indicates that she was involuntarily excluded from the Action, the Reply submissions by the Respondent suggest that the Complainant has chosen not to participate due to lack of resources, lack of counsel and lack of comprehension of the constitutional issues raised in the Action. This does raise access to justice issues, but those issues are being addressed in court by the Commission in dealing with the issue of \u201cservice\u201d before the Federal Court.\n[28] Thus, the preamble and substantive parts of the Federal Court Order suggest that the Commission was granted intervener status specifically to allow for an effective opposition. All factors considered, the Respondent\u2019s Motion for an adjournment pending the decision of the Federal Court on its Motion for Summary Judgment does not appear to be unreasonable. Therefore the matter before this Tribunal is adjourned pending the outcome of the Federal Court Summary Judgment Motion on the question of \u201cservice\u201d (s. 5), at which time the matter will be brought back before the Tribunal.\nSigned by\nGeorge E.

Introduction\n[1] Nahame O\u2019Bomsawin filed a complaint against the Abenakis of Odanak Council (the \u201cCouncil\u201d) with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) on April 15, 2013. After the investigation, the Commission referred the complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) for inquiry on September 15, 2015.\n[2] Pursuant to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cCHRA\u201d), Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin alleges that she was discriminated against on the ground of family status in a hiring process. She claims that she was denied the employment for which she applied\u2014a contractual position as Project Manager (Accreditation Coordinator)\u2014at the Odanak Health Centre. Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin alleges that the Council set aside her application because she is the daughter of the Health Centre Director. The Council alleges that the successful candidate was more motivated than Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin for the position, which was the determining factor for their choice.\n[3] A hearing was held from December 20 to 21, 2016, in Sorel-Tracy, Quebec. Both the Complainant and the Respondent were represented by legal counsel at the hearing. The Commission elected not to appear at the hearing.\n[4] After having heard the parties\u2019 arguments and considered the evidence, I find that Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin\u2019s complaint is substantiated for the following reasons.\nII. Facts\nA. Abenakis of Odanak\n[5] Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin is a member of the Abenaki First Nation in the Odanak reserve. Born in Montr\u00e9al, she grew up in the Odanak community. She left the community at about age 18 to complete her education in Montr\u00e9al, but returned on a regular basis. Her parents still live in the community.\n[6] The Odanak community is located on the east bank of Saint-Fran\u00e7ois River, 32 km east of Sorel in the regional county municipality of Nicolet-Yamaska in the Centre-du-Qu\u00e9bec administrative region.\n[7] Many members of the Odanak community have the same family names without being related. In the present case, Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin and the current Council Chief, Rick O\u2019Bomsawin, have the same family name, but they are not related.\nB. Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin\u2019s qualifications\n[8] Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin is the daughter of Odanak Health Centre Director Deny O\u2019Bomsawin. She began working at the Odanak Health Centre in 2004 as a project leader in charge of organizing a conference. She was then 18 years old, and it was a student job for her. Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin seems to have done a good job. There were no complaints and she completed her mandate.\n[9] From 2005 to 2008, she studied at the University of Montr\u00e9al and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in communication science. From 2008 to 2009, Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin completed a diploma with a specialization in management.\n[10] In August 2009, she applied for and obtained the position of Coordinator of the National Training Program for Community Water Quality Controllers at the Odanak Health Centre. She obtained this position without having an interview. Her mandate began in August 2009 and ended in January 2011 when the program funding ended. There were no complaints made during her mandate.\n[11] In February 2011, Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin applied for and obtained the position of Community Organizer in the Child and Family Services Program (SEFPN) with the Grand Council of the Waban-Aki Nation. She was interviewed to obtain this position.\n[12] In October 2011, Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin resigned from her position with the Grand Council of Waban-Aki. In examination-in-chief and in cross-examination, she explained that she was unhappy in her position and thought that she would have other job possibilities either in Montr\u00e9al or with the Council.\n[13] In February 2012, she was given a three-month mandate as a Project Manager \u2013 Food Safety Program in the Odanak Health Centre. Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin obtained this mandate after sending her CV and without having to go through an interview. Her mandate ended in May 2012.\nC. Contractual position \u2013 Project Manager (Accreditation Coordinator)\n[14] On July 9, 2012, the Council passed a resolution and mandated the Odanak Health Centre to carry out an accreditation process for the Health Centre. The Health Centre Director then drafted a competition notice for the position of Accreditation Coordinator and posted it. After seeing the notice of competition posted at the Odanak Health Centre, Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin applied on July 16, 2012, for the Contractual position \u2013 Project Manager (Accreditation Coordinator) (the \u201cposition\u201d).\n[15] It appears from the hearing that the notice of competition was posted twice. The second time, the closing date of the competition was different from the first time. It was not demonstrated to the Tribunal what the first closing date was\u2014it was later than the date finally posted\u2014but the parties agree that the official closing date of the competition was July 26, 2012.\n[16] The position\u2019s job description and requirements were the same in the two notices of competition. According to the notice of competition, the position\u2019s main responsibilities consisted in developing a conceptual framework, supervising the accreditation process, liaising between the staff and Accreditation Canada, coordinating and encouraging self-assessment, handling accreditation visit logistics and attending regional networking and training meetings in preparation of the accreditation visit.\n[17] The requirements were as follows:\nUniversity education completed in project management or management\nExperience as a project manager\nInterpersonal communication skills\nAbility to work well under pressure\nExcellent oral and written communication skills\nExperience with government organizations\nLocal knowledge\nBilingual (English \u2013 French)\n[18] The position posted was funded by Health Canada, which was responsible for granting the accreditation certificate sought by the Odanak Health Centre. Health Canada had not requested any particular requirements for this position.\nD. Selection committee\n[19] In early August 2012, a few days after the end of the competition, the Council Chief to whom the Odanak Health Centre reports, asked the Council\u2019s Human Resources advisor, Robert St-Ours, to oversee the process related to this competition notice. He did not seem satisfied with the process already put in place by the centre director, Deny O\u2019Bomsawin, who is the Complainant\u2019s father.\n[20] Mr. St-Ours met with Deny O\u2019Bomsawin, Health Centre Director, and offered to set up a process with interviews. Mr. O\u2019Bomsawin agreed and a selection committee was set up. The committee would conduct interviews.\n[21] The committee consisted of Mr. St-Ours, who was then the Council\u2019s Human Resources Advisor, and Daniel G. Nolett, General Manager of the Council. Odanak Health Centre Director Deny O\u2019Bomsawin did not sit on the selection committee, nor did Council Chief Rick O\u2019Bomsawin.\nE. Assessment of candidates\n[22] In August 2012, as of the closing date of the notice of competition, three people applied for the position, Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin and two other candidates. The interviews for the position were held in early October, and Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin was interviewed on October 1, 2012. After one of the candidates withdrew, there were only two candidates remaining: Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin and the other person.\n[23] Two months elapsed between the end of the notice of competition (July 26, 2012) and the beginning of the interviews (October 1, 2012). During that time, no changes were made to the competition, the position was not posted again, and there were no changes to the description of duties or experience required.\n[24] The selection committee members used an evaluation grid to carry out interviews. This grid contains the following evaluation points with the weighting indicated below:\nTraining \u2013 25 points\nProject management experience \u2013 20 points\nQuality of answers \u2013 15 points\nKnowledge of programs \u2013 10 points\nEnglish \u2013 10 points\nOverall evaluation \u2013 10 points\nMaturity (enthusiasm, motivation and life experience) \u2013 10 points\nTotal: 100 points\n[25] Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin was interviewed on October 1, 2012. The interview lasted 45 minutes. In her opinion, the interview proceeded normally. Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin stated that she was asked standard questions. It was her second work interview. Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin was not required to provide written samples of her communication skills.\n[26] Based on the testimony of Messrs. St-Ours and Nolett, they also indicated that Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin\u2019s interview was acceptable, but that she seemed to lack motivation. The evaluation grid filed at the hearing indicated that Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin received a score of 78 from Mr. Nolett and 83 from Mr. St\u2011Ours. The other candidate received a score of 74 from Mr. Nolett and 77 from Mr. St-Ours.\n[27] Despite the fact that the notice of competition indicated that a university education was required and that the notice had not been amended, 25 and 23 points were awarded to both candidates for this criterion by the two members of the selection committee. The scores were identical, and yet only Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin has a university education, having completed a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n[28] The members of the selection committee informed the Tribunal, during their testimony, that in their view such training was not required. According to them, their views were based on information provided by Health Canada that a college-level education and relevant professional experience as a project manager were sufficient for the position. That is why they awarded the same score to both candidates, even though it is apparent from the CVs submitted that one of them clearly had a university education and the other did not.\n[29] It has not been demonstrated that this opinion on the part of the members of the selection committee was based on a requirement of Health Canada, which was funding the project. In any event, despite the fact that two months had elapsed between the closing date of the competition notice and the start of interviews, the notice of competition was never amended to reflect the opinion of the members of the selection committee and thus indicate to potential candidates the actual training required for the position according to the members of the selection committee.\n[30] A re-posting of the position with different qualifications might have allowed for more candidates to compete for the position in question. As a result, at the time the interviews were held, the candidates who had applied had done so on the basis of a competition notice indicating that a university education was required.\n[31] In addition, it was clear that the Complainant\u2019s project management experience was much greater than that of the other candidate, as was reflected on the evaluation grid itself, which indicates a score of 15 points for Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin and 5 for the other candidate.\n[32] Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin also obtained a higher score on her knowledge of the programs. Mr. Nolett gave her 9 points out of 10 and Mr. St-Ours gave her 5 out of 10. The other candidate obtained 3 and 2 out of 10 respectively.\n[33] Upon reading the evaluation grids submitted, the other candidate managed to exceed Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin in the quality of her answers and motivation. The other candidate received 15 out of 15 from both committee members for the quality of those answers, compared to a score of 12 and 13 for Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin. With respect to motivation, the other candidate received a perfect score of 10 out of 10 from both members of the committee, but Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin was only given 4 and 5 respectively.\nF. The Council\u2019s decision\n[34] On October 29, 2012, the Council met to make a decision on the position. At the Council meeting, the evaluation grids were not submitted. Mr. St-Ours verbally informed the Council members of the scores and made a recommendation. Despite having been given a lower score from both members of the selection committee, he recommended the other candidate.\n[35] In their testimony Messrs. St-Ours and Nolett indicated that their joint recommendation to choose the other candidate, despite Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin\u2019s higher score on the evaluation grid, was due to the fact that the other candidate appeared to have been more motivated by the position. It was resolved by the Council to hire the other candidate for the position.\n[36] It is very rare for the Council to have to choose a candidate for jobs of this kind. Normally this type of decision is made by senior management, without the Council\u2019s input.\n[37] The Executive Director of the Council, Mr. Nolett, confirmed that the situation was rare and unique in his testimony. Its uniqueness resulted from the fact, according to the testimony heard, that one of the candidates was the daughter of the Health Centre\u2019s Director.\n[38] Claire O\u2019Bomsawin, a longstanding Council member who testified at the hearing too, also indicated that this process was unusual and that they had proceeded in this way because [translation] \u201cNahame is Deny\u2019s daughter.\u201d\n[39] Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin was notified of the Council\u2019s decision on October 31 and requested a meeting with Messrs. St-Ours and Nolett. A few days later, on November 2, 2012, she met with both members of the selection committee. Messrs. St-Ours and Nolett reiterated to Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin that it was the Council\u2019s choice. Mr. St-Ours confirmed that during the meeting he mentioned to Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin that [translation] \u201csometimes the Council\u2019s decisions can produce victims\u2026\u201d.\n[40] Mr. Nolett confirmed during his testimony that during the meeting that he told Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin that she [translation] \u201cshe had already been given three contracts at the Health Centre without an interview and that it caused a lot of talking in the community\u2026\u201d. The two committee members also confirmed during their testimony, along with Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin, that the motivation criterion raised by the Council as being an important criterion in choosing the candidate, had not been addressed at that meeting.\nIII. Legal framework\n[41] Within the meaning of section 7 of the CHRA, it is a discriminatory practice to refuse to employ an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Family status is a prohibited ground of discrimination under section 3 of the same Act.\n[42] It has been determined by many different tribunals and by this Tribunal in particular that a complainant must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. According to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Ontario (Ontario Human Rights Commission) v. Simpson-Sears Ltd., 1985 CanLII 18 (SCC), at paragraph 28, a prima facie case in such a context is one that deals with allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of a reply from the respondent.\n[43] In the context of the present complaint, Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin must show, according to section 7 of the CHRA, on a balance of probabilities, that: (1) she has a personal characteristic protected from discrimination; (2) that the Council refused to employ her; (3) that the protected characteristic was a factor in refusing to employ her (Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61, at para. 33 (\u201cMoore\u201d); Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier Aerospace Training Centre), 2015 SCC 39, at paras. 56 and 64 (\u201cBombardier\u201d)).\n[44] The Justices of the Supreme Court expressed themselves as follows in Bombardier, supra:\n[63] Finally, in Moore, a more recent case, Abella J. wrote the following for the Court:\n. . . to demonstrate prima facie discrimination, complainants are required to show that they have a characteristic protected from discrimination under the Code; that they experienced an adverse impact with respect to the service; and that the protected characteristic was a factor in the adverse impact. Once a prima facie case has been established, the burden shifts to the respondent to justify the conduct or practice, within the framework of the exemptions available under human rights statutes. If it cannot be justified, discrimination will be found to occur. [Emphasis added; para. 33.]\n[45] In the case with which we are now concerned, the alleged discrimination is employment-related. The Complainant alleges that she was refused employment on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination, namely, family status.\n[46] With respect to hiring, there appears to be a consensus between the parties hereto that the test established in Shakes v. Rex Pak Ltd., (1982), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001, at paragraph 8918 (Ontario Board of Inquiry) (\u201cShakes\u201d) applies here.\n[47] The test establishes a prima facie case when:\nthe complainant was qualified for the particular employment;\nthe complainant was not hired;\nsomeone no better qualified but lacking the distinguishing feature, which is the basis of the complaint of discrimination, subsequently obtained the position.\n[48] Although the parties appear to agree on these criteria, the Tribunal would like to add at this point that the test developed in Shakes serve only as a guide and should not be applied in a rigid or arbitrary manner. Thus, the circumstances of each case must be examined in order to determine whether the application of any of these criteria, in whole or in part, is appropriate (see Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204, at para. 18; Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 FCA 154, at paras. 25-30). Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2004, CHRT 40 (\u201cBressette\u201d), as well as Premakumar v. Air Canada, (2002), C.H.R.D., at para. 77 (C.H.R.T.) (QL).\n[49] I am of the opinion that in the case before us, the multi-part test established in both Shakes and Moore may be applied. More specifically, the test set out in Shakes is helpful in determining whether the prohibited ground of discrimination was a factor in the alleged adverse treatment.\n[50] In response to a complaint, a respondent may submit evidence showing that its actions were not discriminatory or avail itself of a statutory defence under the CHRA to justify the discrimination. In this, the Council attempted to show that its actions were not discriminatory and that the hiring of another candidate was based instead on the skills of that other candidate. The burden therefore falls on Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin to demonstrate that the Council\u2019s explanation is merely a pretext for discrimination (see Bressette, supra, at para. 34).\n[51] Furthermore, it is important to add that it is rarely possible to show direct evidence of discrimination. As a result, direct evidence of discrimination or intent to discriminate is not required to establish the existence of a discriminatory act within the meaning of the CHRA (see Bombardier, at paras. 40-41). Thus, the Tribunal\u2019s task is \u201c\u2026 to consider all the circumstances and evidence to determine if there exists the \u201csubtle scent of discrimination\u201d (see Basi v. Canadian National Railway, 1988 CanLII 108 (CHRT) (\u201cBasi\u201d); Tabor v. Millbrook First Nation, 2015 CHRT 9, at para. 14).\n[52] In addition, as was noted by the Federal Court of Appeal in Holden v. Canadian National Railway Company, (1991) 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (FCA) (\u201cHolden\u201d) at paragraph 7, it is not necessary to show that discrimination was the sole basis for the acts complained of for the complaint to be deemed substantiated. It is sufficient for a prohibited ground of discrimination to have been a contributing factor in the employer\u2019s decision (see Bombardier, at paras. 44-52).\nIV. Analysis\nA. The prima facie case\n[53] Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin claims that she was qualified for the position, that she was not hired and that the individual who was hired obtained the position even though she was no better qualified and because she did not have the alleged prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[54] I agree that a prima facie case for these elements has been made.\n[55] In this case, the first two elements in Moore are not in dispute. First, Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin is the daughter of the director of the Odanak Health Centre. The characteristic family status is present, as the term \u201cfamily status\u201d includes the particular identity of a family member (see B. v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), 2002 SCC 66, at paras. 39-41). And, in a close-knit Indigenous community such as that of Odanak, it is even more present. Second, there is no question that Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin was refused the position at the Odanak Health Centre.\n[56] With respect to the third element in Moore, I am satisfied based on the evidence on a balance of probabilities that the characteristic of family status was a factor in the employer\u2019s refusal to hire Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin. She had the required qualifications, namely a university education at the bachelor\u2019s level at the time of the interview. She had experience in project management and had university training to that effect. Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin had a certain knowledge of the programs, having previously worked at the Odanak Health Centre. Mr. St-Ours, in his testimony, even acknowledged [translation] \u201cthat she was knowledgeable about Health Canada programs and that she had a particular qualification, more than the other candidate.\u201d Later in his testimony, Mr. St-Ours even goes so far as to admit that Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin was [translation] \u201coverqualified\u201d for the position.\n[57] She had not been the subject of a complaint in her previous employments. The witnesses who appeared even confirmed during their testimony that they had no complaints about Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin\u2019s past work.\n[58] Mr. Nolett even acknowledged having provided her with a letter of recommendation in May 2012.\n[59] Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin was not chosen for the position, and the individual who was chosen was not more qualified (I would even say she was less qualified \u2014 she did not have a university education at the bachelor\u2019s level at the time of the interview and had no project management experience) and, in effect, lacked the distinguishing feature on which the complaint was based.\n[60] Mr. Nolett indicated to the Tribunal that it was important to judge candidates on all of their skills. Yet it would appear that the candidate chosen was hired solely on the basis of the motivation criterion and not on all of the criteria, as is apparent from the score grids and the results of the two candidates, which shows a higher overall score for Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin than that of the candidate chosen, and this by the admission of the witnesses before the Tribunal.\n[61] Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin was refused employment, and family status was a factor in the Council\u2019s decision. It is not necessary that family status be the sole and unique factor for discrimination to occur; it is sufficient for it to have been one of the factors (Holden, supra).\n[62] A \u201csubtle scent of discrimination\u201d (Basi, supra) was present during the hearing. The witnesses referred to the fact that Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin had been given jobs in the past because she was the daughter of the director of the Centre. Even if that were the case in the past, that is not what is before the Tribunal. The fact that there might have been discrimination in the past and that Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin was given jobs because she was the daughter of the director of the Centre\u2014and I am not taking a position here because that is not what is before me\u2014does not give the Council permission to also discriminate, but in the opposite direction.\n[63] It was mentioned a number of times in the various testimonies that [translation] \u201cthis was the subject of much talk in the community\u201d. What was the subject of much talk? The fact that Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin is the daughter of Deny O\u2019Bomsawin. Were her skills the subject of much talk? Mr. St-Ours replied that they were not.\n[64] Mr. Nolett and Claire O\u2019Bomsawin also testified that it was rare for the Council to make a determination on such employment contracts. When asked [translation] \u201cWas this the first time?\u201d, Claire O\u2019Bomsawin, who has been a member of the Council for a number of years, immediately replied, [translation] \u201cYes, because she was Deny\u2019s daughter!\u201d\n[65] Lastly, during the meeting on November 2, 2012, between Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin and the members of the selection committee to discuss the decision that had been made by the Council a few days earlier, motivation was not raised. Neither Mr. St-Ours nor Mr. Nolett told the Complainant that motivation was a decisive factor in the Council\u2019s recommendation and decision. To the contrary, in that meeting, reference was made, in veiled terms, to the fact that Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin\u2019s being the daughter of the director of the Centre could have had an impact.\n[66] Mr. St-Ours acknowledged in his testimony that he told Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin that [translation] \u201csometimes the Council\u2019s decisions can produce victims\u201d. Mr. St-Ours did not discuss the criterion of motivation with the Complainant in that meeting.\n[67] Mr. Nolett also acknowledged in his testimony that Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin was not told about the motivation explanation in that post-mortem meeting. He also acknowledged that he said something like [translation] \u201c1, 2, 3 contracts without an interview, there was starting to be talk in the community\u201d.\n[68] For these reasons, I find that the Complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination under section 7 of the CHRA on the basis of family status.\nB. Council\u2019s explanation\n[69] In this case, the Council tried to demonstrate that its actions were not discriminatory and that the hiring of another candidate was instead based on that candidate\u2019s skills.\n[70] Thus, the Respondent claimed that the chosen candidate was more motivated for the job than the Complainant and that this factor was determinative in the choice that had to be made.\n[71] Yet, in light of the evaluation grid used by the Council for interviews, the motivation criterion was only worth 10 out of 100 points and also included [translation] \u201clife experience\u201d. More than two months passed between the date on which the competition closed and the interviews, and yet no change to the evaluation grid was made to reflect the apparent importance of the motivation criterion according to the comments made by the Council\u2019s witnesses. In fact, the Council, in a very subjective manner and without respecting its own evaluation grid, decided to make motivation the only criterion in this case, to give it more weight than it is indicated in its own evaluation grid, in order to justify a decision that was clearly discriminatory with respect to Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin.\n[72] The Council also argued several times that the competition notice did not reflect the real prerequisites for the position and that education and experience were not as important as the competition notice indicated. Yet, at the time of that finding in August 2012, the Council preferred to not re-post the position with a new description. Today, it cannot plead its failure to do so as justification of its choice.\n[73] The Council would have had to, for transparency purposes, at least inform the candidates who had applied for the position on the basis of the advertised notice that the criteria had been changed.\n[74] In its Statement of Particulars, the Council also argued that the refusal to hire Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin was based on a bona fide occupational requirement, that is, the ability to maintain and develop interpersonal relationships. In the Council\u2019s opinion, that ability must be considered a bona fide occupational requirement in this case, and considering that the applicant did not show or otherwise demonstrate that she had this, it alone constitutes a reason to refuse to hire her.\n[75] Apart from advancing this argument, the Respondent did not provide any evidence to establish a bona fide occupational requirement. Namely, to establish a bona fide occupational requirement, subsection 15(2) of the CHRA sets out that the Respondent must establish that accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost. Again, the Council did not provide any evidence of undue hardship.\n[76] For all of these reasons, I find that the Council\u2019s evidence is not convincing and is simply a pretext.\nV. Complaint substantiated\n[77] On the balance of probabilities, I therefore find that the Council engaged in a discriminatory practice under section 7(a) of the CRHA, based on family status, by refusing the hire the Complainant, Nahame O\u2019Bomsawin.\nVI. Relief\n[78] When the Tribunal finds a complaint to be substantiated, it has the power to make orders pursuant to section 53 of the CHRA. In this case, Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin is asking the Tribunal to order the Council to compensate her for loss of wages, for pain and suffering and for having engaged in a discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly, and to award her interest on that compensation. Sections 53(2)(c), 53(2)(e), 53(3) and 53(4) apply. We will analyze each one based on the evidence before us.\nA. Loss of wages (s. 53(2)(c))\n[79] Section 53(2)(c) of the CHRA states that the Tribunal can order the Respondent, who was found to have engaged in a discriminatory practice, to compensate the victim for any wages that the victim was deprived of and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n[80] Certain rules must be respected when this section is applied. First, in Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 268, paragraph 37 (\u201cChopra\u201d), the Federal Court of Appeal specified that there must be a causal link between the discriminatory practice that the Respondent was found to have engaged in and the loss claimed.\n[81] Furthermore, the CHRA clearly states that the Tribunal may compensate the victim for any or all of the wages that the victim was deprived of. Again, in Chopra, paragraph 40, the Federal Court of Appeal clarified the Tribunal\u2019s discretion by basing the application of this rule on an important premise, that is, the mitigation of losses:\nSociety has an interest in promoting economic efficiency by requiring those who have suffered a loss to take steps to minimize that loss as it is not in the public interest to allow some members of society to maximize their loss at the expense of others, even if those others are the authors of the loss.\n[82] Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin applied for the Accreditation Coordinator position at the Odanak Health Centre when she was unemployed. Only two people were interviewed for the position. Even though the Respondent had time to re-post the position between August and October 2012, and thus maybe receive more applications for the position, the Council preferred of its own accord to continue with the process with only two candidates, one of whom was Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin. I have already found, based on the evidence before me, that Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin was a victim of discrimination. In the absence of this discrimination, I am convinced that she would have been hired because overall she had more of the required skills and experience than the other candidate for the job that she applied for.\n[83] The Tribunal has full jurisdiction to compensate the victim of discrimination even if the victim did not lose a job, but lost the opportunity for having one. In fact, in Canada (Attorney General) v. Singh, 2000 CanLII 15208 (FC), at paragraphs 86-89, the Federal Court upheld the Tribunal\u2019s decision for compensation of the loss of wages resulting from a loss of an opportunity for a position, \u201calthough there is no guarantee\u201d.\n[84] Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin claims that she is entitled to $50,138.43 in compensation for loss of wages, which represents the difference between what she would have supposedly earned in three years if she had obtained the contract, less the wages that she actually earned during those three years.\n[85] She mitigated her losses because she did get another job. That job, according to the notices of assessment filed in evidence, allowed her to earn $78,823.95 in wages. Because that work was not performed on a reserve, it was taxable and she paid $14,302.38 in taxes according to those same notices of assessment. She therefore earned a net salary of $64,521.57.\n[86] If Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin had been given the Accreditation Coordinator position, she would not have had to pay taxes on her salary because the work would have been performed on a reserve.\n[87] However, I disagree with Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin on the amount that she claims that she would have earned if she had gotten the job. In fact, there is no evidence that the salary that would have been paid to her is the one claimed by her, that is, 21 hours\/week at $35\/hour.\n[88] First, the competition notice did not state a salary. The salary was to be discussed with the person who got the job based on his or her skills and experience. Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin did not demonstrate that she would have earned $35\/hour. However, according to the various testimonies, Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin apparently earned between $26 and $35 per hour in her previous jobs at the Odanak Health Centre.\n[89] Also, the evidence at the hearing showed that the Council was concerned about paying a salary that was in line with its pay grids and that Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin\u2019s past wages had not always respected those grids. The person who got the Accreditation Coordinator job and who carried out the three-year mandate earned $21\/hour.\n[90] In light of the foregoing, and because the Complainant clearly, at the time of the interviews, had more skills and experience than the other candidate, and because it was a three-year mandate, which would have been Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin\u2019s longest mandate at the Odanak Health Centre, it seems fair to me to find that the hourly wage on which the loss of wages will be based is $26\/hour, that is, the wage that Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin received when she did her three-month mandate as a project manager for the food safety program.\n[91] Thus, based on a three-year contract of 21 hours\/week, $26\/hour, the total salary that would have been paid to Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin is $85,176, tax free.\n[92] If we subtract the salary earned by Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin during those years (mitigation of losses principle) less the tax that she paid on that salary, that is, $64,521.57 based on the notices of assessment submitted, the net loss is $20,654.43.\n[93] Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin is also arguing that she had to work 35 hours\/week to earn a lower salary than what she would have earned if she had worked only 21 hours\/week for the Odanak Health Centre and is asking for compensation for the difference. She submits that she could have gotten another job or generated income by working 21 hours\/week via a three-day week.\n[94] I do not believe that Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin is entitled to compensation regarding the number of hours worked per week. The evidence has not established that if the Complainant had been awarded the Accreditation Coordinator contract, she would have used the remaining hours in the week to find another job. The Complainant herself was vague on this issue, alleging that she would have instead prioritized her quality of life.\n[95] For these reasons, I order the Respondent to pay the Complainant $20,654.43 for lost wages.\nB. Compensation for pain and suffering (s. 53(2)(e))\n[96] Pursuant to section 53(2)(e) of the CHRA, the Complainant is seeking $20,000 for the pain and suffering she allegedly experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice. The Complainant claims that she experienced major stress since the public announcement by the Council that she did not get the job for which she had applied. She claims to have experienced a form of betrayal, that this decision somehow forced her to leave the community and move away from her family. She had to see a physician and was prescribed medication to help her recover from these events. However, the Complainant did not provide any expert evidence to demonstrate the link between her medical situation and the loss of employment opportunity she suffered. There is no expert evidence in this case.\n[97] This does not mean, however, that Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin did not experience any stress related to this situation. The community of Odanak is a small community and the feeling of betrayal within the community cannot be denied, particularly within an Aboriginal community. Despite her qualifications, Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin did not get the job and the person who did get the job was no better qualified than Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin; quite the opposite. Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin gathered from a message sent to her that she was not judged on her qualifications but based on the mere fact that she was someone\u2019s daughter. The feeling of injustice was real.\n[98] However, $20,000 is the maximum amount under the Act that may be awarded and it is usually awarded by the Tribunal in more serious cases: when the scope and duration of the Complainant\u2019s suffering resulting from the discriminatory practice justify the full amount.\n[99] Based on the evidence, and because I find that Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin did suffer a prejudice for the manner in which she was treated, I order the Council to pay her $10,000 for the pain and suffering she experienced.\nC. Special compensation (s. 53(3))\n[100] Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin is asking that the Council pay her $7,500 in special compensation under section 53(3) of the CHRA. This section of the CHRA provides that the Tribunal may order the person to pay such compensation not exceeding $20,000.00 to the victim as the Tribunal may determine if the Tribunal finds that the person is engaging or has engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly.\n[101] According to Canada (Attorney General) v. Johnstone, 2013 FC 113, paragraph 155 (varied on other grounds, 2014 FCA 110), section 53(3) is a punitive provision intended to provide a deterrent and discourage those who deliberately discriminate. A finding of wilfulness requires the discriminatory act and the infringement of the person's rights under the Act to be intentional. Recklessness usually denotes acts that disregard or show indifference for the consequences such that the conduct is done wantonly or heedlessly.\n[102] As with section 53(2)(e), the maximum amount is only awarded in the most serious cases.\n[103] The facts in the evidence tendered showed that the Council was concerned that this [translation] \u201cwas the subject of much talk in the community\u201d, mainly about the fact that Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin was the daughter of the director of the Odanak Health Centre. The witnesses confirmed that the process put in place and more specifically the fact that the decision made by the Council was \u201cunique\u201d in that Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin was the director\u2019s daughter.\n[104] In my view, Messrs. St-Ours and Nolett exhibited behaviour devoid of caution when they decided to ignore all of the candidates\u2019 qualifications and chose the other candidate based solely on the motivation criterion, a criterion that was only worth 10 out of 100 points on their evaluation grid.\n[105] Their explanations during the hearing were clearly more of a pretext than a fair and reasonable explanation. These mitigated explanations from the Council combined with the evidence at the hearing that [translation] \u201cthis was the subject of much talk in the community\u201d, and that the Council appeared to be concerned by this gossip persuaded me that they acted with full knowledge that they were not treating Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin fairly. The Council\u2019s behaviour was devoid of caution and clearly seemed not to care about the consequences. The Respondent\u2019s objective was to make sure Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin did not get the position.\n[106] For these reasons, I order that the Council pay Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin compensation in the amount of $7,500 for having engaged in the discriminatory practice recklessly.\nD. Interest (s. 53 (4))\n[107] Pursuant to section 53(4) of the CHRA and Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal Rules of Procedure (03-05-04), I order that interest be paid on all amounts to be paid to Ms. O\u2019Bomsawin. Interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis at the Bank Rate (monthly series) established by the Bank of Canada. It shall accrue from the date of the decision by the Council not to hire the Complainant, that is, October 29, 2012, until the date of payment of the award of compensation.\nVII. Order\n[108] Nahame O\u2019Bomsawin\u2019s complaint is found substantiated and it is ordered that the Abenakis of Odanak Council:\nCompensate the victim in the amount of $20,654.43 for the wages the victim was deprived of.\nCompensate the victim in the amount of $10,000 for the pain and suffering she experienced.\nCompensate the victim in the amount of $7,500 for having engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully.\nPay interest on the foregoing compensation amounts in accordance with the terms outlined in paragraph 107 of this decision.\nSigned by\nAnie Perrault\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nFebruary 17, 2017\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT2111\/2715\nStyle of Cause:\nNahame O\u2019Bomsawin v.

Conclusion 15\nVI. Order 17\nANNEX........................................................................................................................................ 19\nI. Procedural history of the complaint\n[1] On April 28, 1999, the Syndicat des communications de Radio-Canada (the SCRC), filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission or CHRC) against the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), alleging a wage disparity between assistantship and research positions held predominantly by women, and jobs held by level 9 technicians, a predominantly male workforce, in violation of section 11 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA).\n[2] The SCRC represents jobs related to assistantships and research while the Syndicat des techniciens et artisans du r\u00e9seau fran\u00e7ais (STARF) represents jobs held by level 9 technicians.\n[3] On August 13, 2014, the Commission asked the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) to institute an inquiry into the portion of the complaint concerning research-related jobs and indicated that the Commission had decided not to refer the portion of the complaint concerning jobs related to assistantships. On November 25, 2014, the Chair of the Tribunal assigned the case to me for the purposes of instituting an inquiry. According to the Commission, there have been a series of events and decisions between the filing date of the complaint and the date when the Tribunal receives the request to institute an inquiry. A brief overview of these events is therefore necessary.\n[4] From April 28 to October 16, 1999: CBC claimed that the complaint was inadmissible and denied any claims of wage discrimination. It therefore filed objections pursuant to sections 40 and 41 of the CHRA and requested that the complaint be dismissed. In April 2000, the Commission decided to hear the complaint and proceed with an inquiry. On July 11, 2000, CBC filed an application for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision with the Federal Court.\n[5] On August 16, 2000, the Commission informed CBC that the inquiry was going forward. On July 16, 2002, the Federal Court rendered its decision dismissing the application for judicial review.\n[6] On April 5, 2004, the parties were advised that the Commission had decided to refer the complaint to conciliation and had asked the Chair of the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint if an agreement was not reached within 120 days.\n[7] On July 8, 2004, CBC filed an application for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision.\n[8] On April 12, 2005, the Federal Court ordered that the case be referred back to the Commission so that it could resume its inquiry into the complaint, with regard to a comparative assessment of the duties concerned and the question of whether the groups being compared were part of the same establishment within the meaning of the CHRA. The Court indicated that \u201c[t]he two parties should cooperate fully with the investigator and provide the information that will be requested of them. Needless to say, if it does not already exist, such information should be prepared by the party or parties from which it is requested\u201d (see Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Syndicat des communications de Radio-Canada, 2005 FC 466, at para. 52).\n[9] On March 16, 2011, the Federal Court denied the application for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision not to deal with the portion of the complaint concerning the \u201cassistantship\u201d group (see Syndicat des communications de Radio-Canada v. Canada (Attorney General) 2011 FC 314).\nII. The Commission\u2019s motion for disclosure\n[10] The Commission filed a motion asking the Tribunal to order CBC to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) (\u201cthe Rules\u201d) and to produce, by the deadline set by the Member, the various documents in its possession and that are relevant to any fact, issue or form of relief being sought, including the facts, issues and forms of relief mentioned by the other parties, and to do so within thirty (30) days of the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\n[11] The Commission is seeking an order requiring CBC to disclose the documents requested by the SCRC in its letter of April 15, 2015 \u2013 which will be discussed in further detail below \u2013 to both the Commission and the SCRC within thirty (30) days of the decision.\n[12] I have reviewed the entire case as well as the motion along with the attachments, and the arguments of all the parties. It should be noted that the Tribunal is not in possession of the attachments to the SCRC\u2019s Amended Statement of Particulars; consequently, these attachments were not analyzed for the purposes of this decision. For the sake of brevity, I will not describe each of the arguments presented by the parties here; I will instead provide a brief overview.\n[13] The Commission alleges that CBC failed to comply with Rule 6 of the Rules, which requires each party to disclose the various documents in its possession that are relevant to any issue in question. The Commission therefore maintains that CBC has failed to comply with its obligation in this regard and is asking the Tribunal to order the disclosure of all documents relevant to this case.\n[14] The Commission also points out that CBC\u2019s Statement of Particulars indicates that it is in possession of a series of documents likely to be relevant to the case before the Tribunal, but that it has not been able to submit these documents to the parties because they have not identified the documents that they would like to obtain.\n[15] The Commission and the SCRC are not in a position to identify the documents to be obtained because these documents are not in their possession. The Commission further argues that when it comes to disclosure, the Tribunal must protect the fairness and integrity of the process. This requires full and complete disclosure of all potentially relevant documents by all parties and therefore, in order to achieve this objective, the Tribunal may order one of the parties to disclose these documents.\n[16] The SCRC contends that CBC, by its own admission, is in possession of potentially relevant documents that the SCRC would like to obtain in order to present its evidence, establish the merits of the complaint and complete its expert reports. It further adds that in the context of this extremely complex case, disclosure is necessary in order to ensure that the process before the Tribunal progresses smoothly. Moreover, according to the SCRC, the employer has retained a number of various types of documents concerning the nature of the jobs of various groups, their compensation and the group members.\n[17] The SCRC adds that in February 2015, it forwarded its documentary evidence to CBC. In a letter dated April 2015, the SCRC then asked CBC, in turn, to provide its disclosure. In light of CBC\u2019s refusal, the SCRC turned to the Tribunal to request an order for the disclosure of:\nAny document, letter, email or note that could potentially prove relevant to this case, including but not limited to;\nThe collective agreements for SARDEC and ACTRA in effect between 1995 and 1998;\nJob postings for the research group and the comparison group of category 9 technicians from June 1995 to date;\nDocuments, letters, emails, notes and questionnaires dealing with or concerning the duties, functions or requirements for employment in the comparison group of category 9 technicians from June 1995 to date; and\nDocuments, letters, emails, notes and questionnaires relating to or concerning job evaluations and\/or the creation of monographs for the research group and the comparison group of category 9 technicians from June 1995 to date.\n[18] In short, the SCRC maintains that its motion is supported by the objective of Rule 1 of the Rules. The Rules mentioned in this decision can be found in the Appendix.\n[19] In response, CBC argues that the SCRC was in possession of documents that it had failed to disclose, including the collective agreements for SARDEC and ACTRA in effect from 1995 to 1998, the job postings for the group designated by the SCRC as the research group and the job postings for the comparison group.\n[20] With respect to other requests for the above-mentioned documents, CBC maintains that these requests were so imprecise that it had found it impossible to respond to them. It further adds that the SCRC\u2019s Statement of Particulars is itself imprecise.\n[21] CBC indicates that it is willing to cooperate fully with the Tribunal and the parties, and offer this cooperation in a context where the rules of natural justice are respected.\n[22] In its response, CBC presented an application similar to a counterclaim under Quebec civil law and asked the Tribunal to order the SCRC to disclose the following documents:\nA copy of any collective agreement that the SCRC intends to cite in support of its claims (and\/or that it considers relevant to the purposes of this case) and to which it currently has access;\nA copy of any job posting that the SCRC intends to cite in support of its claims (and\/or that it considers relevant to the purposes of this case) and to which it currently has access;\nA copy of any document to which the SCRC currently has access and that it intends to cite not only to enhance its evidence in the context of the inquiry, but to support the claim that the group 9 jobs represented by STARF could be considered to be a comparison group with a predominantly masculine workforce, in compliance with the legislative objectives (see paragraph 57 of the SCRC\u2019s Statement of Particulars);\nA copy of any document to which the SCRC currently has access and that it intends to cite in the context of the inquiry, for the purposes of applying a potential evaluation plan considering the duties included in the research group and the comparison group;\nA copy of any document to which the SCRC currently has access and that it intends to cite in the context of the inquiry, in order to demonstrate the duties of the comparison group identified;\nThat the Tribunal order the SCRC to clarify the job titles included in the comparison group;\nThe methodology proposed by the SCRC in order to compare the overall compensation of individuals holding positions included in the comparison group; and\nAny specific documents to which it does not have access and which, in its opinion, are necessary for the purpose of evaluating the duties concerned and evaluating the compensation associated with these duties.\n[23] According to CBC, most of the documents sought by the SCRC are in its possession or under its control. According to CBC, it agreed to proceed on the basis of a subpoena duces tecum to be served in anticipation of the inquiry and to limit disclosure prior to the inquiry since this was the approach recommended by the SCRC. In light of a change in approach, CBC maintains that the SCRC should complete its file rather than do so during the inquiry.\n[24] Another argument put forward by CBC concerns the complainant\u2019s obligation with respect to evidence. CBC confirms that it is willing to disclose additional documents that it deems relevant in light of the information received concerning the methodology used to compare jobs and salaries. Moreover, following the transmission of these documents, CBC requests that if the SCRC believes that additional documents exist, these documents should be clearly identified, and the SCRC should contact either CBC and\/or the Tribunal in this regard.\n[25] CBC asked the Tribunal to take note of its commitment indicated in its letter dated April 24, 2015, whereby CBC will provide the specific documents required insofar as they are in its possession. CBC added that it would then be in a position to complete its disclosure which, in its opinion, is consistent with the principles of natural justice. Finally, it argues that these principles of natural justice require the complainants to state their evidence.\nIII. The applicable law\n[26] First and foremost, it would be helpful to refer to subsection 48.9(1) of the CHRA, which stipulates that \u201c[p]roceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\u201d\n[27] Consequently, in compliance with the principles of natural justice and subsection 50(1) of the CHRA, parties before the Tribunal must be given a full and ample opportunity to present their case. This requires the disclosure of arguably relevant evidence between the parties. If there is a rational connection between a requested document and the facts, issues or forms of relief identified by the parties, this document should be disclosed pursuant to Rules 6(1)(d) and (e) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules (see Guay v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2004 CHRT 34, at para. 42 (\u201cGuay\u201d); Telecommunications Employees Association of Manitoba Inc. v. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 CHRT 28, at para. 4 (\u201cTEAM Inc.\u201d); and Rai v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2013 CHRT 6, at para. 28 (\u201cRai\u201d)).\n[28] While the Rules do not specify the manner or form by which production is to take place, the purpose of the Rules and the principles of fairness in general dictate that the disclosure and production of documents be sufficient to allow each party the full and ample opportunity to be heard (see Grand Chief Stan Louttit et al v. Attorney General of Canada, 2013 CHRT 3, at para. 14 (\u201cLouttit\u201d)).\n[29] The Rules provide that the parties are required to disclose the potentially relevant documents in their possession. The parties are not required to create documents for the purposes of disclosure (Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 42, at para. 17).\n[30] Moreover, Rule 1(2) states that they \u201c. . . shall be liberally applied by each Panel to the case before it so as to advance the purposes set out in 1(1).\u201d One of the purposes of the Rules is to ensure that the \u201carguments and evidence be disclosed and presented in a timely and efficient manner\u201d (Rule 1(1)(b)) and that \u201call proceedings before the Tribunal be conducted as informally and expeditiously as possible\u201d (Rule 1(1)(c)). I would add that Rule 1(1)(c) is consistent with subsection 48.9(1) of the CHRA (see Rai, at para. 34).\n[31] It is important to remember that relevance is assessed in relation to the complaint and the Statement of Particulars (see Lindor v. Public Works and Government Services Canada, 2012 CHRT 14, at para. 56).\n[32] Moreover, relevance is a notion that is distinct from the admissibility of evidence for the purposes of a hearing and this principle is set out in the decision rendered in TEAM Inc., at paragraph 4:\n\u201cThe production of documents is subject to the test of arguable relevance, not a particularly high bar to meet. There must be some relevance between the information or document sought and the issue in dispute. There can be no doubt that it is in the public interest to ensure that all relevant evidence is available in a proceeding such as this one. A party is entitled to get information or documents that are or could be arguably relevant to the proceedings. This does not mean that these documents or this information will be admitted in evidence or that significant weight will be afforded to them.\u201d\n[33] That said, the request must not be speculative or amount to a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d. The requested documents should be described with sufficient precision (see Guay, at para. 43).\nIV. Analysis\nA. General duty of disclosure before the Tribunal\n[34] The Rules of disclosure are essentially intended to allow the parties to obtain all the potentially relevant documents in order to prepare to present their evidence before the Tribunal. This facilitates the smooth running of the proceedings as an integral part of the proper administration of justice and the principles of procedural fairness.\n[35] That said, the Rules also provide for ongoing disclosure in anticipation of situations where new evidence may arise or when documents which were omitted must be disclosed.\n[36] For the purposes of disclosure, the complaint, the theory of the case included in the Statement of Particulars and the entire Statement of Particulars in itself, all serve as guides for identifying the potential relevance of the documents. This potential relevance will be analyzed from both the point of view of the complaining party and the respondent or the party representing the public interest, in this case, the Commission. In other words, the documents to be disclosed are not limited to those which support the position of a single party, but the positions of all the parties.\n[37] The process before the Tribunal is a new process that requires full and complete disclosure within the same forum. Consequently, documents that were disclosed in the context of earlier processes and outside Tribunal-related processes are not considered to form an integral part of this process and must therefore be disclosed and communicated among the parties.\n[38] In principle, the parties clearly identify the documents in their list of disclosure and sometimes ask the other parties to identify the documents needed in order to avoid any duplication. However, even though this approach may be considered to be effective, it is not mandatory and is not always appropriate. It will not prove to be very useful if one party does not include certain documents in its list of disclosure and the omitted documents are potentially relevant to the opposing party.\n[39] The parties must include enough information in their lists in order to allow the other parties to understand what these documents include (see Louttit, at para. 15). The parties are subsequently required to forward the list to the other parties concerned and update it if applicable.\n[40] Therefore, this does not mean asking a party to identify the specific documents that it wants and which are not included in the disclosure list of another party. In order to comply with its duty of disclosure, it is important to describe the documents in order to allow the opposing party to identify them and to provide these documents to the opposing party. In short, the party that is in possession of a document is in a better position to describe it than the party who does not have the document in its possession and is often unaware that it exists.\n[41] At best, as in this case, a party that believes that certain documents are in the possession of the other party and are not clearly described on the latter\u2019s disclosure list may request them by identifying categories of documents that rationally relate to a fact, an issue or a form of relief that is being sought, which is what the Commission and the SCRC did here. (See paragraph 17 of this decision, points 1, 4 and 5).\n[42] As pointed out by the Commission, it is important not to confuse the disclosure of potentially relevant documents in the context of the Tribunal process with the disclosure of evidence which will be presented before the Tribunal in the context of the inquiry.\n[43] CBC indicates that it is entitled to expect compliance with the principles of natural justice, to know the theory of the case presented by the SCRC and the Commission and to have information on the evidence it will be required to respond to when presenting its defence.\n[44] This principle is applicable here since all the parties before the Tribunal have a full and ample opportunity to be heard at the inquiry.\n[45] However, there is no infringement on fairness or natural justice based on the fact that the parties are required to disclose the potentially relevant documentation in their possession.\n[46] That said, I will start by addressing the Commission\u2019s first general request, i.e., to obtain disclosure for:\nany document, letter, email or note that could potentially prove relevant to this case. (See point 1 in paragraph 17).\n[47] I note that the Commission forwarded a detailed list of its disclosure to the parties and to the Tribunal. This list includes two Appendices, Appendix A and B. Appendix A, which includes 141 pages, is a list for which no privilege was claimed.\n[48] In reviewing this list, I note that it includes a good number of collective agreements, tables, postings and documents that are potentially relevant to this case. In its response, CBC does not make any reference to the fact that it did not receive this disclosure. CBC is therefore presumably in possession of the Commission\u2019s disclosure.\n[49] In analyzing the list of the Commission\u2019s disclosure, I note that there are similarities between the types of documents which were disclosed and those targeted by requests for disclosure in the context of this motion. The requests by the Commission and the SCRC therefore appear to be reasonable under the circumstances.\n[50] Moreover, in paragraph 80 of its Amended Statement of Particulars, the SCRC indicates its approval of the evidence communicated to the parties by the Commission in December 2014.\n[51] In paragraphs 81 and 82 of this same Amended Statement of Particulars, the SCRC confirms that it forwarded the documents in its possession, i.e., the documents forwarded by CBC to the SCRC, as well as documents created contemporaneously, when these documents were received.\n[52] During the conference call dated June 22, 2015, the SCRC confirmed that it had gone as far as possible in terms of the substantiated allegations set out in its Statement of Particulars. The rest of the documents required to present evidence were allegedly in the hands of CBC.\n[53] For example, paragraph 89 of the SCRC\u2019s Amended Statement of Particulars refers to numerous gaps in communication provided by CBC, related to certain information concerning contracts for the research group.\n[54] The SCRC therefore argues that the disclosure requested from CBC will help complete its expert reports.\n[55] CBC is in possession of the SCRC\u2019s Statement of Particulars, which sets out its case theory and the basis for its claims. The Federal Court also shed some light on this case by setting the context for the Commission\u2019s inquiry.\n[56] For all these reasons, I believe that the parties are well aware of the allegations and issues, despite the need for clarification in the future.\n[57] It is important to note that because we are dealing with allegations of wage disparity, the documents that are being requested in the Commission\u2019s motion appear to be potentially relevant to this case and must therefore be disclosed.\nB. Detailed analysis\n[58] I will now conduct an analysis of each of the requests for the various categories of documents by the Commission and the SCRC in order to determine the potential relevance of the documents requested in the disclosure motion.\n(i) The collective agreements for SARDEC and ACTRA in effect between 1995 and 1998\n[59] The SCRC\u2019s Amended Statement of Particulars mentions these agreements in the following paragraphs; for the sake of brevity, the paragraphs referenced are not reproduced in their entirety here:\n[TRANSLATION]\nParagraph 6: Prior to June 1998, the group of researchers comprised three (3) job titles, which were exclusively under the purview of the union which represented them before the redefinition of the bargaining units by the Canada Industrial Relations Board in 1995: the SJRC researchers (a journalists\u2019 union), the SARDEC researchers (an authors\u2019 union) and the Researcher\/ACTRA Program (an artists\u2019 union).\nParagraph 7: Between 1995 and 1998, the employees in group I were therefore covered by three different collective agreements as indicated in the collective agreement of the Syndicat des journalistes de Radio-Canada (CSN) filed by the CHRC, exhibit 170.\nSee also paragraphs 29, 30 and 44 (non-exhaustively).\n[60] In light of the above references and paragraphs, there is a rational connection between the requested documents, i.e., the SARDEC and ACTRA collective agreements, and the allegations. Therefore, the documents are potentially relevant. Moreover, the reference to another collective agreement filed by the Commission suggests that the Commission disclosed this agreement to the parties. It is therefore justified that CBC, in turn, should comply with the Rules and disclose the documents that are in its possession.\n[61] Consequently, CBC must disclose and provide these documents to the parties; I will include this information in the order.\n(ii) The job postings for the research group and the comparison group of category 9 technicians, i.e., Intermediate Broadcasting Technician; Intermediate Switcher; Intermediate Cameraman; Intermediate Editor; Intermediate Sound Technician from June 1995 to date\n[62] Paragraph 37 of the SCRC\u2019s Amended Statement of Particulars states that:\n[TRANSLATION]\nFrom June 1995 to the date of the filing of the complaint, the requirements related to the positions in the professional research group were similar in terms of training, experience and qualifications required, as indicated in job postings: CHRC-36 to 39, 100 to 103, 326, 330, 339 to 341, 348, 351, 355, 364, 366, 373 and job evaluation questionnaires filed in support of these proceedings for positions held at the time by . . . .\n[63] Moreover, with respect to the comparison group, paragraph 50 indicates that:\n[TRANSLATION]\nJob descriptions and postings were filed by the CHRC demonstrating the nature of job functions and requirements i.e., Exhibits CHRC-19 to 33, 81, 82, 91, 99,189, 193.\nSee also paragraph 31 (non-exhaustively).\n[64] In light of the above references and paragraphs, there is a rational connection between the requested documents and the allegations. The documents are therefore potentially relevant. Moreover, references to many of the Commission\u2019s documents suggest that the Commission disclosed them to the parties. It is therefore justified that CBC, in turn, should comply with the Rules and disclose the documents in its possession.\n[65] For these reasons, CBC must disclose and provide these documents to the parties; I will include this information in the order.\n(iii) Documents, letters, emails, notes and questionnaires dealing with or concerning the duties, functions or requirements for employment in the comparison group of category 9 technicians i.e.: Intermediate Broadcasting Technician; Intermediate Switcher; Intermediate Cameraman; Intermediate Editor and Intermediate Sound Technician from June 1995 to date\n[66] Paragraph 69 of the SCRC\u2019s Amended Statement of Particulars states that:\n[TRANSLATION]\nIndeed, the functions of the research group evolved over time and this resulted in complicating their duties while the opposite was true for the functions related to the comparison group identified, as will be demonstrated during the inquiry.\nSee also paragraphs 47 and 94 (non-exhaustively).\n[67] In light of the above references and paragraphs, there is a rational connection between the requested documents and the allegations. The documents are therefore potentially relevant.\n[68] Consequently, CBC must disclose and provide these documents to the parties; I will include this information in the order.\n(iv) Documents, letters, emails, notes and questionnaires dealing with or concerning job evaluations and\/or the creation of monographs for the research group and the comparison group of category 9 technicians, i.e., Intermediate Broadcasting Technician; Intermediate Switcher; Intermediate Cameraman; Intermediate Editor and Intermediate Sound Technician from June 1995 to date\n[69] Paragraph 33 of the SCRC\u2019s Amended Statement of Particulars states that:\n[TRANSLATION]\nIn March 2006, these jobs were subsequently divided into two job titles, i.e., researchers and investigative journalists, on completion of a joint exercise concerning job evaluations which ran from 2002 to 2006, as indicated in the employment monographs filed by the CHRC, Exhibits CHRC\u2011432 and 440 and the job questionnaires completed at the time for positions in the professional research group exercised at the time by . . . Exhibit CHRC-475 filed in a bundle.\n[70] And paragraph 34 indicates that:\n[TRANSLATION]\nThis exercise of creating monographs took place after CBC and the SCRC agreed on a job evaluation plan, which reapplied the criteria provided in the Order of 1986, as indicated in version 7 of the 2005 evaluation plan, filed under Exhibits CHRC\u2011406 and 407.\nSee also paragraphs: 35, 37, 38, 45, 52, 54, 59, 65, 66, 67, 68 and 94 (non-exhaustively).\n[71] In light of the above references and paragraphs, there is a rational connection between the requested documents and the allegations. The documents are therefore potentially relevant.\n[72] CBC should therefore disclose and provide these documents to the parties; I will include this information in the order.\nV. Conclusion\n[73] I believe that this Amended Statement of Particulars is sufficiently detailed to allow CBC to identify the potentially relevant documents with a rational connection to a fact, issue or a form of relief being sought.\n[74] At this stage of the case file, the SCRC identifies the comparison group as a group that may be found within the sub-groups of category 9 technicians in Quebec and Moncton which were identified in the SCRC\u2019s amended Statement of Particulars, i.e.: Intermediate Broadcasting Technician; Intermediate Switcher; Intermediate Cameraman; Intermediate Editor; Intermediate Sound Technician, Head Technical Installer (see paragraph 12 of the SCRC\u2019s Amended Statement of Particulars).\n[75] Therefore, I do not share CBC\u2019s opinion that the Amended Statement of Particulars provided by the SCRC and the comparison group is imprecise.\n[76] I find that there is a rational connection between the requested documents identified in paragraph 17 of this decision and the facts, issues or forms of relief being sought by the Commission and the SCRC. As demonstrated above, the facts, issues and forms of relief being sought are supported by the SCRC\u2019s Amended Statement of Particulars. The documents are therefore potentially relevant to this case.\n[77] Disclosure of the documents in CBC\u2019s possession will likely allow the SCRC to complete its evidence regarding the sub-groups that could potentially be grouped together in order to establish a comparison group. Ultimately, it is the SCRC\u2019s responsibility to provide evidence in this regard during the inquiry.\n[78] At this stage of the case file, I believe that the reference to positions in the comparison group is sufficient for the purposes of disclosure and may be further clarified at a later date, once the SCRC has received and reviewed the disclosure from CBC. If applicable, the SCRC may then opt to further amend its Statement of Particulars to clarify the sub-groups comprising the comparison group. The parties will also be able to amend their Statement of Particulars to respond to the SCRC\u2019s amendments if applicable.\n[79] With respect to CBC\u2019s request that the Tribunal order the SCRC to disclose the methodology which will be used to evaluate salaries, it is my opinion that this request is premature since the SCRC has confirmed that it will only be able to complete its expert reports after receiving CBC\u2019s disclosure. Moreover, the recommended methodology will potentially be identified by the experts.\n[80] It is well established that this type of case is extremely complex and demands a certain amount of flexibility in the approach to be used, such as the approach adopted in paragraph 78 above. The objective here is not to mischaracterize the complaint or the theory of the case but to instead offer clarifications which may be necessary for the purposes of the case if necessary (see Rule 6(5)(a)). Moreover, a formal approach requiring the SCRC to complete its evidence at this stage, before CBC provides its disclosure, is at the very least questionable.\n[81] For example, the case in Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada Post Corporation, 2005 CHRT 39, was heard over 250 days in a period of seven years and included thousands of documents filed as evidence. In another case it was noted that one party was required to review roughly 40,000 documents in order to compile a list of documents (see Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada (Minister of Personnel of the Government of Northwest Territories), 1999 CanLII 19858). These are just two examples demonstrating the complexity of this type of case and the need for each party to have a certain amount of flexibility.\nVI. Order\n[82] I hereby order the SCRC to compile a detailed list of all the documents in its possession and for which no privilege is claimed.\n[83] I hereby order the SCRC to compile a detailed list of all the documents in its possession for which privilege is claimed.\n[84] I hereby order the SCRC to disclose these lists to the parties and the Tribunal by April 3, 2017.\n[85] I hereby order the SCRC to provide an affidavit confirming that all the documents in its possession were included in the disclosure list and, with respect to the documents for which privilege is not claimed, to provide confirmation that they were disclosed and provided to the parties. This affidavit is to be attached to the SCRC\u2019s disclosure list and will be communicated to the parties and to the Tribunal by April 3, 2017.\n[86] I hereby order CBC to comply with Rule 6 and, more specifically, with Rules 6(1)(d) and (e) and 6(4) of the Rules.\n[87] I hereby order that by June 5, 2017, CBC is to disclose and produce any and all documents, letters, emails and notes that could potentially prove relevant to this case, i.e., in cases where there is a rational connection to a requested document and the facts, issues or forms of relief being sought by all the parties, including the following:\nthe collective agreements of SARDEC and ACTRA in effect between 1995 and 1998;\nthe job postings for the research group and the comparison group of category 9 technicians, i.e.: Intermediate Broadcasting Technician; Intermediate Switcher; Intermediate Cameraman; Intermediate Editor and Intermediate Sound Technician from June 1995 to date;\ndocuments, letters, emails, notes and questionnaires dealing with or concerning the duties, functions or requirements for employment within the comparison group of category 9 technicians i.e.: Intermediate Broadcasting Technician; Intermediate Switcher; Intermediate Cameraman; Intermediate Editor and Intermediate Sound Technician from June 1995 to date; and\ndocuments, letters, emails, notes and questionnaires dealing with or concerning job evaluations and\/or the creation of monographs for the research group and the comparison group of category 9 technicians, i.e.: Intermediate Broadcasting Technician; Intermediate Switcher; Intermediate Cameraman; Intermediate Editor and Intermediate Sound Technician from June 1995 to date.\n[88] I must emphasize that the directives set out in this decision are issued subject to CBC\u2019s right to claim any and all privilege, if necessary and with supporting reasons, as provided in Rule 6(1)(e) of the Rules.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nMarch 1, 2017\nANNEX\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL RULES OF PROCEDURE\n(03-05-04)\nR\u00c8GLES DE PROC\u00c9DURE DU TRIBUNAL CANADIEN DES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE\n(03-05-04)\n1 PURPOSE, INTERPRETATION\n1 OBJET, INTERPR\u00c9TATION\nPurpose\n1(1) These Rules are enacted to ensure that\n(a) all parties to an inquiry have the full and ample opportunity to be heard;\nObjet\n1(1) Les pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles ont pour objet de permettre\na) que toutes les parties \u00e0 une instruction aient la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de se faire entendre;\n(b) arguments and evidence be disclosed and presented in a timely and efficient manner;

Ruling 11\nI. Motion to determine scope\/amend complaint\n[1] Ms. Donna Casler alleges Canadian National Railway (\u201cCN\u201d) discriminated against her in employment, on the grounds of disability and sex, pursuant to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d). In sum, she claims CN treated her in an adverse differential manner, failed to accommodate her disability and employed discriminatory policies and\/or practices.\n[2] When Ms. Casler filed her complaint with the Commission on September 22, 2004, she had been off work since August 2000, which according to her was as a result of CN\u2019s failure to accommodate her disability. By the time the complaint was referred to this Tribunal on February 28, 2014, CN had terminated Ms. Casler\u2019s employment on September 6, 2006. Ms. Casler claims her termination is the end result of CN\u2019s failure to accommodate her disability as detailed in her original complaint. Therefore, she has brought the present motion to include her termination and the facts leading up to her termination, including some facts prior to August 2000, within the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry into her complaint. Alternatively, Ms. Casler moves to amend her complaint to add these details.\n[3] CN claims the complaint referred to the Tribunal is limited to the period of August 25, 2000 to September 22, 2004. In its view, Ms. Casler should not be allowed to amend her complaint to include matters outside of this referral period. According to CN, to do so would prejudice its case.\n[4] The Commission has limited its participation in this matter to Case Management Conference Calls (\u201cCMCCs\u201d) and has not made submissions on this interim motion.\n[5] For the reasons that follow, I find the Commission\u2019s referral of Ms. Casler\u2019s complaint is not limited to the period of August 25, 2000 to September 22, 2004. The allegations Ms. Casler raises before and after this period, including her termination, properly fall within the scope of her complaint.\nII. Issues\n[6] Upon review and consideration of the parties\u2019 submissions, I have identified the issues to be determined in this ruling as follows:\nWhat is the Tribunal\u2019s ability to determine scope\/amendments of the complaint?\nIs there a temporal limit or defined scope to the referral of Ms. Casler\u2019s complaint to the Tribunal?\nDo events pre August 25, 2000 and post September 22, 2004 fall within the scope of Ms. Casler\u2019s complaint?\nWill CN suffer prejudice if events pre August 25, 2000 and post September 22, 2004 fall within the scope of Ms. Casler\u2019s complaint?\nIII. Analysis\nA. What is the Tribunal\u2019s ability to determine scope\/amendments of a complaint?\n[7] The Tribunal\u2019s role is to inquire into complaints referred to it by the Commission (see ss. 40, 44, 49 of the Act). Therefore, the scope of a complaint and whether to allow an amendment thereto is determined by examining the original complaint and the Commission\u2019s request for an inquiry, which generally includes a letter from the Chief Commissioner, the original complaint and a Summary of Complaint form prepared by the Commission. In performing this examination, the Tribunal is ensuring that there is a link to the allegations giving rise to the original complaint and that it is not bypassing the Commission\u2019s referral mandate under the Act. In other words, a determination of scope or amendment cannot introduce a substantially new complaint that was not considered by the Commission (see Canada (Attorney General) v. Parent, 2006 FC 1313 at para. 30 (\u201cParent\u201d); Kanagasabapathy v. Air Canada, 2013 CHRT 7 at paras. 29-30 (\u201cKanagasabapathy\u201d); and, Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 1 at para. 9 [\u201cGaucher\u201d]).\n[8] That said, it must be kept in mind that filing a complaint is the first step in the complaint resolution process under the Act. It raises a set of approximate facts that call for further investigation by the Commission. As the Tribunal stated in Gaucher, at paragraph 11, \u201c[i]t is inevitable that new facts and circumstances will often come to light in the course of the investigation. It follows that complaints are open to refinement\u201d.\n[9] Indeed, the original complaint does not serve the purposes of a pleading in the Tribunal\u2019s adjudicative process leading up to a hearing. Rather, it is the Statements of Particulars filed with the Tribunal that set the more precise terms of the hearing. As long as the substance of the original complaint is respected, the complainant and Commission can clarify and elaborate upon the initial allegations before the matter goes to hearing (see Gaucher at para. 10).\n[10] The role of the Tribunal in a motion such as the present is to consider the documentation and submissions regarding the scope or amendment sought; determine what the substance of the complaint is; and, decide whether the definition of scope or the amendment sought is connected to the substantive complaint and required to enable the Tribunal to inquire into the real issues in dispute. In doing so, it is not the Tribunal\u2019s role to reconsider the Commission\u2019s investigation or its decision to refer a complaint in light of the investigation. That jurisdiction rests exclusively with the Federal Court (see Waddle v. Canadian Pacific Railway and Teamsters Canada Rail Conference, 2016 CHRT 8 at paras. 32-38).\n[11] As with all its actions, in making determinations as to scope and amendment the Tribunal must respect the principles of natural justice and ensure that each party has a full and ample opportunity to present their case (see ss. 48.9(1) and 50(1) of the Act). If an amendment results in real and significant prejudice to a party, and that prejudice cannot be cured, the amendment should not be allowed (see Cook v. Onion Lake First Nation, 2002 CanLII 61849 (CHRT) at para. 20).\nB. Is there a temporal limit or defined scope to the referral of Ms. Casler\u2019s complaint to the Tribunal?\n[12] According to CN, the Commission\u2019s referral of Ms. Casler\u2019s complaint to the Tribunal included a temporal limit on its scope. That is, the Commission limited the scope of the referral to allegations arising between the time period of August 25, 2000 to September 22, 2004.\n[13] CN submits that, after initially screening Ms. Casler\u2019s complaint under section 41(1) of the Act, the Commission wrote a letter to the parties dated January 6, 2005 indicating that it decided to deal only with those allegations which occurred from August 25, 2000 to September 22, 2004. CN argues that this decision of the Commission was never altered or amended by a subsequent decision of the Commission. Therefore, the only decision of the Commission respecting the time period of the complaint is set out in this January 6, 2005 letter, which has remained determinative and consistently followed throughout the Commission\u2019s investigations of the complaint and in its ultimate decision to refer the complaint to the Tribunal.\n[14] In my view, there is no temporal limit or defined scope to the complaint as indicated by CN. CN\u2019s submissions ignore the series of events and decisions that came after the Commission\u2019s January 6, 2005 letter and, more importantly, the actual referral of the complaint to this Tribunal.\n[15] Following the Commission\u2019s initial investigation, it was recommended that the complaint be dismissed, which recommendation was adopted in a decision of the Commission dated June 17, 2009. Ms. Casler sought judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision and, while unsuccessful at the Federal Court (see Casler v. Canadian National Railway, 2011 FC 148 [Casler 2011]), the Federal Court of Appeal upheld the appeal and sent the matter back to the Commission for re-investigation (see Casler v. Canadian National Railway, 2012 FCA 135 [Casler 2012]).\n[16] CN refers to excerpts from Casler 2011 and Casler 2012 to support its temporal scope argument and to indicate that Ms. Casler did not at any time prior to the present motion raise her termination or events outside the time period of August 25, 2000 to September 22, 2004.\n[17] However, the effect of Casler 2012 was to reject the first Commission investigation and decision. The first investigation and decision not to refer the complaint are irrelevant because the subsequent decision to refer the complaint to the Tribunal was based on a re-investigation and re-determination by the Commission. Casler 2011 and Casler 2012 do not support CN\u2019s assertion that there is a temporal limit or scope to the complaint.\n[18] Following a re-investigation, the Commission decided to refer Ms. Casler\u2019s complaint to the Tribunal on February 28, 2014. The referral documentation forwarded to the Tribunal includes a 4 page Complaint Form signed by Ms. Casler on September 22, 2004. It has not been updated or changed by the Commission or Ms. Casler since that time. Also in the referral documentation is a Complaint Summary, which was prepared by the Commission, with information in boxes such as \u201cfile number\u201d, \u201cdate received\u201d, \u201ccomplainant\u2019s name\u201d, \u201crespondent\u2019s name and address\u201d and \u201cwhere occurred\u201d, all of which is not in issue.\n[19] Under the heading \u201cDate of Alleged Conduct\u201d the Complaint Summary states: \u201cOctober 14, 1998 to July 4, 2000, and August 25, 2000 to September 22, 2004 and ongoing\u201d. Under \u201cRelevant Prohibited Grounds\u201d it states: \u201cDisability (Fibromyalgia and Myalgic Encephalomelitis); Sex (female)\u201d. Under \u201cApplicable Sections of the CHRA\u201d it states: \u201c7 & 10\u201d.\n[20] Under \u201cPractices (e.g. termination of employment, harassment, etc.)\u201d it states:\nEmployment - Adverse Differential Treatment\n- Failure to Accommodate\n- Discriminatory Policy and\/or Practice\n[21] There is also accompanying the Complaint Form and Complaint Summary a letter from the Commission (signed by Mr. David Langtry), dated February 28, 2014, addressed to Susheel Gupta, the Acting Chairperson of the Tribunal at the time. The entire letter reads as follows:\nI am writing to inform you that the Canadian Human Rights Commission has reviewed the complaint (20040537) of Donna Casler against Canadian National Railway.\nThe Commission has decided, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, to request that you institute an inquiry into the complaint as it is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, an inquiry is warranted.\nI would also like to inform you that the Commission had previously decided to deal only with the allegations which occurred from August 25, 2000.\nA copy of the complaint form is enclosed. Form I, including complainant and respondent information, will be provided by the Litigation Services Division.\nThe complainant and respondent are being advised that they will receive further information from the Tribunal regarding the proceedings.\n[22] The Complaint Summary does not include \u201ctermination\u201d under the \u201cPractices (e.g. termination of employment, harassment, etc.)\u201d and this letter from Mr. Langtry includes that the Commission \u201cpreviously decided to deal only with the allegations which occurred from August 25, 2000\u201d, without explaining the relevance, if any, to the Tribunal.\n[23] During a conference call on October 18, 2016, I asked Commission counsel if they had any submissions to make regarding this letter, but none were made at that time and, as mentioned above, the Commission has not made any submissions on this motion.\n[24] The Tribunal has held that if the Commission intends to request an inquiry into something less than the entirety of a complaint, this intention must be explicitly stated in the letter of request it sends to the Tribunal Chairperson (see Kanagasabapathy at paras. 30-32; and, Blodgett v. GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy Canada Inc., 2013 CHRT 24 at para. 67).\n[25] The sentence in Mr. Langtry\u2019s February 28, 2014 letter that \u201cI would also like to inform you that the Commission had previously decided to deal only with the allegations which occurred from August 25, 2000\u201d is an ambiguous statement and is not an explicit limitation or restriction on the scope of the complaint referred to the Tribunal. Therefore, I cannot agree that this sentence has the intent or effect of limiting the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry only to events after August 25, 2000. There is also no mention at all of an end date such as September 22, 2004, other than that is the date of the original Complaint Form.\n[26] I find that the Commission did not impose any temporal limits on the referral of Ms. Casler\u2019s complaint to the Tribunal. That said, the determinative issue on this motion is not when or on what date the events or allegations occurred but, as mentioned above, whether those events and allegations are connected to the substance of the original complaint.\nC. Do events pre August 25, 2000 and post September 22, 2004 fall within the scope of Ms. Casler\u2019s complaint?\n[27] Ms. Casler submits that her termination on September 6, 2006 and the circumstances giving rise to that termination, as set out in her Statement of Particulars, are inextricably linked to the original complaint she filed and which the Commission referred to the Tribunal. Her original complaint specified that the alleged discrimination was ongoing because, as of the date of the complaint, she had yet to be accommodated by CN. Ms. Casler submits that her ultimate termination is the continuum of CN\u2019s ongoing discrimination and failure to accommodate, as alleged in the original complaint.\n[28] CN submits there is no reasonable basis to amend the complaint or otherwise include events pre August 25, 2000 and post September 22, 2004 within the scope of Ms. Casler\u2019s complaint. According to CN, the factual circumstances arising after September 22, 2004 and culminating in Ms. Casler\u2019s termination are distinct from the circumstances arising between 2000 and 2004. Furthermore, CN argues the fact that Ms. Casler used the words \u201cand ongoing\u201d in her complaint do not justify the amendment or enlargement of scope requested. A complaint, by definition, must be clearly defined and cannot include some yet-to-occur future issue. CN also takes issue with Ms. Casler raising arguments and suggesting evidence will be called on matters that occurred prior to August 25, 2000.\n[29] As mentioned above, in ruling upon this motion, the Tribunal must assess the submissions of the parties and the referral documentation it received from the Commission to determine if the scope or amendment sought is logically, factually, or causally connected to the substance of the original complaint referred to the Tribunal by the Commission. To determine this motion, I reviewed the parties\u2019 Statements of Particulars and submissions on this motion, along with the referral documentation received from the Commission.\n[30] The Complaint Form dated September 22, 2004, alleges CN discriminated against Ms. Casler due to her disability and sex by failing to accommodate her disability by offering her suitable work. Ms. Casler asserts she has not worked since August 25, 2000, because CN has not offered her suitable work.\n[31] The events pre August 25, 2000 described in Ms. Casler\u2019s original complaint and Statement of Particulars provide context to the events leading up to August 25, 2000, including: Ms. Casler\u2019s employment history with CN; her diagnosis with fibromyalgia and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis and related sick leave; and, her version of events regarding her attempts to return to work and related requests for accommodation.\n[32] With respect to events post September 22, 2004, Ms. Casler\u2019s original complaint alleges the failure to accommodate is ongoing because, as of the date of her complaint, she had yet been offered a suitable position. Ultimately, she did not go back to work and was terminated in September 2006 by CN. Both parties\u2019 Statement of Particulars associate the termination with the ongoing accommodation process.\n[33] In all the events described by Ms. Casler, the parties are the same, the employer is the same, the grounds are the same, and the alleged discriminatory practices (i.e., failing to provide suitable employment) are alleged to have the same basis (i.e., failure to accommodate based on disability and sex).\n[34] I am satisfied that the events pre August 25, 2000 and post September 22, 2004 are factually and logically connected to the substance of Ms. Casler\u2019s original complaint. Subject to the consideration of CN\u2019s arguments regarding prejudice below, I conclude that in order to conduct this inquiry into the real issues in controversy, Ms. Casler ought to be able to include her allegations of ongoing discrimination following her complaint dated September 22, 2004, including her termination and all facts leading thereto, whether they occurred before August 25, 2000 or after September 22, 2004.\nD. Will CN suffer prejudice if events pre August 25, 2000 and post September 22, 2004 fall within the scope of Ms. Casler\u2019s complaint?\n[35] CN submits that allowing events pre August 25, 2000 and post September 22, 2004 within the scope of Ms. Casler\u2019s complaint would cause evident and inherent prejudice to CN in violation of procedural fairness and natural justice.\n[36] CN raises two arguments regarding prejudice: delay and the loss of its opportunity to have the Commission apply section 41(1) of the Act.\n(i) Delay\n[37] According to CN, there is inherent prejudice caused by the delay of almost 10 years in seeking the amendment of the complaint following Ms. Casler\u2019s termination. Furthermore, allegations preceding August 25, 2000 occurred over 16 years ago. CN submits that documents and evidence that may have existed in relation to these allegations are or may have been lost. In this regard, it notes the CN employee managing Ms. Casler\u2019s accommodation and return to work over the post-September 2004 time period is now deceased. In addition, a CN occupational nurse who also had primary responsibility for managing Ms. Casler\u2019s accommodation and return to work is no longer with CN and is unreachable.\n[38] As the Supreme Court of Canada stated in Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 2000 SCC 44, at paragraph 101, the mere passage of time, without more, does not warrant a stay of proceedings as an abuse of process at common law and would be tantamount to imposing a judicially created limitation period. There must be proof of significant prejudice, which results from an unacceptable delay, to warrant dismissing the complaint or an aspect of the complaint as requested by CN. In this regard, I also note Justice Mactavish\u2019s statement in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FC 445, at paragraph 140, that \u201cthe Tribunal\u2019s power to dismiss a human rights complaint in advance of a full hearing on the merits should be exercised cautiously, and then only in the clearest of cases\u201d.\n[39] In my view, CN has not provided proof of significant prejudice at this stage of the proceedings to warrant dismissing the pre August 25, 2000 and post September 22, 2004 allegations at issue in this motion. While it has taken many years for Ms. Casler\u2019s complaint to get to hearing, as mentioned above, the mere passage of time is not enough to establish prejudice. With respect to the unavailability of witnesses and related documentation, the claim of prejudice is speculative at this stage. CN has not specified what actual prejudice it has suffered as a result of the unavailability of these witnesses and, with regard to the occupational nurse, I note that it is unclear why she is unreachable and will not be available for the hearing. I further note that, despite CN\u2019s claim of prejudice, it was able to prepare a detailed Statement of Particulars responding to all aspects of Ms. Casler\u2019s complaint, including allegations raised pre August 25, 2000 and post September 22, 2004.\n[40] I believe CN\u2019s claim of prejudice due to delay is best determined following the hearing of this matter. At that stage, any evidence of the effects of delay will have been proffered before the Tribunal and tested by the parties. Therefore, while I dismiss CN\u2019s claim of prejudice due to delay for the purposes of this motion, this does not affect its right to raise the issue again at a later stage of these proceedings.\n(ii) Loss of opportunity to have the Commission apply section 41(1) of the Act\n[41] CN submits that it will be prejudiced because it has lost the opportunity to have Ms. Casler\u2019s allegations pre August 25, 2000 and post September 22, 2004 pass through the gate keeping and investigative functions of the Commission pursuant to section 41(1) of the Act. Relatedly, it has lost the opportunity to challenge any referral of those allegations by the Commission through judicial review with the Federal Court.\n[42] In the same vein, CN argues that if section 41(1)(b) of the Act were applied to Ms. Casler\u2019s termination allegations, it is clear that the termination related issues would be found to be within the exclusive jurisdiction of a labour arbitrator. Relying on the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Canada (House of Commons) v. Vaid, 2005 SCC 30 (\u201cVaid\u201d), CN argues all matters arising from or in relation to a collective agreement are within the exclusive jurisdiction of a labour arbitrator, empowered under the Canada Labour Code in the case of a federally regulated employer like CN. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction to apply section 41 of the Act to the complaint post-referral and, therefore, this prejudice cannot be rectified by the Tribunal and supports the dismissal of this motion.\n[43] Any prejudice with respect to the opportunity to have the Commission screen and investigate the allegations at issue in this motion is lost only if there is in fact a new complaint. Having found Ms. Casler\u2019s allegations pre August 25, 2000 and post September 22, 2004 not to raise a new complaint, I find there is no prejudice to CN as a result of any lost opportunity to have those allegations go through the Commission process (see Parent at paras. 42-44).\n[44] With respect to the decision in Vaid, it involved an employee who was subject to a specific grievance process under the Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act (\u201cPESRA\u201d). In the specific circumstances of Mr. Vaid\u2019s employment and the allegations surrounding his dismissal, the Supreme Court found his complaint ought to have been considered under the PESRA and not the Act. I do not read the decision in Vaid to stand for the broad proposition advanced by CN that all matters arising from or in relation to a collective agreement are within the exclusive jurisdiction of a labour arbitrator, empowered under the Canada Labour Code in the case of a federally regulated employee. Aside from Vaid, CN did not advance any jurisprudential, statutory or other authority for this proposition.\n[45] Ultimately, the Tribunal\u2019s examination of Ms. Casler\u2019s allegations will focus on whether her disability or sex was a factor in her termination pursuant to the Act. It is not the Tribunal\u2019s role to examine the termination broadly in terms of the collective agreement, whether it was wrongful or unjust dismissal, or whether CN was required to provide notice or severance.\nIV. Ruling\n[46] For the reasons above, I find the Commission\u2019s referral of Ms. Casler\u2019s complaint is not limited to the period of August 25, 2000 to September 22, 2004. The allegations she raises before and after this period, including her termination, properly fall within the scope of her complaint.\n[47] The parties are reminded that this is a pre-hearing ruling. Nothing in this ruling should be interpreted as a determination of any of the matters in dispute. Ms. Casler still has the burden of establishing a prima facie case in relation to all her allegations. Further, this ruling is not a determination of the admissibility or weight of any particular evidence. Such argument is reserved for the hearing.\n[48] I do not think it is necessary to formally amend the complaint in order for the Tribunal to receive the Statement of Particulars already filed by Ms. Casler and which addresses the allegations covered in this ruling. As mentioned above, the complaint does not serve the purposes of a pleading in the Tribunal\u2019s adjudicative process leading up to a hearing. Rather, it is the Statements of Particulars filed with the Tribunal that set the more precise terms of the hearing.\n[49] CN may file an amended Statement of Particulars to address anything arising from this ruling and Ms. Casler may reply to those amendments, if any.\nSigned by\nJ.

Nishnawbe Aski Nation\u2019s motion for immediate relief orders\n[1] In First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Canada), 2016 CHRT 2 (\u201cthe Decision\u201d), this Panel found that First Nations children and families living on reserve and in the Yukon are denied equal child and family services and\/or differentiated adversely in the provision of child and family services contrary to the Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d). More specifically, that Indigenous Affairs and Northern Affairs Canada\u2019s (\u201cINAC\u201d) design, management and control of the First Nations Child and Family Services Program (\u201cthe FNCFS Program\u201d), along with its corresponding funding formulas and other related provincial\/territorial agreements, results in denials of services and creates numerous adverse impacts for many First Nations children and families living on reserve. Among other things, the FNCFS Program funding authorities are not based on provincial\/territorial legislation or service standards. Instead, they are based on funding levels and formulas that can be inconsistent with the applicable legislation and standards.\n[2] The FNCFS Program, corresponding funding formulas and other related provincial\/territorial agreements only apply to First Nations people living on reserve and in the Yukon. It is only because of their race and\/or national or ethnic origin that First Nations children and families suffer the adverse impacts in the provision of child and family services enumerated in the Decision. Furthermore, these adverse impacts perpetuate the historical disadvantage and trauma suffered by Indigenous peoples, in particular as a result of the Residential Schools system.\n[3] INAC was ordered to reform the FNCFS Program and Memorandum of Agreement Respecting Welfare Programs for Indians (\u201cthe 1965 Agreement\u201d) to reflect the findings in the Decision. It was also ordered to cease applying its narrow definition of Jordan\u2019s Principle and to take measures to immediately implement the full meaning and scope of Jordan's Principle.\n[4] The Nishnawbe Aski Nation (\u201cNAN\u201d) seeks various immediate relief orders arising out of the Decision and two subsequent rulings (see 2016 CHRT 10 and 2016 CHRT 16).\n[5] In sum, NAN seeks orders with respect to the provision of mental health services to First Nations in Ontario, the development of a remoteness quotient to be applied to funding for NAN child welfare agencies, and other agency-specific relief.\n[6] The First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, the Assembly of First Nations, the Chiefs of Ontario and the Commission also filed separate motions seeking orders of immediate relief. Along with the motions of the other parties, NAN\u2019s motion was heard from March 22-24, 2017 in Ottawa.\n[7] During the hearing, the Panel was encouraged to learn that NAN and INAC, were able to reach a resolution on certain aspects of NAN\u2019s motion. The following ruling incorporates those resolutions into an order of this Panel. The other orders requested by NAN that are not covered in this ruling shall be dealt with in a separate ruling.\nA. Adjournment of request for \u201cChoose Life\u201d order\n[8] In January 2017, two twelve-year-old children tragically took their own lives in Wapekeka First Nation (\u201cWapekeka\u201d), a NAN community. Before the loss of these children, Wapekeka had alerted the federal government, through Health Canada, to concerns about a suicide pact amongst a group of young children and youth. This information was contained in a July 2016 detailed proposal aimed at seeking funding for an in-community mental health team as a preventative measure.\n[9] The Wapekeka proposal was left unaddressed by Canada for several months with a reactive response coming only after the two youths committed suicide. The media response from Health Canada was that it acknowledged it had received the July 2016 proposal in September 2016; however, it came at an \u201cawkward time in the federal funding cycle\u2019\u2019 (see affidavit of Dr. Michael Kirlew, January 27, 2017, at para. 16). The Panel acknowledges how inappropriate this response is in such circumstances and the additional suffering it must have caused.\n[10] Tragically, in February 2017, two other youths aged 11 and 21 took their own lives in NAN communities of Deer Lake and Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug (see affidavit of Sol Mamakwa, February 13, 2017, at para. 5).\n[11] The Panel would like to acknowledge and extend our condolences to the families and communities of these youths and to all those who have lost children in similar tragic circumstances.\n[12] In its Decision, the Panel made findings about the gaps in mental health services for First Nations children and youth. In particular, the Panel identified jurisdictional issues between INAC and Health Canada in the provision of these services that created adverse impacts and denials of services for First Nations children and families. With specific regard to Ontario, mental health services are not covered by the 1965 Agreement despite the fact that they are legislated in Ontario\u2019s Child and Family Services Act (see paras. 217-223, 239-242, 246, 364-373 and 391-392, and para. 458 of the Decision).\n[13] In a subsequent order following the Decision and dealing specifically with the 1965 Agreement, INAC was ordered to provide a rationale, data and other relevant information to assist this Panel in understanding how Budget 2016 investments are responsive to the needs of First Nations children and how it addresses, in the short term, the findings in the Decision with respect to mental health services (see 2016 CHRT 16, at para. 73).\n[14] In response, INAC indicated it was reviewing the provision of additional services under the 1965 Agreement, such as mental health services, as part of a longer-term engagement and reform process involving national and regional discussions.\n[15] Ms. Robin Buckland, Executive Director of the Office of Primary Health Care within Health Canada\u2019s First Nations and Inuit Health Branch, provided affidavit evidence and was cross-examined on the Wapekeka tragedy. She had no response as to why the Wapekeka proposal was left unanswered. However, according to Ms. Buckland, the gap in mental health services, created by the 1965 Agreement, \u201ccould rightly be considered a Jordan\u2019s Principle case.\u201d\n[16] It is in this context that the NAN seeks a \u201cChoose Life\u201d order that Jordan\u2019s Principle funding be granted to any Indigenous community that files a proposal (akin to the Wapekeka proposal) identifying children and youth at risk of suicide.\n[17] On March 22, 2017, Health Canada committed to establishing a Choose Life Working Group with NAN aimed at establishing a concrete, simplified process for communities to apply for Child First Initiative (Jordan\u2019s Principle) funding (see Annex \u201cA\u201d). As such, NAN has asked this Panel to adjourn sine die its motion for a \u201cChoose Life\u201d order. NAN proposed to report back to the Panel with respect to the Choose Life Working Group by September 6, 2017.\n[18] The Panel grants NAN\u2019s request to adjourn its motion for a \u201cChoose Life\u201d order and is really encouraged by the Choose Life Working Group initiative. In writing, by September 6, 2017, NAN shall report back to the Panel with respect to the Choose Life Working Group and indicate whether or not it continues to seek an adjournment of its request for a \u201cChoose Life\u201d order.\nB. Agreement on the development and implementation of a remoteness quotient\n[19] Since joining these proceedings as an interested party in May 2016, NAN has sought to address the design and implementation of the Panel\u2019s orders with specific regard to the context of remote and northern communities in Ontario. It has advocated that a new remoteness quotient be developed to ensure funding to remote northern communities reflects the high costs of living and the extraordinary costs of providing services in those communities.\n[20] Indeed, this was recognized by the Panel in its Decision where it found the ability of remote FNCFS Agencies to recruit and retain staff, and to deliver services was adversely impacted by the FNCFS Program. The Panel ordered INAC to immediately address how it determines funding for remote FNCFS Agencies. Current funding does not account for such things as travel to provide or access services, the higher cost of living and service delivery in remote communities, the compounded effect of reducing core funding for remote agencies that may also be smaller agencies (see paras. 213-233 and 291 of the Decision). In its subsequent ruling in 2016 CHRT 16, the Panel ordered INAC to provide detailed information to clearly demonstrate how it is determining funding for remote FNCFS Agencies that allows them to meet the actual needs of the communities they serve (see 2016 CHRT 16, at para. 81).\n[21] INAC and NAN have now agreed to terms on the development and implementation of a remoteness quotient for the three FNCFS Agencies that serve NAN communities. INAC will fund the development of this quotient. The specific Terms of Reference of their agreement are attached as Annex \u201cA\u201d of this ruling. The Panel adopts those terms as set out in the order below and pursuant to section 53(2)(a) of the Act.\n[22] Again, the Panel is pleased by this agreement between INAC and NAN. The other parties are also supportive of this agreement, but await the final development and implementation of the remoteness quotient in NAN communities before taking a position on its application across the country. As such, the Tribunal will reserve its jurisdiction to return to the issue of the remoteness quotient to modify or clarify its order in the future. As with the \u201cChoose Life\u201d order, NAN proposed to report back to the Panel with respect to the development and implementation of the remoteness quotient by September 6, 2017.\n[23] The Panel also notes that its acceptance of INAC and NAN\u2019s agreement does not affect the other immediate relief measures requested by the parties. As mentioned above, the motions and measures requested by the other parties, along with the other measures requested by NAN that are not addressed in this ruling, shall be dealt with in a separate ruling. Finally, the Panel\u2019s acceptance of INAC and NAN\u2019s agreement should not be construed to modify or change any immediate relief measures already ordered by the Panel.\nII. Order\n[24] Having heard from the parties and upon considering their written submissions on NAN\u2019s motion for immediate relief and the subsequent resolutions reached with INAC, the Tribunal orders as follows:\n1. NAN\u2019s motion for a \u201cChoose Life\u201d order is adjourned sine die. NAN shall report back to the Panel with respect to the Choose Life Working Group by September 6, 2017 and indicate whether or not it continues to seek an adjournment of its request for a \u201cChoose Life\u201d order;\n2. INAC and NAN will work to develop and implement an immediate relief funding formula for the three FNCFC Agencies that serve NAN communities, in accordance with the Terms of Reference attached to this order as Annex \u201cB\u201d;\n3. INAC will provide to NAN, within 30 days of this order, funding of $77,931.02, inclusive of HST, for Phase 1 as set out in the expert proposal provided by NAN to INAC in accordance with the Terms of Reference;\n4. INAC will provide NAN with the available empirical data agreed upon by NAN and INAC for Phase 1 by April 15, 2017;\n5. The results of Phase 1 will be made available by NAN to INAC by July 15, 2017;\n6. In accordance with paragraph 4 of the Terms of Reference, INAC will commit to a further update to the Barnes Report using data from the 2016 Census and any other relevant available data that NAN and INAC agree upon; and\n7. By September 6, 2017, INAC and NAN will provide an update to the Tribunal concerning the progress of data collection and analysis in relation to the Terms of Reference and every six months thereafter as long as the Panel remains seized of this order.\n[25] The Panel retains jurisdiction over the above orders should it need to modify or clarify them in the future.\nIII. Concluding remarks\n[26] At the outset of the March 22-24, 2017 hearing, the Panel Chairperson stated the following:\nI have a few words to bring hope, since people can perish without vision and hope. Truth always needs to be said, even when it's hard. It is a component of justice. This does not mean we cannot bring hope; we have to foster hope.\nHope is the heartbeat of a nation. It gives people the strength to overcome obstacles that seem insurmountable. It brings people together to work towards a common goal and drives them forward even in the midst of adversity. I would like to say to everyone that you are all precious and that there is always hope.\n[27] The Panel believes the agreements achieved between NAN and INAC to be carriers of hope.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nPanel Chairperson\nEdward P.

It will serve as a pilot that could be broadened to other communities depending on feedback received from First Nations.\nThe Choose Life Working Group is not meant to displace the work of the Joint Action Table. It is intended to provide an interim measure for communities who have identified and assessed\nunmet needs of First Nations children in mental health that have resulted due to the lack of\navailability of services and supports requested in the community, or where a dispute over coverage of the requested services and supports is in question between federal departments or the provincial government.\nHealth Canada will also ensure that the Choose Life application process is consistent with the national Jordan's Principle approval process so that it enhances and does not create a more onerous approach for NAN communities, families and children to access Child First Initiative funding.\n\u201cAnnex A\u201d\nThank you for your consideration and openness to working through these issues.\nWelalin,\nValerie Gideon\nAssistant Deputy Minister\nRegional Operations\nc.

Complaint\n[1] This is a decision regarding a Complaint dated June 5, 2009 by Jessica Mary Stanger, as Complainant, against Canada Post Corporation (\u201cCPC\u201d or \u201cCanada Post\u201d), as Respondent, alleging it discriminated against her on the basis of her disability and marital status.\n[2] On June 11, 2012, pursuant to s. 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the \u201cCHRA\u201d), the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) requested the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) to institute an inquiry into the Complaint.\n[3] Ms. Stanger appeared and gave evidence at the hearing. She was ably assisted by her husband, Mr. Patrick Stanger who, although not a lawyer, did a commendable job of navigating through the Tribunal\u2019s hearing process. The Respondent was represented by a lawyer, Mr. Zygmunt Machelak. The Commission did not appear at the hearing.\n[4] The hearing took place in Victoria, British Columbia (\u201cBC\u201d) mainly over three separate one-week sessions, starting in October 2013 and ending in January 2014. Thereafter, it was necessary to receive the testimony of one witness by affidavit, as he was not well enough to testify in person. This process took several months to complete. Final arguments were heard orally in July of 2015.\nII. Overview\n[5] Ms. Stanger is a long-time employee of Canada Post. Her complaint alleges workplace discrimination on two grounds: Firstly, Ms. Stanger alleges that some fellow employees discriminated against her because of her partial, physical disability. Secondly, Ms. Stanger alleges that some co-workers and CPC discriminated against her because of her relationship with, and eventual marriage to, a Canada Post superintendent.\nIII. Decision\n[6] For the reasons set out below, I have determined that one allegation in the Complaint is substantiated. The remaining allegations are not substantiated and are therefore dismissed.\nIV. Allegations of Discrimination\n[7] At the hearing, Ms. Stanger gave evidence about 18 separate events which she alleges constitute prohibited discrimination under the CHRA. Her allegations are based on two grounds of discrimination under s. 3(1) of the CHRA: marital status; and disability.\n[8] Ms. Stanger alleged 5 acts of discrimination under s. 7: that she was denied employment advancement and that she was treated differentially when certain tasks were wrongly removed from her work rotations because of her marital status. She also alleged 3 acts of discrimination based on her disability.\n[9] Under s.14 of the CHRA, Ms. Stanger alleged harassment related to her employment: 7 events relate to alleged harassment because of her marital status and 3 events relate to alleged harassment because of her disability.\nA. Legal Framework\nSection 7 of the CHRA\n[10] Section 7 of the CHRA states:\nIt is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[11] In human rights cases, a complainant has the burden of proof to establish a prima facie case. A prima facie case is \u201c\u2026one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent-employer.\u201d (Ontario Human Rights Commission and O\u2019Malley v. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 (\u201cO\u2019Malley\u201d) at p. 558).\n[12] To demonstrate prima facie discrimination in the context of the CHRA, complainants are required to show: (1) that they have a characteristic or characteristics protected from discrimination under the CHRA; (2) that they experienced an adverse impact with respect to a situation covered by sections 5 to 14.1 of the CHRA; and, (3) that the protected characteristic or characteristics were a factor in the adverse impact (see Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61 at para. 33; Siddoo v. I.L.W.U., Local 502, 2015 CHRT 21, para. 28). The three elements of discrimination must be proven on a balance of probabilities (see Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier Aerospace Training Center) (\u201cBombardier\u201d), 2015 SCC 39 at paras. 55-69).\n[13] The Tribunal has recognized the difficulty in proving allegations of discrimination by way of direct evidence. As was noted in Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company 1988 CanLII 108 (CHRT) (\u201cBasi\u201d): \u201cDiscrimination is not a practise which one would expect to see displayed overtly. In fact, rarely are there cases where one can show by direct evidence that discrimination is purposely practised.\u201d Rather, one must consider all of the circumstances to determine if there exists what was described in the Basi case as \u201c\u2026the subtle scent of discrimination.\u201d\n[14] It is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue for a complaint to succeed. It is sufficient that the discrimination be a factor in the employer\u2019s actions or decisions (Holden v. Canadian National Railway Co. (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (F.C.A.)). Nevertheless, the complainant has the burden of showing that there is a connection between a prohibited ground of discrimination and the adverse treatment. (See Bombardier, supra, at para. 52.)\n[15] Once a complainant establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, he is entitled to relief in the absence of justification by the employer (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 202, at p. 208; Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204, at para. 18).\nSection 14 of the CHRA\n[16] Section 14 of the CHRA states:\nIt is a discriminatory practice,\n(a) in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public,\n(b) in the provision of commercial premises or residential accommodation, or\n(c) in matters related to employment,\nto harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[17] Marital status and disability are prohibited grounds of discrimination under s. 3(1) of the CHRA.\n[18] Ms. Stanger alleged several events occurred in the workplace which she claimed constituted harassment.\n[19] The Tribunal has attempted to define harassment as any words or conduct that are unwelcome or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome, related to a prohibited ground of discrimination, that would detrimentally affect the work environment or lead to adverse job-related consequences for the victim. Harassment usually denotes repetitious or persistent acts, although a single serious event can be sufficient to create a hostile work environment (see Janzen v. Platy Enterprises Ltd., [1989] 1 SCR 1252; and, Kimberley Franke and Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canadian Armed Forces, [1999] 3 FC 653 (\u201cFranke\u201d)). In the context of harassment based on disability, the Tribunal has held that, the key is to examine whether the conduct has violated the dignity of the employee from an objective perspective such that it has created a hostile or poisoned work environment (see Croteau v. Canadian National Railway Company, 2014 CHRT 16 (\u201cCroteau\u201d), at para. 43).\n[20] In the context of alleged harassment that is not sexual in nature, the Tribunal has considered whether or not comments about one\u2019s disability are relevant to or consistent with the legitimate operations and business goals of the employer. If they are, such comments may not constitute harassment. On the other hand, derogatory comments or unnecessary questioning about a disability are irrelevant and extraneous to the safety, operations and business goals of the employer. Such conduct, where it is humiliating or demeaning, can constitute harassment. (See Day v. Canada Post Corporation, 2007 CHRT 43 (\u201cDay\u201d), at para. 184.)\n[21] The Tribunal further considered the meaning of harassment in Siddoo v. International Longshoremen\u2019s and Warehousemen\u2019s Union, Local 502 2015 CHRT 21 at paras. 45-46 (judicial review pending, T-1742-15):\nEvery act by which a person causes some form of anxiety to another could be labelled as harassment. What offends one person may not offend the next person at all. Furthermore, none amongst us are perfect, and we are all capable of being, on occasion, somewhat thoughtless, insensitive and perhaps even outright stupid. Does this mean that there can never be any safe interactions between people? The question is not so much whether one is offended or feeling humiliated, but by what objective measure can we define harassment, so that people everywhere know exactly how to conduct themselves to avoid it.\nI do not think that every act of foolishness or insensitivity in the workplace was intended to be captured under section 14 of the CHRA. Harassment is a serious word, to be used seriously and applied vigorously when the occasion warrants its use. To do otherwise would be to trivialize it. It should not be cheapened or devalued in its meaning by using it to loosely label petty acts or foolish words where the harm, by any objective standard, is fleeting.\n[22] The Tribunal also noted the importance of not trivializing the protection granted in section 14 of the CHRA in Rampersadsingh v. Wignall, 2002 CanLII 23563 (CHRT), para. 55:\n[55] The same issue was dealt with by the Court of Appeal of Quebec in the case of Habachi v. Commission des droits de la personne du Qu\u00e9bec . The Court recognized that a single act, provided it is serious enough and has an ongoing effect, may constitute harassment. As an example, Madame Justice Deschamps suggested that a single incident of sexual assault at the workplace would create the deep, long-lasting and unfavourable effect required to constitute sexual harassment. But Mr. Justice Baudouin also pointed out in the same case that if one were to conclude that acts lacking the requisite severity nevertheless constitute harassment, the effect would be to trivialize a provision of the Act that was intended to deal with a very specific form of discrimination\u2026\nV. General Background Facts\n[23] There are various background facts which should be noted, none of which are in contention by the parties. Ms. Stanger was first hired by Canada Post in Calgary in 1989. She was transferred to Victoria in 1991 in the position of postal clerk. She suffered a non-work related injury to her neck in 1999 which resulted in two bulging spinal discs. In 2000, Canada Post deemed Ms. Stanger to be a \u201cpermanently, partially disabled\u201d employee, referred to commonly at Canada Post as a \u201cPPD\u201d.\n[24] From June of 2000, until she left the Victoria Mail Processing Plant (\u201cVicMPP\u201d) in 2008, Ms. Stanger\u2019s PPD status entailed the following limitations on her ability to work:\n\u00b7 Lifting floor to waist: Maximum 10 lbs.\n\u00b7 Carrying items with both hands: Maximum 15 lbs.\n\u00b7 Standing: Maximum 2 hours.\n[25] Canada Post accommodated Ms. Stanger\u2019s return to work from 2002 to 2004 through a graduated return to work program. In 2004, Ms. Stanger was assigned to the Number 3 shift in the Communication A section at VicMPP. At VicMPP, each shift section consisted of approximately 16 employees. There were 13 specific work activities to be performed by each section, and the shift workers were rotated, usually every two hours, to a different activity. As a result of her PPD limitations, Ms. Stanger was unable to perform the majority of these activities, and she therefore had to be accommodated by being permitted to perform a limited number of them on a more frequent basis.\n[26] Ms. Stanger had been previously married to one of her co-workers, Mr. Patrick Gibbons, who appeared as a witness for the Respondent at the hearing. She separated from Mr. Gibbons in early 2003, and they were formally divorced in 2004.\n[27] In 2004, Ms. Stanger began a romantic relationship with the Shift 3 Superintendent at VicMPP, Mr. Patrick Stanger. By the end of 2004, the Complainant and Mr. Stanger were living together, and in February of 2008 they were legally married.\n[28] Ms. Stanger stopped working at VicMPP on or about June 22, 2008. She took a sick leave and did not return to work until December of 2008. Ms. Stanger did not return to work at VicMPP. When she returned to work in December of 2008, it was in a retail position for the Respondent elsewhere in the region and she remained working there at the time this complaint was heard.\nVI. Preliminary Issues\nA. Grounds of Discrimination based on Marital Status or Family Status?\n[29] When this complaint was originally filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission in 2009, the Complainant listed the prohibited grounds of discrimination as: \u201cDisability, Marital Status & Family Status.\u201d A revised Summary of Complaint form dated November 30, 2011, listed the prohibited grounds of discrimination as: \u201cDisability & Marital Status.\u201d\n[30] In written submissions and in oral argument, the Complainant\u2019s representative used the terms \u201cmarital status\u201d and \u201cfamily status\u201d interchangeably. It appeared to me that he made no distinction between the two grounds, and that he considered them to be the same. In Waddle v. C.P.R. et al. 2016 CHRT 8, the Tribunal found that where an Amended Summary of Complaint form was referred to the Tribunal along with the Complaint, the Summary of Complaint could serve as an instrument amending the Complaint (see para. 30).\n[31] Accordingly, as the revised Summary of Complaint form makes no mention of \u201cFamily Status\u201d, I have considered the Complainant\u2019s submissions about family status in reference to marital status only.\nB. Start Date for Allegations of Discrimination based on Marital Status\n[32] In its closing argument, the Respondent contends that Ms. Stanger cannot make a claim of discrimination on the grounds of marital status until such status has been acquired by her. In a strict application of the ground \u201cmarital status\u201d, the Respondent argues that Ms. Stanger did not acquire it until her legal marriage to Mr. Stanger on February 14, 2008. In the alternative, if common-law marriage status can be acquired after one year of co-habitation, then Ms. Stanger could not have acquired such status until November 1, 2005. This is the date on which Ms. Stanger confirmed to her employer in writing that she effectively commenced living in a \u201cspousal\u201d (i.e. common-law) relationship with Superintendent Stanger. Submitted as an exhibit, this document was entitled Dependant Information and appeared to be a form issued by Great West Life Assurance Company and the Respondent. It was signed by the Complainant on February 8, 2006. As such, the Respondent argues, any incidents that pre-date the acquisition of marital status cannot give rise to valid complaints under the CHRA.\n[33] The Complainant made no submissions on the argument that she had not acquired marital status until February 14, 2008.\n[34] There is some confusion on the record about when Ms. Stanger\u2019s relationship with the Superintendent began, and when they started to cohabit. In her direct evidence, Ms. Stanger said they started dating in late summer or September of 2004. Under cross examination, Ms. Stanger said that she started living with Superintendent Stanger in late October of 2004.\n[35] However, in Ms. Stanger\u2019s complaint filed with the Commission, she stated that she began dating Superintendent Stanger in the fall of 2005. In her revised Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d), Ms. Stanger stated that she began dating Mr. Stanger in \u201cthe fall of 2004\u201d. The SOP also makes reference to Superintendent Stanger\u2019s change of status form submitted to the Respondent, indicating the Complainant \u201c\u2026and Mr. Stanger have been in a spousal relationship since January 11, 2004.\u201d\n[36] The Complainant filed the Superintendent\u2019s change of status form as an exhibit. It was also titled \u201cDependent Information\u201d and was the same form issued by both Great West Life Assurance Company and the Respondent. It indicated that Ms. Stanger was his spouse with an effective date of: \u201c2004 01 11.\u201d A related provincial health care form filed with the exhibit indicated that Superintendent Stanger\u2019s former spouse, Elizabeth, was deleted as his dependent effective November 1, 2004.\n[37] At the hearing, I attempted to sort through all of this conflicting information to clarify the dates for the record. I asked the Complainant straightforward questions. Ms. Stanger gave confusing and sometimes contradictory answers. In the end, based on the answers the Complainant provided in cross-examination, I conclude that she and Superintendent Stanger started to cohabit at some time in October of 2004.\n[38] The CHRA does not define \u201cmarital status\u201d. There has been much jurisprudence in recent years which attempts to clarify the scope of this prohibited ground. However, relatively few cases directly address the question as to what extent an unmarried couple facing discrimination based on their conjugal relationship can claim \u201cmarital status\u201d discrimination. Respondent counsel cited the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Schaap v. Canadian Armed Forces, (\u201cSchaap\u201d) 1988 CanLII 4504 (CHRT), wherein it was held that the term \u201cmarital status\u201d under the CHRA was restricted to relationships involving a legal form of marriage and could not be stretched to include the common law relationship. At issue in Schaap was whether the Canadian Armed Forces (\u201cCAF\u201d) discriminated on the basis of marital status when it denied \u201cmarried quarters\u201d to members who were involved in a common law relationship with their cohabiting partner.\n[39] However, it is important to note that that the Federal Court of Appeal overturned the Tribunal\u2019s decision in a judgment cited as: Schaap v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces) (1988) [1989] 3 F.C. 172, 12 C.H.R.R. D\/451 (C.A.) (\u201cSchaap-FCA\u201d).\n[40] The Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in Schaap-FCA is comprised of three sets of reasons, with the majority reasons issued by Hugessen and Pratte JJ.A. Hugessen J.A. commenced by noting that a common law relationship cannot \u201cfall within\u201d the definition of marital status, as a status and a relationship are two different things. Marital status, in his view, meant no more than status in the sense of \u201cmarried or not married\u201d (C.H.R.R. para. 6). He then went on to examine the more general intention of Parliament when it included \u201cmarital status\u201d\u2014as well as the other prohibited grounds of discrimination\u2014in the CHRA:\n\u2026I do not think the purpose of the human rights legislation is to favour the institution of marriage (or, for that matter, that of celibacy). On the contrary, I think the legislation, by including marital status as a prohibited ground of discrimination along with such factors as race, ethnic origin, colour, disability, and the like, is clearly saying that these are all things which are irrelevant to any of the types of decisions envisaged in ss. 5 to 10 inclusive. Those decisions are to be made on the basis of individual worth or qualities and not of group stereotypes. [para. 10]\n[41] Hugessen J.A. acknowledged the CAF\u2019s legitimate interest in only providing married quarters to employees who were involved in relationships \u201c\u2026which had a high degree of permanency and stability\u201d (para. 11). By allowing an employee to cohabitate with a person perceived to be in a special relationship with that employee, an employer ultimately fosters better morale (para.13). The flaw in the CAF\u2019s policy, however, was that it based its recognition of the value of the favoured special relationship on the status of those in it, by asking if they were married to each other:\nIn taking this approach, the policy is based on and perpetuates a stereotype, namely, that a relationship between a man and a woman has a lesser social value if it does not have the status of marriage. [para. 14]\n[42] He observed that assessments of the stability and permanency of relationships must be based on factors which actually indicated their existence, and that marriage or its absence was not determinative in this regard (para. 15).\n[43] Finally, Hugessen J.A. noted that in order to correctly appreciate the status of one person, it is frequently necessary to look at the situation of someone else:\nTo appreciate the marital status of the applicants, one must look at the situation of the people with whom they are living in a relationship of husband and wife. The applicants are not married to those people and it is that status alone which is the cause of their exclusion from obtaining the benefit of married quarters. [para. 17]\n[44] Justice Pratte commences his reasons with the statement that \u201cmarital status\u201d under the CHRA means \u201c\u2026the status of a person in relation to marriage, namely, whether that person is single, married, divorced or widowed\u201d (para. 2). He then asserts that the complainants in the Schaap-FCA case, (applicants on judicial review) were indeed victims of discrimination based on their marital status, \u201c\u2026in spite of the fact that the reason for that discrimination was not simply that the applicants were not married but, rather, that each one of them was not married to the woman with whom he was living\u2026\u201d (para. 3).\n[45] Like Justice Hugessen, Pratte J.A. acknowledges that the plain meaning approach to marital status would not seem to expressly include unmarried partners. However, both Justices ultimately recognize the viability of a \u201crelative status\u201d claim, whereby a person subjected to adverse treatment based on her cohabitation in a conjugal relationship outside marriage, could seek the protection of the CHRA. Justice Hugessen clearly arrives at this conclusion based on a purposive and contextual interpretation of the prohibited ground in question.\n[46] Together, the majority judgments in Schaap-FCA do not establish in the clearest of terms that any unmarried couple who faces discrimination under the CHRA is eligible for protection under the prohibited ground of \u201cmarital status\u201d. In Schaap-FCA, the focus was on the exclusion of unmarried couples from a benefit made available to legally married couples. However, the majority judgments at the very least establish that marital status discrimination can be a relative construct, in the sense that an individual\u2019s marital status can be determined by looking at his or her current conjugal living situation and relationship with one\u2019s partner. Moreover, unlike the Tribunal decision which it set aside, Schaap-FCA does not foreclose the possibility of a marital status claim under the CHRA from an individual who experiences adverse treatment based on her involvement in a conjugal relationship outside of marriage.\n[47] The foregoing interpretation of Schaap-FCA is buttressed by subsequent jurisprudence from courts and tribunals:\nIn Jensen v. B.C. Report Magazine Ltd. (1993), 19 C.H.R.R. D\/495 (B.C.H.R.C.), the tribunal had to construe the undefined term \u201cmarital status\u201d in the British Columbia Human Rights Act. It noted the Supreme Court\u2019s statements in O\u2019Malley, supra, regarding the special nature of human rights legislation, and the Court\u2019s rejection of the approach that \u201c\u2026no broader meaning can be given to the Code than the narrowest interpretation of the words employed.\u201d (para. 32) The tribunal then noted that in the context of other prohibited grounds of discrimination, namely \u201crace\u201d, \u201ccolour\u201d and \u201cdisability\u201d, the protection against discrimination is not limited to actual characteristics, but extends to perceived characteristics. Applying the principle to the matter at hand, it concluded that \u201c\u2026[t]he complainant, although unmarried at the time in question, had the same protection under the Act as if she were married because the respondent perceived her as married.\u201d (para. 37)\n[48] In Gipaya v. Anton's Pasta Ltd. (\u201cGipaya\u201d) (1996), 27 C.H.R.R. D\/326 (B.C.C.H.R.), the British Columbia tribunal again had to determine whether the complainant in the case was protected by the \u201cmarital status\u201d provision of the BC Human Rights Act. In holding that she was so protected, the tribunal noted that the state of being engaged to be married clearly related to or was connected with the status of marriage and could be considered \u201cmarital\u201d (para. 109). It also noted that in Supreme Court jurisprudence (O\u2019Malley, supra; Action travail des femmes v. C.N. [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114), \u201c\u2026human rights tribunals have been cautioned not to seek ways and means to minimize the proper impact of human rights legislation.\u201d Rather, a large, liberal and purposive approach to interpreting the provision in question would permit \u201c\u2026a finding that \"marital status\" includes both the status of being engaged to be married and the status of living in a relationship analogous to marriage.\u201d (Paras. 112-113).\n[49] In 502798 N.B. Inc. v. N.B. Human Rights Commission, 2008 NBQB 390 (\u201c502798 N.B. Inc.\u201d) the Court had to determine whether the ground \u201cmarital status\u201d\u2014undefined in New Brunswick\u2019s Human Rights Act\u2014applied to the relationship existing between the complainant and a colleague, who were cohabiting. The Court cited a statement in The Law of Human Rights in Canada (by the Honourable Justice Russel W. Zinn) to the effect that where there is no statutory definition to rely on, the jurisprudence has established that \u201cmarital status\u201d will be interpreted to include common law relationships (para. 39). The Court then noted the evidence given in the case from the two cohabiting individuals, that by the time of the complainant\u2019s termination, \u201c\u2026they were living as a married couple.\u201d This evidence was found to be \u201ccompletely determinative\u201d (para. 41). The Court concluded that the complainant was involved in a common law relationship that would qualify for protection on the basis of marital status (paras. 44-45).\n[50] Finally, in Canada (Attorney General) v. Johnstone, 2014 FCA 110 (\u201cJohnstone\u201d), a case concerned with the scope of the ground \u201cfamily status\u201d under the CHRA, the Federal Court of Appeal provided important guidance on how to interpret the scope of a prohibited ground. It recalled that human rights legislation must be given a broad interpretation to ensure that the stated objects and purposes of such legislation are fulfilled; a narrow restrictive interpretation that would defeat the purpose of eliminating discrimination should be avoided. The Court also noted that the key provisions of human rights legislation must be interpreted in a flexible manner and with an adaptive approach. Finally it cited the rule that human rights legislation has a unique quasi-constitutional nature and ought to be interpreted in a liberal and purposive manner in order to advance the broad policy considerations underlying it (paras. 61-63).\n[51] In Johnstone, the issue was whether the ground \u201cfamily status\u201d could include family circumstances such as childcare obligations. In holding that it did include such circumstances, the Court considered the French version of ss. 2 and 3 of the CHRA, and noted that \u201cfamily status\u201d (\u201csituation de famille\u201d) was much broader than \u201cmarital status\u201d (\u201c\u00e9tat matrimonial\u201d). However, this finding does not impact the current analysis given that the complainant in this case, Ms. Stanger, is not asserting that the marital status discrimination she experienced pertained to circumstances or obligations that were incidental to her relationship. Rather, it is the identity of her spouse that in her view is the source of the marital status discrimination.\n[52] Re-examining the Respondent\u2019s position in light of the foregoing jurisprudence, one is compelled to conclude that the CHRA\u2019s protection against marital status discrimination cannot be confined to the period commencing on the date of a legally solemnized marriage. Such a narrow and restrictive interpretation would frustrate the purposes of the CHRA, and create the absurd result whereby the termination of employees on the basis of their recent marriage would be reviewable under the CHRA, while the termination of employees on the basis of their imminent marriage would not be. The Respondent\u2019s position ignores the fact that marriage does not spontaneously come into existence without any antecedents; hence the extension of marital status protection to the engaged couples in Jensen and Gipaya.\n[53] Moreover, were the Tribunal to deny the Complainant the benefit of the CHRA protection available to married couples on the sole basis that her relationship with her unmarried partner did not qualify as a legal marriage, would it not be perpetuating the same kind of stereotypical value judgments about the worthiness, permanence and stability of unmarried relationships that were so clearly denounced by Hugessen J.A. in Schaap-FCA? I conclude it would and therefore do not find the protection against marital status discrimination to be so limited.\n[54] The Respondent\u2019s alternative position\u2014that protection against marital status discrimination only commences after one year of co-habitation\u2014is also inconsistent with the jurisprudence. To the extent this argument relies upon definitions of spousal relationships found in statutes outside the field of human rights, it must be noted that legislation passed for different purposes cannot contribute to a purposive interpretation of the CHRA: see Jensen, para. 38; and Gipaya, para. 108. Moreover, none of the authorities reviewed above have made marital status protection strictly contingent upon the sheer number of months of a couple\u2019s prior conjugal cohabitation. For that matter, the periods of cohabitation range greatly, from 4 months in Jensen to over two years for the co-complainant in Schaap.\n[55] Rather, the scope of the protection granted by the ground of marital status has been ascertained by a more qualitative assessment of the relationship in question at the relevant time. Hugessen J.A. in Schaap-FCA tacitly acknowledged that the relationship giving rise to marital status discrimination was essentially \u201ca relationship of husband and wife\u201d (para. 17). In Gipaya, the complainant, who cohabited with her colleague, had purchased a house with him, and had announced their engagement, was protected \u201c\u2026by virtue of her status of being engaged or being in a common-law spousal relationship.\u201d (Para. 115). In 502798 N.B. Inc., the human rights board of inquiry had found that the testimony of the complainant and his colleague that \u201c\u2026they were living as a married couple, without specifying particulars of their cohabitation\u2026\u201d was sufficient, and the Court endorsed the finding that they had marital status at the relevant time (paras. 6, 41-42). In Jensen, the tribunal found that the complainant was protected under the statute because the respondent perceived her as married (para. 37). The emphasis placed on perception in the Jensen case has been subsequently underscored by the Supreme Court of Canada in Qu\u00e9bec (C.D.P.D.J.) v. Montr\u00e9al 2000 SCC 27, where the Court held that the ground \u201chandicap\u201d in Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms can include both an ailment, as well as the perception of such an ailment (para. 72).\n[56] Unfortunately in this case, the parties did not make fully developed arguments about when marital status protection might commence, such as how soon after cohabitation in a conjugal relationship has started. The matter is further complicated by the conflicting dates in the evidentiary record. As such, this is not the best case in which to make a definitive determination of this question. However, for the purpose of the analysis below, I will give a broad interpretation and find that Ms. Stanger is entitled to the protection granted by the ground of marital status for events occurring after November 1, 2004.\nC. Credibility of the Complainant\n[57] For the most part, Ms. Stanger appeared to be sincere in giving her evidence. However, there were times when her answers were unclear, evasive and simply not credible. There are several specific examples:\nA) As mentioned above, Ms. Stanger provided the Tribunal with several conflicting dates regarding the commencement of her relationship with Superintendent Stanger. Even when I asked her directly to clarify the dates, it took her a very long time to give me a clear answer and she was unable to explain the reasons for the alternative dates provided;\nB) At one point, Ms. Stanger testified that she had filed two human rights complaints and that she had originally contacted the Commission in 2004 to file a complaint. After repeating this several times when being questioned about the date, she suddenly changed her testimony and stated that she had first contacted the Commission in 2008. She also stated that she filed two complaints with the Commission that were later amalgamated although I did not see any evidence of that;\nC) During her cross examination by the Respondent, Ms. Stanger was asked to confirm when she had booked her holidays in Hawaii, which took place from February 9 to 26, 2008, during which trip she legally married Superintendent Stanger. The upcoming CLDP course (discussed in detail below) ran from February 25-28, 2008, conflicting with the dates of Ms. Stanger\u2019s wedding plans. The questions about when she booked the holiday related to whether she already knew at the time of applying for the CLDP that she was unavailable to attend the course due to her wedding plans. I found Ms. Stanger to be rather evasive when questioned about when she booked the trip to Hawaii. She stated repeatedly that she did not know when she booked the trip to Hawaii, and she would also not concede that she must have requested the time off work at least one or two months in advance. To this and several like questions, she replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I found her answers not to be credible because she applied for the CLDP merely 17 days prior to her departure to Hawaii for her wedding. She also testified that her honeymoon cruise, departing several weeks later, had been booked several weeks prior to her wedding date;\nD) As will be discussed in detail below, Ms. Stanger testified that her former spouse, Patrick Gibbons, had deliberately followed her at work while he was driving a forklift. Ms. Stanger described him as \u201cchasing\u201d her in the forklift and being \u201cvery aggressive\u201d towards her. Mr. Gibbons testified and completely denied the allegation. Ms. Stanger also testified that she had reported the incident to a Supervisor, Brad Harrison. Mr. Harrison was called as a witness by the Respondent and denied any memory of the incident. He also testified that the allegation would have been considered very serious, if true, and that he certainly would have followed up on it. There were no written reports or any other evidence presented at the hearing indicating that this event occurred as described by Ms. Stanger; and,\nE) As will be discussed in detail below, one of Ms. Stanger\u2019s allegations involved an exchange she had with a co-worker named Pam Cromwell. Ms. Cromwell was later reprimanded by Superintendent Stanger, and thereafter Ms. Stanger alleges she was subjected to an act of reprisal by Ms. Cromwell. Ultimately, Superintendent Stanger wrote an email to Manager Sherry Aiken in which he suggested Ms. Cromwell was connected to the alleged reprisal. Notwithstanding that Ms. Stanger was then living with him, she denied ever having spoken to Superintendent Stanger about the reprisal and suggesting that Ms. Cromwell was responsible for this alleged act. This was explored during Ms. Stanger\u2019s cross-examination and I did not find her denial to be credible.\n[58] Many of the events discussed at the hearing happened several years prior. It is possible for memories to fade and for mistakes to be made. However, the above-noted instances caused me to have concerns about the Complainant\u2019s credibility such that I was unable to accept her evidence about certain key controversial incidents without cogent corroborative evidence. (See Cassidy v. Canada Post et al. 2012 CHRT 29 para. 27).\n[59] I make the foregoing observations having due regard to the principles of credibility assessment, as expressed in Faryna v. Chorny [1952] 2 D.L.R. 354 (B.C.C.A.):\nThe credibility of interested witness, particularly in cases of conflict of evidence, cannot be gauged solely by the test of whether the personal demeanour of the particular witness carried conviction of the truth. The test must reasonably subject his story to an examination of its consistency with the probabilities that surround the currently existing conditions. In short, the real test of the truth of the story of a witness in such a case must be its harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions.\" [See also: Cassidy v. Canada Post et al. 2012 CHRT 29, paras.25-26]\nVII. Section 7 Allegations of Discrimination related to Marital Status\nA. Denial of Career Leadership Development Program Participation\ni) Background and Facts\n[60] At the time Ms. Stanger worked at VicMPP, there was a recruitment program offered by Canada Post called the Career Leadership Development Program (\u201cCLDP\u201d). Canada Post employees, mainly members of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (\u201cCUPW\u201d), were often assessed through this program for consideration for promotion to supervisory positions. The CLDP was developed in an attempt to bring some objectivity into the assessment of employees wishing to move up to these supervisory positions. The program was run periodically in anticipation of staffing needs, and it was usually run once or twice per year in the Pacific region. Employees interested in applying to attend the CLDP were required to have their Team Leader complete a Recommendation Form and then have it signed by their local Manager. If a particular CLDP session was over-subscribed, the surplus applicants were usually put on a waiting list to attend the next CLDP session that was offered.\n[61] Ms. Stanger testified that she had applied for the CLDP session in Vancouver, scheduled for late February of 2008. The deadline for the application submission was January 22, 2008. The Manager at VicMPP was Ms. Sherri Aiken, and it was her signature of approval that was required on Ms. Stanger\u2019s Recommendation Form.\n[62] The Recommendation Form for the CLDP was tendered as an exhibit at the hearing. Ms. Aiken checked the box to decline the approval, signed and dated the form, and then wrote the following in the comment section:\nJessica would potentially be a good candidate if her personal situation was different or if she were to work in another facility. Her husband is shift #3 operations superintendent and there is a high likelihood of conflict of interest. Recommend review with HPM expertise to determine best next steps for Jessica to pursue her career advancement.\n[63] Ms. Aiken testified that she had a meeting with Ms. Stanger on or about January 22, 2008, to discuss her concerns about a possible conflict of interest. According to Ms. Aiken, the CLDP was usually run when there were specific vacancies that needed to be filled. It was Ms. Aiken\u2019s understanding that the only supervisor position available in Victoria at that time was a position that would put her into a direct conflict of interest situation with her spouse, Superintendent Stanger.\n[64] There was conflicting testimony about whether or not Ms. Stanger had indicated at that meeting her willingness to relocate to a different town in order to avoid the conflict with her spouse. In her direct examination, Ms. Stanger said that during the January 22, 2008, meeting, she had asked Ms. Aiken about the availability of positions elsewhere on Vancouver Island. Under cross-examination, Ms. Stanger indicated she had been willing at that time to relocate anywhere in BC, even to places as far away as Fort St. John, even though she would have to bear the relocation cost and notwithstanding her then imminent marriage to Superintendent Stanger three weeks later.\n[65] In her direct testimony, Ms. Aiken recalled that she had told Ms. Stanger there were no other supervisory positions available at the time on Vancouver Island. Ms. Aiken testified that she asked Ms. Stanger if she would be willing to relocate to Vancouver, where there were several positions available. According to Ms. Aiken, Ms. Stanger said no. Ms. Aiken went on to testify that if Ms. Stanger had been willing to relocate to the mainland, she would have approved the Recommendation Form without hesitation. Ms. Aiken testified she was positive about Ms. Stanger\u2019s position on relocation, because her subsequent correspondence with Human Resources officers focused specifically on Ms. Stanger\u2019s unwillingness to relocate. (In an email dated February 4, 2008, Ms. Aiken wrote to the responsible Human Resources Officer in Vancouver, Colleen McKenzie, about her conversation with the Complainant as follows: \u201cI did speak to her about her mobility and she is not interested in a position outside of Victoria.\u201d)\n[66] Ms. Aiken\u2019s testimony provided further clues about her motivation, as she testified that it would be an unwise expenditure for Canada Post to send Ms. Stanger on the CLDP assessment, specifically because Ms. Stanger had not indicated a willingness to relocate to avoid a possible conflict of interest in the future.\n[67] After Ms. Aiken declined to approve the Recommendation Form, Ms. Stanger submitted her application for the CLDP directly to Ms. Colleen McKenzie, the responsible Human Resources Officer in Vancouver. In an email dated January 28, 2008, Ms. McKenzie advised Ms. Aiken that she had consulted with Canada Post\u2019s human rights officer, Ms. Roxanne Ayers, and that it was Ms. Ayers\u2019 advice that Ms. Stanger could not be denied the opportunity to apply for the CLDP based on her marital status. Ms. McKenzie recommended that Ms. Aiken approve the Recommendation Form, and if Ms. Stanger was a successful candidate at the CLDP, she could go on a waiting list for a position that would not be reporting to her husband.\n[68] A subsequent email, dated February 5, 2008, was sent to Ms. Aiken by Mr. John Scott, then Acting Director of HPM (Human Performance Management) - Pacific Region. Mr. Scott wrote the following advice to Ms. Aiken:\nDenying an opportunity that would result in a conflict of interest as per our policy is appropriate.\n[69] Mr. Scott went on in his email to advise Ms. Aiken of the following, regarding the application for a seat at the CLDP program:\nHaving said all that, my belief is that if you believe that she is a good candidate for supervisor (aside from the conflict issue) you can complete the recommendation. The normal step would be that when we select who gets the seats we base it on where there are existing opportunities. If there are no opportunities except where the conflict exists and if she has noted that she is unwilling to relocate, then she would not get one of the seats based on that.\nThe decision is based on our conflict policy and not her marital status. There is significant case law to support this interpretation.\n[70] Based on the advice she received, Ms. Aiken reversed her decision. At a meeting in early March of 2008, after Ms. Stanger returned to work following her trip to Hawaii, Ms. Aiken advised Ms. Stanger that she had approved her application to attend the CLDP, and that Ms. Stanger was now on a waiting list to attend the next CLDP session, whenever it was announced. Unfortunately, Canada Post later decided to cancel the CLDP program and, as such, Ms. Stanger\u2019s application was never considered. Canada Post had decided to contract with an external company to run the process for supervisor recruitment. The CLDP session at the end of February 2008, was the last such program to be run in the Pacific Region.\n[71] Ms. Aiken testified that it was not immediately apparent to her that Ms. Stanger was disappointed by missing the CLDP session. A letter of apology from Ms. Aiken to Ms. Stanger dated April 6, 2009, was tendered as an exhibit at the hearing. In the letter, Ms. Aiken explained that she only became aware of the anxiety she had caused Ms. Stanger in denying the CLDP recommendation when the latter filed a human rights complaint. Ms. Aiken wrote the letter to Ms. Stanger to offer her apology and to confirm that Ms. Stanger was still on a waiting list should the CLDP session be offered again.\nii) Prima facie Case of Discrimination Established\n[72] While there is conflicting testimony about was what actually said at the January 22 meeting, the conflict has no bearing on the question of whether a prima facie case has been established. In my view, Ms. Stanger presented uncontroverted evidence proving a prima facie case of discrimination based on her marital status.\n[73] As I held earlier, Ms. Stanger has established that since November 2004 she was in a conjugal relationship with Mr. Stanger that was protected by the ground of marital status. In the context of the current allegation, her manifestation of the protected characteristic was evinced by the fact that she was engaged to be married in a few weeks.\n[74] Secondly, Ms. Stanger has proven that she was differentiated adversely when her CLDP recommendation was not approved. While I have doubts about whether Ms. Stanger actually planned to attend the CLDP session in late February, conflicting as it did with her wedding plans, the fact remains that Ms. Stanger was denied access to a significant employment opportunity (CHRA, s. 2). It is possible that when Ms. Stanger applied for the CLDP, she simply forgot or was not aware that it conflicted with her wedding plans. In any event, it is not necessary to speculate what Ms. Stanger might have done if she had been accepted to the February 2008 CLDP session. As it turned out, the CLDP program was never offered again. As such, I conclude the CLDP denial had an adverse impact upon her.\n[75] Lastly, Ms. Stanger has demonstrated that the Respondent differentiated adversely based on her marital status. The reasons given on the Recommendation Form show that Ms. Aiken\u2019s perception of Ms. Stanger\u2019s spousal relationship with Superintendent Stanger (referring to him as \u201cher husband\u201d) was a factor in the decision to deny her the opportunity to participate in the CLDP session. Ms. Aiken\u2019s testimony corroborates this fact.\n[76] For the foregoing reasons, I find that the three constituent elements of prima facie discrimination have been proven on a balance of probabilities. (See Bombardier, supra.)\niii) Justification for Discrimination\n[77] Once a prima facie case has been proven on a balance of probabilities, it is incumbent on the respondent to justify the discriminatory actions taken (Bombardier, paras. 36-38, 61).\n[78] Section 15(1)(a) of the CHRA provides an exception to discrimination in circumstances where an employer establishes that the impugned actions were based on a bona fide occupational requirement:\nIt is not a discriminatory practice if\u2026\n(a) any refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement;\n[\u2026]\n[79] Section 15(2) of the CHRA imposes a burden on a respondent relying on s. 15(1)(a) to demonstrate that it would be an \u201cundue hardship\u201d to accommodate the needs of the individuals affected, considering health, safety and cost.\n[80] Section 15(2) must be read in conjunction with the findings of the Supreme Court of Canada in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, 1999 CanLII 652 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 (\u201cMeiorin\u201d). In Meiorin, the Supreme Court articulated a three-step test for determining whether \u2026 a given standard is a bona fide occupational requirement. The Court states, at para. 54, that an employer may justify the impugned standard by establishing on the balance of probabilities:\na. that the employer adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job;\nb. that the employer adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfilment of that legitimate work-related purpose; and\nc. that the standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that legitimate work-related purpose. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, it must be demonstrated that it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship upon the employer.\n[81] The Respondent did not put forward a formal bona fide occupational requirement (\u201cBFOR\u201d) defense for the CLDP incident. The actual conflict of interest policy of Canada Post was not in issue. In this case, the actual impugned standard was Ms. Aiken\u2019s premature refusal of the CLDP recommendation, based on her perception that admission to the Program would inevitably put Ms. Stanger into a conflict of interest predicament.\n[82] Although the parties believed much turned on the question of Ms. Stanger\u2019s willingness to relocate, I am not as convinced. I do not find that there was a BFOR to deny the approval of the Recommendation Form. A decision to approve the CLDP Recommendation would not have immediately given rise to a real or potential conflict of interest based on Ms. Stanger\u2019s marital status. It related only to Ms. Stanger\u2019s ability to attend an assessment session, after which she might possibly have been considered for a supervisor position.\n[83] On the evidence before me, it could not be established that Ms. Aiken\u2019s refusal, in the circumstances of the present case, constituted a BFOR. The Respondent led no evidence indicating that Ms. Stanger could not have been accommodated by approving the CLDP and managing the conflict of interest if and when it arose. The correspondence of Mr. Scott submitted into evidence clearly indicated that the Respondent could have accommodated the CLPD request, and indeed recommended that course of action.\n[84] Ms. Stanger\u2019s attendance at the February 2008 session of the CLDP course would not have put her into an immediate conflict of interest situation. As such, it was not reasonably necessary, for the accomplishment of the purpose of conflict of interest avoidance, to impose a blanket prohibition on her attendance at the CLDP session because of her marital status.\n[85] It is understandable that Ms. Aiken, as a responsible manager, did not want to squander corporate resources if there was, in her view, no possible way the CLDP attendance could lead to career advancement for Ms. Stanger. However, as Ms. Aiken\u2019s colleagues pointed out, approving the recommendation to attend the CLDP session did not in and of itself place Ms. Stanger into a conflict of interest situation. It was within the realm of possibility that Ms. Stanger might not have been favourably assessed at the CLDP session, or even given a seat, as was suggested by Mr. Scott. If either of these two things had happened, any potential conflict of interest problem would have been averted.\n[86] Ms. Aiken\u2019s motivation for declining Ms. Stanger\u2019s application may have been based on her perception of the proper way to implement the conflict policy of Canada Post. However, as Mr. Scott points out above, the conflict would not have arisen just because Ms. Stanger\u2019s CLDP recommendation was approved. Mr. Scott\u2019s advice to Ms. Aiken was for her to approve the CLDP recommendation and let the conflict policy be applied later.\n[87] Canada Post should be commended for quickly realizing their error and they immediately took action to reverse Ms. Aiken\u2019s decision not to approve the CLDP recommendation form. However the effect of this decision, once taken, could not be reversed.\niv) Allegation of Discrimination Substantiated\n[88] Although they reversed their position, Ms. Stanger has satisfied me that Canada Post did initially discriminate against her on the ground of marital status when Ms. Aiken declined the CLDP recommendation because of her marriage to Superintendent Stanger. Furthermore, Canada Post has not established on a balance of probabilities that accommodation of Ms. Stanger\u2019s marital status in this instance would have caused it undue hardship.\nv) Remedy\n[89] As this is the only part of Ms. Stanger\u2019s complaint that is substantiated, I will address the issue of remedy at this point in the decision. Upon a finding that the Complaint or a portion thereof is substantiated, section 53 of the CHRA authorizes the Tribunal to make an order against a respondent, providing for compensation and other forms of redress. At the hearing, Ms. Stanger did not come prepared with submissions or documentary evidence related to her claimed financial losses. Respondent counsel suggested that the hearing be bifurcated, and that any evidence and submissions on damages could be presented if and when the Tribunal found liability. The parties and the Tribunal agreed to the bifurcation.\n[90] The Tribunal\u2019s Registry will contact the parties to inform them of the schedule for filing documentary evidence and argument on the issue of remedy. I will give this material due consideration, along with any relevant evidence that was already received at the hearing. It was conceded by the Complainant in her final argument that even if she had attended the CLDP, there was no guarantee that she would have been selected to receive an offer of a supervisor position. The CLDP was merely a tool to assess interested candidates. In preparing their submissions, it will be important for the parties to bear in mind the specific provisions of s. 53, and also, the extent to which they require a causal link between the discriminatory practice and the loss claimed. (See e.g. Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 268, (\u201cChopra\u201d) para. 37.)\n[91] Moreover, the parties should address the question of whether, and if so, to what extent, the Tribunal should apply the doctrine of mitigation of losses to any claim for compensation. (See Chopra, para. 40.) Naturally, the parties are free to refer to any additional legal authorities they deem relevant to the remedial claim in this case.\nB. Removal from Version 2 Duties\n[92] Ms. Stanger testified that she had been assigned Version 2 work because it was within her PPD limitations. It involved several hours of paperwork each month connected with the mail-out of provincial welfare cheques. According to Ms. Stanger, in early 2008, her supervisor, Mr. Michael Yaromy, told her she would no longer be doing this work, and that she needed to train her replacement right away. Furthermore, she alleged other employees had the perception that she was allowed to do Version 2 work as a perk for being in a marital relationship with Superintendent Stanger. I asked Ms. Stanger specifically if she was removed from the Version 2 work and she replied affirmatively.\n[93] Mr. Yaromy testified that he did not recall that Ms. Stanger was ever removed from performing the Version 2 duties. He did not receive any complaints from any other workers about Ms. Stanger performing these duties, nor did he hear anyone say it was considered to be a perk. Mr. Yaromy agreed that Ms. Stanger would have been asked to train other employees to do the Version 2 work, but this was to ensure that other employees would be available to do the work if Ms. Stanger was away or otherwise unable to perform this work.\n[94] In the cross-examination of Mr. Yaromy, a question was asked of him asserting that Ms. Stanger had testified that she was removed from Version 2 duties. However, Mr. Yaromy was not asked if Ms. Stanger was actually removed from these duties or if he ever told her that she would be. I find the omission of these two questions in the cross-examination to be somewhat telling.\n[95] I prefer the evidence of Mr. Yaromy because it is more consistent and logical. Ms. Stanger gave very brief oral evidence in chief, whereas Mr. Yaromy answered several questions on the subject. Moreover, when I asked Ms. Stanger specifically whether it happened that she was actually removed from Version 2 duties, she replied affirmatively, but in a rather vague manner and then changed the subject. I am not convinced that Ms. Stanger was ever removed from performing the Version 2 duties. She may have been asked to train other employees, but she has not satisfied me that she was permanently removed from performing this task and therefore suffered adverse differential treatment. Moreover, contrary to her Statement of Particulars, none of the evidence, including her own testimony, suggests a connection between any alleged removal of duties and her disability. Her claim about the perceptions of other employees, if anything, suggests a connection to the ground of marital status, which is why this allegation is addressed here. However, I do not find Ms. Stanger has proven the existence of these perceptions by merely stating they existed.\nVIII. Section 7 Allegations of Discrimination related to Disability\n[96] Ms. Stanger alleges that certain job duties that she was capable of performing were taken away from her because of her disability. According to Ms. Stanger, these duties were taken from her as a result of complaints from co-workers about her PPD status. As such, she alleges, this constituted adverse differentiation under section 7(b) of the CHRA.\n[97] In 2004, upon her completion of the graduated return to work program, Ms. Stanger was assigned to the Number 3 shift in the Communication A section at VicMPP. Each shift section consisted of approximately 16 employees, and there were 13 specific work activities to be performed by each section. For the purposes of this decision, all the different job duties do not need to be described in detail. However, the main duties are commonly referred to by these names: A\/Os; No Codes; Bag Revision; Version 2; EFM; O\u2019Cull; and, DRS.\n[98] The workers in her section were rotated into different duties, usually every two hours. Every week, a duty rotation would be posted so that each worker in the shift knew what duties they would be performing each day. Ms. Stanger\u2019s supervisor, Mr. Yaromy, gave evidence that much effort was required to schedule a rotation of productive duties for Ms. Stanger because of the limitations under her PPD status.\n[99] Over the course of the hearing, much evidence was given about each of the specific duties and the physical efforts required to perform them. Ms. Stanger testified that she was accommodated by Canada Post from 2004 until late 2007- early 2008. Ms. Stanger testified that during that period, she performed Bag Revision, A\/Os, O\u2019Cull, Version 2, EFM and No Codes. Some parts of these duties, such as bag dumping while on O\u2019Cull, were not performed by Ms. Stanger because of her limitations.\n[100] Ms. Stanger testified that starting in late 2007, certain co-workers made complaints to her and others about her physical limitations. These complaints, alleges Ms. Stanger, led to her being removed from certain rotation duties by her supervisor, Mr. Yaromy, and another supervisor, Ms. Paula Sylvester.\nA. Randy Bourke and Norma Chin Incidents\n[101] Ms. Stanger gave evidence about being removed from A\/O work twice in late 2007, when her work shift overlapped for an hour or so with the graveyard shift at VicMPP. On one evening, Ms. Stanger was performing A\/Os in the Dock 3 area that was also occupied by a graveyard shift worker, Mr. Randy Bourke. According to Ms. Stanger, Mr. Bourke told her that this A\/O work was for his shift only, so she returned to Mr. Yaromy who then assigned her to Bag Revision. She testified that Mr. Bourke was very angry and told her to get out of the Dock 3 area. Ms. Stanger accused Mr. Yaromy of not dealing with the situation.\n[102] About a week later, Ms. Stanger testified, she was back at Dock 3 again to do A\/Os when another employee, Ms. Norma Chin, told her that A\/Os were assigned to Ms. Chin because it was the work of the graveyard shift. According to Ms. Stanger, she complained to Mr. Yaromy and he told her to do something else instead.\n[103] Neither Mr. Bourke nor Ms. Chin were called as witnesses. However, Mr. Yaromy was called as a witness by the Respondent and gave his evidence in chief, cross-examination and re-direct testimony by affidavit, as he was unable to attend the hearing. Mr. Yaromy recalled Ms. Stanger complaining about Mr. Bourke asking her to leave the Dock 3 area. He had no recollection about a complaint involving Ms. Chin.\n[104] According to Mr. Yaromy, after Ms. Stanger complained about Mr. Bourke, he sought out the Dock 3 Supervisor, Dave Diertens, to get clarification. Mr. Diertens informed Mr. Yaromy that the A\/Os was a scheduled assignment for the Dock 3 graveyard shift workers. This had to be respected and, as such, he testified that he probably would have asked Ms. Stanger to return to a different job duty that she could perform based on her PPD limitations.\n[105] I accept Ms. Stanger\u2019s testimony that these events with the Dock 3 workers did occur. However, Ms. Stanger has failed to demonstrate that the re-assignment of work had anything to do with her disability. It seems clear on the evidence that Ms. Stanger was asked to leave the Dock 3 area because the A\/O work belonged to a different shift that was tasked with working in that area. Therefore, since Ms. Stanger has not proven on a balance of probabilities that there was a connection between the treatment she experienced and a prohibited ground of discrimination, I do not find the allegations involving Mr. Bourke and Ms. Chin are substantiated.\nB. Joanne Cook Incident\n[106] Ms. Stanger testified that she was permanently removed from performing No Codes after an incident involving one of her co-workers, Ms. Joanne Cook. In late 2007, Ms. Stanger was assigned to work on No Codes, which involved looking up postal codes at a desk. Ms. Stanger saw an empty desk against a wall and decided to sit there to work on this rotation. Ms. Stanger testified that Ms. Cook approached her and said, \u201cYou have to leave.\u201d Ms. Cook allegedly then added, with anger in her voice, \u201cI might hurt you if you sit there.\u201d Ms. Stanger then testified, \u201cAnd I felt threatened when she told me that she was going to hit me. I felt threatened by that.\u201d I asked Ms. Stanger, \u201cDid she use these words?\u201d Ms. Stanger replied \u201cYes\u201d. I asked again, to clarify, \u201cShe said she was going to hit you?\u201d Ms. Stanger then altered her testimony and said that Ms. Cook might have said, \u201cI could hit you if you sit there.\u201d\n[107] I further asked Ms. Stanger to clarify what she thought Ms. Cook meant when she said \u201chit\u201d. Ms. Stanger replied that she understood that to mean being hit with a box or something else heavy. In my view, this is a departure from her earlier testimony where Ms. Stanger used the phrase, \u201cshe was going to hit me\u201d to imply Ms. Cook threatened to strike her. I believe Ms. Stanger deliberately exaggerated those words to give that impression.\n[108] In any event, Ms. Stanger said she felt threatened by Ms. Cook\u2019s comments, and so she complained to her supervisor, Mr. Yaromy. She told Mr. Yaromy she felt threatened by Ms. Cook and she asked him to speak to her. Mr. Yaromy did not immediately speak to Ms. Cook; he told Ms. Stanger to do something else instead. Ms. Stanger said this made her feel abandoned. She testified that she never did No Codes again. Ms. Stanger presented this story as an example of discrimination based on her PPD status, and of not being accommodated, by removing a work rotation from her schedule.\n[109] The Respondent called Ms. Cook as a witness. Ms. Cook recalled the interaction with Ms. Stanger which stood out in her memory because it only happened once. According to Ms. Cook, she was not angry, and she merely asked Ms. Stanger to leave the workspace at the desk because there was not enough room for two people to work there at once. Furthermore, this was Ms. Cook\u2019s regular work space for doing No Codes look-ups. Shortly after the conversation with Ms. Stanger, Superintendent Stanger showed up in Ms. Cook\u2019s office, and before she could say anything, he asked her if she had a problem working with people. According to Ms. Cook, she explained to Superintendent Stanger that there was not enough room for two people, and that the area was a \u201csteel-toe\u201d area of the workplace, making it more dangerous. Ms. Cook denied that she was angry, and she denied saying that she could hurt Ms. Stanger if Ms. Stanger worked there.\n[110] Mr. Yaromy also testified about the incident with Ms. Cook. He recalled Ms. Stanger complaining about it, so he went to talk to Ms. Cook directly. Ms. Cook explained to him that she said that it was possible Ms. Stanger could get hurt accidentally if she was at that particular desk while Ms. Cook and her shift co-workers occasionally used it. Mr. Yaromy observed that Ms. Cook was mildly upset over the incident, but he did not agree that she was angry. Mr. Yaromy also testified that after this incident, Superintendent Stanger placed a desk at the far end of the Multi-Line Optical Character Reader (MLOCR) area, and at this location, Ms. Stanger continued to work on No Codes.\n[111] I prefer the evidence of Ms. Cook and Mr. Yaromy about this incident. I find that Ms. Stanger exaggerated her account of this conversation and then altered her testimony as I questioned her. On the other hand, the testimony of Mr. Yaromy and Ms. Cook was more consistent. Ms. Cook merely asked Ms. Stanger to work in a different location. This is not adverse differentiation. She may have been short and terse in her conversation, but based on the evidence, I do not conclude that Ms. Cook threatened Ms. Stanger. Although it is not determinative, there was no evidence that Ms. Cook even knew that Ms. Stanger had PPD limitations. I also conclude that Ms. Stanger was not immediately and thereafter prevented from performing the No Codes job rotation. Mr. Yaromy\u2019s evidence was very clear that Superintendent Stanger had provided a desk to Ms. Stanger for that very purpose and thereafter she continued to perform that job rotation. The complainant has not substantiated this part of her complaint. I would add that none of the evidence presented on this allegation, including the Complainant's own testimony, indicated any connection between, on the one hand, Ms. Cook\u2019s conduct and the alleged reassignment, and on the other, the Complainant\u2019s disability.\nC. Removal from O\u2019Cull Duties\n[112] Ms. Stanger also testified that in early 2008 she was removed from the O\u2019Cull rotation. This rotation involves dumping bags of mail and sorting the individual pieces. The Tribunal was told that every thirty minutes, the four employees on the O\u2019Cull rotation would rotate so that each would take a 30 minute turn at the bag dumping, which was more strenuous work. Ms. Stanger testified that she had worked on the O\u2019Cull rotation, but had been exempted from the bag dumping part. Ms. Stanger said that Mr. Yaromy pulled her from the O\u2019Cull rotation because other employees were complaining about her PPD status.\n[113] Mr. Yaromy testified that around early 2008, the O\u2019Cull rotation was modified to reduce the number of employees from 4 to 3 on each rotation. This meant that able-bodied employees rotated more frequently into the position that dumped the mail bags onto the sorting belt. As Ms. Stanger was unable to perform the bag dumping, she was removed from the rotation at this time. According to Mr. Yaromy, this was the only time he recalled Ms. Stanger being removed from a job duty. In this case, the decision was not made only by him, but it was also endorsed by two other supervisors, a superintendent and the plant manager. The decision was made for health and safety reasons, not because of other co-workers complaining about Ms. Stanger\u2019s PPD status.\n[114] Mr. Yaromy testified that he once heard from an employee complaining about \u201cpicking up the slack\u201d for PPD status employees. However, the comment was made generally, not in relation to Ms. Stanger. Mr. Yaromy also testified that Ms. Stanger once complained to him that co-workers were treating her unkindly. However, he did not recall Ms. Stanger saying it was in relation to her PPD or marital status.\n[115] Ms. Stanger has not convinced me that her removal from the O\u2019Cull rotation was an adverse differential treatment. The removal of duties for health and safety reasons is not adverse treatment per se. Ms. Stanger has not proven that such action was \u201churtful, harmful or hostile\u201d within the meaning of Tahmourpour vs. Attorney General for Canada (2010 FCA 192, para. 12). Further, the broader legislative scheme recognizes that good faith measures taken on account of health and safety are not discriminatory. (See CHRA ss. 15(1)(a), 15(2)). There was satisfactory evidence that the rotation had changed to reduce one employee and create additional physical burden in relation to bag dumping.\nIX. Section 14 Allegations of Harassment related to Marital Status\n[116] Ms. Stanger alleges that she was harassed in the workplace by fellow employees because of her marital status, namely her common-law and later legal marriage to VicMPP Superintendent, Patrick Stanger. According to Ms. Stanger, there were a series of events from 2005 to 2008 that constituted harassment on the ground of marital status in matters related to employment, under section 14(1)(c) of the CHRA. Each of the alleged events will be addressed below.\nA. Guy Labine Grievance \u2013 Harassment Relating to Work Break Schedule\n[117] Ms. Stanger alleges that she was harassed in the workplace on or about February 7, 2006 by her supervisor, Guy Labine, when he mentioned her personal relationship with Patrick Stanger in front of co-workers on the shop floor. She testified she felt embarrassed and bullied when he suggested aloud there was a perception on the floor that she was receiving preferential treatment regarding her break times because of the relationship. This incident gave rise to a formal grievance filed by Ms. Stanger dated February 15, 2006.\n[118] According to Ms. Stanger, Mr. Labine spoke to her in the company of two shop stewards, Sue Robinet and Betty Kristofferson, about her break schedule. Mr. Labine asked her to be consistent about which lunch break (earlier or later) she would be taking. According to Ms. Stanger, it made no difference to her, and she was ready to take whatever break made the most sense given her PPD limitations. Ms. Stanger said she felt \u201cganged up\u201d on at this meeting, and she claimed that the shop stewards were not there to represent her interests. She said she felt angry and highly upset. Mr. Labine told her to take her lunch on the early break time.\n[119] Mr. Labine was called as a witness by the Respondent to testify about the incident and the complaints about Ms. Stanger\u2019s break times. Mr. Labine was employed as an Acting Supervisor at VicMPP in 2006, and was the immediate supervisor of the Complainant at that time. In turn, Mr. Labine reported to Superintendent Stanger.\n[120] Mr. Labine gave background information relating to this incident. The evening shift was divided into two groups and each had its own designated half-hour lunch break. The lunch breaks were to be strictly observed so that rotations could continue in an orderly manner. Mr. Labine testified that it was possible that Ms. Stanger might occasionally, because of her PPD status, have been asked to switch her break time. In late 2005, Ms. Sue Savoy, one of Ms. Stanger\u2019s co-workers, and two shop stewards, Sue Robinet and Betty Kristofferson, spoke to Mr. Labine to complain about Ms. Stanger\u2019s break times. Their complaint was two-fold: Ms. Stanger did not appear to be taking her lunch break in accordance with the schedule of either group; and, Ms. Stanger was very often taking more than the allotted 30 minutes for her lunch break. Neither party called Ms. Robinet or Ms. Kristofferson as witnesses. However, the Respondent called Ms. Savoy as a witness and her evidence is discussed below in another section of this decision. Moreover, Mr. Labine testified that he told Ms. Stanger there was a perception she was getting preferential treatment because of her relationship with Superintendent Stanger, and that he was advised this by Ms. Savoy and the shop stewards.\n[121] Mr. Labine testified that he observed Ms. Stanger\u2019s lunch breaks for a few weeks thereafter, and concluded the complaints were well-founded. Ms. Stanger did not appear to be following the regular schedule of either work group, and she returned from her breaks often 10 to 20 minutes late. He also observed that on many days, she took her lunch break with Mr. Stanger, and they returned to the work-place at the same time.\n[122] Mr. Labine also gave evidence concerning Canada Post\u2019s card swipe system, which was used to keep track of employee attendance. Each employee had a card that they were required to swipe through a reader to record the time they entered the shop floor, the time they departed for breaks, the time they returned from breaks, and the time they left at the end of their shift. The computer system would generate a report based on the swipes. However, if an employee failed to swipe their card, either upon an entry or a departure from the shop floor, an error report would be generated. The Supervisor would be required to override the system and input a time to correct the error. A Supervisor had to make such corrections, if required, at the end of each shift.\n[123] Mr. Labine observed that many times, Ms. Stanger failed to swipe her card when taking her breaks. This forced him to override the system and input a time for the missing swipe, usually for the departure or return from her lunch break. He mentioned that he had to fix Ms. Stanger\u2019s missing swipes several times per week.\n[124] Mr. Labine decided to escalate the issue one level higher. It was a delicate situation, Mr. Labine testified, because taking the issue one level higher would mean taking it to his direct boss, who was Superintendent Stanger. Although he felt uncomfortable, Mr. Labine thought if he mentioned the problem to Mr. Stanger, the matter would resolve itself. Mr. Labine did not mention the extended break times to Mr. Stanger, just that the Complainant was taking her lunch breaks erratically. Mr. Labine asked if the Superintendent could request the Complainant to conform to the appropriate break schedule, and to ensure she swiped her card each time.\n[125] At the hearing, Mr. Labine stressed how clearly he remembered Mr. Stanger\u2019s response to his request, because the reaction was totally unexpected. According to Mr. Labine, the Superintendent replied that he did not think it would be a good idea for Mr. Labine to request that the Superintendent speak with Ms. Stanger. Mr. Labine testified that he was quite taken aback at the response, because he thought Mr. Stanger would have been more congenial about it.\n[126] Mr. Labine recalled that another supervisor, Mr. Bob Tischert, also observed the same problem with Ms. Stanger\u2019s breaks. Prior to Mr. Labine\u2019s conversation with Ms. Stanger, both Mr. Tischert and he had gone to see the VicMPP Manager, Sherri Aiken. Mr. Labine advised that he took the Dynamic List Display, a computer generated list of employee card swipes, to show Ms. Aiken some proof of the problem.\n[127] Two similar Dynamic List Display records were admitted into evidence at the hearing. The first one showed Ms. Stanger\u2019s swipe records having been changed by Mr. Stanger twice on January 30, 2006. Mr. Labine described Mr. Stanger\u2019s actions as \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cabnormal\u201d, because it was the responsibility of a Supervisor, not a Superintendent, to fix any errors in the Dynamic List Display record. The second record showed that Mr. Stanger had altered Ms. Stanger\u2019s swipe record 45 times between 2005 and 2008.\n[128] As the situation was ongoing, Mr. Labine testified that he decided to have a conversation with Ms. Stanger about her break times. This led to the conversation on the shop floor in the presence of the two shop stewards, Ms. Robinet and Ms. Kristofferson. Mr. Labine asked Ms. Stanger to be consistent about which group\u2019s break she would be taking, and he mentioned that her behaviour regarding her breaks had raised a perception amongst some of her co-workers that she was receiving preferential treatment because of her relationship with the Superintendent. Mr. Labine related that he had been trained to address work floor conflicts, and that therefore he spoke to her in a business-like, professional and calm manner, presenting her with the facts as he knew them. Mr. Labine described the reaction of Ms. Stanger as \u201chighly animated and belligerent\u201d. He testified that he tried to diffuse the situation on the shop floor because he didn\u2019t like the sudden outburst of emotion. Mr. Labine testified that he immediately made the decision to no longer deal with the problem, as he felt it was beyond his jurisdiction to impose any discipline. He said he decided to just report it again to the Manager, Sherri Aiken, which he did.\n[129] After the conversation on the shop floor, Ms. Stanger filed a union grievance against Mr. Labine, alleging she \u201c\u2026was embarrassed in front of co-workers by supervisor Guy Labine by his referring to the Grievor going out with supervisor Pat Stanger several times and mentioning that there is a perception that the Grievor is receiving preferential treatment.\u201d\n[130] Mr. Labine testified that he was quite shocked and upset to find that a grievance had been filed against him. He mentioned having had a lengthy career in the unionized private courier industry, and never having had a grievance filed against him before. He was particularly upset at the time because he was merely an Acting Supervisor, and he feared the grievance would have a negative impact on his chances for advancement. In the end, a Memorandum of Settlement, entered as exhibit, resolved the matter between the union and management. The grievance was fully resolved by Canada Post agreeing to issue a reminder to supervisory staff within the Victoria Local that an employee\u2019s personal life is not an appropriate subject of discussion on the work floor.\n[131] I do not find Mr. Labine\u2019s statements during the work floor conversation to constitute harassment under the CHRA. The Complainant has established the event occurred and that her marital status (her relationship with the Superintendent-with whom by that time she had been cohabitating for over a year) was raised in the presence of others. However, I do not find that the conduct of Mr. Labine violated Ms. Stanger\u2019s dignity such that it could contribute to the creation of a hostile or poisoned work environment. The Complainant may have perceived Mr. Labine\u2019s comments to be unwelcome and embarrassing. However, on the evidence, they constituted a good faith exercise of supervisory authority in pursuit of the legitimate operations and business goals of the employer (see Day, supra, para. 184).\n[132] On the question of whether the incident constituted demeaning, humiliating or insulting treatment, I must conclude that the conversation was nothing other than appropriate under the circumstances, as the Respondent\u2019s evidence establishes. I was persuaded by Mr. Labine\u2019s testimony that he addressed the Complainant in a professional manner, and that he mentioned her relationship only in the context of the complaints that had been raised with him by others. Although the shop stewards were present, I do not view this as them and Mr. Labine \u201cganging up\u201d on Ms. Stanger. They had originally brought the complaint to Mr. Labine and presumably their presence was viewed as part of their legitimate labour relations responsibilities. There was no evidence that there were other employees present.\nB. Incidents concerning Ms. Susan Savoy\n[133] Ms. Stanger also alleged that a co-worker, Susan Savoy, harassed her because of her marital status. There were two separate allegations against Ms. Savoy: that Ms. Savoy harassed her by saying Ms. Stanger received preferential treatment concerning her break times; and, that Ms. Savoy harassed her by saying Ms. Stanger\u2019s relationship with the Superintendent was \u201cun-Christian.\u201d\n[134] Ms. Savoy was a co-worker of the Complainant in 2006 and she was also called as a witness by the Respondent. Ms. Stanger\u2019s testimony about Ms. Savoy was not very clear, and she implied both alleged events happened at the same time. Ms. Stanger was not clear about when, but she stated that Ms. Savoy revealed to her that she had written a letter to the VicMPP Manager, complaining about Ms. Stanger\u2019s erratic break times. Ms. Stanger alleges that Ms. Savoy was self-righteous and made Ms. Stanger feel hurt.\n[135] Ms. Savoy\u2019s letter to the VicMPP Manager, Ms. Aiken, was dated February 6, 2006, and it was admitted as an exhibit at the hearing. As the content of this letter was not revealed to Ms. Stanger until the disclosure in preparation for this hearing, it is not itself part of the harassment allegation. However, I raise it here as part of the context of the situation. The letter set out in some detail specific instances when Ms. Stanger had been late returning from breaks, and how that adversely impacted co-workers who were working on rotations where operations required a full complement of employees. In the letter, Ms. Savoy stated:\nIn my opinion, changing her break time for their (the Stangers\u2019) own convenience, or to fulfill their own personal agenda expresses a blatant disregard for corporate policy or rules and regulations. It also shows a total lack of respect and concern for her co-workers health and well-being, who have the extra burden of doing her job (as well as their own).\n[136] According to Ms. Savoy, some time after she wrote her letter to Ms. Aiken, she found herself working alongside Ms. Stanger. Ms. Savoy never received a reply from Ms. Aiken, and was unaware that Ms. Stanger had filed a grievance against Mr. Labine. However, she wanted to be forthright with Ms. Stanger, so she told her about the letter when they were working alongside each other some weeks later. Ms. Savoy described the conversation as normal and without hostility.\n[137] The other alleged event happened earlier. Ms. Savoy described that in 2005 she learned about Ms. Stanger\u2019s early relationship with the Superintendent from a co-worker on the shop floor. She recalled a long conversation with the co-worker, who was upset that Ms. Stanger had started dating the Superintendent, because she felt that Ms. Stanger was being used and would end up hurt. Ms. Savoy said she defended Ms. Stanger, stating that she was old enough to make her own decisions. Sometime later that year, Ms. Stanger came up to Ms. Savoy, after having spoken to the other employee about her relationship. Ms. Savoy said Ms. Stanger seemed pleased that she had defended Ms. Stanger to the other employee in regards to the relationship. Ms. Savoy testified that she told Ms. Stanger that she did agree Ms. Stanger had the right to make her own decisions, but that in some ways she agreed with the other employee about the inappropriateness of the relationship. Ms. Savoy recollected that she either said, \u201cin my religion, it [the relationship] was wrong\u201d or perhaps, \u201cbeing a Christian, that might be wrong\u201d because, as Ms. Savoy understood the circumstances, Mr. Stanger was still a married man.\n[138] According to Ms. Savoy, Ms. Stanger\u2019s response was to give her a funny look. Ms. Savoy said that she may have had a less friendly relationship with Ms. Stanger thereafter, but that she didn\u2019t shun her or otherwise treat Ms. Stanger differently.\n[139] Ms. Stanger\u2019s evidence was that Ms. Savoy called the Complainant\u2019s relationship \u201cun-Christian\u201d. Although Ms. Savoy did not recall using that exact term, I am convinced on the evidence of both parties that Ms. Savoy did convey to the Complainant some sort of judgement about the appropriateness of the Complainant\u2019s personal relationship with the Superintendent. I am also prepared to accept that the ground of marital status is engaged, given the fact that the Stangers had been cohabitating for at least a few months by that time (even if their relationship was still perceived as \u201cjust dating\u201d). However, I do not find Ms. Savoy\u2019s comment violated Ms. Stanger\u2019s dignity such that it created a hostile or poisoned work environment. The comment in question was accompanied by Ms. Savoy\u2019s affirmation that Ms. Stanger had the right to make her own decisions. In the context of the conversation in which it arose, I do not find that the comment was demeaning, humiliating or insulting within the meaning of s. 14. Moreover, I am not convinced the comment was completely unsolicited as it would appear that it was Ms. Stanger who initiated the conversation.\n[140] Ms. Stanger testified that being told about the letter and that Ms. Savoy suggested she was being shown favouritism regarding her breaks caused her to feel hurt. However, I do not find Ms. Savoy\u2019s conduct concerning her complaint to be harassment. A letter of complaint to management about a co-worker\u2019s non-compliance with the employer\u2019s break policy is consistent with the legitimate operations and business goals of the employer. There was no evidence that the letter was sent in bad faith or for an improper purpose. In fact, Ms. Savoy had no reason to reveal the existence of the letter to Ms. Stanger. In my view, it was for the sake of transparency and an extension of the good faith in which it was written. In this context, I do not find that conversation to have been demeaning or insulting, nor do I find that the possible embarrassment caused to Ms. Stanger would fall within the ambit of s. 14.\nC. Patrick Gibbons \u2013 Forklift Incident\n[141] Ms. Stanger alleges that on March 10, 2005, Mr. Patrick Gibbons, her former spouse, deliberately chased her on the shop floor while he was driving a forklift. Ms. Stanger was wheeling a large box, which she referred to as a \u201ccoffin\u201d, when Mr. Gibbons approached her from behind in the forklift. Ms. Stanger described him as \u201cchasing\u201d her in the forklift and being \u201cvery aggressive\u201d towards her. Ms. Stanger testified that she turned around and told Mr. Gibbins to \u201cback off\u201d, but he just smiled at her and kept coming closer in the forklift. After getting out of his way, Ms. Stanger went to see her immediate supervisor at the time, Dean Iverson, to report the incident. She described Mr. Iverson as not all that interested in the incident, even though she felt Mr. Gibbons had crossed a line. Ms. Stanger said she then went to the office of Superintendent Stanger to report the incident. She said that another shift superintendent, Mr. Brad Harrison, was also present in the office, and that she relayed the details of the forklift incident to both of them. Ms. Stanger described herself as being scared, intimidated and angry over the incident.\n[142] Ms. Stanger testified that nothing was ever done about the forklift incident. Nothing was said, and nothing was ever brought to her attention about the matter being resolved. Ms. Stanger said she also spoke with her union shop stewards, Ms. Kristofferson and Ms. Robinet, about the forklift incident. She said they both told her they couldn\u2019t talk to her because there was a conflict of interest, presumably between her and Mr. Gibbons. (It is worth noting at this point, no evidence was led indicating that Ms. Stanger exercised any kind of recourse against her union in relation to the shop stewards alleged refusal to talk to her).\n[143] The Respondent called both Mr. Gibbons and Mr. Harrison as witnesses to speak about this alleged event. Mr. Gibbons had been married to Ms. Stanger for approximately 11 years, and they ceased living together in 2004. He was also Ms. Stanger\u2019s co-worker at VicMPP, and Patrick Stanger was also his Superintendent. Mr. Gibbons gave evidence about his shock when he found out that his ex-wife was dating the Superintendent, to whom he reported. Shortly after hearing the news, Mr. Gibbons sought counselling from his doctor, and then took a six week stress leave from work. He testified that he also consulted an employment lawyer, because he was worried about returning to a workplace that could be hostile. Mr. Gibbons was worried that something he might say or do could be interpreted as harassment and get him into trouble. His lawyer advised Mr. Gibbons to have limited interaction at work with his ex-wife and the Superintendent, and for a while Mr. Gibbons\u2019 hours were modified to avoid overlap with their shifts.\n[144] Mr. Gibbons was quite blunt in his testimony and said the forklift event never happened. His evidence was that he didn\u2019t remember anything like that happening, that he would not have driven close to someone and not been aware of it, and that no supervisor or anyone else ever spoke to him about the alleged incident. Although Mr. Gibbons was cross-examined, there were no cross-examination questions put to Mr. Gibbons about the alleged forklift incident, and I find that telling. Furthermore, Mr. Gibbons gave evidence that he was worried about his future with Canada Post because of his ex-wife\u2019s relationship with the Superintendent. It therefore seems very unlikely that he would dangerously threaten or intimidate her with a forklift.\n[145] Mr. Harrison had no recollection of Ms. Stanger\u2019s complaint about the forklift incident. He agreed it would have been a serious event in the workplace, if it happened. Mr. Harrison also felt that it was unlikely he would have been in the Superintendent\u2019s office at the same time as Mr. Stanger, because he was working the graveyard shift in those days.\n[146] In cross-examination, Mr. Harrison admitted he could have been in the Superintendent\u2019s office if he had been at work during daytime hours for some exceptional reason, such as training. However, he also was not cross-examined about the fork-lift allegation, which I find telling.\n[147] The Tribunal was presented with starkly conflicting evidence about whether or not this event occurred. I do not believe the Complainant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. Gibbons chased her with a forklift, or followed her too closely. In addition to the two witnesses who denied any knowledge of this alleged event, Ms. Stanger\u2019s version of events is not in harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions (Croteau supra, para. 53). It would be a serious danger in the workplace for an employee to recklessly and aggressively drive a forklift towards a co-worker. I find it hard to believe the matter would not generate any contemporaneous documentation.\n[148] The allegation certainly invites the question why the Superintendent himself, Mr. Stanger, would not have taken some action, or at least reported it to the Plant Manager. Mr. Stanger did, in fact, send Ms. Aiken an email about a much less serious incident, which will be discussed in detail below. Why would he not report an event like this which potentially involved the perpetration of violence with a workplace vehicle? It appears that Mr. Stanger himself could have offered testimony on this point. However, Superintendent Stanger did not testify at the hearing. Similarly, Mr. Iverson, Ms. Robinet and Ms. Kristofferson were not called to testify about their alleged refusal to assist the Complainant with this issue. Ms. Stanger has not proven on a balance of probabilities that this event occurred as she described it. In light of the foregoing, the issue of its connection to her marital status need not be discussed.\nD. Pam Cromwell \u2013 Conversation and the Rotten Fruit Incident\n[149] Ms. Stanger testified about events in late 2006 involving a co-worker named Pam Cromwell. During one particular overtime shift, Ms. Stanger had been asked to label a sortation case. According to Ms. Stanger, Ms. Cromwell approached her in an angry mood, and demanded to know what she was doing, stating it was stupid to work on a case that no one used. According to Ms. Stanger, Ms. Cromwell suggested Ms. Stanger was getting perks because she was in a relationship with the Superintendent. Ms. Stanger said these remarks were made in a loud voice, with aggression, and that others on the shop floor could hear.\n[150] Ms. Cromwell testified that she recalled the event, but her version of events differed from the Complainant\u2019s. Ms. Cromwell said she did not have a close relationship with Ms. Stanger, and that she seldom talked to her. She recalled that she and other co-workers were surprised to see Ms. Stanger labelling a sortation case that was in disuse. It also appeared strange to her that Ms. Stanger would be getting paid overtime, as they were that evening, to do such a job. According to Ms. Cromwell, she was not angry or upset, but just curious as to why Ms. Stanger was labelling that case. On their way to their break, Ms. Cromwell testified, she simply asked Ms. Stanger if there was a plan to use that sortation case at some time in the future. Ms. Cromwell denied being angry. She denied suggesting that Ms. Stanger was getting perks as a result of her relationship with the Superintendent. She admitted she might have had that thought, but that it would have been very unwise for her to ever say something like that out loud. Ms. Cromwell testified that she was \u201c99.9% sure\u201d about the words she spoke to Ms. Stanger that day, and that all she asked was whether or not the sortation case was going to come into use again.\n[151] Ms. Cromwell went on to testify that immediately after the break, after she had asked the Complainant about the case, Superintendent Stanger came up to her on the work floor. Ms. Cromwell was still eating an apple that she had not finished during her break. She testified that Mr. Stanger verbally reprimanded her for eating the apple on the floor. Ms. Cromwell said that it was not that unusual for employees to sometimes finish food or coffee on the work floor, and that she had done it many times before without ever being reprimanded. Ms. Cromwell described feeling attacked by Superintendent Stanger, and could not understand why he was so upset. She later felt that it might have been because she had asked his girlfriend a question.\n[152] According to Ms. Stanger\u2019s testimony, a few days later, when she went to her unlocked locker, there was a plastic bag of \u201crotten fruit\u201d hanging on one of the hooks. She described it as \u201crotten fruit and a couple of apples on top\u201d, noting that the apples did not look rotten. Ms. Stanger said that she considered the bag of rotten fruit as a \u201cthreat\u201d, because it had been placed in her locker. However, Ms. Stanger did not show the bag of rotten fruit to anyone, and there were no other witnesses to the incident.\n[153] Ms. Stanger testified she complained to her supervisor, Mike Yaromy, and that he told her to tell the superintendent on duty, Patrick Stanger.\n[154] However, Mr. Yaromy testified that he was absent from VicMPP when this incident took place, and was only advised about it when he returned. He stated, \u201cI was not approached by Ms. Stanger about this incident.\u201d\n[155] Ms. Stanger said she asked Superintendent Stanger to write an email to Ms. Aiken about the rotten fruit incident, and the email was tendered as an exhibit. Dated December 11, 2006, the email first seeks clarification as to whether Mr. Stanger should place a written letter of reprimand (for eating an apple on the shop floor) in Ms. Cromwell\u2019s file, or not. It goes on to say:\nHowever, a matter has come to my attention that may pertain to this issue. On Sunday night when Jessica came in for overtime she found that two apples and some rotting fruit had been placed in her unlocked locker. This would appear to be related to my letter of discipline to Pam Cromwell regarding her eating an apple on the work floor. In conversation with Jessica, she feels that she is being targeted every time someone on the work floor disagrees with something I have done.\n[156] However, Ms. Stanger denied having told Superintendent Stanger that she suspected the rotting fruit incident was possibly connected to his discipline of Ms. Cromwell. Ms. Stanger also emphatically stated that she did not discuss her conversation with Ms. Cromwell about labelling the case with Superintendent Stanger either, even though she had been living with him for roughly two years. When asked how \u2014without the Complainant\u2019s information\u2014Superintendent Stanger could have made the link to Ms. Cromwell concerning the rotten fruit, Ms. Stanger simply replied that he must have arrived at this conclusion on his own.\n[157] Ms. Cromwell testified that Ms. Aiken did speak to her about the bag of rotten fruit. She told Ms. Aiken she knew nothing about it.\n[158] Ms. Stanger has not adduced sufficient evidence to convince the Tribunal the rotten fruit event occurred or if it did, that it constituted a form of harassment under the CHRA. If Ms. Stanger considered the appearance of rotten fruit as some kind of threat towards her, why did she not show it to anyone? Furthermore, the appearance of the fruit is not conclusive about anything. As described by Ms. Stanger, the plastic bag did not contain only \u201crotten fruit\u201d, but also two or more fresh apples on top. There was no note attached to the bag. There is no evidence allowing the Tribunal to conclude the bag was targeted towards Ms. Stanger, or that it was deliberately placed in her locker. It may have been placed there by accident or for completely innocuous reasons.\n[159] Furthermore, regarding Ms. Cromwell\u2019s question about the sortation case, the two witnesses gave starkly different accounts of the exchange. Ms. Stanger testified that Ms. Cromwell\u2019s remarks were in a loud voice and that others on the shop floor could hear her. However, Ms. Stanger did not call any witnesses to corroborate her version. On the other hand, Ms. Cromwell gave very clear evidence and assured the Tribunal that her recollection was 99.9% accurate. I prefer the testimony of Ms. Cromwell for this reason and conclude that she did not remark about Ms. Stanger receiving perks because of her marital status.\nE. Union Shop Steward Zaria Andrews and Supervisor Russell Odnokon\n[160] Ms. Stanger testified that she was harassed and intimidated by a co-worker because of her relationship with the Superintendent. In late 2004, not long after she started dating the Superintendent, Ms. Stanger was approached by Ms. Zaria Andrews, a co-worker and her union\u2019s shop steward. Ms. Andrews made a couple of requests for Ms. Stanger to meet with her in the Union Office, which seemed unusual to her; as such a meeting usually occurs after some incident or for the purpose of discussing some formal matter. Feeling that she needed some representation in dealing with her own union, Ms. Stanger asked her then-supervisor, Russell Odnokon, to accompany her to the Union Office. She acknowledged that, normally, the union would send a representative to accompany its employee member, if the employer requested a meeting with that member. This was happening the other way around, and Ms. Stanger herself described the situation as \u201chighly unique\u201d.\n[161] According to Ms. Stanger, at the meeting Ms. Andrews told her that she was only being used in her relationship so that the Superintendent could get information about the union. Ms. Andrews and the other shop stewards wanted her to break off the relationship. Ms. Stanger said she didn\u2019t feel that she was being used. She described Ms. Andrews as being angry, and speaking to her at a close range, making her feel intimidated. Ms. Stanger concluded from this meeting that the Union would not offer her any representation or protection going forward. After 5 minutes or so, as the meeting was concluding, Mr. Odnokon asked Ms. Stanger, \u201cCan I go now?\u201d He then left the room.\n[162] There were no witnesses called to corroborate or refute this story, as neither Ms. Andrews nor Mr. Odnokon testified before the Tribunal. There was no documentary evidence to support Ms. Stanger\u2019s allegations. Given the reservations that I have expressed concerning Ms. Stanger\u2019s credibility, I do not make the finding that this event occurred.\n[163] Even if I were convinced, on a balance of probabilities, that the event occurred exactly as Ms. Stanger recounted it, I do not find it amounts to harassment under the CHRA. Section 14 of the CHRA does not prevent union officials from pursuing legitimate operations and business goals, provided they act in good faith. Even if Ms. Andrews may not have used optimal language, a bargaining agent has a legitimate interest to ensure that internal information is not leaked to management.\n[164] The second part of Ms. Stanger\u2019s argument concerning this incident is that Mr. Odnokon had a positive duty to take further action, having witnessed this conversation first hand. At several points in her testimony, and in her final arguments, Ms. Stanger argued that Canada Post had a positive duty to investigate her numerous complaints of harassment and discrimination, and that they failed to do so. I will address this argument in a separate section of this decision.\nF. Incidents with Postal Clerk Tom McMenemy\n[165] Ms. Stanger alleges that a co-worker named Tom McMenemy harassed her by talking to her about her relationship with Superintendent Stanger in a derogatory manner. In late 2005, Ms. Stanger had taken a vacation to Calgary with Superintendent Stanger. On her first day back at work, just before a pre-shift meeting when all co-workers were gathered on the shop floor, Mr. McMenemy questioned Ms. Stanger about her trip. He wanted to know where they went, what they saw, and if they had seen the Canada Post plant in Calgary, in which he appeared to be interested. When Mr. McMenemy asked specific questions about Superintendent Stanger\u2019s activities in Calgary, Ms. Stanger suggested that he ask him directly. Ms. Stanger testified that Mr. McMenemy had the type of personality of someone who wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. According to Ms. Stanger, Mr. McMenemy was not satisfied with her suggestion that he ask Superintendent Stanger directly, and made a comment to the effect of, \u201cAre you telling me you\u2019re sleeping with him and you don\u2019t know?\u201d\n[166] Ms. Stanger testified that the comment was loud and made within earshot of many others gathered for the meeting, including Shop Steward Robinet and Ms. Stanger\u2019s supervisor. She said they did not react at all after Mr. McMenemy\u2019s comment.\n[167] In cross-examination, Ms. Stanger admitted that she was vaguely aware that Mr. McMenemy had a daughter in Calgary, and that he was contemplating a transfer to the Canada Post plant there. Mr. McMenemy was not called as a witness, and there was no other evidence tendered in support of this allegation.\n[168] In the Complainant\u2019s written closing argument about this event, there is an inconsistency which must be noted. The written argument states, \u201cThe complainant talked to team leader Yaromy later in the day and told him that she felt Mr. McMenemy\u2019s comments were hurtful and inappropriate. Mr. Yaromy did nothing.\u201d These assertions did not form part of Ms. Stanger\u2019s oral evidence when she was on the stand, nor was any documentary evidence adduced in support thereof. Although he did not testify in relation to this alleged incident, I note it was Mr. Yaromy\u2019s evidence elsewhere that he did not start working at Canada Post until May of 2006.\n[169] Ms. Stanger brought her own credibility as a witness into question, as outlined above. As there was no corroborating evidence, no witnesses called or supporting documentation, I do not conclude on a balance of probabilities that this event occurred as she alleged.\n[170] Although McMenemy\u2019s alleged comment would have been unseemly and impolite, I would not find this single event to be significant enough to warrant a finding of harassment on its own. Even if I were convinced that the event occurred exactly as Ms. Stanger described it, I would find any harm caused thereby to be fleeting. According to Ms. Stanger, there was no reaction from others nearby and as such, I would find the event itself did not create a hostile or poisoned work environment. Ms. Stanger and the Superintendent had been living together for about a year by this time, and it was known at the workplace that they had been travelling together. If others had heard Mr. McMenemy\u2019s comment, they would not have been surprised by his presumption that there was an ongoing conjugal relationship. Notwithstanding my finding such a comment to be in bad taste, I would not find that it constitutes harassment under section 14.\n[171] The Complainant\u2019s written closing argument also speaks of another incident involving Mr. McMenemy. However, there was no evidence regarding this incident presented at the hearing, so it will not be addressed.\nG. Incident with Postal Clerk Howard Siegrist\n[172] Ms. Stanger alleges that a co-worker, Mr. Howard Siegrist, harassed her because of her marital status by making derogatory remarks about her then-boyfriend, Superintendent Stanger. Mr. Siegrist was a co-worker of the Complainant for around three years. Ms. Stanger alleged that in early 2007, she was working alongside Mr. Siegrist in the O\u2019Cull rotation, where one worker would dump mail out of bags, and others would sort it. On the day in question, Mr. Siegrist had just come from a \u201c24 hour notice\u201d disciplinary meeting with Superintendent Stanger. According to Ms. Stanger, Mr. Siegrist was angry and was slamming down the postal bags 4-5 feet away from her. Ms. Stanger was vague on the details of her conversation with Mr. Siegrist that day, but she said that he referred to Superintendent Stanger as, \u201cyour fucking boyfriend\u201d and also as \u201ca prick\u201d. She says that Mr. Siegrist\u2019s behaviour made her scared, hurt and embarrassed.\n[173] Mr. Siegrist was called as a witness by the Respondent. I found him to be forthright and not hesitant about admitting unflattering comments he might have made. In my view, this made him a credible witness. Mr. Siegrist did not have a specific recollection of his conversation with Ms. Stanger that day. He said that he had attended more than ten 24 hour notice meetings, and that for him, it was like a joke. These meetings didn\u2019t concern him at all because they were removed from his record every year anyway. Furthermore, he didn\u2019t mind spending 1-2 hours away from the shop floor to go to these meetings. Mr. Siegrist said he did not recall referring to Superintendent Stanger as \u201cyour fucking boyfriend\u201d and doubted he had said it. He didn\u2019t rule out the possibility that he may have said it at some point, but he claimed that he had no recollection. However, Mr. Siegrist was rather certain that he had never referred to Mr. Stanger as a \u201cprick\u201d, because that was not an expression that he ever used.\n[174] Mr. Siegrist also contested the allegation that he was slamming down mail bags in anger, or to scare Ms. Stanger. He stated that the mail bags were already quite heavy, and that he would not have been able to make the extra effort to slam them down in any exceptional way. I accept his testimony on this point. Furthermore, M. Siegrist also testified that Ms. Stanger never told him that she was scared of him or intimidated by him.\n[175] Mr. Siegrist was cross-examined at the hearing. He was asked several unrelated questions about PPD status employees and other general matters but there was no attack on his credibility. Furthermore, there were no cross-examination questions related to the alleged conversation in early 2007.\n[176] There was not much evidence presented in support of this allegation. However, given that Mr. Siegrist did not rule out the possibility that he may have made one of the comments attributed to him, I am prepared to accept Ms. Stanger\u2019s testimony in that regard. However, even if Mr. Siegrist had indeed referred to Superintendent Stanger as \u201cyour fucking boyfriend\u201d in his conversation with the complainant, I do not find this single occurrence to be significant enough, on its own, to warrant a finding of workplace harassment under the CHRA. To create a hostile work environment, a single event must be quite serious or severe. (See Franke, supra.) The act was evidently not sufficiently serious enough for Ms. Stanger to report it at the time to any level of management.\nH. Incident with Postal Clerk Darlene Schultz Regarding Jacket\n[177] Ms. Stanger made two allegations about Ms. Darlene Schultz, but relating to two different incidents, and based on different grounds of discrimination. The incident that related to marital status harassment was referred to in the Complainant\u2019s SOP and written closing argument, but no evidence was led in regard to this incident. The other incident was related to harassment based on disability, and will be addressed in the following section of these reasons.\n[178] Ms. Schultz was a co-worker of the Complainant for around three years. In her SOPs, Ms. Stanger alleged that Ms. Schultz had commented on a new Canada Post jacket that Ms. Stanger was wearing. According to Ms. Stanger, Ms. Schultz wanted to know if the jacket was new, and who had given it to her. When Ms. Stanger told her it was not a new coat, she alleges Ms. Schultz told her, \u201cOh, it\u2019s who you know\u201d, which Ms. Stanger took as an implication that she had received the jacket as a perk because of her marital status. According to Ms. Stanger\u2019s SOP, many other employees were present at the time and heard the comment.\n[179] At the hearing, there were no witnesses called to speak to the allegation, and Ms. Stanger herself did not speak to it. There was no documentary evidence to support the allegation. Therefore, I made no finding about this allegation.\nX. Section 14 Allegations of Harassment related to Disability\nA. Incident concerning Ms. Ruth Allen\n[180] The Complainant\u2019s SOP speaks of an incident involving Ms. Ruth Allen. However, there was no evidence regarding this incident presented at the hearing, so it will not be addressed.\nB. Incident concerning Ms. Corinne Jacobson\n[181] The Complainant\u2019s SOP speaks of an incident involving Ms. Corinne Jacobson. However, no evidence was presented at the hearing in regard to this incident, so it will not be addressed.\nC. Incident concerning Ms. Darlene Schultz\n[182] As mentioned above, in her oral testimony, Ms. Stanger talked in detail about a conversation with Ms. Darlene Schultz on Ms. Stanger\u2019s final day of work at VicMPP, which was June 22, 2008. Ms. Stanger had put in a request to transfer to a new job with Canada Post in a different location. According to Ms. Stanger, as they were working on the O\u2019Cull rotation, she noticed that Ms. Schultz was agitated and angry at her. Ms. Schultz was complaining to Ms. Stanger that Superintendent Stanger was not doing a good job managing the Communications 3A shift. Wanting to change the topic, Ms. Stanger mentioned that she had been told Ms. Schultz had made a complaint to the union because of Ms. Stanger\u2019s transfer request. Ms. Stanger observed that people like Ms. Schultz had been harassing her for years because of her PPD status, and now that she was trying to leave, people were still not happy.\n[183] According to Ms. Stanger, Ms. Schultz commented that it was amazing how PPD employees suddenly became miraculously cured of their disabilities when they applied for a transfer, and that people like Ms. Stanger were \u201cscamming the corporation.\u201d\n[184] After that comment, Ms. Stanger ended the conversation by putting on her head phones. She finished her shift and went on sick leave immediately thereafter. She never returned to VicMPP.\n[185] Ms. Schultz was not called as a witness, and this incident was not explored during the cross-examination of Ms. Stanger. There were no witnesses called to corroborate or refute this evidence. Without any additional evidence, and given the credibility issues raised earlier, I am not prepared to make a finding that this event occurred as described.\nXI. Cumulative Effect of Harassment Incidents\n[186] Where impugned conduct takes the form of sarcastic comments, derogatory references to one\u2019s marital partner and like comments, it must be persistent and frequent in order to constitute harassment within the meaning of the CHRA (see Morin v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 CHRT 41, at para. 258). However, in the above analysis, I have concluded that only three of the ten harassment allegations actually occurred: the Labine complaint; the Savoy complaint; and, the Siegrist complaint. The Labine allegation was not substantiated because I was persuaded Mr. Labine was conducting himself properly within the context of his role. For the reasons outlined above, I did not find Ms. Savoy\u2019s comment nor the revelation of her letter to be harassment as defined under the CHRA. The possible comment by Mr. Siegrist about the Complainant\u2019s boyfriend was unwelcome and could be perceived as demeaning. However, as it was a single occurrence, and evidently not serious enough for Ms. Stanger to report it, I did not find that allegation of harassment to be substantiated by itself.\n[187] If there were several incidents, none of which alone were sufficient to substantiate a finding of harassment, but cumulatively they could create a poisoned work environment, then a finding of harassment under s. 14 could be made. However, in this case, there were only two relevant incidents, involving Ms. Savoy and Mr. Siegrist, that were found to have occurred. Therefore, the argument of the cumulative effect is significantly diminished. Both remarks were connected to Ms. Stanger\u2019s marital status. Both comments were unwelcome and both could be viewed as somewhat demeaning towards Ms. Stanger. However, I do not believe that two comments, made by two different co-workers, perhaps 18-24 months apart, had a cumulative effect sufficient to conclude there was a toxic\/poisoned work environment. A series of small events that are insulting, demeaning or degrading could create over time a poisonous, hostile workplace. However, neither of these comments were found to be severe enough on their own to constitute harassment. Likewise, I do not find that on the evidence before the Tribunal, that both of them combined contributed to a poisonous or hostile work environment for the Complainant.\nXII. Notification of Discrimination \/ Harassment to the Employer\n[188] Even if I had found that the relevant incidents possessed sufficient gravity, persistence or repetition to poison Ms. Stanger\u2019s work environment, there is an additional legal requirement to be considered before a finding of harassment can be made. In fairness to respondents who have established harassment policies that include complaint mechanisms, there is an obligation for employees to give adequate notice to the employer of the alleged harassment. This matter was considered in some detail by the Federal Court in Franke, supra, which reads at section 2(d) as follows:\nAlthough this was not an element considered by the Supreme Court in Janzen, I believe that fairness requires the employee, whenever possible, to notify the employer of the alleged offensive conduct.\nIn recent years, courts and tribunals have insisted on a degree of vigilance over the work environment, which requires employers to provide a workplace free from harassment. Conversely, in my opinion, in order for sexual harassment policies to work, the employee should inform the employer of any problems, in order to give him or her the opportunity to remedy them.\nThis requirement will exist where the employer has a personnel department along with a comprehensive and effective sexual harassment policy, including appropriate redress mechanisms, which are already in place.\nThe goal of a sexual harassment policy is to achieve a healthy workplace; and, therefore, the sooner action is taken to eliminate harassing conduct, the less likely it is that any such conduct will become detrimental to the work environment.\n[189] The Tribunal is satisfied that Canada Post has a personnel department and had in place a comprehensive and effective anti-harassment and discrimination policy. Amongst other measures, since 2005, Canada Post gave human rights training to all new employees. An informative newsletter on harassment and discrimination was distributed to all employees. The newsletter gave out the name and contact information of the internal Canada Post human rights officer. Periodic seminars were also given to employees. With this policy in place, the question is whether Ms. Stanger gave adequate notice to the employer of the alleged offensive conduct in order for them to have an opportunity to investigate and remedy the situation.\n[190] The first period to consider is when Ms. Stanger was working at VicMPP where the harassment was alleged to have occurred. The relevant period is from November 1, 2004 to June 22, 2008. Did Ms. Stanger give notice to her employer that she was experiencing harassment in the workplace during this period? In addressing this argument, I will consider the five events where Ms. Stanger contends she reported the alleged harassment to her employer between November 2004 and June 2008:\nA) Guy Labine Grievance: On February 15, 2006, Ms. Stanger filed a written grievance with her union which included the allegation that Mr. Labine \u201cdid harass and bully\u201d her. The grievance was acted upon and a settlement was reached between the union and the employer. I concluded that Mr. Labine\u2019s conduct was in the good faith exercise of his supervisory duties and not harassment.\nB) Forklift Incident: Ms. Stanger alleges that she complained to Supervisor Brad Harrison and Superintendent Stanger about this incident immediately after it happened in March 2005. I have concluded that there was insufficient evidence this event occurred as described. In particular, I am convinced that if such allegations had been made to management, they would have been acted upon. I therefore conclude that no such report was made.\nC) Rotten Fruit Incident: Mr. Yaromy denies Ms. Stanger\u2019s evidence that she reported this incident to him. However, one can infer that Ms. Stanger reported the rotten fruit incident to Superintendent Stanger, as he referred the matter to Ms. Aiken and she took steps to investigate the matter. Ms. Aiken testified that she did speak to Ms. Cromwell, whom Superintendent Stanger had implied was the suspect. Ms. Aiken\u2019s investigation did not lead to any conclusion about who was responsible, or even if the event actually occurred. Ms. Stanger chose to not show the alleged bag of rotten fruit to anyone. Even assuming that a bag of rotten fruit was placed in Ms. Stanger\u2019s locker in late 2006, Ms. Stanger has not proven on a balance of probabilities that Ms. Cromwell was involved in this act and that it constituted some form of reprisal. Therefore, it remains within the realm of possibility that the bag of fruit was innocently placed in Ms. Stanger\u2019s locker by mistake.\nD) Zaria Andrews Incident: Ms. Stanger gave the only evidence that Supervisor Odnokon was in attendance at a meeting in late 2004 with union representative, Zaria Andrews. Ms. Stanger argues that Supervisor Odnokon had a duty to act in relation to the Zaria Andrews incident. However, as stated above, I am of the view that even if the event occurred exactly as Ms. Stanger has described, it was not an act of harassment under the CHRA. The union has a legitimate role in the pursuit of its business and it would appear that asking for a meeting in private, the union was pursuing those goals in good faith. As such, I would conclude that Supervisor Odnokon would not have witnessed harassment and would therefore have nothing to report. Moreover, there is no evidence that Ms. Stanger expressly told Supervisor Odnokon at the time that she regarded Ms. Andrews\u2019 words and actions as harassment. It is understandable that Supervisor Odnokon would not take action on his own initiative in relation to a conversation between a unionized employee and her shop steward.\nE) Tom McMenemy Incident: Ms. Stanger alleged in her written argument that she reported Mr. McMenemy\u2019s inappropriate remarks in late 2005 to Supervisor Yaromy. However, she did not give this evidence orally at the hearing nor does any other evidence in the record support this allegation. Further, it was Mr. Yaromy\u2019s evidence that he did not start working at VicMPP until some months after the alleged incident. I therefore conclude that no such report was made to Supervisor Yaromy.\n[191] Under cross-examination, Ms. Stanger admitted that she had only reported the first three incidents above during the 2004 \u2013 2008 period in question. She also admitted that she did not report harassment when she decided to leave VicMPP in June of 2008. Moreover, it was the testimony of Mr. Yaromy that Ms. Stanger never complained to him about co-workers harassing her about her marital relationship or her PPD status. Ms. Aiken also testified that Ms. Stanger never complained to her about harassment during this period.\n[192] Therefore, the Complainant\u2019s argument that the Respondent had sufficient notice of ongoing harassment falls short. At most, there was evidence that Canada Post had received a grievance about Mr. Labine\u2019s conduct in early 2006 and there was some kind of notice of an allegation about rotten fruit in her locker in late 2006 which was investigated but inconclusive. Accordingly, Ms. Stanger fails to meet the fairness requirement under the Franke test for her failure to adequately put the employer on notice.\n[193] Much evidence was given about Canada Post\u2019s reaction to Ms. Stanger\u2019s harassment allegations after she left the VicMPP workplace. Notwithstanding her admissions in cross-examination, Ms. Stanger insisted that Canada Post was well aware during the 2004 \u2013 2008 period that she had been harassed in the workplace. When asked for specific evidence, she referred to the minutes taken by Manulife Financial of her Return to Work (RTW) meeting, held on August 5, 2008, and specifically, this observation in the minutes:\nThe employee indicated she feels harassed at work on the basis that she has PPD limitations and that she is married to her Superintendent. She stated the severity of this harassment has led to her not feeling safe at work.\n[194] As was pointed out by respondent counsel, the above observation merely constitutes the recounting of the Complainant\u2019s self-serving statement. It was not an admission by Canada Post, and indeed there was evidence that harassment had never been raised by the Complainant prior to that meeting: Ms. Aiken testified that prior to the August 5, 2008 RTW meeting, Ms. Stanger had never complained that she was harassed, or not accommodated because of her PPD status.\n[195] The above-quoted minutes from the RTW meeting went on to say:\nThe employee indicated she has brought forward these concerns in the past but feels that by raising these concerns the harassment only escalates. The employee stated she has no interest in discussing these matters with a representative from the Human Rights department.\n[196] After leaving the VicMPP workplace unannounced in June 2008, Ms. Stanger remained off work until she started her new position in December 2008. Ms. Stanger\u2019s sick leave ran out in early September 2008 so she then made a request for \u201cspecial leave\u201d, but her request was denied. On September 18, 2008, Ms. Stanger wrote to the President of Canada Post, Ms. Moya Greene, and alleged she had been harassed while working at VicMPP.\n[197] The office of the President took prompt action. Ms. Greene assigned Lucie Manoni, Director of Presidential and Corporate Affairs, to look into the matter. An email was also sent to Ms. Roxanne Ayers dated September 25, 2008, instructing her to \u201chandle as urgent\u201d an inquiry into Ms. Stanger\u2019s allegations.\n[198] The Respondent called Ms. Ayers as a witness. She was an employee of Canada Post from 1973 until her retirement in 2009. From 1995 to 2000, Ms. Ayers worked as a Human Rights Investigator amongst other positions, and from 2000 to 2009 she was the Pacific and Yukon Specialist for Human Rights, Employment Equity and Official Languages. Ms. Ayers provided the Tribunal with very helpful evidence throughout her direct examination and a very lengthy cross-examination.\n[199] Ms. Ayers testified that she told Ms. Stanger that in order for there to be an investigation into her complaints, Ms. Stanger would have to provide a complaint in writing that contained specific details of the allegations. Ms. Stanger insisted that Ms. Ayers make that request to her in writing. Ms. Ayers testified that this request was \u201cabnormal\u201d because human rights investigators did not want to appear to be soliciting complaints from employees. It was normal practice, she testified, to act only once a complaint was received from an employee. Notwithstanding the normal practice, Ms. Ayers did write to Ms. Stanger, and specified what information would be required in her complaint, in order for an official investigation to be commenced. Even though she had asked for it, Ms. Stanger did not reply to Ms. Ayers\u2019 letter, and did not provide any detailed information about the allegations of harassment.\n[200] Based on the testimony of Ms. Ayers, and the correspondence submitted at the hearing, I am convinced that Ms. Ayers had a genuine interest in Ms. Stanger\u2019s situation, and was concerned for her human rights. Ms. Ayers said she was very surprised to first hear about Ms. Stanger\u2019s allegations from the President\u2019s office, after Ms. Stanger had referenced harassment in her letter to Ms. Greene. Ms. Ayers was also quite surprised that Ms. Stanger had been off work for nearly four months without having contacted her.\n[201] Ms. Ayers gave detailed evidence about the human rights awareness training given to all Canada Post employees. Various materials were submitted into evidence, including the Canada Post Code of Conduct, the Canada Post 2008 Annual Report on Human Rights, copies of Canada Post\u2019s No Harassment Policy, and samples of workplace posters guiding employees on what to do if they feel they are being \u201charassed, bullied or discriminated against.\u201d Ms. Ayers highlighted the section of the Annual Report that confirmed the delivery of a program called \u201cHuman Rights and Conflict in the Workplace\u201d, which is delivered to all new employees hired into the CUPW bargaining unit. Ms. Ayers testified that existing employees were also given this half day module about human rights, harassment, discrimination, and resolving conflict in the workplace.\n[202] In a letter to Ms. Stanger dated September 25, 2008, Ms. Ayers sent her a copy of the Canada Post No Harassment Policy. The policy was clear that investigations would remain confidential to the extent possible, and that complainants would be protected from retaliation. The policy also instructed employees about who to contact to make a complaint of harassment, including Human Rights Coordinators like Ms. Ayers. Under cross-examination, Ms. Stanger confirmed she had received and read this document and in particular that she understood the sections about retaliation and that employees could be disciplined or even dismissed for violating the policy.\n[203] Notwithstanding that she was clearly aware of the policy, Ms. Stanger continued to refuse to cooperate with an investigation. When Ms. Ayers retired in 2009, her file concerning Ms. Stanger was taken over by another Human Rights Manager for Canada Post, Ms. Renu Srai.\n[204] On February 28, 2009, Ms. Srai wrote a letter to Ms. Stanger about her human rights allegations. She noted Ms. Stanger\u2019s reluctance to provide particulars of the allegations and wrote:\nTherefore, Canada Post has not investigated your complaint of harassment and cannot either confirm or deny that the harassment occurred until additional information is provided.\n[205] In a letter to Ms. Stanger dated May 19, 2009, Ms. Srai repeated:\n\u2026your complaint of harassment by your peers based upon disability and marital status was not investigated because you have not provided any particulars or incidents which could be investigated.\n[206] On March 4, 2009, Ms. Stanger filed a grievance through her union complaining that \u201cthe Corporation caused the intentional infliction of emotional distress to the above-named employee (Ms. Stanger) when Canada Post failed to conduct a proper investigation into a written complaint of harassment and violence in the workplace\u2026\u201d\n[207] Again, Ms. Stanger refused to provide particulars of her allegations. The Memorandum of Settlement for the grievance provided that Ms. Stanger would give Canada Post \u201c\u2026a written statement outlining the specific allegations of her complaint within 30 days of this memorandum of agreement that (sic) it will be referred to the Human Rights department for review.\u201d Failing to provide the statement within 30 days would result in the grievance being resolved. Ms. Stanger did not provide the written statement.\n[208] What makes this complaint audacious is that on multiple occasions, Ms. Stanger was invited to provide details of her alleged harassment so her employer could investigate. She steadfastly refused to cooperate but then instead made this complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\n[209] It is worth noting that Ms. Stanger\u2019s refusal to disclose details of her alleged harassment continued well into the inquiry at the Tribunal. Throughout the case management phase before the hearing, Ms. Stanger exhibited a reluctance to provide specific details about her allegations of discrimination and harassment. The original SOP of the Complainant focused mainly on the discrimination allegation related to the CLDP assessment session. The harassment allegations under s.14 in Ms. Stanger\u2019s original SOP were quite vague. Other than a reference to the formal grievance filed against Mr. Labine, the allegations against other employees were not specific, and did not contain the names of those employees, the relevant dates, nor the circumstances surrounding the alleged harassment.\n[210] Prior to the first week of hearing, the Tribunal made an order directing Ms. Stanger to provide an amended SOP that described in detail any actions, words and\/or deeds that constituted, in her view, \u201charassment\u201d and\/or \u201cdiscrimination\u201d. Ms. Stanger complied with the order, and a revised, 58 page SOP was re-submitted. The amended SOP added twenty-one separate incidents of alleged harassment, in addition to the allegations contained in her original SOP. The additional twenty-one incidents were described in detail, including dates, locations, and the names of others involved. At the hearing, however, Ms. Stanger did not give any evidence for nine of the incidents alleged in her revised SOP.\n[211] Ms. Stanger claimed she was previously reluctant to provide such details because she felt the Respondent could not \u201cprotect\u201d her after she had made such allegations. However, it was never articulated from what Ms. Stanger felt she needed to be protected, nor was she able to describe what such protection might look like, even when I asked her at the hearing.\n[212] For the reasons outlined in the following section, I find Ms. Stanger\u2019s earlier failure to provide details to the Respondent was unreasonable.\nXIII. Complainant\u2019s Assertion of Respondent\u2019s Positive Duty to Act\n[213] Throughout her written submissions and at various times during the hearing, the Complainant alleged that Canada Post had a positive duty to investigate human rights abuses in the work place, and that it failed in such duty. This argument is very weak under the circumstances, because it pre-supposes a finding that harassment under s. 14 actually occurred. In this case, there has been no such finding.\n[214] The duty of an employer to investigate an allegation or an occurrence of workplace discrimination was considered by the Tribunal in Cassidy v. Canada Post Corporation et al. (2012 CHRT 29) at paragraphs 158 and 159:\n[158] A corporate (including governmental) respondent (analogous to vicarious liability under tort law) may be held liable for the discriminatory acts or harassment committed by its officers, directors, employees or agents acting in the course of their employment, pursuant to section 65 of the CHRA. This is so unless the respondent employer can show it did not consent to the discriminatory practice, and exercised \u201call due diligence\u201d to prevent it and mitigate or avoid its effect. I should add that, in my view, the modifier \u201call\u201d before \u201cdue diligence\u201d does not require a standard of \u201cperfection\u201d in the exercise of its due diligence. Rather, the modifier requires that the corporate respondent exercised \u201creasonable\u201d due diligence all of the time. In Hinds v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Comm.)(1988), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/5683 (C.H.R.T.), at para. 41611, applying s. 48(6) of the CHRA [s. 65(2) as it then read], the Tribunal wrote:\nAlthough the C.H.R.A. does not impose a duty on an employer to maintain a pristine working environment, there is a duty upon an employer to take prompt and effectual action when it knows or should know of coemployees\u2019 conduct in the workplace amounting to racial harassment\u2026To avoid liability, the employer is obliged to take reasonable steps to alleviate, as best as it can, the distress arising within the work environment and to reassure those concerned that it is committed to the maintenance of a workplace free of racial harassment. A response that is both timely and corrective is called for and its degree must turn upon the circumstances of the harassment in each case. [Emphasis added.]\n[159] Included in this duty to mitigate is an examination of the steps taken by a corporate respondent to investigate, make findings and impose a resolution. In Sutton v. Jarvis Ryan Associates et al., 2010 HRTO 2421, at paras. 130-33, the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario dealt with a corporate respondent\u2019s duty to investigate a complaint of discrimination or harassment:\nIt is well established in the Tribunal\u2019s jurisprudence that an employer may be held liable for the way in which it responds to a complaint of discrimination.\nThe rationale underlying the duty to investigate a complaint of discrimination is to ensure that the rights under the Code are meaningful. As stated in Laskowska v. Marineland of Canada Inc., 2005 HRTO 30 (CanLII) (\u201cLaskowska\u201d), at para. 53:\nIt would make the protection under subsection 5(1) to be a discrimination-free work environment a hollow one if an employer could sit idly when a complaint of discrimination was made and not have to investigate it. If that were so, how could it determine if a discriminatory act occurred or a poisoned work environment existed? The duty to investigate is a \u2018means\u2019 by which the employer ensures that it is achieving the Code-mandated \u2018ends\u2019 of operating in a discrimination-free environment and providing its employees with a safe work environment.\nThe Tribunal\u2019s jurisprudence has established that the employer\u2019s duty to investigate is held to a standard of reasonableness, not correctness or perfection. In Laskowska, the Tribunal set out the relevant criteria for an employer to consider in its duty to investigate as:\n(1) Awareness of issues of discrimination\/harassment, Policy Complaint Mechanism and Training: Was there an awareness of issues of discrimination and harassment in the workplace at the time of the incident? Was there a suitable anti-discrimination\/harassment policy? Was there a proper complaint mechanism in place? Was adequate training given to management and employees?\n(2) Post-Complaint: Seriousness, Promptness, Taking Care of its Employee, Investigation and Action: Once an internal complaint was made, did the employer treat it seriously? Did it deal with the matter promptly and sensitively? Did it reasonably investigate and act; and\n(3) Resolution of the Complaint (including providing the Complainant with a Healthy Work Environment) and Communication: Did the employer provide a reasonable resolution in the circumstances? If the complainant chose to return to work, could the employer provide him\/her with a healthy, discrimination-free work environment? Did it communicate its findings and actions to the complainant?\nThe Tribunal in Laskowska also stated the following at para. 60:\nWhile the above three elements are of a general nature, their application must retain some flexibility to take into account the unique facts of each case. The standard is one of reasonableness, not correctness or perfection. There may have been several options \u2013 all reasonable \u2013 open to the employer. The employer need not satisfy each element in every case in order to be judged to have acted reasonably, although that would be the exception rather than the norm. One must look at each element individually and then in the aggregate before passing judgment on whether the employer acted reasonably.\n[215] In considering the three part test in Laskowska, supra, I will review the evidence regarding Canada Post\u2019s harassment policy. Ms. Ayers gave detailed evidence about the human rights awareness training given to all Canada Post employees. I am satisfied that Canada Post meets the first part of the Laskowska test by having an adequate human rights policy which ensures there was a general awareness of these issues in the workplace.\n[216] Regarding the second part of the Laskowska test, I am similarly satisfied that Canada Post had in place the appropriate mechanisms and responses to deal with a human rights complaint. The evidence of Ms. Ayers confirmed that the employer took all human rights complaints seriously and that they were acted upon forthwith. Ms. Stanger chose to not make a written complaint with details of her allegations as requested by Ms. Ayers. Therefore, there was no complaint to be investigated or resolved. However, Ms. Ayers did take steps to investigate Ms. Stanger\u2019s complaint and the documentary record shows the actions taken were prompt, sensitive and reasonable. I am satisfied that the second part of the Laskowska test is satisfied.\n[217] The third part of the Laskowska test, the resolution of the complaint and communication thereof, are not directly applicable to this case as there was no actionable complaint submitted by Ms. Stanger. In conclusion, I am satisfied that Canada Post did in fact discharge its corporate responsibility to have in place appropriate policy and mechanisms to investigate complaints of discrimination and harassment. Their policy was clear that harassment would not be tolerated. They exercised due diligence by taking reasonable steps to train and inform their employees about the policy to prevent harassment. Canada Post employed human rights experts trained to intervene and mitigate any instances of harassment or discrimination. I am satisfied that Canada Post would have fully investigated her complaints if Ms. Stanger had been cooperative. Under the circumstances, and based on Ms. Stanger\u2019s own admission that she was aware of the details of the No Harassment Policy, I find her failure to cooperate was not reasonable.\n[218] Until this Tribunal specifically directed Ms. Stanger to provide detailed particulars of her allegations, she resisted doing so. Although she may have had her reasons, they were never clear to me. If Ms. Stanger was fearful of violent or threatening reprisal, she did not so indicate when asked about this possibility at the hearing. There was no convincing evidence presented to support a conclusion that the workplace at VicMPP was unsafe.\nXIV. Conclusion\n[219] Notwithstanding the multiple allegations of the Complainant, I find that only one aspect of the complaint is substantiated: the allegation concerning the denial of the CLDP opportunity. As mentioned above, the parties and the Tribunal agreed to bifurcate the hearing so as to only address remedy in the event the complaint was found to be substantiated. As this part of Ms. Stanger\u2019s complaint is substantiated, the parties are to follow the remedy instructions outlined in paragraphs 89-91.\nSigned by\nDavid L.

Conclusion 8\nV. Further observations 9\nI. The complaint and the motion\n[1] On November 30, 2012, Serge Lafreni\u00e8re (the Complainant) filed a complaint under the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) against Via Rail Canada Inc. (the Respondent).\n[2] On August 10, 2016, after investigation, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) referred the complaint filed by the Complainant to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) for inquiry under section 7 of the CHRA.\n[3] In essence, the Complainant alleges that he was treated differently and that he had unfairly accumulated penalty points in his disciplinary file, all of which led to his dismissal on October 5, 2012.\n[4] In his original complaint, the Complainant alleges his sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[5] The Commission, in its referral to the Tribunal and its Statement of Particulars, raises two grounds of discrimination: sexual orientation and disability.\n[6] In the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars, only the ground of disability is raised.\n[7] On January 17, 2017\u2014a week before the first case management conference call for this case\u2014counsel for the Respondent filed four preliminary motions, including a motion to strike.\n[8] During the case management conference call held on January 24, 2017, the Tribunal informed the parties that it would first deal with the motion to strike, once it had received written submissions from all parties.\n[9] The Tribunal also asked the Complainant to make the prohibited grounds of discrimination raised in his complaint clear in his written submissions.\nII. The issues\n[10] The Tribunal has identified the following issues arising from the filing of the Respondent\u2019s motion to strike:\n(a) First, in order to narrow the scope of the discussion, what are the prohibited grounds of discrimination to be heard by the Tribunal at the hearing?\n(b) Can the Tribunal dismiss part of the complaint before the start of the hearing?\n(c) Should the Tribunal grant the Respondent\u2019s motion to strike and strike paragraphs 4 to 53 of the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars, grant part of the motion and strike only part of those paragraphs, or dismiss the motion entirely?\nIII. Analysis\nA. What are the prohibited grounds of discrimination to be heard by the Tribunal at the hearing?\n[11] During the case management conference call, the Tribunal made it clear to the parties that there appeared to be a discrepancy between the prohibited grounds of discrimination raised in the original complaint (sexual orientation), the Commission\u2019s Statement of Particulars (sexual orientation and disability), and the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars (disability).\n[12] The Tribunal informed the Complainant that, in his response to the motion to strike, he should clarify which grounds correspond to each of the allegations of discrimination that he intends to raise in this complaint.\n[13] The Tribunal requested that the Commission contact the Complainant after the conference call to ensure that he understood the correct procedure regarding grounds of discrimination. The Commission agreed to do so.\n[14] Upon reading the written submissions (responses to the motion to strike) submitted by the Complainant and the Commission, it appears that only the ground of disability is now being raised by the Complainant in this case.\n[15] The Tribunal therefore concludes that only this ground will be considered at the hearing of this case and that the debate is thus limited to this sole ground of discrimination.\nB. Can the Tribunal dismiss part of the complaint before the start of the hearing?\n[16] The case law in this regard is clear. In the past, the Federal Court and the Tribunal have clearly expressed the view that the Tribunal may dismiss a complaint in whole or in part before holding a full hearing on the merits, provided that the process is fair and respects the rules of natural justice, and that the parties have had full and ample opportunity to present the necessary evidence to determine the issues raised by the motion to strike. (See Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FC 445; Murray v. Immigration and Refugee Board, 2013 CHRT 2; and Emmett v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2013 CHRT 12).\n[17] In light of these principles, the Tribunal will now review parts of the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars to determine whether they should be struck.\nC. Should the Tribunal grant the Respondent\u2019s motion to strike and strike paragraphs 4 to 53 of the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars, grant part of the motion and strike only parts of those paragraphs, or dismiss the motion entirely?\n[18] The CHRA and the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure do not specifically provide for striking a Statement of Particulars. This concept originates from the civil litigation process before the courts. In Bailie et al. v. Air Canada and Air Canada Pilots Association, 2011 CHRT 17, the Tribunal explained it as follows:\n[22] Perhaps the Tribunal should consider the legal tests and practices before other human rights tribunals in Canada before resorting to the courts\u2019. There are strong policy reasons why the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure contain only ten rules, whereas the Federal Courts Rules are over 500 in number. Notably, there is also a statutory basis as subsection 48.9(1) of the CHRA provides: \u201cProceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\u201d (See also Rule 1(1)c)).\n[19] The Respondent submits that paragraphs 4 to 53 of the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars concern issues that are not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and are therefore irrelevant. The Respondent submits that the Complainant is using these paragraphs in an attempt to demonstrate the cause of his disability\u2014an area over which the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction\u2014and that it is not within its jurisdiction to determine the reason for the Complainant\u2019s disability.\n[20] The Complainant and the Commission plead that the motion to strike should be rejected.\n[21] The Commission argues that the motion is unfounded in fact and in law, and that the Complainant\u2019s complaint is based on his dismissal on a prohibited ground of discrimination\u2014his disability. As a result, [translation] \u201cMr. Lafreni\u00e8re\u2019s complete disciplinary record is before the Tribunal.\u201d\n[22] The Commission also refers the Tribunal to the reasons for its request that the Tribunal institute an inquiry into the Complainant\u2019s complaint, citing the following excerpt in particular from its decision:\n[translation]\n[I]f the Respondent knew or should have known that the Complainant, who had no disciplinary record for years but who suddenly accumulated several penalty points, had no mental disability for which he needed accommodation.\n[23] The Commission explains in paragraph 17 of its response to the motion that [translation] \u201cthe Commission specifically asked the Tribunal to look into Mr. Lafreni\u00e8re\u2019s dismissal and his disciplinary record.\u201d It is important to note that the Chairperson of the Tribunal did not receive a copy of the Commission\u2019s reasons with its request to institute an inquiry. The scope of the referral is determined by the letter the Commission files with the Chairperson of the Tribunal along with a copy of the complaint; it is this letter that initiates the Tribunal inquiry process (see Bentley v. Air Canada and the Air Canada Pilots Association, 2016 CHRT 17, paragraph 4). The request to institute an inquiry dated August 22, 2016, referred the whole complaint to the Tribunal, which could include the issue of the Complainant\u2019s disciplinary record. In any case, the Commission\u2019s reasons in its response to the motion to strike clarify one of the main reasons for the request to initiate an inquiry.\n[24] The Complainant alleges in paragraph 18 of his representations on the motion, and not in his Statement of Particulars, [translation] \u201c\u2026 [that] there is written evidence of the Complainant\u2019s disability dating back to November 2011, and even earlier.\u201d\n[25] At the beginning of his representations on the motion, the Complainant also confirms in paragraph (d) that he had a mental disability that the Respondent should have been aware of because he disclosed it several times in the year preceding his dismissal [my emphasis]. Moreover, he claims in paragraph (e) that the Respondent intentionally refused to take his disability into account.\n[26] At paragraph 19 of his Statement of Particulars, the Complainant states that his last year of employment with the Respondent corresponds to the period when he had a mental disability. If one accepts that the Respondent dismissed him on October 5, 2012, according to paragraph 74 of his Statement, this means that he is claiming to have had a disability from October 6, 2011.\n[27] In light of the above, I must categorize the paragraphs of the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars covered by the motion in the following manner:\nFirst, the paragraphs dealing with the alleged causes of his disability and in which the Complainant attempts to establish a causal link between the Respondent\u2019s actions and the Complainant\u2019s disability, or dealing with an incident that occurred at work that does not seem to be related to the alleged disability (staffing April 2011) (paragraphs 4 to 9; paragraphs 10 to 18 and 39 to 53); and\nSecond, the other paragraphs (19 to 26 and 27 to 38), which deal with an incident or with disciplinary action or the accumulation of disciplinary action in his record during his last year of employment with the Respondent, during the period of his alleged disability (from October 6, 2011 to October 5, 2012).\n(i) Paragraphs dealing with the alleged causes of the Complainant\u2019s disability or with an incident at work that does not seem to be related to his alleged disability\n[28] First, paragraphs 4 to 9 refer to a job application dated April 2011, which does not seem to have led to disciplinary action or occurred during the period of the Complainant\u2019s alleged disability. The relevance of these allegations is therefore questionable.\n[29] An inquiry into the allegations in paragraphs 4 to 9, which would require a hearing of the evidence to find the Respondent responsible and reply evidence from the Respondent to defend itself, would not help in disposing of the issue before the Tribunal. If the Complainant wishes to testify about these allegations to provide [translation] \u201ccontext\u201d and if this helps him tell his story, that is his choice, but the Respondent should not feel obliged to respond to or to rebut each of his allegations to avoid being found responsible by the Tribunal.\n[30] As for the paragraphs dealing with the alleged causes of the Complainant\u2019s disability, the Tribunal does not believe there to be a need to establish a causal link between the Respondent\u2019s alleged actions and the Complainant\u2019s disability, unless these actions can be characterized as discriminatory practices within the meaning of the CHRA, which does not seem to be the case based on the Tribunal\u2019s reading of the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars.\n[31] What is relevant for the Tribunal is whether a prohibited ground of discrimination under the CHRA, in this case, disability, was a factor in the decisions (disciplinary action and dismissal) made by the Respondent during the alleged period of disability.\n[32] In other words, were the actions taken in regard to the Complainant during his alleged period of disability discriminatory because they did not take his disability into account? Anything that concerns the cause of the disability, as described by the Complainant, is irrelevant.\n[33] Consequently, the Complainant does not have to establish the cause of his disability before the Tribunal. He must, however, demonstrate that he had a disability when the impugned actions (disciplinary action and dismissal) were taken.\n[34] As indicated in paragraph 18 of this decision, the motion to strike adds a formality to the Tribunal\u2019s proceedings that is more appropriate in a civil litigation context. The Tribunal therefore does not object to the Complainant providing context for his complaint at the hearing by referring to paragraphs 10 to 18 and 39 to 53 of his Statement of Particulars and thus describing the work environment in which the impugned actions were taken, but he may not do so to establish and prove the Respondent\u2019s responsibility and thus require the Respondent to provide reply evidence.\n[35] The Tribunal adds, however, that part of paragraph 18 of the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars is relevant: [translation] \u201cI had to take a great deal of medication, and my doctor (Doctor Ben Haddad) ordered me not to work for a total of three months (from March 1, 2012, to June 7, 2012).\u201d\n(ii) Other paragraphs\n[36] Let us move on to the paragraphs dealing with an incident or disciplinary action and the accumulation of disciplinary action in the Complainant\u2019s disciplinary record during his last year of employment with the Respondent, during the period of his alleged disability (from October 6, 2011 to October 5, 2012).\n[37] Paragraphs 19 to 26 seem to describe a disciplinary incident that occurred in November 2011, which falls in the alleged period of disability. These allegations therefore seem relevant.\n[38] Paragraphs 27 to 38 refer to a physical incident that led to disciplinary action, but that occurred before the period of alleged disability, so, before October 6, 2011. The relevance of these allegations is therefore debatable. However, the Tribunal is reluctant to apply a very strict interpretation of the alleged period of disability in this case.\n[39] In fact, paragraphs 27 to 38 refer to incidents that occurred on September 19 and 24, 2011, that is, only a few days before the alleged period of disability, which, according to the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars, began on October 6, 2011. The Tribunal is reluctant to call into question the relevance of these paragraphs. At issue is not a physical injury, like a broken ankle, but a mental disability for which an exact date is much harder to establish.\n[40] This is why the Tribunal, respective of the spirit of the Rules of Procedure, which are much more flexible than the rules in civil litigation, finds that the allegations in these paragraphs are also relevant.\nIV. Conclusion\n[41] The Tribunal, aware of how important it is for the Complainant to properly establish the context of his allegations, but recognizing the lack of a causal link between a number of these allegations and a prohibited ground of discrimination, and in order to inquire into the complaint expeditiously, dismisses the Respondent\u2019s motion to strike, but concludes as follows:\nParagraphs 4 to 9 of the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars, which refer to a job application that did not have disciplinary consequences and that was made before the alleged period of disability, may be referred to at the hearing solely for context should the Complainant so wish, but not in order to establish the Respondent\u2019s responsibility;\nParagraphs 19 to 26 and 27 to 38, which concern disciplinary action taken during or close to the alleged period of disability, are relevant and will be heard by the Tribunal; the Complainant will have to establish them, and the Respondent will have to provide reply evidence;\nParagraphs 10 to 18 and 39 to 53, intended to establish a causal link between the Respondent\u2019s alleged actions and the Complainant\u2019s disability may be used by the Complainant should he so wish, solely to provide context but not to establish the Respondent\u2019s responsibility; and\nThe following portion of paragraph 18 of the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars is relevant and will be heard by the Tribunal: [translation] \u201cI had to take a great deal of medication, and my doctor (Doctor Ben Haddad) ordered me not to work for a total of three months (from March 1, 2012 to June 7, 2012).\u201d The Complainant will have to establish this, and the Respondent, provide reply evidence.\nV. Further observations\n[42] The Tribunal wishes to remind the parties that the documents related to their respective Statement of Particulars, or the Statement of Particulars of any other party involved, must all be disclosed (rule 6 of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure). The Rules of Procedure provide for ongoing disclosure of such documents (rule 6(5)). However, if the documents in question raise new facts that were not raised in the parties\u2019 respective Statement of Particulars, a motion to amend the Statement of Particulars must first be filed with the Tribunal.\n[43] The Tribunal received an email from the Complainant on the evening of March 21, 2017, at 7:21 p.m., after having received all parties\u2019 written submissions on the motion to strike and after having begun drafting this decision. In this email, the Complainant states for the first time, and contrary to his original Statement of Particulars, that he has had a disability since December 9, 2010. The Tribunal needs to know with certainty as of when the Complainant alleges having a disability. If he deviates from his original Statement of Particulars, the Complainant must officially apply for leave from the Tribunal to amend it, before disclosing to the other parties the documents that are relevant to this amendment. If the Complainant files a motion to amend his Statement of Particulars, the other parties will then have an opportunity to submit their positions in writing, thus respecting the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness.\n[44] Such a motion to amend, if granted, could affect the Tribunal\u2019s decision on this motion to strike. The Tribunal reserves jurisdiction on the issues raised by this motion in the event of a motion to amend the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars.\nSigned by\nAnie Perrault\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nMarch\n30, 2017\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT2162\/3616\nStyle of Cause:\nSerge Lafreni\u00e8re v.

Hughes a \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 le 20 juin 2016, apr\u00e8s deux t\u00e9moins pour le plaignant, Levan Turner et Eric Christou.\n[4] Les probl\u00e8mes soulev\u00e9s par le plaignant ont trait \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation de notes manuscrites, dat\u00e9es du 12 octobre 2005 et du 15 f\u00e9vrier 2006, concernant l\u2019instance devant la Commission de la fonction publique et produites le 13 juin 2016 avec 11 questions (m\u00e9moire du plaignant, alin\u00e9a 5(i)). Deuxi\u00e8mement, le plaignant s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la production de notes additionnelles, dat\u00e9es du 6 f\u00e9vrier 2006 et du 29 ao\u00fbt 2006, prises durant l\u2019instance devant la Commission de la fonction publique et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites le 18 octobre 2016 (m\u00e9moire du plaignant, sous\u2011alin\u00e9as 5(i) et (ii)).\n[5] Le deuxi\u00e8me sujet de plainte a trait \u00e0 la d\u00e9position des t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019audience.\n[6] Les t\u00e9moins \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels le plaignant souhaite pr\u00e9senter une contre\u2011preuve sont les suivants :\nBarb Lennax : deux probl\u00e8mes avec son t\u00e9moignage sont relev\u00e9s \u00e0 la page 2 de l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate et aux pages 125 et 126 du m\u00e9moire du plaignant (sous\u2011alin\u00e9as 6(b) (i), (ii) et (iii)).\nRobert Farrell et Catherine Black: un probl\u00e8me avec leurs t\u00e9moignages est relev\u00e9 \u00e0 la page 2 de l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate, sous-alin\u00e9as 6(c) (i), (ii) et (iii), et aux pages 126 et 127 du m\u00e9moire du plaignant.\nMark Northcote : Un probl\u00e8me avec son t\u00e9moignage est relev\u00e9 \u00e0 la page 3 de l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate, alin\u00e9a 6(d), et \u00e0 la page 27 du m\u00e9moire du plaignant.\nRobert Farrell : Trois probl\u00e8mes avec son t\u00e9moignage sont relev\u00e9s \u00e0 la page 3, sous-alin\u00e9as 6(e)(i), (ii) et (iii), de l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate, et la page 128 du m\u00e9moire du plaignant.\nCatherine Black : Un probl\u00e8me avec son t\u00e9moignage est relev\u00e9 \u00e0 la page 5 de l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate, alin\u00e9a 6(f), et \u00e0 la page 129 du m\u00e9moire du plaignant.\nHolly Stoner : Un probl\u00e8me avec son t\u00e9moignage est relev\u00e9 \u00e0 la page 5 de l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate, alin\u00e9as 6(f), et \u00e0 la page 129 du m\u00e9moire du plaignant.\n[7] Les avocats du plaignant et de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont convenu que la jurisprudence cit\u00e9e par le plaignant dans son m\u00e9moire \u00e9nonce les principes qui r\u00e9gissent la contre-preuve.\nR v.

L\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une r\u00e9ponse et celle-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie par le plaignant. Les avocats ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations de vive voix \u00e0 Victoria le 7 mars 2017.\n[10] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les parties, bien que d\u2019accord sur le principe de la requ\u00eate, ne partagent pas le m\u00eame point de vue sur les faits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et sur la fa\u00e7on dont ils doivent \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019est pas \u00e9tonnant que la jurisprudence cit\u00e9e \u00e9taye les deux positions et qu\u2019elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battue de cette mani\u00e8re.\n[11] Le plaignant soutient que les questions soulev\u00e9es l\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il eut conclu sa preuve ou qu\u2019il y avait des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve auxquels il ne s\u2019attendait pas, ou que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont pris une plus grande importance \u00e0 la suite de la d\u00e9position du t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[12] L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne souscrit pas \u00e0 la qualification du plaignant et pr\u00e9tend que la preuve n\u2019\u00e9tait pas complexe et qu\u2019on aurait d\u00fb s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle soit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et que la requ\u00eate du plaignant pour faire valoir un droit de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la preuve ne vise qu\u2019\u00e0 renforcer son t\u00e9moignage, et que la preuve soumise par les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas pris plus d\u2019importance.\n[13] L\u2019avocat du plaignant soutient que le Tribunal doit \u00eatre tr\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019aff\u00fbt du \u00ab parfum subtil \u00bb de la discrimination et il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ceci \u00e0 la page 4 de son m\u00e9moire en r\u00e9ponse : [traduction] \u00ab \u00c0 chaque \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse, y compris l\u2019explication de l\u2019intim\u00e9, le Tribunal doit examiner attentivement l\u2019ensemble des circonstances de la plainte afin de pouvoir d\u00e9celer le \u2018parfum subtil\u2019 de la discrimination.\u00bb\n[14] De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9clare que la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une contre-preuve n\u2019est pas un droit mais une opportunit\u00e9 discr\u00e9tionnaire limit\u00e9e.\n[15] La pr\u00e9sente affaire dont est saisi le Tribunal tire son origine d\u2019une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant le 9 juillet 2008 et le 19 d\u00e9cembre 2011. Les affaires port\u00e9es devant le Tribunal le 27 juin 2012 suite \u00e0 la saisine du Tribunal de la pr\u00e9sente affaire sont des requ\u00eates concernant la divulgation, le caviardage de documents, de nombreuses t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rences de gestion de cas et des ajournements de l\u2019audience en raison d\u2019une divulgation tardive. En fin de compte, il y a eu environ six semaines de t\u00e9moignage.\n[16] \u00c0 l\u2019heure actuelle, il semble que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a qu\u2019une seule personne qui doive t\u00e9moigner, et, d\u00e8s que cette personne aura termin\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage, la preuve sera close sauf s\u2019il y a pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une contre-preuve ou d\u2019observations.\n[17] Ce qui est pr\u00e9occupant, c\u2019est que les parties n\u2019ont pas trait\u00e9 pleinement de la question de la divulgation relativement \u00e0 ce qui relevait de leur pouvoir ou ce qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre en possession de l\u2019autre partie. Suite \u00e0 la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a produit des notes de la CFP dat\u00e9es du 12 octobre 2005, du 15 f\u00e9vrier 2006, du 6 f\u00e9vrier 2006 et du 29 ao\u00fbt 2007. Cette consignation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant, mais avant la cl\u00f4ture de son plaidoyer.\n[18] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne n\u2019est pas li\u00e9 par les r\u00e8gles strictes de la preuve, mais par le principe d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9. La d\u00e9cision Chopra c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien\u2011\u00eatre social), 2001 CHRD 20) (onglet 8 du dossier de requ\u00eate du plaignant) applique la d\u00e9cision Barnasky c. D\u00e9veloppement des ressources humaines Canada:\n[traduction]\nIl ressort clairement de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne que le Tribunal n\u2019est pas li\u00e9 par les r\u00e8gles strictes de la preuve. Le Tribunal est toutefois li\u00e9 par le principe d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9. C\u2019est ce principe d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers toutes les parties qui d\u00e9limite la port\u00e9e et l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de la contre\u2011preuve.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 ne devrait pas \u00eatre l\u00e9s\u00e9 par la pr\u00e9sentation tardive d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ne font que confirmer ou \u00e9tayer les arguments de la plaignante et de la Commission. L\u2019obligation d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers l\u2019intim\u00e9 exige que la plaignante pr\u00e9sente sa preuve ou pr\u00e9sente la preuve sur laquelle elle entend se fonder pour faire valoir ses arguments lors de la pr\u00e9sentation initiale afin que l\u2019intim\u00e9 puisse y r\u00e9pondre pleinement.\nLa plaignante a le droit de pr\u00e9senter une contre-preuve pour r\u00e9pondre aux nouvelles questions ou aux nouveaux moyens de d\u00e9fense soulev\u00e9s par la partie adverse et auxquels la plaignante ne pouvait pas raisonnablement s\u2019attendre.\n[19] Les questions dont le Tribunal est saisi sont complexes et sont aggrav\u00e9es par le fait que l\u2019affaire a commenc\u00e9 en juin 2015 et que toutes les transcriptions de l\u2019instance ne sont pas disponibles. Toutefois, tout retard additionnel serait inacceptable.\n[20] Eu \u00e9gard aux r\u00e8gles r\u00e9gissant la contre-preuve telle que soumise, au fait que le pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne n\u2019est pas li\u00e9 par les r\u00e8gles strictes de pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve, et compte tenu de la doctrine d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers les parties, il est ordonn\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nA. Questions concernant les notes manuscrites\n[21] Les notes manuscrites concernant l\u2019instance devant la Commission de la fonction publique :\nLe 13 juin 2016, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des notes dat\u00e9es du 12 octobre 2005 et du 15 f\u00e9vrier 2006, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises par ses repr\u00e9sentants durant l\u2019instance devant la Commission de la fonction publique;\nLe 18 octobre 2016, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019autres notes prises par ses repr\u00e9sentants durant l\u2019instance devant la Commission de la fonction publique. Ces notes \u00e9taient dat\u00e9es du 6 f\u00e9vrier 2006 et du 29 ao\u00fbt 2006.\n[22] Le plaignant sera autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une contre-preuve relativement aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans son avis de requ\u00eate. Cette autorisation est accord\u00e9e dans la mesure o\u00f9 les notes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 un stade avanc\u00e9 de l\u2019instance et \u00e9taient des documents qui auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s au plaignant avant sa d\u00e9position.\n[23] Lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agira d\u2019interroger le plaignant, son avocat aura pour consigne de lui poser des questions directes et non pas des questions ouvertes. Le plaignant et son avocat sont avis\u00e9s, et on leur rappellera \u00e0 l\u2019audience qu\u2019ils ne pourront pas se servir de la contre-preuve pour d\u00e9velopper des th\u00e9ories de l\u2019affaire ou soumettre de longues versions de la preuve qui n\u2019ont rien \u00e0 voir avec des points pr\u00e9cis.\nB.

Monsieur Jean-Marc Malenfant (M. Malenfant ou le plaignant) d\u00e9pose, le 5 avril 2017, une demande similaire. Vid\u00e9otron a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ses repr\u00e9sentations le 12 avril 2017 et s\u2019oppose aux demandes.\n[2] Vid\u00e9otron a affich\u00e9, en 2014, deux offres d\u2019emploi comme conseillers, ventes et services apr\u00e8s-ventes, \u00e0 Gatineau (13-1004 et 14-1004). Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour ces deux postes, mais n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu par Vid\u00e9otron au stade pr\u00e9liminaire du processus d\u2019embauche. M. Malenfant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 la Commission en vertu des articles 7 et 8 de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne (LCDP ou la Loi) pr\u00e9tendant que Vid\u00e9otron a agi de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi et ce, en raison de son \u00e2ge.\n[3] Pendant le processus de divulgation des documents potentiellement pertinents, plusieurs documents incluant des curriculum vitae de candidats embauch\u00e9s par Vid\u00e9otron sur les postes 13-1004 et 14-1004, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9chang\u00e9s entre les parties. Par contre, les coordonn\u00e9es des candidats n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises par Vid\u00e9otron consid\u00e9rant la nature personnelle et confidentielle de ces informations. La Commission et M. Malenfant d\u00e9sirent assigner cinq candidats ayant obtenus une offre d\u2019emploi aux postes 13-1004 et 14-1004 afin qu\u2019ils puissent t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Les noms de ces cinq candidats apparaissent dans la liste de t\u00e9moins du plaignant, transmise aux parties ainsi qu\u2019au Tribunal le 16 janvier 2017. Vid\u00e9otron s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la transmission des coordonn\u00e9es de ces dits candidats.\n[4] La question en litige est celle de savoir si le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (Tribunal) devrait ordonner \u00e0 Vid\u00e9otron de divulguer les informations demand\u00e9es par la Commission et le plaignant.\n[5] Le Tribunal a pris connaissance des repr\u00e9sentations de chaque partie et pour les motifs d\u00e9taill\u00e9s dans les paragraphes suivants, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 Vid\u00e9otron la transmission des curriculum vitae non caviard\u00e9s des cinq candidats ayant obtenus des emplois chez l\u2019intim\u00e9e et qui sont identifi\u00e9s par le plaignant dans sa liste des t\u00e9moins du 16 janvier 2017.\nII. Les positions des parties sur la requ\u00eate\nA. La Commission\n[6] La Commission pr\u00e9tend que le Tribunal a l\u2019autorit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire afin d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 Vid\u00e9otron la divulgation des coordonn\u00e9es des cinq candidats en question. Pour en arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, le Tribunal r\u00e9sume comme suit les principaux arguments de la Commission soumis dans ses repr\u00e9sentations \u00e9crites.\n[7] La Commission indique que les parties ont le droit \u00e0 une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re et cons\u00e9quemment, elles ont le droit de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui sont pertinents \u00e0 leur cause. Les parties doivent divulguer les documents ou informations qui sont potentiellement pertinents au litige, favorables ou non.\n[8] La Commission pr\u00e9tend que le seuil de la pertinence est peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 et la tendance du Tribunal est plut\u00f4t \u00e0 la divulgation des informations plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 la non-divulgation. La partie qui demande la divulgation doit d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien entre les \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e0 \u00e9tablir et les documents ou informations demand\u00e9s.\n[9] La Commission soumet, au surplus, qu\u2019une distinction importante existe entre la production et la recevabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience des documents et informations pertinents. Au stade de la production, seule la pertinence doit \u00eatre \u00e9tablie. La pertinence doit \u00eatre relative \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement.\n[10] Dans ses repr\u00e9sentations, la Commission propose au Tribunal de passer en revue la plainte afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir la pertinence des documents ou informations. Elle indique que les candidats sont n\u00e9cessaires afin de t\u00e9moigner notamment sur leurs comp\u00e9tences, leur \u00e2ge ainsi que le processus d\u2019embauche. Comme il s\u2019agit d\u2019une plainte en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi impliquant une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, une \u00e9tude comparative entre M. Malenfant et les candidats retenus par Vid\u00e9otron est n\u00e9cessaire.\n[11] La Commission argumente que l\u2019intrusion \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e invoqu\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019est pas un motif justifiant la non-divulgation des coordonn\u00e9es des candidats. Les documents potentiellement pertinents sont sujets \u00e0 divulgation et, dans un contexte de litige, font l\u2019objet d\u2019un engagement implicite de confidentialit\u00e9 ou peuvent faire l\u2019objet de toute autre ordonnance jug\u00e9e appropri\u00e9e afin d\u2019en assurer la confidentialit\u00e9.\n[12] Finalement, la Commission avance que les coordonn\u00e9es des candidats sont n\u00e9cessaires afin de les assigner comme t\u00e9moins dans le but d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Elle pr\u00e9tend que le d\u00e9faut de transmettre ces informations les privera, ainsi qu\u2019au plaignant, de l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter une preuve compl\u00e8te au Tribunal. La Commission demande donc au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de divulguer les coordonn\u00e9es (adresses et t\u00e9l\u00e9phones) des cinq candidats s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s.\nB. Le plaignant\n[13] M. Malenfant a transmis une demande dans le m\u00eame sens que celle de la Commission. Il demande au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de transmettre les coordonn\u00e9es des cinq candidats s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s. Le Tribunal peut r\u00e9sumer les principaux arguments de M. Malenfant comme suit.\n[14] Dans ses repr\u00e9sentations \u00e9crites, le plaignant indique qu\u2019il fait sien une grande partie des repr\u00e9sentations de la Commission. Il ajoute que les t\u00e9moignages des candidats sont essentiels afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination ainsi que d\u2019effectuer une analyse comparative des comp\u00e9tences, exp\u00e9riences de travail et \u00e2ge de chaque candidat. M. Malenfant avance \u00e9galement l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien direct entre l\u2019\u00e2ge d\u2019un individu et les exp\u00e9riences et comp\u00e9tences qui sont acquises avec le nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es de travail.\n[15] Le plaignant soumet qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e des candidats si leurs coordonn\u00e9es sont transmises et que les r\u00e8gles de confidentialit\u00e9 sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 applicables dans un contexte de litige. Il indique, au surplus, que le Tribunal a, si les circonstances le justifient, l\u2019autorit\u00e9 afin d\u2019ordonner des r\u00e8gles plus pr\u00e9cises quant \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 des informations.\n[16] M. Malenfant avance qu\u2019il est essentiel, afin de pouvoir pr\u00e9senter une preuve pleine et enti\u00e8re au Tribunal, d\u2019avoir acc\u00e8s aux coordonn\u00e9es des candidats s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s. Il estime qu\u2019une non-divulgation l\u2019emp\u00eachera d\u2019\u00e9tablir avec succ\u00e8s son fardeau de la preuve.\nC. L\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[17] Quant \u00e0 Vid\u00e9otron, elle s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la divulgation des coordonn\u00e9es personnelles des cinq candidats ayant re\u00e7u une offre d\u2019emploi pour les postes 13-1004 et 14-1004. Le Tribunal r\u00e9sume les principaux arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9e comme suit.\n[18] Tout d\u2019abord, Vid\u00e9otron soumet que la divulgation des coordonn\u00e9es n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire et que les requ\u00e9rants (la Commission et M. Malenfant) n\u2019ont pas justifi\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de divulguer ces informations.\n[19] Vid\u00e9otron indique que les informations sur les candidats font d\u00e9j\u00e0 partie du dossier du Tribunal et qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019entendre le t\u00e9moignage de ces tierces personnes au litige. Elle maintient que les curriculum vitae des candidats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis et ce faisant, toutes les parties ainsi que le Tribunal disposent des m\u00eames informations qu\u2019elle d\u00e9tenait personnellement afin de prendre sa d\u00e9cision dans son processus d\u2019embauche.\n[20] L\u2019intim\u00e9e argumente que la confirmation des comp\u00e9tences des candidats ainsi que leur \u00e2ge, en 2014, et la valeur probante potentielle \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 cette preuve, ne justifie pas une intrusion dans la vie priv\u00e9e de ces dits candidats. Il doit exister un lien rationnel entre les documents demand\u00e9s et les questions en litige et donc, l\u2019information doit avoir une pertinence probable sans, toutefois, \u00eatre sp\u00e9culative ni oppressive. Vid\u00e9otron soumet qu\u2019il faut se demander si les renseignements demand\u00e9s sont n\u00e9cessaires pour que la partie qui demande la divulgation puisse se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 faire valoir ses arguments devant le Tribunal.\n[21] Vid\u00e9otron rappelle que son processus d\u2019embauche s\u2019effectue en plusieurs \u00e9tapes. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de son processus d\u2019embauche est celle de la r\u00e9vision du curriculum vitae. Elle soumet que M. Malenfant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 passer \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du processus soit l\u2019entrevue t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique. Ce faisant, l\u2019analyse comparative devrait se faire dans le m\u00eame contexte, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la comparaison des curriculums vitae des candidats. Selon elle, ce qu\u2019ont v\u00e9cu les autres candidats dans les \u00e9tapes ult\u00e9rieures du processus n\u2019est pas pertinent. Comme M. Malenfant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 ces \u00e9tapes subs\u00e9quentes, les t\u00e9moignages de ces candidats sur ce sujet n\u2019est pas pertinent \u00e0 un fait, une question en litige ou un redressement recherch\u00e9.\n[22] Vid\u00e9otron mentionne \u00e9galement que la preuve doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on efficace et que les affaires devant le Tribunal doivent instruite de la fa\u00e7on la plus rapide possible. Elle estime que de permettre les t\u00e9moignages non pertinents rallongerait l\u2019audition d\u2019au moins trois jours.\n[23] Finalement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e indique que le droit au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e et de la confidentialit\u00e9 des informations est un aspect \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier dans un contexte d\u2019une demande de divulgation. Comme les candidats sont \u00e9trangers au litige, n\u2019y ont aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat, sont toujours employ\u00e9s de l\u2019entreprise et devront t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cette derni\u00e8re, ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments devraient \u00eatre pris en compte dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la requ\u00eate.\n[24] Vid\u00e9otron r\u00e9it\u00e8re qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00e0 une divulgation compl\u00e8te des informations de ces candidats, mais bien d\u2019une divulgation superflue. Selon elle, les requ\u00e9rants n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 et la pertinence du t\u00e9moignage de ces cinq candidats et une divulgation constituerait une entrave injustifi\u00e9e au droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e de ces tierces personnes.\nIII. Le droit et l\u2019analyse\n[25] Chaque partie a le droit \u00e0 une audition pleine et enti\u00e8re. \u00c0 cet effet, la LCDP pr\u00e9voit au para. 50(1) que :\n50(1) Le membre instructeur, apr\u00e8s avis conforme \u00e0 la Commission, aux parties et, \u00e0 son appr\u00e9ciation, \u00e0 tout int\u00e9ress\u00e9, instruit la plainte pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9; il donne \u00e0 ceux-ci la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations. [Le Tribunal souligne]\n[26] Ce droit inclut la divulgation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments pertinents dont les autres parties ont en leur possession ou sous leur contr\u00f4le (Guay c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2004 TCDP 34, para. 40). Les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (les R\u00e8gles) prescrivent \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 6(1) et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment aux paras. (d) et (e) que :\n6(1) Chaque partie doit signifier et d\u00e9poser dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le membre instructeur un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions indiquant :\n[\u2026]\nd) les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u2013 pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 \u2013 et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle;\ne) les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u2013 pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation est invoqu\u00e9 \u2013 et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle;\n[\u2026]\n[Le Tribunal souligne]\n[27] En mati\u00e8re de divulgation, le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 statu\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises que le principe directeur est celui de la pertinence probable ou possible (Bushey c. Sharma, 2003 TCDP 5 et Hughes c. Transport Canada, 2012 TCDP 26. Voir subsidiairement Guay, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e; Day c. Minist\u00e8re de la d\u00e9fense nationale et Hortie, 2002 CanLII 61833 ; Warman c. Bahr, 2006 TDCP 18; Seeley c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2013 TCDP 18). Le Tribunal rappelle que les parties ont l\u2019obligation de divulguer les documents potentiellement pertinents qu\u2019elles ont en leur possession (Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 42, para. 17).\n[28] Afin de d\u00e9montrer que des documents ou informations sont pertinents, le requ\u00e9rant doit d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien rationnel entre ceux-ci et les questions soulev\u00e9s en l\u2019occurrence (Warman, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, para. 6. Voir notamment Guay, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, para. 42; Hughes, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, para. 28; Seeley, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, para. 6). La pertinence s\u2019\u00e9value au cas par cas, en tenant compte des questions soulev\u00e9es dans chaque situation (Warman, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, para. 9. Voir aussi Seeley, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, para. 6). Le Tribunal rappelle que le seuil de la pertinence potentielle est peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 et la tendance actuelle se veut \u00e0 plus de divulgation que moins (Warman, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, para. 6. Voir \u00e9galement Rai c. Gendarmerie Royale du Canada, 2013 TCDP 36 para. 18). Bien entendu, la divulgation ne doit pas \u00eatre sp\u00e9culative ou \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une partie de p\u00eache (Guay, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, para. 43).\n[29] Le Tribunal rappelle que le stade de la production des documents est diff\u00e9rent du stade de leur admissibilit\u00e9 en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audition. Par le fait m\u00eame, la pertinence est une notion distincte. Comme l\u2019indique le Membre Michel Doucet, dans la d\u00e9cision Association des employ\u00e9(e)s des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications du Manitoba Inc. c. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 TCDP 28 (ci-apr\u00e8s AETM), au para. 4 :\n[4] \u2026La production de documents est assujettie au crit\u00e8re de la pertinence potentielle, qui n'est pas un crit\u00e8re tr\u00e8s exigeant. Il doit y avoir une certaine pertinence entre le document ou les renseignements demand\u00e9s et la question en litige. Il ne fait aucun doute qu'il est dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public de veiller \u00e0 ce que tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents soient disponibles dans le cadre d'une affaire comme celle en l'esp\u00e8ce. Une partie a le droit d'obtenir les renseignements ou les documents qui sont pertinents quant \u00e0 l'affaire ou qui pourraient l'\u00eatre. Cela ne veut pas dire que ces documents ou renseignements seront admis en preuve ou qu'on leur accordera une importance significative.\n[30] Ceci \u00e9tant dit, j\u2019ai pris connaissance des arguments des parties et vient \u00e0 la conclusion que les t\u00e9moignages des cinq candidats identifi\u00e9s par le plaignant dans sa liste des t\u00e9moins du 16 janvier 2017 sont potentiellement pertinents au litige.\n[31] Il est important de rappeler, comme le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal, David L. Thomas, l\u2019a bien soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Siddoo c. Syndicat international des d\u00e9bardeurs et magasiniers, section locale 502, 2015 TCDP 21, au para. 29, que :\n[29] Le Tribunal a reconnu la difficult\u00e9 de prouver des all\u00e9gations de discrimination par des preuves directes. Comme il est mentionn\u00e9 dans Basi c. Cie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 1988 CanLII 108 (TCDP) [Basi] : \u00ab La discrimination n\u2019est pas un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne qui se manifeste ouvertement, comme on serait port\u00e9 \u00e0 le croire. Il est rare en effet qu\u2019on puisse prouver par des preuves directes qu\u2019un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis intentionnellement. \u00bb Il faut plut\u00f4t prendre en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019ensemble des circonstances afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 dans Basi de \u00ab subtiles odeurs de discrimination \u00bb.\n[32] C\u2019est dans cette m\u00eame veine que je viens \u00e0 la conclusion que les t\u00e9moignages de ces cinq candidats peuvent \u00eatre potentiellement pertinents. Le fardeau serait \u00e9lev\u00e9, pour un plaignant, de d\u00e9montrer \u00e0 tous coups une preuve directe de discrimination. Les subtiles odeurs de discrimination peuvent d\u00e9couler des circonstances, prises dans leur ensemble. Encore faut-il que le plaignant ait l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de faire une preuve sur ces circonstances. Comme l\u2019indique la Commission aux paragraphes 19 et 20 de ses repr\u00e9sentations, les candidats devront \u00eatre entendus \u00ab notamment, mais pas exclusivement \u00bb, sur leur \u00e2ge, leurs comp\u00e9tences, leur curriculum vitae, mais aussi sur le processus d\u2019embauche [je souligne]. Les circonstances dans lesquelles s\u2019inscrit le processus d\u2019embauche de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pourraient \u00eatre potentiellement pertinent. Dans son expos\u00e9 des faits, pris dans son ensemble, le plaignant manifeste aussi cette m\u00eame id\u00e9e quant au processus de s\u00e9lection de Vid\u00e9otron qui, selon son interpr\u00e9tation, met volontairement de l\u2019avant ses pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences pour des candidats plus jeunes. \u00c0 cet effet, il fait un lien, aux paragraphes 19 \u00e0 22 de son expos\u00e9, entre la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 8 (publicit\u00e9 dans les demandes d\u2019emploi) et la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 7 (le refus d\u2019emploi) de la LCDP. Il manifeste l\u2019id\u00e9e que les motifs du refus sont teint\u00e9s de pr\u00e9somptions ou ne sont que des pr\u00e9textes dans le refus d\u2019embauche. Au surplus, M. Malenfant fait \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat O\u2019Malley c. Simpson-Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, qui expose la notion des effets indirects de la discrimination. Visiblement, le plaignant soul\u00e8ve des questions sur le processus d\u2019embauche et sur les circonstances l\u2019entourant.\n[33] Je ne suis pas d\u2019avis, comme l\u2019indique Vid\u00e9otron au paragraphe 23 de ces repr\u00e9sentations, que les t\u00e9moignages des candidats sur leur processus d\u2019embauche ou d\u2019autres informations non pr\u00e9sentes sur le curriculum vitae, sont aucunement pertinents au litige. Je rappelle que le seuil de la pertinence potentielle, \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape, est peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 d\u2019autant plus que celle-ci ne doit qu\u2019\u00eatre que potentielle ou probable.\n[34] Il est clair que les parties manifestent un d\u00e9saccord quant \u00e0 cette question de la divulgation des coordonn\u00e9es des cinq candidats s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s dont le Tribunal est saisi et que les parties ne s\u2019entendent pas sur la pertinence des t\u00e9moignages des cinq candidats s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s. Le stade de la production des documents ainsi que d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audition sont distinctes. J\u2019estime qu\u2019il serait pr\u00e9matur\u00e9, \u00e0 ce stade-ci, de refuser la divulgation des coordonn\u00e9es desdits candidats et de tirer imm\u00e9diatement une conclusion en affirmant que les t\u00e9moignages des candidats ne sont aucunement pertinents au litige et ce, sans avoir pu entendre la preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Si l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9sire faire des repr\u00e9sentations au sujet de la pertinence \u00e0 l\u2019audience, il lui sera loisible de le faire. Autrement, le pr\u00e9judice pour la Commission et plus particuli\u00e8rement, pour le plaignant, d\u2019un refus \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape-ci, pourrait \u00eatre important et avoir des r\u00e9percussions sur le fond du litige.\n[35] Quant \u00e0 la question de la confidentialit\u00e9 des informations personnelles et de la vie priv\u00e9es des cinq candidats s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s, j\u2019entends les arguments de Vid\u00e9otron. N\u00e9anmoins, il est \u00e9galement \u00ab [\u2026] dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public de veiller \u00e0 ce que tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents soient disponibles dans le cadre d\u2019une affaire comme celle en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00bb (AETM, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, para. 4). D\u2019autres moyens, comme l\u2019invite la Commission au paragraphe 21 et le plaignant, au paragraphe 11, de leurs repr\u00e9sentations respectives, peuvent \u00eatre pris afin de prot\u00e9ger autant que faire se peut les informations personnelles des candidats. \u00c0 ce stade-ci, aucune demande formelle d\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e par les parties. Celles-ci pourront, en temps et lieu, faire une telle demande si elles le jugent n\u00e9cessaire. Je signale \u00e9galement aux parties que d\u2019autres mesures pourraient \u00eatre prises lors de l\u2019instance afin de minimiser, dans la mesure du possible, la divulgation des renseignements personnels des candidats.\n[36] Finalement, je rappelle aux parties que l\u2019obligation de divulguer les documents concerne les documents qu\u2019elles ont en leur possession. Cons\u00e9quemment, l\u2019obligation ne s\u2019\u00e9tend pas \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation de documents \u00e0 des fins de divulgation (Gaucher, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, para. 17). Ce faisant, comme les coordonn\u00e9es existent et se retrouvent sur les curriculum vitae des cinq candidats s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s, j\u2019ordonnerai \u00e0 Vid\u00e9otron de transmettre les curriculum vitae sans que les coordonn\u00e9es ne soient caviard\u00e9es.\nIV. La d\u00e9cision et l\u2019ordonnance\n[37] Pour ces motifs j\u2019ordonne que Vid\u00e9otron transmette aux autres parties les curriculum vitae des cinq candidats s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s aux postes 13-1004 et 14-1004, de 2014, et identifi\u00e9es dans la liste des t\u00e9moins du plaignant, dat\u00e9e du 16 janvier 2017, \u00e0 son paragraphe 4, sans que leurs coordonn\u00e9es ne soient caviard\u00e9es.\nSign\u00e9e par\nGabriel Gaudreault\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nLe\n4 mai 2017\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal :\nT2131\/0516\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nJean-Marc Malenfant c.

La plainte et la requ\u00eate\n[1] Le 30 novembre 2012, Serge Lafreni\u00e8re (le plaignant) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP) contre Via Rail Canada Inc. (l\u2019intim\u00e9e).\n[2] Le 22 ao\u00fbt 2016, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission), apr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate, a renvoy\u00e9 pour instruction au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant en vertu de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP.\n[3] Essentiellement, le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment et qu\u2019il s\u2019est vu injustement d\u00e9cerner des points de p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 dans son dossier disciplinaire, le tout ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement le 5 octobre 2012. Le motif de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans ce dossier et retenu par le Tribunal est la d\u00e9ficience.\n[4] Le 30 mars 2017, le Tribunal a rendu la d\u00e9cision 2017 TCDP 9 sur une requ\u00eate en radiation d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 au plaignant, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u un courriel de sa part pendant que la d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait toujours en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, de d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate en amendement de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions s\u2019il le jugeait appropri\u00e9.\n[5] Une requ\u00eate en amendement a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 10 avril 2017 et les soumissions \u00e9crites de toutes les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ues par le Tribunal le 27 avril 2017.\nII. Les questions en litige\n[6] Le Tribunal rel\u00e8ve les questions suivantes suite au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la requ\u00eate en amendement de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant :\na) Les faits soulev\u00e9s par le plaignant dans sa requ\u00eate justifient-ils un amendement de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions?\nb) Quelles sont les r\u00e8gles entourant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de documents au soutien de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions?\nIII. Analyse\nA. Les faits soulev\u00e9s par le plaignant dans sa requ\u00eate justifient-ils un amendement de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions?\n[7] Il incombe au plaignant de convaincre le Tribunal que les faits nouveaux qu\u2019il apporte \u00e0 la connaissance du Tribunal serviront plus qu\u2019\u00e0 donner du contexte. Pour ce faire, il doit formuler des all\u00e9gations affirmant que les traitements in\u00e9quitables auxquels il fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence sont fond\u00e9s sur une d\u00e9ficience.\n[8] Le Tribunal rappelle ici la disposition de la LCDP invoqu\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce :\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\n(a) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\n(b) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\n[mes soulign\u00e9s]\n[9] La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de plaider un lien avec un motif de distinction illicite est donc pr\u00e9vue dans le libell\u00e9 m\u00eame de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP.\n[10] Il appert des soumissions \u00e9crites du plaignant que les faits nouveaux sont plut\u00f4t soulev\u00e9s pour expliquer sa d\u00e9ficience ou donner du contexte. Une fois de plus, le plaignant indique qu\u2019il cherche \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que sa d\u00e9ficience a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par des gestes r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[11] Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend dans sa requ\u00eate en amendement \u00eatre atteint de d\u00e9ficience depuis 2010. Il joint \u00e0 sa requ\u00eate des documents au soutien de sa pr\u00e9tention. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas d\u2019objection \u00e0 ce que sa p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e soit prolong\u00e9e. Par contre, le simple fait de plaider une p\u00e9riode prolong\u00e9e ne donne pas lieu \u00e0 une all\u00e9gation que les traitements in\u00e9quitables pr\u00e9tendument v\u00e9cus par le plaignant pendant sa p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9ficience l\u2019aient \u00e9t\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il avait cette d\u00e9ficience.\n[12] Pour faire valoir une all\u00e9gation d\u2019acte discriminatoire au sens de la LCDP relative \u00e0 un comportement ou une d\u00e9cision reproch\u00e9s, le plaignant doit au moins indiquer dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions que, selon lui, sa d\u00e9ficience a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de ce comportement ou de cette d\u00e9cision.\n[13] Le plaignant, aux paragraphes 15 et 16 de sa requ\u00eate en amendement, ne fait pas ce lien. Il pr\u00e9tend plut\u00f4t que les r\u00e9sultats du concours d\u2019embauche sont peut-\u00eatre une explication de sa condition : \u00ab le plaignant ne compte nullement tenter d\u2019expliquer la cause de sa d\u00e9ficience en parlant de l\u2019injustice qu\u2019il a subie\u2026.apr\u00e8s avoir entendu tous les pr\u00e9judices que la plaignant a subis\u2026.cette conclusion sera \u00e9vidente \u00bb.\n[14] Le fait d\u2019affirmer que les comportements ou d\u00e9cisions reproch\u00e9s se sont produits \u00ab durant la p\u00e9riode de sa d\u00e9ficience \u00bb ne satisfait pas \u00e0 l\u2019exigence de formuler un lien entre le motif de distinction illicite et l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable. Donc, ces all\u00e9gations (paras. 4 \u00e0 9 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant) ne pourront que servir d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments contextuels.\n[15] Comme le Tribunal l\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision du 30 mars 2017, ce qui est pertinent pour le Tribunal, c\u2019est de d\u00e9terminer si un motif de distinction illicite pr\u00e9vu par la LCDP, en l\u2019occurrence ici la d\u00e9ficience, a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans les d\u00e9cisions de mesures disciplinaires et de cong\u00e9diement prises par l\u2019intim\u00e9e durant la p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e [mes soulign\u00e9s] (Moore c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61, para. 33).\n[16] En d\u2019autres mots, les gestes pos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du plaignant pendant sa p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 discriminatoires parce qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas tenu compte de sa situation de d\u00e9ficience ou, alternativement, ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 discriminatoires parce qu\u2019ils v\u00e9hiculaient des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa d\u00e9ficience? Tout ce qui concerne la cause de cette d\u00e9ficience, telle que d\u00e9crite par le plaignant, n\u2019a pas de pertinence.\n[17] Ainsi, le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e0 faire la preuve de la cause de sa d\u00e9ficience au Tribunal. Il doit par contre faire la preuve qu\u2019il y avait effectivement d\u00e9ficience lorsque les gestes reproch\u00e9s aux termes de la LCDP (mesures disciplinaires et cong\u00e9diement) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9s.\n[18] Ainsi, la requ\u00eate en amendement du plaignant n\u2019en est pas vraiment une \u2013 le plaignant apporte plut\u00f4t un compl\u00e9ment d\u2019informations pouvant servir au contexte de la plainte et des pr\u00e9tentions du plaignant.\n[19] De plus, le plaignant d\u00e9bat de questions dans sa requ\u00eate qui ne pourront \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es qu\u2019apr\u00e8s que toute la preuve ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e et entendue lors de l\u2019audience. Le Tribunal ne s\u2019engage pas, lorsque saisi d\u2019une requ\u00eate en amendement de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, dans un examen de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 ou l\u2019exactitude des all\u00e9gations qui sont effectu\u00e9es. Cette d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration aura lieu uniquement \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019instruction du dossier.\n[20] Le Tribunal est donc en accord avec la conclusion de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en amendement du plaignant. Il n\u2019est pas suffisant pour le plaignant d\u2019all\u00e9guer qu\u2019il \u00e9tait atteint de d\u00e9ficience durant une certaine p\u00e9riode pour que tous les gestes pos\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9e durant cette p\u00e9riode soient discriminatoires.\nB. Quelles sont les r\u00e8gles entourant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de documents au soutien de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions\n[21] Le plaignant a joint, en annexe de sa requ\u00eate en amendement, des documents m\u00e9dicaux au soutien de ses pr\u00e9tentions, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il est atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience depuis au moins juin 2010. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des documents dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate du plaignant, en joignant le relev\u00e9 de pr\u00e9sence de ce dernier.\n[22] Il est vrai que la r\u00e8gle 6(1)(d) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal porte possiblement \u00e0 confusion, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle exige que les parties indiquent les divers documents pertinents en leur possession.\n[23] Cependant, la r\u00e8gle 6(4) pr\u00e9cise que les documents identifi\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 6(1)(d) ne sont pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au greffe [mes soulign\u00e9s]. On veut plut\u00f4t que les documents soient fournis \u00e0 toutes les parties impliqu\u00e9es au dossier (plaignant, intim\u00e9e et Commission). Ils ne doivent pas \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au Tribunal pendant la p\u00e9riode de divulgation pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[24] Le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des documents en preuve (sous forme de pi\u00e8ces) se fait seulement lors de l\u2019audience conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)(c), et aux paras. 50(4) et 50(5) de la LCDP.\nIV. Conclusion\n[25] Pour toutes ces raisons, le Tribunal r\u00e9it\u00e8re les conclusions de sa d\u00e9cision du 31 mars 2017 sur la requ\u00eate en radiation, et conclu que la requ\u00eate en amendement du plaignant doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[26] Les parties doivent se conformer aux conclusions du Tribunal. Toute r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements d\u00e9crits aux paragraphes 4 \u00e0 9, 10 \u00e0 18 (excluant la partie portant sur le billet m\u00e9dical) et 39 \u00e0 53 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant pourront servir de bases contextuelles uniquement lors de l\u2019audience si le plaignant le d\u00e9sire et non avec l\u2019objectif d\u2019\u00e9tablir la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[27] Les paragraphes 19 \u00e0 26 et 27 \u00e0 38, qui faisaient l\u2019objet de la requ\u00eate en radiation et qui portent sur une mesure disciplinaire ayant eu lieu pendant ou pr\u00e8s de la p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, de m\u00eame que tous les autres paragraphes de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant qui ne faisaient pas l\u2019objet de la requ\u00eate en radiation, sont pertinents et seront entendus par le Tribunal, et le plaignant devra en faire preuve et l\u2019intim\u00e9e devra en faire contre-preuve.\n[28] Les documents m\u00e9dicaux joints en annexe \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en amendement par le plaignant, ainsi que le document joint en annexe par l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, peuvent \u00eatre fournis aux autres parties, mais ils ne feront pas partie de la preuve au dossier \u00e0 moins d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience et re\u00e7us par le membre instructeur en conformit\u00e9 avec l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)(c) de la LCDP. Les autres parties auront alors l\u2019occasion de s\u2019objecter \u00e0 leur recevabilit\u00e9, s\u2019il y a lieu.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAnie Perrault\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nLe\n12 mai 2017\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal :\nT2162\/3616\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nSerge Lafreni\u00e8re c.

Pannu\nTable des mati\u00e8res\nI. Contexte 1\nII. Droit applicable 1\nIII. Analyse et d\u00e9cision 2\nI. Contexte\n[1] Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en divulgation compl\u00e8te des formulaires de renseignements sur les projets (FRP) pour les exercices se terminant le 31 mars 2013 et le 31 mars 2014. Les FRP sont des documents qui contiennent la description des projets, les montants d\u00e9pens\u00e9s, la date de r\u00e9alisation des projets et les priorit\u00e9s de la bande. Le plaignant fait valoir que ces renseignements sont pertinents, parce qu\u2019ils permettraient de d\u00e9terminer, dans une certaine mesure, quelles t\u00e2ches et quels projets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prioris\u00e9s et r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par la bande pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte.\n[2] L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que certains des renseignements demand\u00e9s ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis. Elle pr\u00e9cise que les employ\u00e9s de la bande ont fouill\u00e9 dans leurs dossiers et n\u2019arrivent pas \u00e0 trouver les FRP demand\u00e9s. Ils croient que si les FRP se trouvaient dans le bureau de la bande, ils en ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9s par des membres de la bande lors de la prise en charge du bureau, et affirment qu\u2019ils ne sont plus en leur possession. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une qu\u00eate \u00e0 l\u2019aveuglette de renseignements qui ne sont pas pertinents dans le contexte de la plainte.\n[3] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne souscrit aux arguments du plaignant, selon lesquels les documents demand\u00e9s aideraient \u00e0 clarifier les faits entourant le remplacement du r\u00e9servoir \u00e0 eau au foyer 1502 de la bande et l\u2019installation de la rampe d\u2019acc\u00e8s au foyer 1502 de la bande, ainsi que la demande de r\u00e9paration de la rampe d\u2019acc\u00e8s pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant pour que celle-ci puisse \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e. Les documents fourniraient des renseignements qui aideraient le Tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer les autres projets qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prioris\u00e9s et r\u00e9alis\u00e9s pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte. Les documents sont donc pertinents pour permettre au Tribunal d\u2019examiner les explications donn\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9e et les arguments de d\u00e9fense qu\u2019elle a formul\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, notamment en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question de la contrainte excessive.\nII. Droit applicable\n[4] Il doit exister un lien rationnel entre les documents et les questions (pertinence probable). La demande de renseignements ne doit pas \u00eatre sp\u00e9culative ou s\u2019apparenter \u00e0 une recherche \u00e0 l\u2019aveuglette, et les documents devraient \u00eatre identifi\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on minutieuse (Guay c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada), 2004 TCDP 34, aux paras. 42 \u00e0 44).\n[5] Une partie doit d\u00e9montrer non pas que la preuve est pertinente au sens traditionnel du mot, mais que la divulgation du document sera utile, est appropri\u00e9e, susceptible de faire progresser le d\u00e9bat et repose sur un objectif acceptable qu\u2019elle cherche \u00e0 atteindre dans le dossier, et que le document se rapporte au litige (Syndicat canadien des communications, de l\u2019\u00e9nergie et du papier c. Bell Canada, 2005 TCDP 34, au para. 11).\n[6] Bien que le crit\u00e8re de base pour \u00e9tablir la pertinence soit facile \u00e0 remplir et que la tendance qui se dessine maintenant favorise une communication de documents plus \u00e9tendue, il doit n\u00e9anmoins \u00eatre \u00e9tabli un lien entre les questions \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer et les documents demand\u00e9s (Warman c. Bahr, 2006 TCDP 18, aux paras. 6, 7 et 9).\n[7] Les parties qui se pr\u00e9sentent devant le Tribunal doivent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leurs arguments. \u00c0 cette fin, chaque partie exige entre autres, avant l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire, la divulgation des renseignements potentiellement pertinents qui se trouvent en la possession ou sous la garde de la partie adverse. Avec les faits et les questions que pr\u00e9sentent les parties, la divulgation de renseignements potentiellement pertinents permet \u00e0 celles-ci de conna\u00eetre les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui leurs sont reproch\u00e9s et, ainsi, de se pr\u00e9parer convenablement \u00e0 l\u2019audition. Pour cette raison, s\u2019il existe un lien logique entre un document et les faits, les questions ou les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par les parties en cause, ce document doit \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9 (Yaffa c. Air Canada, 2014 TCDP 22, au para. 3).\nIII. Analyse et d\u00e9cision\n[8] La requ\u00eate en divulgation du plaignant satisfait au crit\u00e8re de base relatif \u00e0 la pertinence, et les renseignements demand\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s. Il existe un lien rationnel entre les renseignements demand\u00e9s et les faits et questions mentionn\u00e9s par les parties. La demande ne s\u2019apparente pas \u00e0 une qu\u00eate \u00e0 l\u2019aveuglette, car les renseignements demand\u00e9s donneraient aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leurs arguments.\n[9] Je reconnais que l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que les renseignements en question ne sont peut-\u00eatre plus en sa possession. Par contre, il pourrait \u00eatre possible d\u2019obtenir des copies de ces documents des minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux concern\u00e9s. En vertu du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que me conf\u00e8rent les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03-05-04), je rends la d\u00e9cision suivante :\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e doit prendre toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour fournir les renseignements demand\u00e9s dans la requ\u00eate du plaignant; elle doit notamment demander au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral les documents qui ne sont pas en sa possession.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e doit fournir les renseignements aux parties dans les quatre (4) semaines suivant la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nLes parties doivent participer \u00e0 une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance \u00e0 une date qui sera fix\u00e9e par le Tribunal pour discuter, avant l\u2019audience, des questions relatives \u00e0 la divulgation et \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure, entre autres.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAlex G.

Ordonnances 56\nI. Requ\u00eates visant des mesures d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diates li\u00e9es au principe de Jordan\n[1] Jordan River Anderson de la Nation crie de Norway House souffrait de graves probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 \u00e0 sa naissance. Comme peu de services m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9taient offerts au sein de sa collectivit\u00e9, sa famille s\u2019est tourn\u00e9e vers les services de protection de l\u2019enfance de la province afin qu\u2019il puisse recevoir les soins m\u00e9dicaux dont il avait besoin. Apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 les deux premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es de sa vie \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital, Jordan aurait pu \u00eatre plac\u00e9 dans un foyer d\u2019accueil sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement o\u00f9 il recevait des soins, \u00e0 Winnipeg. Cependant, pendant deux ans, Affaires autochtones et du Nord Canada (AANC), Sant\u00e9 Canada et la province du Manitoba ont d\u00e9battu de la question de savoir qui devrait payer pour les co\u00fbts du foyer d\u2019accueil de Jordan. Finalement, Jordan est rest\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de cinq ans; il a pass\u00e9 toute sa vie \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital.\n[2] Le principe de Jordan, qui s\u2019appuie sur l\u2019histoire de Jordan, veut que dans les cas o\u00f9 un service gouvernemental est offert \u00e0 tous les autres enfants, mais qu\u2019un conflit de comp\u00e9tence surgit entre le Canada et une province ou un territoire ou encore entre diff\u00e9rents minist\u00e8res concernant les services fournis \u00e0 l\u2019enfant d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation, le premier minist\u00e8re contact\u00e9 est celui qui paie pour les services et peut demander un remboursement \u00e0 l\u2019autre minist\u00e8re ou gouvernement, une fois que l\u2019enfant a re\u00e7u les dits services. Ce principe de l\u2019enfant d\u2019abord a pour but d\u2019emp\u00eacher que des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations se voient refuser des services publics essentiels ou tardent \u00e0 recevoir de tels services. Le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2007, la Chambre des communes a appuy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9 une motion portant que le gouvernement devrait imm\u00e9diatement adopter le principe de l\u2019enfant d\u2019abord, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le principe de Jordan, afin de r\u00e9soudre les conflits de comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de services aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations.\n[3] Les plaignantes et les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es (\u00e0 l\u2019exception d\u2019Amnistie internationale) ont toutes d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pour contester, entre autres choses, la fa\u00e7on dont le Canada a appliqu\u00e9 le principe de Jordan suite \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision et les ordonnances de la pr\u00e9sente formation rendues dans l\u2019affaire Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada et autres c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (pour le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), 2016 TCDP 2 (la \u00ab d\u00e9cision \u00bb). Le Canada et la Commission ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ces requ\u00eates. Les requ\u00eates ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendues du 22 au 24 mars 2017, \u00e0 Ottawa. Comme lors de l\u2019audience sur le fond, l\u2019audition de ces requ\u00eates a \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9e sur le R\u00e9seau de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision des peuples autochtones (le RTPA).\n[4] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate porte express\u00e9ment sur les all\u00e9gations de non\u2011conformit\u00e9 et les demandes connexes pour que d\u2019autres ordonnances soient rendues concernant le principe de Jordan. Les autres aspects des requ\u00eates des parties, qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, seront examin\u00e9s dans le cadre d\u2019une autre d\u00e9cision.\nII. Conclusions et ordonnances rendues jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant relativement au principe de Jordan\n[5] Dans la d\u00e9cision, la formation a jug\u00e9 que la d\u00e9finition et la mise en \u0153uvre du principe de Jordan par le Canada \u00e9taient \u00e9troites et inad\u00e9quates, ce qui entra\u00eenait des lacunes dans la prestation de services, des d\u00e9lais et des refus pour les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Des d\u00e9lais \u00e9taient inh\u00e9rents au processus de traitement des cas potentiels vis\u00e9s par le principe de Jordan. En outre, l\u2019approche du gouvernement du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des cas vis\u00e9s par le principe de Jordan \u00e9tait ax\u00e9e uniquement sur les conflits entre les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux concernant des enfants atteints de multiples d\u00e9ficiences, plut\u00f4t que sur les conflits de comp\u00e9tence (y compris entre les minist\u00e8res du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral) impliquant tous les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations (et pas seulement ceux souffrant de d\u00e9ficiences multiples). Par cons\u00e9quent, AANC a re\u00e7u ordre de prendre des mesures pour appliquer imm\u00e9diatement le principe de Jordan, en lui donnant sa pleine port\u00e9e et tout son sens (voir la d\u00e9cision, aux paragraphes 379 \u00e0 382, 458 et 481). La d\u00e9cision et les ordonnances connexes n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9es dans le cadre d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[6] Trois mois apr\u00e8s que la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, AANC et Sant\u00e9 Canada ont indiqu\u00e9 avoir entam\u00e9 des discussions concernant ce processus en vue d\u2019\u00e9largir la d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan, d\u2019am\u00e9liorer sa mise en \u0153uvre et de cibler d\u2019autres partenaires qui devraient prendre part \u00e0 ce processus. Ils ont pr\u00e9vu qu\u2019un d\u00e9lai de 12 mois serait n\u00e9cessaire pour amener les Premi\u00e8res Nations, les provinces et les territoires \u00e0 participer \u00e0 ces discussions et concevoir des options en vue d\u2019apporter des modifications au principe de Jordan.\n[7] Dans une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate subs\u00e9quente (2016 TCDP 10), la formation a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que son ordonnance enjoignait au gouvernement de mettre en \u0153uvre imm\u00e9diatement le principe de Jordan en lui donnant sa pleine port\u00e9e et tout son sens et non d\u2019entamer imm\u00e9diatement des discussions en vue de revoir la d\u00e9finition \u00e0 long terme. Nous avons fait observer qu\u2019il existe d\u00e9j\u00e0 une d\u00e9finition valable du principe de Jordan, adopt\u00e9e par la Chambre des communes, et qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune raison pour laquelle cette d\u00e9finition ne pourrait pas \u00eatre mise en \u0153uvre imm\u00e9diatement. AANC a re\u00e7u l`ordre de consid\u00e9rer imm\u00e9diatement le principe de Jordan comme incluant tous les conflits de comp\u00e9tence (y compris ceux qui opposent des minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux) et visant tous les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations (pas seulement ceux atteints de d\u00e9ficiences multiples). La formation a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 que l\u2019organisme gouvernemental qui est contact\u00e9 en premier devrait payer le service sans devoir proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen au regard des politiques ni tenir de conf\u00e9rences sur le cas avant qu\u2019un financement soit fourni (voir la d\u00e9cision 2016 TCDP 10, aux paragraphes 30 \u00e0 34). L\u00e0 encore, la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate et les ordonnances connexes n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9es dans le cadre d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[8] Par la suite, AANC a indiqu\u00e9 avoir pris les mesures suivantes afin d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter l\u2019ordonnance de la formation :\nle Minist\u00e8re a corrig\u00e9 son interpr\u00e9tation du principe de Jordan pour qu\u2019il ne se limite plus aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations dans les r\u00e9serves qui ont des d\u00e9ficiences multiples n\u00e9cessitant les soins de diff\u00e9rents fournisseurs de services;\nil a corrig\u00e9 son interpr\u00e9tation du principe de Jordan pour qu\u2019il s\u2019applique \u00e0 tous les conflits de comp\u00e9tence et qu\u2019il englobe d\u00e9sormais ceux qui entre les minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux;\nla prestation de services dans toute affaire vis\u00e9e par le principe de Jordan ne sera pas retard\u00e9e en raison de conf\u00e9rences sur le cas ou d\u2019examens au regard des politiques;\ndes comit\u00e9s de travail compos\u00e9s de fonctionnaires, de directeurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et de sous-ministres adjoints de Sant\u00e9 Canada et d\u2019AANC assureront la supervision, guideront la mise en \u0153uvre de la nouvelle application du principe de Jordan et offriront une fonction d\u2019appel.\n[9] En outre, le Minist\u00e8re a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il entamerait des discussions avec les Premi\u00e8res Nations, les provinces et le Yukon concernant une strat\u00e9gie \u00e0 long terme. De plus, AANC a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il produirait un rapport annuel sur le principe de Jordan, qui fera \u00e9tat, entre autres, du nombre de cas ayant fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un suivi et du montant des fonds d\u00e9pens\u00e9s pour traiter de cas particuliers. AANC a \u00e9galement mis \u00e0 jour son site Web pour refl\u00e9ter les changements susmentionn\u00e9s et a affich\u00e9 les coordonn\u00e9es des personnes \u00e0 contacter dans les cas vis\u00e9s par le principe de Jordan.\n[10] Bien que la formation se r\u00e9jouissait de ces changements et des investissements pr\u00e9vus en vue de donner sa pleine port\u00e9e et tout son sens au principe de Jordan, elle avait encore quelques questions en suspens concernant les consultations et la mise en \u0153uvre int\u00e9grale. Dans la d\u00e9cision 2016 TCDP 16, la formation a demand\u00e9 des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 AANC concernant ses consultations sur le principe de Jordan et le processus de gestion des cas vis\u00e9s par ce principe. En outre, elle a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 AANC de fournir \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des Premi\u00e8res Nations et des organismes des Services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations (SEFPN) les noms et les coordonn\u00e9es des responsables du principe de Jordan dans chacune des r\u00e9gions.\n[11] Enfin, la formation a fait remarquer que la nouvelle formulation du principe de Jordan par AANC semblait, encore une fois, plus restrictive que celle retenue par la Chambre des communes. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, AANC limite l\u2019application du principe aux \u00ab enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves \u00bb (plut\u00f4t que de l\u2019appliquer \u00e0 tous les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations), de m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab ceux atteints de probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 et ceux qui pr\u00e9sentent un probl\u00e8me sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 court terme qui n\u00e9cessite une aide sociale et m\u00e9dicale \u00bb. La formation a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 AANC d\u2019appliquer imm\u00e9diatement le principe de Jordan \u00e0 tous les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations et non seulement \u00e0 ceux qui vivent dans les r\u00e9serves. Pour \u00eatre en mesure d\u2019\u00e9valuer pleinement les r\u00e9percussions de la formulation du principe de Jordan d\u2019AANC, la formation a \u00e9galement ordonn\u00e9 au Minist\u00e8re d\u2019expliquer pourquoi il a formul\u00e9 sa d\u00e9finition du principe de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il s\u2019applique uniquement aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations [traduction] \u00ab atteints de probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 et \u00e0 ceux qui pr\u00e9sentent un probl\u00e8me sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 court terme qui n\u00e9cessite une aide sociale et m\u00e9dicale \u00bb (voir la d\u00e9cision 2016 TCDP 16, aux paragraphes 107 \u00e0 120). Cette troisi\u00e8me d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate n\u2019a pas, non plus, \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e dans le cadre d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\nIII. Mesures suppl\u00e9mentaires prises par le Canada en ce qui concerne le principe de Jordan\n[12] En r\u00e9ponse aux pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates, le Canada a affirm\u00e9 que sa d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan s\u2019applique d\u00e9sormais \u00e0 tous les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations et ne se limite pas \u00e0 ceux qui vivent dans les r\u00e9serves ou qui y vivent habituellement. Sa d\u00e9finition s\u2019applique \u00e9galement \u00e0 tous les conflits de comp\u00e9tence, y compris \u00e0 ceux qui opposent les minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux.\n[13] Selon le Canada, son interpr\u00e9tation r\u00e9vis\u00e9e du principe de Jordan a pour but de s\u2019assurer que chaque fois qu\u2019un enfant d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation a besoin de mesures de soutien ou de services financ\u00e9s par le secteur public en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9, d\u2019\u00e9ducation ou de services sociaux, cet enfant re\u00e7oit ce soutien ou ces services. Tout probl\u00e8me de comp\u00e9tence qui pourrait se poser sera r\u00e9gl\u00e9 apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre assur\u00e9 qu\u2019on a r\u00e9pondu aux besoins de l\u2019enfant. De nouveaux processus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9s afin que les services requis dans toute affaire vis\u00e9e par le principe de Jordan ne soient pas retard\u00e9s en raison de conf\u00e9rences de cas ou d\u2019examens au regard des politiques. Les affaires urgentes seront trait\u00e9es dans un d\u00e9lai de 12 heures, tandis que le d\u00e9lai de traitement des autres cas sera de 5 jours ouvrables ou encore de 7 jours ouvrables dans les cas complexes n\u00e9cessitant un suivi ou des consultations avec d\u2019autres intervenants.\n[14] Le Canada a indiqu\u00e9 avoir \u00e9galement pris les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour s\u2019assurer que les ressources humaines et le financement requis sont disponibles pour mettre en \u0153uvre la d\u00e9finition \u00e9largie du principe de Jordan. \u00c0 ce titre, il a pris de nouvelles initiatives strat\u00e9giques en vue de mieux r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 et de services sociaux. Selon le Canada, l\u2019initiative \u00ab L\u2019enfant d\u2019abord \u00bb soutient l\u2019application \u00e9largie du principe de Jordan, en fournissant au Canada les m\u00e9canismes dont il a besoin pour emp\u00eacher ou r\u00e9soudre les conflits de comp\u00e9tence et pr\u00e9venir et corriger les lacunes avant qu\u2019ils n\u2019apparaissent. Le Canada a soutenu que cette initiative cible les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00e0 risques, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une meilleure coordination des services, et offre une source de financement pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des enfants lorsque ces besoins ne peuvent pas \u00eatre combl\u00e9s dans le cadre des programmes publics existants. Le Canada a \u00e9galement attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention sur le plan op\u00e9rationnel r\u00e9gional de 2016-2017 de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la sant\u00e9 des Premi\u00e8res nations et des Inuits (DGSPNI), qui pr\u00e9conise, selon lui, une interpr\u00e9tation appropri\u00e9e de la fa\u00e7on d\u2019appliquer le principe de Jordan. Ce plan n\u00e9cessite un financement de 64 millions de dollars pour les programmes et les services de sant\u00e9 mentale destin\u00e9s aux Premi\u00e8res Nations en Ontario, en plus des programmes de sant\u00e9 mentale habituels.\n[15] En outre, le Canada a soutenu qu\u2019il s\u2019efforce \u00e9galement d\u2019am\u00e9liorer ses efforts de communication afin de veiller \u00e0 ce que ses partenaires des Premi\u00e8res Nations soient inform\u00e9s de la nouvelle approche adopt\u00e9e et des nouvelles ressources disponibles et qu\u2019ils aient la possibilit\u00e9 de s\u2019impliquer et de faire conna\u00eetre leurs points de vue.\n[16] Enfin, le Canada a affirm\u00e9 que bien que le principe de Jordan ne puisse pas servir \u00e0 tout financer, aucune ligne pr\u00e9cise n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 trac\u00e9e quant \u00e0 ce qui est recouvrable. Tout service public offert aux autres enfants canadiens est admissible en vertu du principe de Jordan et a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme couvert lorsque la question s\u2019est pos\u00e9e.\nIV. Analyse\n[17] Les plaignantes et les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es croient que jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant, le Canada ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9 aux ordonnances de la formation ou \u00e0 certains aspects de celles-ci. De mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, chacune de leurs observations respectives portait sur un aspect diff\u00e9rent de la plainte, et elles y demandaient que des ordonnances sur les mesures d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diates soient rendues pour traiter ces aspects particuliers. Selon les d\u00e9clarations qu\u2019elles ont faites dans leurs observations et \u00e0 l\u2019audience, les plaignantes et les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement favorables aux positions exprim\u00e9es et aux ordonnances demand\u00e9es par les autres.\n[18] La Commission estime que malgr\u00e9 quelques avanc\u00e9es positives et encourageantes, le Canada ne s\u2019est pas encore pleinement conform\u00e9 aux ordonnances de la pr\u00e9sente formation et qu\u2019il est donc loisible \u00e0 la formation de fournir des indications ou des pr\u00e9cisions suppl\u00e9mentaires au sujet de ses ordonnances.\n[19] En ce qui a trait au principe de Jordan, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada (la \u00ab Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00bb) et la Commission demandent que d\u2019autres ordonnances soient rendues concernant la d\u00e9finition du principe, la communication de cette d\u00e9finition au public et aux intervenants et le processus de gestion et de suivi des cas vis\u00e9s par le principe de Jordan.\n[20] L\u2019Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res Nations (l\u2019\u00ab APN \u00bb) \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e, au d\u00e9part, par le fait qu\u2019elle ne participait pas aux activit\u00e9s de Sant\u00e9 Canada li\u00e9es au principe de Jordan \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a conclu un protocole de participation avec la DGSPNI. Sant\u00e9 Canada a depuis invit\u00e9 l\u2019APN \u00e0 copr\u00e9sider un groupe de travail sur le principe de Jordan, ce que l\u2019APN a accept\u00e9. Les observations de l\u2019APN font \u00e9cho \u00e0 bon nombre des pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et la Commission en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan et au processus connexe.\n[21] Les observations formul\u00e9es par l\u2019organisme Chiefs of Ontario (\u00ab COO \u00bb) et la Nation Nishnawbe Aski (la \u00ab NNA \u00bb) concernant le principe de Jordan portent essentiellement sur la prestation de services de sant\u00e9 mentale en vertu du Protocole d\u2019entente sur les programmes d\u2019aide sociale pour les Indiens (l\u2019\u00ab Entente de 1965 \u00bb), en Ontario. La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate concerne le principe de Jordan en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Les questions particuli\u00e8res soulev\u00e9es concernant l\u2019Entente de 1965 ainsi que les autres demandes formul\u00e9es seront examin\u00e9es dans une d\u00e9cision distincte.\n[22] En outre, la formation souligne que dans sa requ\u00eate, la NNA a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 qu\u2019une ordonnance ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention du suicide soit rendue afin que le financement pr\u00e9vu aux termes du principe de Jordan soit accord\u00e9 \u00e0 toute collectivit\u00e9 autochtone qui pr\u00e9sente une proposition dans laquelle elle fait \u00e9tat d\u2019enfants et de jeunes pr\u00e9sentant un risque de suicide. Sant\u00e9 Canada s\u2019est depuis engag\u00e9 \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un Groupe de travail sur la pr\u00e9vention du suicide, en collaboration avec la NNA, qui aura pour mandat de d\u00e9finir un processus de demande de financement concret et simplifi\u00e9 pour les collectivit\u00e9s, dans le cadre de l\u2019initiative \u00ab L\u2019enfant d\u2019abord \u00bb (principe de Jordan). Ainsi, et \u00e0 la demande de la NNA, la formation a report\u00e9 la demande visant l\u2019obtention d\u2019une ordonnance ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention du suicide (voir la d\u00e9cision 2017 TCDP 7).\nA. Arguments juridiques\n(i) Fardeau de la preuve et conformit\u00e9\n[23] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, concernant les diff\u00e9rents aspects des requ\u00eates sur lesquelles la formation doit maintenant se prononcer, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et l\u2019APN ont fait valoir que le Canada a le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer au Tribunal qu\u2019il s\u2019est conform\u00e9 aux ordonnances sur les mesures d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diates rendues jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent. Le Canada a en main les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires pour prouver si les mesures d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diates demand\u00e9es par le Tribunal ont bien \u00e9t\u00e9 prises. En outre, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 que le Canada a fait preuve de discrimination syst\u00e9mique \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations et de leurs familles, il serait injuste que les plaignantes aient la \u00ab charge de la preuve \u00bb et doivent prouver que la discrimination persiste, en l\u2019absence d\u2019autres ordonnances.\n[24] En l\u2019absence de preuves d\u00e9montrant clairement que le Canada a trait\u00e9 tous les points \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans les ordonnances d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate du Tribunal, les plaignantes et les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es demandent, entre autres, au Tribunal de conclure que le Canada continue de faire preuve de discrimination et qu\u2019il ne s\u2019est jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent pas conform\u00e9 aux ordonnances de la formation et, dans certains cas, de rendre une ordonnance dans laquelle il d\u00e9clarerait que le Canada n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 lesdites ordonnances.\n[25] La Commission soutient que dans les cas o\u00f9 le Tribunal continue d\u2019avoir comp\u00e9tence pour faciliter la mise en application d\u2019une ordonnance et qu\u2019un diff\u00e9rend survient par la suite, le Tribunal a la possibilit\u00e9 de reprendre l\u2019audience afin : (i) de tirer des conclusions quant \u00e0 savoir si une partie s\u2019est conform\u00e9e aux dispositions de l\u2019ordonnance initiale et (ii) d\u2019apporter des clarifications et un compl\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance initiale, si des directives suppl\u00e9mentaires sont n\u00e9cessaires pour corriger la pratique discriminatoire cibl\u00e9e dans l\u2019ordonnance initiale. La Commission est d\u2019avis qu\u2019en d\u00e9pit des quelques avanc\u00e9es positives et encourageantes observ\u00e9es, le Canada ne s\u2019est pas encore pleinement conform\u00e9 aux d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate du Tribunal concernant le principe de Jordan. Il est donc loisible au Tribunal de fournir des indications ou des pr\u00e9cisions suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[26] Le Canada fait valoir qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de crit\u00e8re juridique qui r\u00e9git les requ\u00eates de non\u2011conformit\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es devant le Tribunal. Le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 satisfaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de telles requ\u00eates doit donc s\u2019appuyer sur les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux qui r\u00e9gissent le droit en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Selon le Canada, il est clairement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans la loi que les parties requ\u00e9rantes ont le fardeau ultime de prouver leurs all\u00e9gations selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s : en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, elles doivent prouver leurs all\u00e9gations de non\u2011conformit\u00e9. Le Canada est d\u2019avis que les parties requ\u00e9rantes ne se sont pas acquitt\u00e9es du fardeau qui leur incombait et que leurs requ\u00eates devraient donc \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, le Canada affirme s\u2019\u00eatre conform\u00e9 aux ordonnances du Tribunal.\n[27] Une fois qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il y a eu discrimination ou pr\u00e9judice, le Tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il est appropri\u00e9 de rendre une ordonnance [voir le paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb)]. \u00c0 ce titre, le Tribunal a l\u2019obligation d\u2019\u00e9valuer la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de rendre une ordonnance d\u2019apr\u00e8s les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s; il peut \u00e9galement renvoyer la question aux parties pour qu\u2019elles pr\u00e9sentent une preuve plus \u00e9toff\u00e9e quant \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance qu\u2019il conviendrait de rendre [voir Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2010 CF 1135, aux paragraphes 61 et 67, confirm\u00e9e dans 2011 CAF 202 (\u00ab Walden \u00bb)]. Voil\u00e0 la situation dans laquelle se trouve la formation au moment de rendre une d\u00e9cision concernant les pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates.\n[28] Dans la d\u00e9cision, la formation a rendu des ordonnances g\u00e9n\u00e9rales afin que la pratique discriminatoire cesse et que des mesures soient prises pour corriger la situation et l\u2019emp\u00eacher de se reproduire; toutefois, elle y explique \u00e9galement qu\u2019elle a besoin d\u2019autres \u00e9claircissements des parties au sujet des mesures concr\u00e8tes de r\u00e9paration r\u00e9clam\u00e9es, notamment sur la mani\u00e8re la plus pratique, concr\u00e8te et efficace de mettre en \u0153uvre les r\u00e9formes \u00e0 court terme et \u00e0 long terme (voir le paragraphe 483). En effet, bien que la formation ait r\u00e9ussi, dans ses d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate subs\u00e9quentes, \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser ses ordonnances en s\u2019appuyant sur les renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires fournis par les parties, elle est rest\u00e9e saisie de l\u2019affaire en attendant d\u2019autres rapports des parties, principalement du Canada (voir 2016 TCDP 10 et 2016 TCDP 16). Autrement dit, le Tribunal ne cherche pas \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le bien-fond\u00e9 d\u2019une plainte dont une des parties a le fardeau de prouver certains faits, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer les r\u00e9parations appropri\u00e9es en recueillant les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires afin de rendre des ordonnances utiles et efficaces en vue de mettre fin aux pratiques discriminatoires observ\u00e9es.\n[29] En conformit\u00e9 avec cette approche, et comme l\u2019a d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente formation, l\u2019ordonnance rendue en vertu de l\u2019article 53 de la Loi a pour but d\u2019\u00e9liminer et de pr\u00e9venir toute forme de discrimination. Suivant une d\u00e9marche motiv\u00e9e et fond\u00e9e sur des principes, en tenant compte des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, le Tribunal doit veiller \u00e0 ce que ses ordonnances de r\u00e9paration parviennent \u00e0 promouvoir efficacement les droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Loi et \u00e0 compenser utilement toute perte subie par la victime de discrimination. Cependant, \u00e9laborer des r\u00e9parations efficaces et utiles pour r\u00e9soudre un diff\u00e9rend complexe, comme c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, est une t\u00e2che d\u00e9licate qui peut n\u00e9cessiter un contr\u00f4le continu (voir la d\u00e9cision 2016 TCDP 10, aux paragraphes 13 \u00e0 15 et 36).\n[30] Pour cette raison, en l\u2019absence de lacunes dans la preuve, le Tribunal ne consid\u00e8re pas la question du fardeau de la preuve comme une question d\u00e9terminante pour trancher les pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates. Comme l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 268, au paragraphe 42 (\u00ab Chopra \u00bb), \u00ab [l]a question du fardeau de la preuve ne se pose que lorsqu\u2019il faut d\u00e9cider quelle partie doit subir les cons\u00e9quences d\u2019une lacune dans la preuve qui emp\u00eache le d\u00e9cideur des faits de tirer une conclusion particuli\u00e8re \u00bb. Bien que des questions particuli\u00e8res concernant le fardeau de la preuve puissent se poser lorsqu\u2019elle doit trancher des requ\u00eates comme celles dont la formation a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, si le dossier de la preuve permet \u00e0 la formation de tirer des conclusions de fait \u00e9tay\u00e9es par la preuve, la question de savoir qui avait le fardeau de prouver un fait est sans importance.\n[31] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, le r\u00f4le de la formation, au moment de se prononcer sur les pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates, n\u2019est pas en soi de d\u00e9clarer s\u2019il y a conformit\u00e9 ou non-conformit\u00e9. Conform\u00e9ment aux principes de r\u00e9paration expos\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, lorsque la formation formule des ordonnances quant aux mesures d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diates requises et conserve comp\u00e9tence pour superviser leur mise en \u0153uvre, son r\u00f4le consiste plut\u00f4t \u00e0 s\u2019assurer que les effets pr\u00e9judiciables et les refus de services cibl\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision sont provisoirement \u00e9limin\u00e9s, dans toute la mesure du possible, en attendant la fin de la r\u00e9forme des programmes de protection de l\u2019enfance des Premi\u00e8res Nations par AANC. Cela dit, pour formuler d\u2019autres ordonnances visant \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir la discrimination d\u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision ou \u00e0 y mettre fin imm\u00e9diatement, il est n\u00e9cessaire que la formation examine les mesures prises jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent par le Canada pour donner suite aux ordonnances qu\u2019elle a rendues, et elle peut tirer des conclusions \u00e0 savoir si ces mesures sont conformes ou non \u00e0 ces ordonnances.\n[32] Comme l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada dans l\u2019affaire Grover c. Canada (Conseil national de recherches), [1994] 24 CHRR D\/390 (CF), au paragraphe 32, \u00ab [d]ans bien des cas, le tribunal serait peut-\u00eatre mieux avis\u00e9 de donner des directives pour permettre aux parties d\u2019arranger elles-m\u00eames [les d\u00e9tails de l\u2019ordonnance] plut\u00f4t que de leur imposer une ordonnance qu\u2019elles n\u2019arriveront pas \u00e0 mettre \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution \u00bb. Cette d\u00e9claration est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019approche adopt\u00e9e par la formation jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des mesures de redressement requises dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Afin de faciliter la mise en \u0153uvre imm\u00e9diate des mesures de redressement g\u00e9n\u00e9rales pr\u00e9vues dans la d\u00e9cision, la formation a demand\u00e9 des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires aux parties, a surveill\u00e9 la mise en \u0153uvre par le Canada de ses ordonnances et a fourni des directives additionnelles aux parties, dans ses d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate subs\u00e9quentes, et a rendu un certain nombre d\u2019autres ordonnances fond\u00e9es sur les conclusions et le raisonnement d\u00e9taill\u00e9s d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision.\n[33] Cette approche a donn\u00e9 certains r\u00e9sultats, mais plus d\u2019un an s\u2019est maintenant \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis que la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue et la pr\u00e9sente instance doit aller de l\u2019avant et d\u00e9passer le stade de la simple prise de mesures d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diates. Les plaignantes, la Commission et les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es souhaitent voir un changement significatif pour les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations et veulent s\u2019assurer que le Canada met en \u0153uvre ce changement, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent. Tout comme elles, la formation souhaite voir un changement v\u00e9ritable et rapide. Les pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates sont une fa\u00e7on de v\u00e9rifier les assertions du Canada selon lesquelles il y a un tel changement et d\u2019aider la formation, lorsque cela est n\u00e9cessaire, \u00e0 formuler des ordonnances efficaces et utiles.\n[34] Voil\u00e0 le contexte dans lequel les pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es. Le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9paration doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on raisonnable eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 ce contexte particulier et \u00e0 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans le cadre de ces requ\u00eates. Cette preuve comprend l\u2019approche adopt\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent par le Canada pour se conformer aux ordonnances de la formation, laquelle preuve peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e par la formation pour tirer des conclusions et trancher les requ\u00eates d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par les parties.\n(ii) S\u00e9paration des pouvoirs\n[35] Le Canada invite le Tribunal \u00e0 garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux qui sous-tendent la s\u00e9paration appropri\u00e9e des pouvoirs au moment de formuler d\u2019autres ordonnances. Autrement dit, le Tribunal devrait laisser la m\u00e9thode pr\u00e9cise utilis\u00e9e pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la violation entre les mains de l\u2019organisme qui a la responsabilit\u00e9 de mettre en application l\u2019ordonnance rendue. Selon le Canada, le Tribunal outrepasserait ses pouvoirs s\u2019il rendait des ordonnances qui le rendraient responsable de la gestion et de la coordination d\u00e9taill\u00e9es de la r\u00e9forme entreprise actuellement.\n[36] Le Canada affirme qu\u2019une certaine retenue s\u2019impose afin de lui permettre d\u2019exercer son r\u00f4le dans l\u2019\u00e9laboration et la mise en \u0153uvre des politiques et l\u2019utilisation des fonds publics. En l\u2019absence d\u2019un pouvoir l\u00e9gal ou d\u2019une contestation pour des motifs constitutionnels, les cours et les tribunaux n\u2019ont pas la comp\u00e9tence institutionnelle n\u00e9cessaire pour s\u2019ing\u00e9rer dans l\u2019affectation des fonds publics ou l\u2019\u00e9laboration des politiques de l\u2019\u00c9tat. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 le Tribunal est invit\u00e9 \u00e0 rendre d\u2019autres ordonnances de r\u00e9paration qui l\u2019obligeraient \u00e0 dicter des politiques ou \u00e0 autoriser la d\u00e9pense de fonds publics, le Canada est d\u2019avis que les pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates devraient \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es, car elles outrepassent la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal.\n[37] L\u2019argument du Canada concernant la s\u00e9paration des pouvoirs n\u2019est pas assez pr\u00e9cis. Mis \u00e0 part une ordonnance particuli\u00e8re demand\u00e9e par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, qui sera examin\u00e9e par la formation dans une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate distincte, le Canada n\u2019a attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention sur aucune autre des ordonnances demand\u00e9es par les autres parties auxquelles cet argument pourrait s\u2019appliquer. Pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, il n\u2019a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 aucune des ordonnances demand\u00e9es relativement au principe de Jordan qui risque d\u2019aller \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la s\u00e9paration des pouvoirs. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, tel qu\u2019il est expliqu\u00e9 dans les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s, toute autre ordonnance \u00e9mise par la formation est fond\u00e9e sur les conclusions et les ordonnances rendues dans la d\u00e9cision et les d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate subs\u00e9quentes, qui ont toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9es par le Canada, de m\u00eame que sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s relativement aux pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates et les pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 la formation en vertu du paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi. Dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente analyse, l\u2019argument g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada concernant la s\u00e9paration des pouvoirs n\u2019est pas particuli\u00e8rement utile.\nB. Autres ordonnances sollicit\u00e9es\n(i) D\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan\n[38] Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019assurance donn\u00e9e par le Canada que sa d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan s\u2019applique d\u00e9sormais \u00e0 tous les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations, ind\u00e9pendamment de leur \u00e9tat ou de leur lieu de r\u00e9sidence, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien affirme que les fonctionnaires du gouvernement ont adopt\u00e9 une d\u00e9finition restrictive du principe de Jordan, qui est encore ax\u00e9e sur les enfants atteints d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience ou pr\u00e9sentant un \u00e9tat critique de courte dur\u00e9e, qui n\u00e9cessitent des services de sant\u00e9 ou des services sociaux. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien ajoute qu\u2019AANC n\u2019a pas encore proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019examen des cas ant\u00e9rieurs vis\u00e9s par le principe de Jordan pour lesquels des services ont \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9s. Bien que Sant\u00e9 Canada ait entam\u00e9 un processus d\u2019examen de ces cas, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et l\u2019APN ne savent pas vraiment combien d\u2019ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures seront examin\u00e9es dans le cadre de ce processus.\n[39] En outre, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien est pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par le fait que la d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan se limite aux enfants au sens o\u00f9 on l\u2019entend dans la l\u00e9gislation provinciale. Dans certaines provinces, un enfant est un individu \u00e2g\u00e9 de moins de 16 ans. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien est d\u2019avis qu\u2019une telle approche est inacceptable, dans la mesure o\u00f9 le principe de Jordan ne se limite pas aux services fournis en vertu des lois d\u2019une province qui r\u00e9gissent les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. De m\u00eame, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien fait valoir que le principe de Jordan exige, en ce qui concerne l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux services, une approche ax\u00e9e sur les r\u00e9sultats, et non sur le processus. Autrement dit, les normes en mati\u00e8re de soins des provinces et des territoires sont une mesure inad\u00e9quate pour la conception de programmes et d\u2019initiatives visant \u00e0 assurer une r\u00e9elle \u00e9galit\u00e9 aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations.\n[40] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la Commission est d\u2019accord avec la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien pour dire que le Tribunal devrait fournir des directives suppl\u00e9mentaires, en pr\u00e9cisant la d\u00e9finition exacte du principe de Jordan qui doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avenir pour \u00e9liminer les pratiques discriminatoires recens\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision. Compte tenu des d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate d\u00e9j\u00e0 rendues par la formation jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant, la Commission a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 certains principes cl\u00e9s que toute d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan doit mettre de l\u2019avant.\n[41] S\u2019il est vrai que le Canada a fait certains efforts pour mettre en \u0153uvre le principe de Jordan depuis que la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, il ne l\u2019a toujours pas appliqu\u00e9 en lui donnant sa pleine port\u00e9e et tout son sens. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la formation a indiqu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision 2016 TCDP 16 qu\u2019une d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan qui s\u2019applique aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations [traduction] \u00ab atteints de probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 et \u00e0 ceux qui pr\u00e9sentent un probl\u00e8me sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 court terme qui n\u00e9cessite une aide sociale et m\u00e9dicale \u00bb semble \u00eatre plus restrictive que celle formul\u00e9e par le l\u00e9gislateur. Suivant la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la demande de renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires de la formation et la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans le cadre des pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates, la formation peut maintenant confirmer que le Canada applique effectivement une d\u00e9finition restreinte du principe de Jordan qui n\u2019est pas conforme aux ordonnances ant\u00e9rieures de la formation.\n[42] Le Canada a appel\u00e9 trois t\u00e9moins en r\u00e9ponse aux requ\u00eates des plaignantes et des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es :\nMme Robin Buckland, directrice ex\u00e9cutive du Bureau des soins de sant\u00e9 primaires de Sant\u00e9 Canada au sein de la DGSPNI;\nMme Cassandra Lang, directrice au sein de la Direction de l\u2019enfance et de la famille, de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019enfance et de la famille d\u2019AANC;\nMme Lee Cranton, directrice, Op\u00e9rations du Nord, dans la r\u00e9gion de l\u2019Ontario, au sein de la DGSPNI de Sant\u00e9 Canada.\n[43] Chacun de ces trois t\u00e9moins a sign\u00e9 un affidavit et a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet par les autres parties, et tous ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s devant la formation dans le cadre des pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates. De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les trois t\u00e9moins ont rendu un t\u00e9moignage semblable qui appuie la position d\u00e9fendue par le Canada. Toutefois, comme la formation l\u2019explique dans les pages qui suivent, o\u00f9 elle se penche principalement sur le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Buckland, la majeure partie des preuves documentaires produites par le Canada, qui visent la derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e \u00e9coul\u00e9e depuis la d\u00e9cision, ne corroborent pas le t\u00e9moignage de ces t\u00e9moins concernant le principe de Jordan.\n[44] Mme Buckland est la repr\u00e9sentante du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral charg\u00e9e de mettre en \u0153uvre le principe de Jordan. Elle prend part \u00e0 ce processus depuis que la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue (voir Gillespie Reporting Services, transcription du contre-interrogatoire de Robin Buckland, Ottawa, volume I, \u00e0 la page 15, lignes 21 \u00e0 23 [transcription du contre\u2011interrogatoire de Mme Buckland]).\n[45] Dans son affidavit, Mme Buckland indique que les restrictions observ\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment dans la d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan ont maintenant \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9es, notamment l\u2019exigence selon laquelle les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations doivent vivre dans les r\u00e9serves ou \u00eatre atteints de d\u00e9ficiences multiples, ce qui requiert l\u2019obtention de services aupr\u00e8s de diff\u00e9rents fournisseurs. Elle pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019en d\u00e9pit de tout cela, il est fr\u00e9quent que les familles ne se manifestent pas pour demander de l\u2019aide. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, elle indique que les efforts proactifs d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s en partenariat avec les organismes de prestation de services sur le terrain devront se poursuivre et pr\u00e9cise que le Canada a entrepris diverses activit\u00e9s de mobilisation pour aider \u00e0 faciliter l\u2019application plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du principe de Jordan (voir l\u2019affidavit de Mme Robin Buckland, dat\u00e9 du 25 janvier 2017, aux paragraphes 3, 16 et 17).\n[46] En outre, Mme Buckland explique que la d\u00e9finition actuelle du principe de Jordan, qui s\u2019applique aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations [traduction] \u00ab atteints de probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 et \u00e0 ceux qui pr\u00e9sentent un probl\u00e8me sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 court terme qui n\u00e9cessite une aide sociale et m\u00e9dicale \u00bb, avait pour but de concentrer les efforts sur les enfants les plus vuln\u00e9rables :\n[traduction] Il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t d\u2019examiner les secteurs o\u00f9 les besoins sont les plus grands et d\u2019essayer d\u2019y concentrer nos efforts.\nTranscription du contre-interrogatoire de Mme Buckland \u00e0 la page 17, lignes 12 et 13.\nNos efforts en ce qui a trait au principe de Jordan \u00e9taient ax\u00e9s sur les enfants qui vivent dans les r\u00e9serves et qui souffrent d\u2019une affection temporaire ou de courte dur\u00e9e ou encore d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience qui nuit \u00e0 leurs activit\u00e9s quotidiennes; nous continuons de concentrer nos efforts sur ces enfants.\nTranscription du contre-interrogatoire de Mme Buckland \u00e0 la page 39, lignes 17 \u00e0 21.\nChaque fois qu\u2019un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 complexe est examin\u00e9, une approche multimodale doit invariablement \u00eatre adopt\u00e9e.

En effet, la formation a plus particuli\u00e8rement relev\u00e9 des lacunes observ\u00e9es dans les services offerts aux enfants qui ne sont pas atteints de d\u00e9ficiences multiples.

La premi\u00e8re question pos\u00e9e dans ce tableau est la suivante : [traduction] \u00ab L\u2019enfant a-t-il des besoins li\u00e9s \u00e0 une d\u00e9ficience ou \u00e0 un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e qui ne sont pas satisfaits? \u00bb Si la r\u00e9ponse est \u00ab non \u00bb, le client ou la famille doit alors avoir recours aux programmes habituels.

Encore une fois, lorsqu\u2019on compare cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e0 d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, on constate que la d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan mentionn\u00e9e lors de cette r\u00e9union ne semble pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9e ou communiqu\u00e9e et il n\u2019est pas certain que les principes mentionn\u00e9s aient \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en \u0153uvre.\n[67] Par cons\u00e9quent, la formation conclut que la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate d\u00e9montre que la d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan appliqu\u00e9e par le Canada ne tient pas compl\u00e8tement compte des conclusions de la d\u00e9cision et qu\u2019elle ne donne pas suffisamment suite aux ordonnances de la formation. Bien que le Canada ait \u00e9largi son application du principe de Jordan depuis la d\u00e9cision et qu\u2019il ait \u00e9limin\u00e9 certaines des restrictions qui existaient quant \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation du principe, il continue de restreindre l\u2019application du principe \u00e0 certains enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations.\n[68] Le Canada aurait pu appliquer int\u00e9gralement le principe de Jordan, comme l\u2019a ordonn\u00e9 la formation, ainsi qu\u2019une m\u00e9thode pour se concentrer sur les besoins urgents de certains enfants, mais ce n\u2019est pas ce qu\u2019il a choisi de faire. Le fait d\u2019adopter une d\u00e9finition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019exclut pas la possibilit\u00e9 de mettre en place un processus pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins urgents de certains enfants. Toutefois, il existe une distinction entre, d\u2019une part, l\u2019adoption d\u2019une d\u00e9finition \u00e9largie et l\u2019\u00e9tablissement subs\u00e9quent des priorit\u00e9s en termes d\u2019urgence et, d\u2019autre part, une d\u00e9finition plus \u00e9troite, ce qui a pour r\u00e9sultat d\u2019exclure certaines personnes et de mettre l\u2019accent sur les personnes les plus vuln\u00e9rables.\n[69] Par ailleurs, de nombreuses versions du principe de Jordan mettent l\u2019accent sur les normes en mati\u00e8re de soins et les services comparables, mais cela ne r\u00e9pond pas aux conclusions de la d\u00e9cision pour ce qui touche l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle et le besoin d\u2019offrir des services adapt\u00e9s aux cultures (voir la d\u00e9cision au paragraphe 465). Ces normes ne devraient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es que pour \u00e9tablir le niveau minimal de service. Pour assurer l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle et la prestation de services adapt\u00e9s aux cultures, il faut tenir compte des besoins particuliers des enfants et les \u00e9valuer; il faut \u00e9galement tenir compte des besoins qui d\u00e9coulent des d\u00e9savantages historiques et du manque de services dans les r\u00e9serves et autour de celles-ci (voir la d\u00e9cision aux paragraphes 399 \u00e0 427).\n[70] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les normes de services d\u2019une province donn\u00e9e peuvent aider \u00e0 cibler les lacunes dans les services ax\u00e9s sur les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Les normes sont \u00e9galement un bon indicateur des services que tout enfant devrait recevoir, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019un enfant des Premi\u00e8res Nations ou non. Par exemple, dans le cadre de l\u2019audience sur le fond, la formation a entendu dire que Sant\u00e9 Canada ne paye qu\u2019un appareil m\u00e9dical sur trois et que cet appareil est rembours\u00e9 tous les cinq ans s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un fauteuil roulant. Les normes en mati\u00e8re de soins pr\u00e9voient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement le remboursement des trois appareils (voir la d\u00e9cision au paragraphe 366 et le rapport pr\u00e9liminaire sur la r\u00e9solution de conflits li\u00e9e au principe de Jordan [mandat du groupe de travail des fonctionnaires, mai 2009], pi\u00e8ce HR-13, onglet 302). Cet exemple illustre les lacunes de la politique de Sant\u00e9 Canada et son manque de logique; en effet, la politique ne tient pas compte de la croissance de l\u2019enfant au cours de ces cinq ann\u00e9es.\n[71] Toutefois, les normes en mati\u00e8re de soins ne ciblent pas les lacunes dans les services offerts aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations, que des services semblables soient offerts aux autres enfants canadiens ou non. Comme le document The Way Forward for the Federal Response to Jordan\u2019s Principle \u2013 Proposed Definitions l\u2019indique, dans la section sur les facteurs \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer pour l\u2019option no 1 : [traduction] \u00ab L\u2019accent qui est mis sur un conflit [paiement de services entre les administrations ou au sein de celles-ci] ne tient pas compte des lacunes potentielles dans les services lorsqu\u2019aucune administration ne fournit les services requis. \u00bb\n[72] Cette lacune potentielle dans les services a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire Pictou Landing susmentionn\u00e9e et dans la d\u00e9cision. Lorsqu\u2019une politique provinciale a emp\u00each\u00e9 un adolescent des Premi\u00e8res Nations lourdement handicap\u00e9 de recevoir des soins \u00e0 domicile parce qu\u2019il vivait dans une r\u00e9serve, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a jug\u00e9 que le principe de Jordan existait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour corriger ce genre de situation (voir Pictou Landing aux paragraphes 96 et 97). Par ailleurs, les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations peuvent avoir besoin de services dont n\u2019ont pas besoin les autres Canadiens, comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 la formation dans la d\u00e9cision aux paragraphes 421 et 422 :\n[421] Lors d\u2019une vaste recherche qu\u2019elle a r\u00e9cemment men\u00e9e afin d\u2019\u00e9valuer la sant\u00e9 et le bien-\u00eatre des membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans une r\u00e9serve, Dre Bombay a constat\u00e9 que les enfants des survivants des pensionnats indiens avaient v\u00e9cu davantage d\u2019exp\u00e9riences n\u00e9gatives durant l\u2019enfance et de plus grands traumatismes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge adulte. Ces facteurs semblaient avoir contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la manifestation de sympt\u00f4mes de d\u00e9pression plus importants chez les descendants des survivants des pensionnats indiens (voir l\u2019annexe, pi\u00e8ce 53, \u00e0 la page 373; voir \u00e9galement la Transcription, volume 40, aux pages 69 et 71).\n[422] Le t\u00e9moignage de Dre Bombay permet de comprendre les besoins des peuples autochtones en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille. De mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il montre que ces besoins sont plus grands pour les Autochtones qui vivent dans les r\u00e9serves. En mettant l\u2019accent sur la prise en charge des enfants, le Programme des SEFPN, les mod\u00e8les de financement correspondants et les autres ententes provinciales\/territoriales connexes perp\u00e9tuent les dommages caus\u00e9s par les pensionnats indiens plut\u00f4t que de tenter d\u2019y rem\u00e9dier. L\u2019histoire du syst\u00e8me des pensionnats indiens et le traumatisme interg\u00e9n\u00e9rationnel qu\u2019il a engendr\u00e9 s\u2019ajoutent aux autres facteurs de risque qui touchent les enfants et les familles autochtones, comme la pauvret\u00e9 et les infrastructures m\u00e9diocres, et montre bien que les membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations ont davantage besoin de recevoir des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille ad\u00e9quats, incluant les mesures les moins perturbatrices et, surtout, des services adapt\u00e9s aux particularit\u00e9s culturelles.\n[73] Par cons\u00e9quent, il est inqui\u00e9tant que le fait d\u2019aller au-del\u00e0 de la norme \u00e9tablie pour ce qui touche les soins soit \u00ab exceptionnel \u00bb compte tenu des conclusions de la d\u00e9cision, que le Canada a accept\u00e9es et auxquelles il ne s\u2019est pas oppos\u00e9. La discrimination cibl\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision est en partie caus\u00e9e par le manque de coordination entre les programmes, les politiques et les formules de financement sociaux et de sant\u00e9 et par la fa\u00e7on dont ils sont con\u00e7us et utilis\u00e9s. Le but de ces programmes, de ces politiques et de ces formules de financement devrait \u00eatre de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Il faudrait am\u00e9liorer la coordination entre les minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux afin de s\u2019assurer qu\u2019ils r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 ces besoins, qu\u2019ils ne causent pas d\u2019effets n\u00e9fastes et que les services ne sont pas retard\u00e9s ou refus\u00e9s aux Premi\u00e8res Nations. Au cours de la derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e, la formation a accord\u00e9 au Canada une certaine souplesse pour mettre un terme \u00e0 la discrimination cibl\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision. Une r\u00e9forme a \u00e9t\u00e9 exig\u00e9e. Toutefois, en se fondant sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans le cadre de cette requ\u00eate concernant le principe de Jordan, on constate que le Canada veut continuer d\u2019offrir des politiques et des pratiques qui ressemblent \u00e0 celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es discriminatoires. Les nouveaux programmes, politiques, pratiques et formules de financement mis en \u0153uvre par le Canada devraient tenir compte des lacunes pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment cibl\u00e9es et ne devraient pas \u00eatre une simple extension de pratiques ant\u00e9rieures qui n\u2019ont pas fonctionn\u00e9 et qui \u00e9taient discriminatoires. Ces programmes, politiques, pratiques et formules de financement devraient \u00eatre utiles et corriger et pr\u00e9venir la discrimination de fa\u00e7on efficace.\n[74] L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9troite que fait le Canada du principe de Jordan, le manque de coordination entre ses programmes ax\u00e9s sur les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations (comme on le verra dans la prochaine section), l\u2019accent qui est mis sur les politiques existantes et le fait d\u2019\u00e9viter les co\u00fbts potentiellement \u00e9lev\u00e9s des services n\u2019est pas l\u2019approche appropri\u00e9e pour mettre un terme \u00e0 la discrimination. Au contraire, les d\u00e9cisions doivent \u00eatre prises dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur des enfants. Bien que les ministres de la Sant\u00e9 et des Affaires autochtones se soient engag\u00e9s \u00e0 soutenir l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur des enfants, les renseignements qui proviennent de Sant\u00e9 Canada et d\u2019AANC, comme le souligne la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, ne cadrent pas avec ce qu\u2019ont affirm\u00e9 les ministres.\n[75] Dans l\u2019ensemble, la formation estime que le Canada ne se conforme pas compl\u00e8tement aux ordonnances rendues pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment relativement au principe de Jordan dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Le Canada a adapt\u00e9 ses documents, ses communications et ses ressources pour les harmoniser avec sa d\u00e9finition et son utilisation \u00e9largies, mais encore trop \u00e9troites, du principe de Jordan. Le fait de pr\u00e9senter une d\u00e9finition fond\u00e9e sur des crit\u00e8res, sans mentionner qu\u2019il s\u2019agit seulement d\u2019une orientation, ne tient pas compte de tous les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations conform\u00e9ment au principe de Jordan. Par ailleurs, le fait de mettre l\u2019accent sur les normes en mati\u00e8re de soins ne garantit pas une r\u00e9elle \u00e9galit\u00e9 pour les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations, ce qui est particuli\u00e8rement probl\u00e9matique puisque le Canada a avou\u00e9 avoir eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 cibler les enfants qui satisfont aux crit\u00e8res du principe de Jordan et \u00e0 encourager les parents d\u2019enfants qui ont des besoins non satisfaits \u00e0 se manifester (voir la transcription du contre\u2011interrogatoire de Mme Buckland \u00e0 la page 43, lignes 1 \u00e0 8).\n[76] En ce qui concerne ce dernier point, la formation souhaite souligner que la preuve indique que les fonds r\u00e9serv\u00e9s au r\u00e8glement des affaires vis\u00e9es par le principe de Jordan qui ne sont pas d\u00e9pens\u00e9s au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e donn\u00e9e ne peuvent pas \u00eatre report\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un montant fixe qui ne doit \u00eatre d\u00e9pens\u00e9 que pour r\u00e9gler des cas vis\u00e9s par le principe de Jordan; les fonds non d\u00e9pens\u00e9s sont renvoy\u00e9s au Tr\u00e9sor public. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, de juillet 2016 \u00e0 f\u00e9vrier 2017, environ 12 millions de dollars seulement, ou un peu plus de 15 % des 76,6 millions de dollars pr\u00e9vus au budget de 2016-2017 en application du principe de Jordan, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pens\u00e9s; de ce montant, 8 millions de dollars \u00e9taient r\u00e9serv\u00e9s aux services de soins de rel\u00e8ve au Manitoba [voir Principe de Jordan \u2013 Initiative de l\u2019enfant d\u2019abord, pr\u00e9sentation au comit\u00e9 des services de sant\u00e9 non assur\u00e9s, 15 septembre 2016 (pi\u00e8ces du contre-interrogatoire de Robin Buckland sur son affidavit dat\u00e9 du 25 janvier 2017, 6 et 7 f\u00e9vrier 2017, onglet 5, page 10); \u00ab Principe de Jordan, Tableau de bord de 2016-2017 de Sant\u00e9 Canada et d\u2019AANC, Fonds de r\u00e8glement de l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux services \u00bb, valide en date du 11 janvier 2017 (affidavit de Robin Buckland, 25 janvier 2017, pi\u00e8ce A); \u00ab Note de service \u00e0 l\u2019intention du sous-ministre adjoint principal, Demandes de financement pour les soins de rel\u00e8ve et les soins connexes en vertu du principe de Jordan \u00bb, 3 octobre 2016 (affidavit de Robin Buckland, 25 janvier 2017, pi\u00e8ce B, page 2); \u00ab Note de service \u00e0 l\u2019intention du sous-ministre adjoint principal, Demande de financement pour des programmes de th\u00e9rapie sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9gion du Manitoba en vertu du principe de Jordan \u00bb, 9 d\u00e9cembre 2016 (affidavit de Robin Buckland, 25 janvier 2017, pi\u00e8ce B, page 2) et \u00ab 2016-17 JP-CFI Allocation by Region \u00bb (r\u00e9ponses aux demandes de Robin Buckland, 7 mars 2017, \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 9)].\n[77] L\u2019approche actuelle du Canada pour ce qui touche le principe de Jordan est semblable \u00e0 la strat\u00e9gie qu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9e de 2009 \u00e0 2012 et qui est d\u00e9crite au paragraphe 356 de la d\u00e9cision. Au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, le Canada a affect\u00e9 11 millions de dollars au principe de Jordan. Les fonds \u00e9taient vers\u00e9s chaque ann\u00e9e par tranches de 3 millions de dollars. Aucune affaire vis\u00e9e par le principe de Jordan n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9e et les fonds n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s ni d\u00e9pens\u00e9s. La formation a conclu que c\u2019est l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9troite de Sant\u00e9 Canada et d\u2019AANC du principe de Jordan qui explique le fait qu\u2019aucun cas ne r\u00e9pondait aux crit\u00e8res du principe de Jordan (voir la d\u00e9cision aux paragraphes 379-382).\n[78] En attendant qu\u2019une r\u00e9forme soit entreprise, le principe de Jordan demeure un moyen efficace de combler certaines des lacunes li\u00e9es \u00e0 la prestation des services aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cern\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision; cependant, l\u2019approche du Canada risque de perp\u00e9tuer la discrimination et les lacunes relev\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision, surtout en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019allocation des fonds et des ressources r\u00e9serv\u00e9s au r\u00e8glement de certains de ces probl\u00e8mes (voir la d\u00e9cision au paragraphe 356). En ce sens, la preuve d\u00e9montre que les fonds de 382 millions de dollars sur trois ans que le Canada a pr\u00e9vu de d\u00e9penser pour les affaires vis\u00e9es par le principe de Jordan sont insuffisants compte tenu de la d\u00e9finition \u00e9largie adopt\u00e9e par la formation dans la d\u00e9cision et les d\u00e9cisions subs\u00e9quentes. Comme pour les pratiques adopt\u00e9es par le Canada dans le pass\u00e9, il s\u2019agit de fonds annuels communs qui expirent s\u2019ils ne sont pas d\u00e9pens\u00e9s. Par ailleurs, les fonds sont adapt\u00e9s aux personnes vis\u00e9es par la d\u00e9finition \u00e9troite adopt\u00e9e par le Canada, selon ce qui est mentionn\u00e9 dans les documents du Canada, et ne tiennent pas compte des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui vivent dans les r\u00e9serves. Les ressources r\u00e9serv\u00e9es au r\u00e8glement des affaires vis\u00e9es par le principe de Jordan pourraient \u00eatre limit\u00e9es maintenant que la d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9largie et que certains fonds ont expir\u00e9 [voir \u00ab Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la sant\u00e9 des Premi\u00e8res Nations et des Inuits, Forum des cadres r\u00e9gionaux, Compte rendu des discussions et des d\u00e9cisions \u00bb, 9 ao\u00fbt 2016 (r\u00e9ponses aux demandes de Robin Buckland, 7 mars 2017, \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 3A].\n[79] L\u00e0 encore, la formation reconna\u00eet que le Canada a fait des efforts pour mettre en \u0153uvre le principe de Jordan et qu\u2019il ne disposait que de peu de temps pour le faire apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de la formation, prise en avril 2016. Toutefois, le Canada a dispos\u00e9 de beaucoup de temps apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision d\u2019avril, particuli\u00e8rement apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de septembre 2016, puisque l\u2019audition de ces requ\u00eates n\u2019a eu lieu qu\u2019en mars 2017. Cela \u00e9tant dit, la formation estime que le Canada veut se conformer \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision et aux ordonnances connexes et l\u2019a dit haut et fort [voir par exemple \u00ab Feuillet de renseignements : Principe de Jordan \u2013 R\u00e9pondre aux besoins des enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations \u00bb (r\u00e9ponses aux demandes de Robin Buckland, 7 mars 2017, \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 3A) et \u00ab FNIHB SMC-P&P, Record of Decisions \u00bb, 18 mai 2016 (r\u00e9ponses aux demandes de Robin Buckland, 7 mars 2017, \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 5, page 1)].\n[80] En d\u00e9pit de cela, pr\u00e8s d\u2019un an depuis la d\u00e9cision d\u2019avril 2016 et plus d\u2019un an depuis la d\u00e9cision, le Canada continue de restreindre la signification et l\u2019objet du principe de Jordan. La formation estime que le Canada ne se conforme pas enti\u00e8rement aux ordonnances rendues pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment relativement au principe de Jordan. La formation doit rendre d\u2019autres ordonnances en vertu des alin\u00e9as 53(2)a) et b) de la Loi pour s\u2019assurer que le Canada applique le principe de Jordan dans toute sa signification et toute sa port\u00e9e. Pour corriger les pratiques ant\u00e9rieures du Canada qui \u00e9taient discriminatoires, la formation fait remarquer qu\u2019aucune restriction n\u2019emp\u00eacherait une personne qui s\u2019est vu refuser des fonds en vertu du principe de Jordan, ou qui serait maintenant vis\u00e9e par le principe de Jordan, de se manifester et de soumettre ou de soumettre \u00e0 nouveau une demande. En fait, comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, puisque le Canada a appliqu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e9troite le principe de Jordan de 2009 (au moins) \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui, il serait appropri\u00e9 et raisonnable que le Canada revoie les demandes de fonds qu\u2019il avait rejet\u00e9es en vertu du principe de Jordan ou d\u2019une autre loi applicable, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 se conformer \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate et \u00e0 appliquer correctement le principe de Jordan conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance qui y figure.\n[81] Toutes les ordonnances de la formation relativement \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre du principe de Jordan en lui donnant sa pleine port\u00e9e et tout son sens sont d\u00e9crites en d\u00e9tail dans la section \u00ab Ordonnances \u00bb ci-dessous, sous \u00ab D\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan \u00bb.\n(ii) Modifications dans le traitement et le suivi des affaires vis\u00e9es par le principe de Jordan\n[82] Le Canada estime que ses nouveaux processus garantissent que les affaires vis\u00e9es par le principe de Jordan ne sont pas retard\u00e9es en raison de conf\u00e9rences sur le cas ou d\u2019examens au regard des politiques. Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, le Canada affirme que les affaires urgentes sont trait\u00e9es dans un d\u00e9lai de 12 heures, tandis que d\u2019autres cas sont trait\u00e9s dans un d\u00e9lai de 5 jours ouvrables et que les affaires complexes ou pour lesquelles un suivi doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 ou des consultations doivent \u00eatre men\u00e9es sont trait\u00e9es dans un d\u00e9lai de 7 jours ouvrables.\n[83] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien affirme que les processus r\u00e9vis\u00e9s du Canada pour r\u00e9gler les affaires vis\u00e9es par le principe de Jordan causent encore des retards. L\u2019APN partage le point de vue de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, \u00e0 savoir que l\u2019organe gouvernemental qui est contact\u00e9 en premier ne g\u00e8re toujours pas la question directement en finan\u00e7ant le service demand\u00e9 et en se faisant ensuite rembourser, comme l\u2019exige le principe de Jordan. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les normes en mati\u00e8re de services du Canada se rapportent au laps de temps qui s\u2019\u00e9coule avant qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit prise et non au temps requis pour que l\u2019enfant re\u00e7oive un service. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Canada devrait confirmer au Tribunal qu\u2019il a modifi\u00e9 ses processus de sorte que l\u2019organisation gouvernementale qui est contact\u00e9e en premier paye pour les services et se fait rembourser, sans tenir de conf\u00e9rence sur le cas ni proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen au regard des politiques.\n[84] Par ailleurs, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien souligne que le Canada n\u2019a pas de m\u00e9canisme transparent et ind\u00e9pendant permettant aux familles ou aux fournisseurs de service d\u2019interjeter appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision dans une affaire vis\u00e9e par le principe de Jordan. Bien que la famille d\u2019un enfant puisse interjeter appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision, aucune proc\u00e9dure d\u2019appel n\u2019est d\u00e9crite ni fournie et aucun d\u00e9lai n\u2019est \u00e9tabli pour le traitement de l\u2019appel; par ailleurs, il n\u2019y a aucune certitude que des motifs \u00e9crits seront fournis.\n[85] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien affirme que le Canada n\u2019effectue pas un suivi officiel du nombre d\u2019affaires vis\u00e9es par le principe de Jordan qui sont rejet\u00e9es ou en cours. Elle affirme \u00e9galement que le Canada n\u2019\u00e9value pas son rendement en fonction des d\u00e9lais \u00e9tablis pour r\u00e9gler les affaires vis\u00e9es par le principe de Jordan. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019APN souligne que le principe de Jordan doit combler les lacunes dans le financement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations; toutefois, le Canada n\u2019a pas encore compris en quoi consistent ces lacunes.\n[86] La Commission est d\u2019accord avec la demande de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien que le Canada : (i) cesse imm\u00e9diatement de retarder la prestation des services pour examiner les politiques ou tenir des conf\u00e9rences sur le cas et (ii) mette imm\u00e9diatement en \u0153uvre des syst\u00e8mes fiables pour cerner les affaires vis\u00e9es par le principe de Jordan. Toutefois, il existe sans doute diverses fa\u00e7ons de se conformer aux ordonnances de la formation. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal devrait simplement fixer un d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9cis pour mettre en place les proc\u00e9dures requises et exiger du Canada qu\u2019il informe les parties de la m\u00e9thode choisie \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0.\n[87] Mis \u00e0 part certaines r\u00e9ponses de ses t\u00e9moins, le Canada n\u2019a pas express\u00e9ment trait\u00e9 des observations li\u00e9es au principe du premier organe contact\u00e9, aux m\u00e9canismes d\u2019appel ou au suivi.\n[88] Comme la formation l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 dans sa derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cision sur cette affaire (2017 TCDP 7) en janvier 2017, deux enfants \u00e2g\u00e9s de 12 ans se sont tragiquement enlev\u00e9 la vie dans la Premi\u00e8re Nation Wapekeka (\u00ab la PN Wapekeka \u00bb), une collectivit\u00e9 de la NNA. Avant la mort de ces enfants, la PN Wapekeka avait pr\u00e9venu le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de Sant\u00e9 Canada, qu\u2019elle s\u2019inqui\u00e9tait d\u2019un pacte de suicide conclu au sein d\u2019un groupe de jeunes enfants et d\u2019adolescents. Cette information figurait dans une proposition d\u00e9taill\u00e9e dat\u00e9e de juillet 2016 qui \u00e9tait destin\u00e9e \u00e0 obtenir des fonds en vue de mettre sur pied une \u00e9quipe communautaire de sant\u00e9 mentale \u00e0 titre de mesure pr\u00e9ventive.\n[89] La proposition de la PN Wapekeka est rest\u00e9e sans r\u00e9ponse de la part du Canada pendant plusieurs mois, et une r\u00e9ponse r\u00e9active n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e qu\u2019apr\u00e8s le suicide des deux jeunes. La r\u00e9ponse m\u00e9diatique de Sant\u00e9 Canada a \u00e9t\u00e9 la suivante : le Minist\u00e8re reconnaissait avoir re\u00e7u en septembre 2016 la proposition de juillet 2016, mais celle-ci avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 un [traduction] \u00ab moment peu propice dans le cycle de financement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00bb (voir l\u2019affidavit du Dr Michael Kirlew, 27 janvier 2017, au paragraphe 16).\n[90] Bien que le Canada ait fourni de l\u2019aide apr\u00e8s les suicides de la PN Wapekeka, les failles du processus li\u00e9 au principe de Jordan ont fait en sorte que l\u2019on n\u2019a pas pu pr\u00e9venir la trag\u00e9die de la PN Wapekeka, qui n\u2019a donn\u00e9 lieu qu\u2019\u00e0 une r\u00e9ponse r\u00e9active puisque les services ont subs\u00e9quemment \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts. Sur une note positive, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, Sant\u00e9 Canada s\u2019est depuis engag\u00e9 \u00e0 mettre sur pied un Groupe de travail sur la pr\u00e9vention du suicide en collaboration avec la NNA, dont l\u2019objectif sera d\u2019\u00e9tablir un processus concret et simplifi\u00e9 permettant aux collectivit\u00e9s de pr\u00e9senter une demande de financement dans le cadre de l\u2019initiative \u00ab L\u2019enfant d\u2019abord \u00bb (principe de Jordan). N\u00e9anmoins, les \u00e9v\u00e9nements tragiques de la PN Wapekeka r\u00e9v\u00e8lent qu\u2019il faut modifier la fa\u00e7on de coordonner le processus li\u00e9 au principe de Jordan.\n[91] Mme Buckland a reconnu que la proposition de la PN Wapekeka a cern\u00e9 des lacunes dans les services et que les fonds r\u00e9serv\u00e9s aux affaires vis\u00e9es par le principe de Jordan auraient pu servir \u00e0 combler ces lacunes. Malgr\u00e9 cela, et malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un cas de vie ou de mort, Mme Buckland a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une demande de groupe, que celle-ci devait \u00eatre trait\u00e9e comme toute autre demande de groupe et qu\u2019il fallait la faire signer par le sous-ministre adjoint. Mme Buckland a laiss\u00e9 entendre que le traitement de la demande de la PN Wapekeka aurait probablement pris deux semaines (voir la transcription du contre-interrogatoire de Mme Buckland \u00e0 la page 174, lignes 19 \u00e0 21; page 175, lignes 1 \u00e0 4; page 180, lignes 1 \u00e0 9 et page 182, lignes 11 \u00e0 16).\n[92] Si une demande comme celle de la PN Wapekeka ne peut pas \u00eatre trait\u00e9e rapidement, comment les autres demandes sont-elles trait\u00e9es? Le Canada a fourni des d\u00e9lais d\u00e9taill\u00e9s pour ce qui touche le traitement des demandes vis\u00e9es par le principe de Jordan, mais la preuve indique que ces processus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9s peu de temps apr\u00e8s le contre-interrogatoire de Mme Buckland. En effet, rien n\u2019indique que ces d\u00e9lais existaient avant f\u00e9vrier 2017. Au contraire, la preuve laisse croire que le processus comportait un d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9d\u00e9fini puisqu\u2019on ne savait pas exactement en quoi consistait le processus [voir \u00ab Jordan\u2019s Principle, ADM Executive Oversight Committee,Record of Decisions \u00bb, 2 septembre 2016 (affidavit de Robin Buckland, 25 janvier 2017, pi\u00e8ce F, page 3); voir \u00e9galement la transcription du contre-interrogatoire de Mme Buckland, page 82, lignes 1 \u00e0 12].\n[93] Qui plus est, les commentaires de Mme Buckland semblent indiquer que le traitement des affaires vis\u00e9es par le principe de Jordan met encore l\u2019accent sur les besoins administratifs du Canada plut\u00f4t que sur la gravit\u00e9 et le caract\u00e8re urgent de la demande et, surtout, sur les besoins et les int\u00e9r\u00eats sup\u00e9rieurs des enfants. Il est manifeste que l\u2019organe gouvernemental f\u00e9d\u00e9ral qui est contact\u00e9 en premier ne r\u00e9pond toujours pas directement \u00e0 la demande en finan\u00e7ant le service et en se faisant ensuite rembourser comme l\u2019exige le principe de Jordan. La formation estime que le nouveau processus du Canada quant au principe de Jordan est tr\u00e8s semblable \u00e0 l\u2019ancien, \u00e0 quelques exceptions pr\u00e8s. Les responsables de l\u2019\u00e9laboration de ce nouveau processus ne semblent pas avoir pris en consid\u00e9ration les failles de l\u2019ancien processus.\n[94] Les d\u00e9lais impos\u00e9s aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui demandent des fonds en vertu du principe de Jordan donnent au gouvernement le temps de naviguer entre ses propres services et programmes; cette situation est semblable \u00e0 un probl\u00e8me cibl\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision. Selon Mme Buckland, c\u2019est la personne responsable de l\u2019application du principe de Jordan, qui re\u00e7oit le formulaire de demande du client et l\u2019envoie \u00e0 l\u2019administration centrale, qui attire l\u2019attention du Canada sur une affaire vis\u00e9e par le principe de Jordan. Le personnel de l\u2019administration centrale \u00e9value le cas pour d\u00e9terminer si le service demand\u00e9 est couvert par un programme existant de Sant\u00e9 Canada ou d\u2019AANC. Nous ne savons pas exactement combien de temps prennent le traitement de la demande et l\u2019\u00e9valuation initiale.\n[95] Par exemple, on a remis \u00e0 la formation les courriels que se sont \u00e9chang\u00e9s Sant\u00e9 Canada et une m\u00e8re des Premi\u00e8res Nations dont le fils atteint d\u2019une paralysie c\u00e9r\u00e9brale grave doit \u00eatre transport\u00e9 en autobus jusqu\u2019\u00e0 un centre de services hors r\u00e9serve, qui offre un programme pour les enfants ayant des besoins sp\u00e9ciaux (pi\u00e8ces du contre-interrogatoire de Robin Buckland sur son affidavit dat\u00e9 du 25 janvier 2017, 6 et 7 f\u00e9vrier 2017, \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 12). Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u cette premi\u00e8re demande et des courriels contenant des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires dat\u00e9s des 19 et 20 f\u00e9vrier 2017, Sant\u00e9 Canada a inform\u00e9 la m\u00e8re le 27 janvier 2017 que le Minist\u00e8re tentait de d\u00e9terminer avec AANC si ce service \u00e9tait offert dans le cadre de leur programme d\u2019\u00e9ducation. La m\u00e8re a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada le 3 f\u00e9vrier 2017 pour savoir o\u00f9 le dossier en \u00e9tait puisqu\u2019elle n\u2019avait toujours pas re\u00e7u de nouvelles. Deux semaines apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9ception de la demande initiale, le Canada essayait encore de naviguer entre ses propres programmes et services. Lorsqu\u2019on a parl\u00e9 de ce cas \u00e0 Mme Buckland dans le cadre de son contre-interrogatoire, celle-ci a affirm\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Je suppose que des efforts suppl\u00e9mentaires devraient \u00eatre faits et je ne pense pas pouvoir en dire plus sur ce sujet \u00bb (transcription du contre-interrogatoire de Mme Buckland, page 82, lignes 10 \u00e0 12).\n[96] Dans le cas o\u00f9 un programme existant ne peut pas r\u00e9pondre au besoin du client, le personnel de l\u2019administration centrale doit d\u00e9terminer si le cas doit \u00eatre trait\u00e9 par le personnel, par le directeur ex\u00e9cutif ou par le sous-ministre adjoint. C\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment seulement que les d\u00e9lais du Canada entrent en jeu (cas urgents trait\u00e9s dans un d\u00e9lai de 12 heures, autres cas trait\u00e9s dans un d\u00e9lai de 5 jours ouvrables et cas complexes trait\u00e9s dans un d\u00e9lai de 7 jours ouvrables). L\u00e0 encore, la preuve indique que ces d\u00e9lais n\u2019\u00e9taient pas tout \u00e0 fait en vigueur au moment du contre-interrogatoire de Mme Buckland. Un organigramme pr\u00e9liminaire intitul\u00e9 \u00ab processus d\u2019approbation du principe de Jordan \u00bb dat\u00e9 du 20 f\u00e9vrier 2017 et fourni apr\u00e8s le contre-interrogatoire de Mme Buckland porte la marque \u00ab \u00e9bauche \u00bb (r\u00e9ponses aux demandes de Robin Buckland, 7 mars 2017, \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 11). Comme Mme Buckland l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 dans son contre-interrogatoire, des am\u00e9liorations sont actuellement apport\u00e9es au processus (voir la transcription du contre-interrogatoire de Mme Buckland, page 119, lignes 13 \u00e0 19).\n[97] La preuve indique qu\u2019on utilise les fonds r\u00e9serv\u00e9s au principe de Jordan en dernier recours, ce qu\u2019a confirm\u00e9 Mme Buckland (voir la transcription du contre\u2011interrogatoire de Mme Buckland, page 51, lignes 3 \u00e0 9; pages 65 \u00e0 67; page 72, lignes 6 \u00e0 21 et pages 76 \u00e0 78). La formation estime que le nouveau processus li\u00e9 au principe de Jordan d\u00e9crit ci-dessus est tr\u00e8s semblable au processus pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, qui causait des retards et comportait des lacunes, et dans le cadre duquel les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations se voyaient refuser l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des services sociaux et des services de sant\u00e9 essentiels. En fin de compte, la formation a pris ce processus en consid\u00e9ration avant de conclure qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de discrimination (voir la d\u00e9cision aux paragraphes 356 \u00e0 358, 365, 379 \u00e0 382 et 391).\n[98] Le nouveau processus cause encore des retards en raison des \u00e9changes entre les minist\u00e8res du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de conf\u00e9rences sur le cas, d\u2019examens au regard des politiques ou de navigation entre les services. Comme la formation l\u2019indique dans la d\u00e9cision, cette \u00e9tape administrative suppl\u00e9mentaire nuit au principe \u00e9tabli pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour r\u00e9gler ces probl\u00e8mes puisqu\u2019elle cause des retards et des interruptions et qu\u2019elle prive les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations de certains biens ou services. Conform\u00e9ment au principe de Jordan, une fois qu\u2019un besoin en mati\u00e8re de service a \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9, le gouvernement doit payer pour le service et d\u00e9terminer par la suite qui doit rembourser. Concr\u00e8tement, cela signifie qu\u2019il faut \u00e9liminer les d\u00e9lais li\u00e9s au traitement d\u2019une demande pour d\u00e9terminer si le service demand\u00e9 est couvert par un programme existant de Sant\u00e9 Canada ou d\u2019AANC. Le Canada devrait assumer la responsabilit\u00e9 de cet obstacle administratif ou de ce d\u00e9lai ainsi que du manque \u00e9vident de coordination entre les diff\u00e9rents programmes offerts aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations ayant besoin de services, qui ne devraient pas \u00eatre touch\u00e9s par ces probl\u00e8mes.\n[99] Selon le principe de Jordan, les responsables du principe de Jordan ou l\u2019administration centrale devraient \u00e9valuer directement les besoins et rendre une d\u00e9cision rapidement. Les fonds r\u00e9serv\u00e9s au principe de Jordan devraient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on prioritaire et non en dernier recours. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, aucune explication n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie sur la raison pour laquelle la plupart des cas sont trait\u00e9s dans un d\u00e9lai moyen de 5 jours ouvrables. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les cas urgents peuvent \u00eatre trait\u00e9s dans un d\u00e9lai de 12 heures, il est raisonnable de croire que le Canada peut traiter la plupart des affaires vis\u00e9es par le principe de Jordan dans des d\u00e9lais semblables, et c\u2019est ce qu\u2019on lui ordonnera de faire.\n[100] En ce qui concerne les appels, il n\u2019existe aucun processus officiel. Dans son affidavit, Mme Buckland a affirm\u00e9 que le [traduction] \u00ab Canada met en \u0153uvre un processus d\u2019approbation et d\u2019appel pour examiner toutes les demandes en temps opportun \u00bb (affidavit de Robin Buckland, 25 janvier 2017, au paragraphe 11). Lors de son contre-interrogatoire, elle a indiqu\u00e9 que des am\u00e9liorations sont actuellement apport\u00e9es au processus d\u2019appel, mais qu\u2019il permet actuellement \u00e0 une famille d\u2019aviser la personne responsable du principe de Jordan qu\u2019elle souhaite interjeter appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision, apr\u00e8s quoi le cas est envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Buckland, qui l\u2019envoie au sous-ministre adjoint aux fins d\u2019examen (voir la transcription du contre-interrogatoire de Mme Buckland, de la page 117, ligne 3, \u00e0 la page 119, lignes 3 \u00e0 19).\n[101] Certains d\u00e9tails suppl\u00e9mentaires concernant le processus d\u2019appel sont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s dans un autre organigramme provisoire dat\u00e9 du 20 f\u00e9vrier 2017 intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Processus d\u2019approbation du principe de Jordan \u00bb; ce document porte \u00e9galement la marque \u00ab \u00e9bauche \u00bb, pourrait \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 et a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni apr\u00e8s le contre-interrogatoire de Mme Buckland (voir les r\u00e9ponses aux demandes de Robin Buckland, 7 mars 2017, \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 11 et la transcription du contre-interrogatoire de Mme Buckland, de la page 117, ligne 3, \u00e0 la page 119, ligne 19). \u00c0 la section sur les principes directeurs, il est entre autres indiqu\u00e9 que les [traduction] \u00ab [d]\u00e9cisions sont appliqu\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on uniforme et sont prises de fa\u00e7on impartiale \u00bb, que le \u00ab [p]rocessus est ouvert, accessible au public et facile \u00e0 comprendre \u00bb et que les \u00ab [d]\u00e9cisions sont prises sans tarder dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable et respectent les normes en mati\u00e8re de services \u00e9tablies relativement au principe de Jordan \u00bb.\n[102] Toutefois, il est difficile de dire comment ces principes sont incorpor\u00e9s au processus d\u2019appel actuel. Tout ce que r\u00e9v\u00e8le l\u2019organigramme, c\u2019est que le responsable r\u00e9gional du principe de Jordan re\u00e7oit la demande d\u2019appel, envoie la demande accompagn\u00e9e de nouveaux renseignements ou de renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires au sous-ministre adjoint de Sant\u00e9 Canada, DGSPNI ou au sous-ministre adjoint d\u2019AANC, Programmes et partenariats en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9ducation et d\u00e9veloppement social, aux fins d\u2019examen. Si l\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9, une justification doit \u00eatre fournie au client. L\u2019organigramme ne mentionne aucun d\u00e9lai et les dossiers documentaires ne contiennent aucun autre renseignement sur le processus d\u2019appel.\n[103] En ce qui concerne le processus global li\u00e9 au principe de Jordan, la formation conclut que des am\u00e9liorations s\u2019imposent pour s\u2019assurer que le principe r\u00e9pond aux besoins des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations et met un terme \u00e0 la discrimination cibl\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi, la formation ordonne au Canada d\u2019int\u00e9grer \u00e0 ses processus li\u00e9s au principe de Jordan les normes pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es dans la section \u00ab Ordonnances \u00bb ci-dessous, sous \u00ab Traitement et suivi des cas li\u00e9s au principe de Jordan \u00bb. Par ailleurs, le Canada devrait \u00e9tablir un processus d\u2019appel ind\u00e9pendant en partenariat avec les d\u00e9cideurs qui sont \u00e9galement des professionnels de la sant\u00e9 et des travailleurs sociaux autochtones.\n[104] En ce qui concerne le suivi des cas li\u00e9s au principe de Jordan, peu d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve donnent \u00e0 penser que le Canada effectue un suivi officiel qui va au-del\u00e0 du niveau minimal de suivi. Comme l\u2019a affirm\u00e9 Mme Buckland, le suivi doit [traduction] \u00ab clairement \u00eatre am\u00e9lior\u00e9 pour effectuer un meilleur suivi et obtenir de meilleurs d\u00e9tails \u00bb (transcription du contre-interrogatoire de Mme Buckland, de la page 96, ligne 25, \u00e0 la page 97, ligne; voir \u00e9galement de la page 72, ligne 22, \u00e0 la page 73, ligne 22; page 92, lignes 12 \u00e0 15 et de la page 97, ligne 10, \u00e0 la page 98, ligne 2). Une pr\u00e9sentation au comit\u00e9 des sous-ministres adjoints charg\u00e9s de la surveillance intitul\u00e9e Jordan\u2019s Principle: Engaging with partners to design long-term approach (affidavit de Robin Buckland, 25 janvier 2017, pi\u00e8ce H), qui a eu lieu en novembre 2016, indique \u00e0 la page 6, sous \u00ab Activit\u00e9s et \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers \u00bb, qu\u2019un outil de cueillette des donn\u00e9es sera d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 de l\u2019automne 2016 \u00e0 l\u2019hiver 2017; cet outil s\u2019adresse aux coordonnateurs des services d\u2019AANC et de Sant\u00e9 Canada et aux points de contact du principe de Jordan. Toutefois, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le Canada utilisait une d\u00e9finition \u00e9troite du principe de Jordan, il est probable comme nous l\u2019avons vu que le suivi actuel des cas ne cible pas tous les cas potentiellement li\u00e9s au principe de Jordan et qu\u2019il ne tienne pas compte des lacunes dans les services et de tous les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations.\n[105] En ce qui concerne l\u2019affirmation de l\u2019APN que le Canada n\u2019a pas encore compris en quoi consistent les lacunes dans le financement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral octroy\u00e9 aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations, la formation fait remarquer qu\u2019il est mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit dans la pr\u00e9sentation Principe de Jordan \u2013 Initiative de l\u2019enfant d\u2019abord faite le 6 octobre 2016 dans le cadre de la table ronde inuite (affidavit de Cassandra Lang, 25 janvier 2017, pi\u00e8ce 2, annexe I), sous \u00ab Points de mise en \u0153uvre \u00bb, \u00e0 la page 12 : [traduction] \u00ab Effectuer une analyse des \u00e9carts dans chaque province pour ce qui touche les services sociaux et les services de sant\u00e9 destin\u00e9s aux enfants handicap\u00e9s vivant dans les r\u00e9serves \u00bb (voir \u00e9galement Principe de Jordan \u2013 Initiative de l\u2019enfant d\u2019abord de Sant\u00e9 Canada, pr\u00e9sentation dat\u00e9e du 12 octobre 2016 [affidavit de Cassandra Lang, 25 janvier 2017, pi\u00e8ce 2, annexe I, \u00e0 la page 12]).\n[106] Aucun \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier n\u2019indique le moment o\u00f9 cette analyse prendra fin et, compte tenu des arguments susmentionn\u00e9s de la formation concernant la d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan adopt\u00e9e par le Canada, l\u2019analyse devra \u00eatre \u00e9largie pour inclure d\u2019autres sujets que les enfants handicap\u00e9s vivant dans les r\u00e9serves. Les renseignements recueillis doivent refl\u00e9ter le nombre r\u00e9el d\u2019enfants qui ont besoin de services et les \u00e9carts r\u00e9els dans ces services afin d\u2019appuyer de fa\u00e7on efficace les mesures futures.\n[107] Par cons\u00e9quent, la formation ordonne au Canada de suivre et de recueillir des donn\u00e9es sur les affaires li\u00e9es au principe de Jordan conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan \u00e9tablie dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. La formation convient avec la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien que le Canada devrait effectuer un suivi officiel du nombre d\u2019affaires li\u00e9es au principe de Jordan qui sont approuv\u00e9es, rejet\u00e9es ou en cours afin de s\u2019assurer que le Canada met correctement en \u0153uvre ce principe. Par ailleurs, il faudrait effectuer un suivi des mesures de rendement en termes de d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s pour r\u00e9gler les affaires li\u00e9es au principe de Jordan et pour fournir les services approuv\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi, la formation rend les autres ordonnances pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es dans la section \u00ab Ordonnances \u00bb ci-dessous, sous \u00ab Traitement et suivi des cas li\u00e9s au principe de Jordan \u00bb.\n(iii) Rendre publiques la d\u00e9finition et l\u2019approche jug\u00e9es conformes au principe de Jordan\n[108] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le Canada a diffus\u00e9 une d\u00e9finition \u00e9troite du principe de Jordan, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien demande que le Canada soit tenu de faire une mise au point \u00e9crite et proactive aupr\u00e8s des particuliers, des organisations ou des administrations qui ont re\u00e7u ou qui pourraient poss\u00e9der des documents erron\u00e9s sur le principe de Jordan. \u00c0 ce titre, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien demande que le Canada revoie ses ententes de financement et les autres ententes qu\u2019il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclues pour s\u2019assurer qu\u2019elles refl\u00e8tent ad\u00e9quatement la pleine port\u00e9e du principe de Jordan ainsi que sa mise en \u0153uvre.\n[109] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien estime \u00e9galement que le Canada a omis de prendre des mesures officielles pour s\u2019assurer que l\u2019ensemble du personnel comprend et poss\u00e8de les outils et les ressources n\u00e9cessaires pour donner suite aux conclusions de la d\u00e9cision relativement au principe de Jordan et des d\u00e9cisions et ordonnances subs\u00e9quentes rendues par la formation \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[110] La Commission convient qu\u2019il serait appropri\u00e9 que le Tribunal compl\u00e8te son ordonnance initiale en ordonnant au Canada de prendre des mesures pr\u00e9cises, dans des d\u00e9lais fixes, pour informer de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e les fonctionnaires du gouvernement, les organismes fournissant des SEFPN et les membres du grand public de son approche pour se conformer au principe de Jordan. La Commission ajoute que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et les autres parties \u00e0 cette plainte poss\u00e8dent une expertise pr\u00e9cieuse et peuvent contribuer \u00e0 la discussion sur la meilleure fa\u00e7on de sensibiliser le public au principe de Jordan. Ensemble, elles peuvent s\u2019assurer que tous les documents de relations publiques contiennent des renseignements \u00e0 jour, fiables et obtenus directement des personnes qui travaillent tous les jours pour offrir des services d\u2019aide sociale \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et d\u2019autres services destin\u00e9s aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission demande \u00e0 ce que le Canada consulte la Commission, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, l\u2019APN et les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es pour ce qui touche la distribution de tout document de sensibilisation du public.\n[111] Le Canada a soutenu qu\u2019il fait \u00e9galement davantage d\u2019efforts de communication afin d\u2019informer ses partenaires des Premi\u00e8res Nations de la nouvelle approche adopt\u00e9e et des nouvelles ressources disponibles pour soutenir les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations et qu\u2019ils aient la possibilit\u00e9 de s\u2019engager et de faire conna\u00eetre leur point de vue. Il ajoute que, compte tenu du fait que le Canada a termin\u00e9 le travail initial de r\u00e9forme de son approche relativement au principe de Jordan, il est maintenant davantage en mesure de mobiliser les diff\u00e9rentes parties et les autres intervenants afin de discuter des r\u00e9percussions des modifications apport\u00e9es par le Canada. Selon le Canada, la r\u00e9forme est un processus en constante \u00e9volution qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiera de cet engagement.\n[112] Vu la preuve et les conclusions sur la d\u00e9finition et le traitement des affaires li\u00e9es au principe de Jordan, la formation conclut que le Canada doit communiquer \u00e0 nouveau avec ses employ\u00e9s, les organisations avec lesquelles il travaille et ses partenaires des Premi\u00e8res Nations pour les informer de la bonne d\u00e9finition et des nouveaux processus li\u00e9s au principe de Jordan. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, les diverses pr\u00e9sentations faites par le Canada \u00e0 ce jour comportaient une d\u00e9finition restreinte du principe de Jordan; par ailleurs, les processus li\u00e9s \u00e0 ce principe ont r\u00e9cemment \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9s et continueront de l\u2019\u00eatre apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. La d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment adopt\u00e9e par le Canada a fait en sorte que certaines familles ont renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 demander des services si bien que des affaires relevant potentiellement du principe de Jordan n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9es et que des cas urgents n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9s en lien avec ce m\u00eame principe. Le Canada a admis avoir eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 identifier les enfants vis\u00e9s par le principe de Jordan. Il faut diffuser la nouvelle d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan ainsi que les nouveaux processus qui y sont li\u00e9s, et sensibiliser le public, les employ\u00e9s, les organisations concern\u00e9es et tous les partenaires des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Les sites Web d\u2019AANC et de Sant\u00e9 Canada sont de bons endroits pour diffuser cette information puisqu\u2019ils sont faciles d\u2019acc\u00e8s. Par ailleurs, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019audition de la plainte qui nous occupe et des pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates a \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9e sur le RTPA, la formation est d\u2019avis que le R\u00e9seau est \u00e9galement un bon endroit pour diffuser la d\u00e9finition et les processus corrig\u00e9s.\n[113] Il ne fait aucun doute que la Commission devrait \u00eatre consult\u00e9e pour ce qui touche ces activit\u00e9s de diffusion. La Commission a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le actif dans l\u2019affaire au cours des dix derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es et un r\u00f4le central dans la pr\u00e9sentation de la majorit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve lors de l\u2019audience sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte. En outre, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment que la formation peut ordonner \u00ab [...] de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019acte et de prendre, en consultation avec la Commission relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, des mesures [...] \u00bb (non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original).\n[114] Toutefois, la Loi et la jurisprudence applicable r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour ordonner au Canada de consulter les autres parties, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la Commission [voir Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Johnstone, 2013 CF 113 aux paragraphes 164 \u00e0 169 (Johnstone)]. N\u00e9anmoins, compte tenu des circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la formation convient que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et d\u2019autres parties \u00e0 la plainte poss\u00e8dent des connaissances pr\u00e9cieuses et peuvent contribuer aux discussions sur la meilleure fa\u00e7on de sensibiliser le public \u2013 particuli\u00e8rement les peuples des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u2013 au principe de Jordan.\n[115] Un certain nombre de consid\u00e9rations importantes ont permis d\u2019en arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion. Par ailleurs, il faut interpr\u00e9ter la Loi \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de son objet, qui est de rendre ex\u00e9cutoire le principe suivant :\n[\u2026] le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction des leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur [des pratiques discriminatoires].\n[116] Les personnes touch\u00e9es par la d\u00e9cision et les ordonnances subs\u00e9quentes qui veulent avoir des chances \u00e9gales d\u2019\u00e9panouissement sont les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Cela n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le cas dans Johnstone. Comme il est mentionn\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision, les rapports qui existent entre le gouvernement et les peuples autochtones sont de nature fiduciaire plut\u00f4t que contradictoire et la reconnaissance et la confirmation contemporaines des droits ancestraux doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9finies en fonction de ces rapports historiques (voir la d\u00e9cision au paragraphe 93, qui fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 R. c. Sparrow, [1990] 1 RCS 1075, \u00e0 la page 1108). Il est de jurisprudence constante que, dans tous ses rapports avec les peuples autochtones, la Couronne doit agir honorablement [voir la d\u00e9cision au paragraphe 89, qui fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 Nation Ha\u00efda c. Colombie-Britannique (Ministre des For\u00eats), 2004 CSC 73, au paragraphe 16]. Cela signifie que le Canada doit traiter les peuples autochtones de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable et honorable et qu\u2019il existe une relation de fiduciaire sp\u00e9ciale entre la Couronne et les peuples autochtones (voir la d\u00e9cision aux paragraphes 91 \u00e0 95). La Couronne a \u00e9galement le devoir constitutionnel de tenir des consultations significatives avec les peuples autochtones sur les d\u00e9cisions qui les concernent (voir 2016 TCDP 16 au paragraphe 10). La position unique qu\u2019occupent les peuples autochtones au Canada est reconnue \u00e0 l\u2019article 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 et \u00e0 l\u2019article 25 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la Loi, lorsque l\u2019article 67 a \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9 en 2008, le Parlement a confirm\u00e9 ce qui suit dans l\u2019article 1.1 de la Loi modifiant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (L.C. 2008, ch. 30) :\nIl est entendu que l\u2019abrogation de l\u2019article 67 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne porte pas atteinte \u00e0 la protection des droits existants \u2013 ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s \u2013 des peuples autochtones du Canada d\u00e9coulant de la reconnaissance et de leur confirmation au titre de l\u2019article 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982.\n[117] L\u2019affaire dont nous sommes saisis se rapporte \u00e0 la prestation de services d\u2019aide sociale aux enfants et aux familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un domaine qui touche directement les droits fondamentaux des enfants, des familles et des collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations et qui est inextricablement li\u00e9e \u00e0 la notion d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019enfant, principe juridique d\u2019importance capitale dans le droit canadien et international [voir Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2004 CSC 4 au paragraphe 9 et Baker c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), [1999] 2 RCS 817 au paragraphe 75 (Baker)]. Comme le mentionne la d\u00e9cision au paragraphe 346, qui cite le professeur Nicholas Bala :\n[traduction] [L]es arr\u00eats de principe canadiens, les lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et provinciales et les trait\u00e9s internationaux posent tous comme principe que les d\u00e9cisions concernant les enfants doivent se fonder sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation de leur int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un concept fondamental pour ceux qui prennent des d\u00e9cisions impliquant un enfant, non seulement les juges et les avocats, mais \u00e9galement les \u00e9valuateurs et les m\u00e9diateurs.\n[118] Pour s\u2019assurer que les droits des Autochtones et l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations sont respect\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la formation estime que les organismes de gouvernance prot\u00e9geant ces droits et ces int\u00e9r\u00eats et repr\u00e9sentant les enfants et les familles touch\u00e9s par la d\u00e9cision et qui sont des professionnels dans le domaine de l\u2019aide sociale aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations, comme les plaignantes et les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, devraient \u00eatre consult\u00e9s pour ce qui touche la meilleure fa\u00e7on de sensibiliser le public, plus particuli\u00e8rement les peuples des Premi\u00e8res Nations, au principe de Jordan. Cette consultation permettra \u00e9galement de s\u2019assurer que les plans et les documents sont adapt\u00e9s aux particularit\u00e9s culturelles.\n[119] Cette consultation est \u00e9galement raisonnable au regard des observations et des mesures prises par le Canada dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Le Canada a \u00e9galement mis l\u2019accent sur les consultations avec les peuples et les organisations des Premi\u00e8res Nations depuis la d\u00e9cision (voir par exemple le m\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9, 14 mars 2017, aux paragraphes 36 et 39). Le Canada a \u00e9galement reconnu que l\u2019APN et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e9taient des partenaires importants dans le cadre de la r\u00e9forme de ses politiques et de ses programmes. L\u2019APN participe au comit\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutif de surveillance depuis juillet 2016. Mme Cindy Blackstock, directrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e par la ministre de la Sant\u00e9 \u00e0 si\u00e9ger au comit\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutif de surveillance [voir l\u2019affidavit de Robin Buckland, 25 janvier 2017, aux paragraphes 17 et 18; \u00ab Jordan\u2019s Principle, ADM Executive Oversight Committee,Record of Decisions\u00bb, 2 septembre 2016 (affidavit de Robin Buckland, 25 janvier 2017, pi\u00e8ce F, page 2); Lettre de la ministre de la Sant\u00e9, l\u2019honorable Jane Philpott, \u00e0 Mme Cindy Blackstock, directrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada, 22 d\u00e9cembre 2016 (affidavit de Robin Buckland, 25 janvier 2017, pi\u00e8ce G); Sant\u00e9 Canada,Jordan\u2019s Principle: Engaging with partners to design long-term approach, pr\u00e9sentation dat\u00e9e de novembre 2016 (affidavit de Robin Buckland, 25 janvier 2017, pi\u00e8ce H, aux pages 3 \u00e0 7); \u00ab Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la sant\u00e9 des Premi\u00e8res Nations et des Inuits, Forum des cadres r\u00e9gionaux, Compte rendu des discussions et des d\u00e9cisions \u00bb, 9 ao\u00fbt 2016 (r\u00e9ponses aux demandes de Robin Buckland, 7 mars 2017, \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 3A) et \u00ab FNIHB SMC-P&P, Record of Decisions \u00bb, 14 septembre 2016 (r\u00e9ponses aux demandes de Robin Buckland, 7 mars 2017, onglet 5, page 2)].\n[120] Le Canada s\u2019engage \u00e0 travailler avec les organismes fournissant des services aux enfants et aux familles, les fournisseurs de services de premi\u00e8re ligne, les organisations, les dirigeants et les collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations, les plaignantes et les provinces et les territoires pour convenir des \u00e9tapes \u00e0 suivre pour r\u00e9former le programme et des changements \u00e0 apporter qui auront des r\u00e9percussions positives sur les enfants et les familles (voir 2016 TCDP 10, au paragraphe 6). La formation appuie cet engagement et estime que l\u2019obligation de consulter les plaignantes et les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es sur la meilleure fa\u00e7on de sensibiliser le public au principe de Jordan, en particulier les peuples des Premi\u00e8res Nations, permet de renforcer les mesures qui sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 partiellement prises dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. La formation veut s\u2019assurer que cette volont\u00e9 de partenariat se poursuit et que des am\u00e9liorations significatives y sont apport\u00e9es en rendant des ordonnances qui l\u2019officialisent. Par cons\u00e9quent, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi, la formation rend les ordonnances pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es dans la section \u00ab Ordonnances \u00bb ci-dessous, sous \u00ab Rendre publiques la d\u00e9finition et l\u2019approche jug\u00e9es conformes au principe de Jordan \u00bb.\n(iv) Rapports \u00e0 venir\n[121] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien demande qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019avenir le Canada produise ses rapports de conformit\u00e9 sous forme d\u2019affidavit et qu\u2019un \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier soit \u00e9tabli tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t dans le processus pour faciliter le contre-interrogatoire des souscripteurs d\u2019affidavit, qui serait suivi par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des arguments \u00e9crits et des arguments verbaux. L\u2019\u00e9change des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et le contre-interrogatoire des t\u00e9moins rendent le processus li\u00e9 aux mesures correctives plus transparent. L\u2019APN appuie la demande de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien en ce qui a trait aux rapports \u00e0 venir, et le COO a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande semblable pour ce qui touche les ordonnances qu\u2019il r\u00e9clame.\n[122] La Commission ne prend pas position sur cette demande, mais sugg\u00e8re que le Tribunal inclue les pr\u00e9cisions suivantes aux ordonnances qu\u2019il autorise : (i) les param\u00e8tres du rapport, (ii) la fr\u00e9quence des rapports, (iii) la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019obligation de produire des rapports.\n[123] Le processus propos\u00e9 de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien pour ce qui touche les rapports \u00e0 venir est semblable au processus utilis\u00e9 pour entendre les pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates et pour trancher celles-ci. La formation a trouv\u00e9 que ce processus \u00e9tait efficace et que l\u2019utilisation des t\u00e9moignages par affidavit et leur v\u00e9rification lors des contre\u2011interrogatoires aidaient grandement la formation \u00e0 trancher les questions qui lui sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es.\n[124] Toutefois, \u00e0 l\u2019avenir, la formation pr\u00e9f\u00e9rerait que le contre-interrogatoire des souscripteurs d\u2019affidavit ait lieu dans le cadre d\u2019une audience devant la formation et soit assujetti au processus du Tribunal. Dans les pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates, le contre\u2011interrogatoire a eu lieu en dehors du processus du Tribunal, en l\u2019absence des membres de la formation. La formation n\u2019a re\u00e7u qu\u2019une transcription des t\u00e9moignages aux fins d\u2019examen. Cela a soulev\u00e9 deux probl\u00e8mes. Premi\u00e8rement, un diff\u00e9rend est survenu quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si une partie a l\u2019obligation, dans le cadre du contre-interrogatoire de l\u2019auteur d\u2019un affidavit, de s\u2019engager \u00e0 poser des questions auxquelles le souscripteur d\u2019affidavit n\u2019a pas de r\u00e9ponse. Deuxi\u00e8mement, la formation n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019occasion de poser ses propres questions aux t\u00e9moins.\n[125] En ce qui concerne le premier probl\u00e8me, la NNA a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des demandes d\u2019engagement concernant le refus du Canada de financer la proposition de la PN Wapekeka sur la constitution d\u2019une \u00e9quipe de fournisseurs de services de sant\u00e9 mentale au sein de la collectivit\u00e9. Le Canada a refus\u00e9 de s\u2019engager parce que, \u00e0 son avis, le souscripteur d\u2019affidavit avait r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la question de la NNA au meilleur de sa capacit\u00e9 et que les autres questions sortaient du cadre de ses fonctions. Par ailleurs, le Canada affirme qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune obligation juridique de fournir des engagements dans le cadre du contre-interrogatoire de l\u2019auteur d\u2019un affidavit. La NNA a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des arguments et une jurisprudence \u00e0 l\u2019effet contraire et a demand\u00e9 que le t\u00e9moin se pr\u00e9sente devant la formation pour terminer son t\u00e9moignage.\n[126] La formation rejette cette demande, puisque cela ressemble plus \u00e0 une demande d\u2019interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable dans le cadre d\u2019une poursuite civile qu\u2019au contre-interrogatoire d\u2019un t\u00e9moin dans le cadre d\u2019une audience devant le Tribunal. Bien que le paragraphe 48.9(2) de la Loi autorise le pr\u00e9sident \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de pratique r\u00e9gissant les enqu\u00eates pr\u00e9alables instruites par le Tribunal, aucune r\u00e8gle de ce genre n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie \u00e0 ce jour. Au contraire, les parties qui se pr\u00e9sentent devant le Tribunal ont l\u2019obligation de divulguer et de produire des documents potentiellement pertinents tout au long de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal [voir les r\u00e8gles 6(1)d) et e) et 6(5) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (03-05-04)]. Le but de la divulgation des documents est de faire conna\u00eetre le point de vue d\u2019une partie, ce qui permet \u00e0 chaque partie de bien se pr\u00e9parer et de pr\u00e9senter sa cause. La question est de savoir si les renseignements demand\u00e9s sont pertinents et n\u00e9cessaires et permettent \u00e0 la partie de pr\u00e9parer la cause qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9sentera devant le Tribunal.\n[127] Bien que les renseignements demand\u00e9s par la NNA soient sans doute pertinents pour les questions qui sont soulev\u00e9es dans sa requ\u00eate modifi\u00e9e et qu\u2019ils soient tr\u00e8s importants pour les familles et les collectivit\u00e9s qui ont perdu des enfants, ils n\u2019ont pas emp\u00each\u00e9 la NNA d\u2019\u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9 de sa requ\u00eate.\n[128] Les renseignements n\u2019ont \u00e9galement pas aid\u00e9 la formation \u00e0 tirer des conclusions sur la requ\u00eate de la NNA. Le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de tirer des conclusions en se fondant sur l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 du souscripteur d\u2019affidavit \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux questions de la NNA. En ce qui concerne les probl\u00e8mes soulev\u00e9s dans la requ\u00eate de la NNA, les questions de la NNA ont suffi \u00e0 mettre en lumi\u00e8re la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir des processus plus rigoureux pour ce qui touche l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux fonds r\u00e9serv\u00e9s aux affaires li\u00e9es au principe de Jordan de sorte que la situation de la PN Wapekeka ne se reproduise pas.\n[129] En toute justice, bien que la formation ait autoris\u00e9 les parties \u00e0 mener les contre\u2011interrogatoires des souscripteurs d\u2019affidavit en dehors du processus d\u2019audience du Tribunal, ni les parties ni la formation n\u2019ont autoris\u00e9 un processus pour ce qui touche les engagements. Lorsqu\u2019elle est pr\u00e9sente aux contre-interrogatoires, la formation peut r\u00e9gler ce genre de probl\u00e8mes d\u00e8s qu\u2019ils surgissent sans devoir obtenir des observations ou des d\u00e9cisions suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[130] En ce qui concerne le deuxi\u00e8me probl\u00e8me, la formation aimerait avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de poser des questions aux t\u00e9moins. Les contre-interrogatoires qui ont lieu devant la formation pr\u00e9sentent certains avantages : ils permettent \u00e0 la formation de poser ses questions de fa\u00e7on efficace, sans qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire de rappeler des t\u00e9moins, et donnent aux parties l\u2019occasion de poser d\u2019autres questions soulev\u00e9es par les questions de la formation.\n[131] Par cons\u00e9quent, les rapports \u00e0 venir du Canada devront \u00eatre appuy\u00e9s par un ou des affidavits confirmant les renseignements contenus dans le rapport. Des \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers seront \u00e9tablis pour permettre \u00e0 la formation d\u2019assister aux contre\u2011interrogatoires, qui seront suivis du d\u00e9p\u00f4t des arguments verbaux et des observations \u00e9crites, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant. La formation doit garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit la suggestion de la Commission que tous les rapports \u00e0 venir doivent pr\u00e9ciser les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants : i) les param\u00e8tres du rapport, (ii) la fr\u00e9quence des rapports et (iii) la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019obligation de produire des rapports.\n[132] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de et \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi, la formation conserve le pouvoir de rendre les ordonnances susmentionn\u00e9es jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle soit convaincue qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pleinement mises en \u0153uvre. Le Canada devra signifier et d\u00e9poser un rapport et les documents des affidavits pr\u00e9cisant qu\u2019il se conforme \u00e0 chacune de ces ordonnances, conform\u00e9ment au processus d\u00e9crit dans la section \u00ab Ordonnances \u00bb ci-dessous, sous \u00ab R\u00e9tention de juridiction et production de rapports \u00bb.\nV. Ordonnances\n[133] Les ordonnances rendues dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision doivent \u00eatre lues conjointement avec les conclusions susmentionn\u00e9es et avec les conclusions et les ordonnances contenues dans la d\u00e9cision et les d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures (2016 TCDP 2, 2016 TCDP 10 et 2016 TCDP 16). Le fait de s\u00e9parer les ordonnances du raisonnement qui les sous-tend n\u2019aidera pas \u00e0 mettre en \u0153uvre les ordonnances de fa\u00e7on efficace et utile afin de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations et de mettre un terme \u00e0 la discrimination.\n[134] Les d\u00e9lais pr\u00e9cis pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de chacune des ordonnances de la formation sont fournis ci-dessous; ces d\u00e9lais pr\u00e9cisent les attentes de la formation, ce qui permettra d\u2019\u00e9viter les fausses interpr\u00e9tations qui se sont produites dans le pass\u00e9 (notamment pour ce qui touche le terme \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb).\n[135] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, les ordonnances de la formation sont les suivantes :\n1. D\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan\nA. En date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, le Canada doit cesser de s\u2019appuyer sur les d\u00e9finitions du principe de Jordan qui ne se conforment pas aux ordonnances de la formation \u00e9tablies dans 2016 TCDP 2, 2016 TCDP 10, 2016 TCDP 16 et dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, et doit cesser de les perp\u00e9tuer.\nB. En date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, le Canada doit se fonder sur les principes cl\u00e9s suivants pour d\u00e9finir et appliquer le principe de Jordan :\nLe principe de Jordan est un principe qui place l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019enfant en priorit\u00e9 et qui s\u2019applique \u00e9galement \u00e0 tous les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations, qu\u2019ils vivent dans une r\u00e9serve ou non. Il ne s\u2019applique pas seulement aux enfants qui sont en situation de d\u00e9ficience ou qui ont, \u00e0 court terme, des affections m\u00e9dicales particuli\u00e8res suscitant des besoins critiques \u00e0 recevoir des services de sant\u00e9 et des services sociaux ou ayant une incidence sur leurs activit\u00e9s de la vie quotidienne.\nLe principe de Jordan r\u00e9pond aux besoins des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations en s\u2019assurant qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d`\u00e9carts ni de manque dans les services gouvernementaux qui sont offerts \u00e0 ces enfants. Il peut notamment r\u00e9pondre aux lacunes dans la prestation des services de sant\u00e9 mentale, d\u2019\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e, de kin\u00e9sith\u00e9rapie, d\u2019orthophonie et de physioth\u00e9rapie, ainsi que dans l\u2019obtention d\u2019\u00e9quipement m\u00e9dical.\nLorsqu\u2019un service gouvernemental est offert \u00e0 tous les autres enfants, le minist\u00e8re contact\u00e9 en premier doit payer pour les services, sans tenir de conf\u00e9rence sur le cas, proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen au regard des politiques, naviguer \u00e0 travers les diff\u00e9rents services, ou toute autre proc\u00e9dure administrative semblable avant qu\u2019un financement soit fourni. Apr\u00e8s que l\u2019enfant aura re\u00e7u le service, le minist\u00e8re peut demander \u00e0 \u00eatre rembours\u00e9 par un autre minist\u00e8re ou par le gouvernement.\nLorsqu\u2019un service gouvernemental n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement offert \u00e0 tous les autres enfants ou qu\u2019il exc\u00e8de la norme en mati\u00e8re de soins, le minist\u00e8re contact\u00e9 en premier doit \u00e9valuer les besoins particuliers de l\u2019enfant afin de d\u00e9terminer si le service demand\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre offert dans le but de s\u2019assurer que les services offerts \u00e0 l\u2019enfant r\u00e9pondent au principe de l`\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle et qu`ils soient adapt\u00e9s sur le plan culturel et\/ou de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019enfant. Lorsque de tels services sont offerts, le minist\u00e8re contact\u00e9 en premier doit payer pour les services, sans tenir des conf\u00e9rences sur le cas, proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen au regard des politiques, naviguer \u00e0 travers les diff\u00e9rents services ou toute autre proc\u00e9dure administrative semblable avant qu\u2019un financement soit fourni. Une fois que le service a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni, le minist\u00e8re contact\u00e9 en premier peut demander \u00e0 un autre minist\u00e8re ou au gouvernement de le rembourser.\nBien que le principe de Jordan puisse s\u2019appliquer aux conflits de comp\u00e9tence qui surgissent entre les gouvernements (c.-\u00e0-d. entre les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, provinciaux ou territoriaux) et aux conflits de comp\u00e9tences qui surgissent entre les minist\u00e8res d\u2019un m\u00eame gouvernement, un tel conflit n\u2019est pas une condition n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'application du principe de Jordan.\nC. Le Canada ne doit pas utiliser ou diffuser une d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan qui restreint d\u2019une mani\u00e8re quelconque les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au point B.\nD. Le Canada doit r\u00e9examiner les demandes ant\u00e9rieures de financement qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9es, soit en application du principe de Jordan ou autrement \u00e0 partir du 1er avril 2009, pour veiller au respect des principes susmentionn\u00e9s. Le Canada doit terminer cet examen avant le 1er novembre 2017.\n2. Traitement et suivi des cas li\u00e9s au principe de Jordan\nA. Le Canada doit \u00e9laborer des processus ou modifier ses processus existants li\u00e9s au principe de Jordan pour s\u2019assurer que les normes suivantes sont mises en \u0153uvre d\u2019ici le 28 juin 2017 :\nLe minist\u00e8re contact\u00e9 en premier doit \u00e9valuer les besoins particuliers d\u2019un enfant qui demande des services en vertu du principe de Jordan ou qui pourrait \u00eatre admissible en vertu de ce principe.\nL\u2019\u00e9valuation initiale et la d\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 la demande doivent \u00eatre faites dans un d\u00e9lai de 12 \u00e0 48 heures suivant la r\u00e9ception de la demande.\nLe Canada doit cesser de causer des retards en tenant des conf\u00e9rences sur le cas, en proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 un examen au regard des politiques, en naviguant \u00e0 travers les diff\u00e9rents services ou toute autre proc\u00e9dure administrative semblable avant qu\u2019un financement soit fourni.\nSi la demande est accept\u00e9e, le minist\u00e8re contact\u00e9 en premier doit payer pour le service sans tenir de conf\u00e9rence sur le cas, proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen au regard des politiques, en naviguant \u00e0 travers les diff\u00e9rents services ou toute autre proc\u00e9dure administrative semblable avant qu\u2019un financement soit fourni.\nSi la demande est rejet\u00e9e, le minist\u00e8re contact\u00e9 en premier doit informer le demandeur, par \u00e9crit, de son droit d\u2019interjeter appel de la d\u00e9cision, du processus d\u2019appel, des renseignements qu\u2019il devra fournir, du moment auquel le Canada devra d\u00e9cider de l\u2019appel et du fait que des motifs \u00e9crits lui seront fournis si l\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9.\nB. Le Canada doit mettre en oeuvre des syst\u00e8mes et des processus internes fiables d\u2019ici le 28 juin 2017 pour s\u2019assurer que tous les cas potentiellement li\u00e9s au principe de Jordan ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9s et trait\u00e9s, y compris les cas o\u00f9 le demandeur ne sait pas si le principe de Jordan s\u2019applique.\nC. Le Canada doit \u00e9laborer des syst\u00e8mes internes fiables d\u2019ici le 27 juillet 2017 pour effectuer un suivi des \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants : le nombre de demandes qu\u2019il re\u00e7oit et qui sont li\u00e9es au principe de Jordan ou qui pourraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant des affaires li\u00e9es \u00e0 ce principe, la raison de la demande et le service demand\u00e9, l\u2019avancement de chaque cas, le r\u00e9sultat de la demande (accept\u00e9e ou refus\u00e9e) et les motifs applicables, et les d\u00e9lais li\u00e9s au r\u00e8glement de chaque cas, y compris le moment o\u00f9 le service a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni.\nD. Le Canada doit fournir \u00e0 cette formation, un rapport et des affidavits le 15 novembre 2017 et tous les 6 mois suivant la mise en \u0153uvre des syst\u00e8mes internes susmentionn\u00e9s; ces documents doivent d\u00e9crire le suivi des cas li\u00e9s au principe de Jordan. La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir de nouveaux rapports conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance sera revue le 25 mai 2018.\n3. Rendre publiques la d\u00e9finition et l\u2019approche jug\u00e9es conformes au principe de Jordan\nD\u2019ici le 9 juin 2017, le Canada devra afficher un lien tr\u00e8s clair et visible vers les renseignements sur le principe de Jordan, y compris la d\u00e9finition conforme aux pr\u00e9sentes ordonnances, sur les pages d\u2019accueil d\u2019AANC et de Sant\u00e9 Canada.\nD\u2019ici le 28 juin 2017, le Canada devra faire une annonce t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9e bilingue (en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais) sur le RTPA pour fournir des d\u00e9tails sur la nouvelle d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan et les processus qui y sont li\u00e9s et qui se conforment aux pr\u00e9sentes ordonnances.\nD\u2019ici le 9 juin 2017, le Canada devra communiquer avec tous les intervenants qui ont re\u00e7u des documents sur le principe de Jordan depuis le 26 janvier 2016 et les informer par \u00e9crit des conclusions et des ordonnances contenues dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nD\u2019ici le 27 juillet 2017, le Canada devra revoir les ententes conclues avec les organismes de prestations de services qui assurent la coordination des services dans le cadre de l\u2019initiative \u00ab L\u2019enfant d\u2019abord \u00bb et apporter les changements requis pour que ces ententes refl\u00e8tent ad\u00e9quatement la d\u00e9finition et la port\u00e9e du principe de Jordan, \u00e9tablies dans la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance.\nD\u2019ici le 27 juillet 2017, le Canada devra consulter les plaignantes, la Commission et les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es pour \u00e9laborer des documents de formation et de sensibilisation du public relativement au principe de Jordan et financer l\u2019\u00e9laboration de ces documents (qui doivent mentionner la d\u00e9cision et les d\u00e9cisions subs\u00e9quentes); le Canada doit \u00e9galement veiller \u00e0 ce que ces documents soient distribu\u00e9s au public, aux responsables du principe de Jordan, aux membres du comit\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutif de surveillance, aux gestionnaires responsables de l\u2019application du principe de Jordan et de l\u2019initiative \u00ab L\u2019enfant d\u2019abord \u00bb, aux collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations, aux services d\u2019aide sociale \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et aux autres intervenants ou bailleurs de fonds concern\u00e9s.\n4. Maintien de la comp\u00e9tence et production de rapports\nLa formation conserve comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des ordonnances susmentionn\u00e9es pour s\u2019assurer qu\u2019elles sont ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on efficace et utile et pour les clarifier ou les pr\u00e9ciser, au besoin. La formation conservera comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces ordonnances jusqu\u2019au 25 mai 2018; \u00e0 ce moment, elle d\u00e9terminera si elle doit rester saisie de cette question au-del\u00e0 de cette date.\nLe Canada devra signifier et d\u00e9poser des rapports et des affidavits pr\u00e9cisant qu\u2019il se conforme \u00e0 chacune des ordonnances susmentionn\u00e9es d\u2019ici le 15 novembre 2017.\nLes plaignantes et les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es doivent fournir une r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite au rapport du Canada d\u2019ici le 29 novembre 2017 et doivent indiquer (1) si elles souhaitent contre-interroger les affiants du Canada et (2) si elles souhaitent que la formation rende des ordonnances suppl\u00e9mentaires.\nLe Canada doit fournir une r\u00e9ponse, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, d\u2019ici le 6 d\u00e9cembre 2017.\nE. La formation examinera les d\u00e9lais relatifs au contre-interrogatoire des affiants du Canada et les rapports \u00e0 venir une fois que les parties auront soumis leurs observations relativement aux ordonnances 4(C) et 4(D).\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nPr\u00e9sidente de la formation\nEdward P.

D\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate 13\nI. Proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour le r\u00e9examen\n[1] Le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) est saisi pour la troisi\u00e8me fois de l\u2019affaire qui nous occupe. La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate vise \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la proc\u00e9dure qu\u2019il convient de suivre pour le r\u00e9examen de l\u2019affaire.\nII. Contexte\n[2] M. Turner a initialement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) le 8 f\u00e9vrier 2005. Il all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination de la part de l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (l\u2019\u00ab ASFC \u00bb) sur la base de sa race, de son origine nationale ou ethnique, de son \u00e2ge et de la perception d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience fond\u00e9e sur sa masse corporelle, en violation de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb). Les all\u00e9gations d\u00e9coulent de deux concours de l\u2019ASFC tenus en 2003 et 2004.\n[3] Le 24 ao\u00fbt 2007, la Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019instruire la plainte, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi.\n[4] L\u2019ancien pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal, J. Grant Sinclair, a instruit l\u2019affaire \u00e0 Victoria. L\u2019audience, qui a commenc\u00e9 le 17 novembre 2008, s\u2019est \u00e9chelonn\u00e9e sur 10 jours. Le Tribunal a entendu de nombreux t\u00e9moins et re\u00e7u des preuves documentaires ainsi que les plaidoiries finales des parties. Dans sa d\u00e9cision rendue le 10 juin 2010, le membre Sinclair a conclu que la plainte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9e (voir Turner c. Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, 2010 TCDP 15) [la \u00ab d\u00e9cision 1 \u00bb]).\n[5] La d\u00e9cision 1 a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une r\u00e9vision judiciaire de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Dans sa d\u00e9cision en date du 24 juin 2011, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9vision judiciaire (voir Turner c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CF 767).\n[6] La d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a elle-m\u00eame fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un appel devant la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (la \u00ab CAF \u00bb). Dans son arr\u00eat dat\u00e9 du 30 mai 2012, la CAF a accueilli l\u2019appel et annul\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. La CAF a conclu que le Tribunal, dans la d\u00e9cision 1, avait omis d\u2019examiner l\u2019un des motifs de discrimination: la perception d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience fond\u00e9e sur la masse corporelle. La CAF a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal pour nouvel examen par un membre diff\u00e9rent pour qu\u2019il tienne compte des observations de M. Turner relatives \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue et toute possibilit\u00e9 de recoupement des autres motifs all\u00e9gu\u00e9s (voir Turner c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CAF 159).\n[7] \u00c0 la suite de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la CAF concernant la d\u00e9cision 1, lors d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance tenue par l\u2019ancien membre Wallace Craig qui \u00e9tait alors charg\u00e9 du dossier, les parties ont accept\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait pas d\u2019audition de novo pour la nouvelle d\u00e9cision, mais que le membre Craig proc\u00e9derait \u00e0 l\u2019examen du dossier de la d\u00e9cision 1. Ce dossier contenait notamment les observations et les pi\u00e8ces d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par les parties ainsi que la transcription de l\u2019audience. En outre, le membre Craig a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de permettre aux parties de pr\u00e9senter de nouvelles observations finales lors d\u2019une audience, laquelle a eu lieu \u00e0 Victoria en novembre 2013 pendant deux jours.\n[8] Le 7 mars 2014, dans une d\u00e9cision fond\u00e9e sur le dossier de la d\u00e9cision 1, le membre Craig a conclu que la plainte \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e (voir Turner c. Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, 2014 TCDP 10) [la \u00ab d\u00e9cision 2\u00bb]).\n[9] Le membre Craig a rendu une d\u00e9cision distincte sur la r\u00e9paration le 7 mai 2015 (voir Turner c. Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, 2015 TCDP 10).\n[10] La d\u00e9cision 2 a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une r\u00e9vision judiciaire par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Dans sa d\u00e9cision rendue le 26 octobre 2015, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a accueilli la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9vision et ordonn\u00e9 le renvoi de l\u2019affaire \u00e0 un autre tribunal en vue d\u2019un nouvel examen (voir Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Turner, 2015 CF 1209). Aux paragraphes 52 et 53 de sa d\u00e9cision, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[52] Compte tenu de ces points, je conclus que la mani\u00e8re dont le second tribunal a \u00e9valu\u00e9 la preuve ainsi que sa conclusion selon laquelle M. Turner avait \u00e9tabli une preuve de discrimination \u2013 pour s\u2019\u00eatre vu priver de possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi du fait de son \u00e2ge, de sa race et d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue, l\u2019ob\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u2013 sont d\u00e9raisonnables.\nVII. Conclusion et d\u00e9cision\n[53] Les conclusions du tribunal ne sont pas \u00e9tay\u00e9es par les preuves qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises. Par cons\u00e9quent, sa conclusion selon laquelle M. Turner avait \u00e9tabli une preuve de discrimination n\u2019appartient pas aux issues acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit. Il me faut donc accueillir la pr\u00e9sente demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire et ordonner qu\u2019un autre tribunal r\u00e9examine l\u2019affaire.\n[11] La d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e en appel devant la CAF. Dans son arr\u00eat en date du 6 janvier 2017, la CAF a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel (voir Turner c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2017 CAF 2). Aux paragraphes 56 et 70 \u00e0 72, la CAF a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\n[56] J\u2019accepte le point de vue de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon lequel les conclusions du Tribunal quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins ont droit \u00e0 moins de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence que les conclusions en mati\u00e8re de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale parce que le Tribunal a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur la seule transcription, sans b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de l\u2019avantage de l\u2019audition directe des t\u00e9moins, et n\u2019\u00e9tait donc pas en mesure d\u2019\u00e9valuer le comportement de ceux-ci. Tout le monde s\u2019entend pour dire que, dans un monde id\u00e9al, le Tribunal aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre en mesure d\u2019entendre de nouveau les t\u00e9moins. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que le Tribunal aurait pu assigner des t\u00e9moins s\u2019il avait des doutes. Je dois rejeter cet argument puisque les parties ont convenu que le volumineux dossier serait ad\u00e9quat aux fins du nouvel examen. En fait, la transcription de la conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance d\u00e9montre que les deux parties et le Tribunal \u00e9taient conscients des difficult\u00e9s que posait un r\u00e9examen fond\u00e9 sur le seul dossier. Cela dit, le Tribunal devait fonder ses conclusions en mati\u00e8re de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 sur la preuve.\n[\u2026]\n[70] Ces erreurs me convainquent que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal n\u2019est pas appuy\u00e9e par le dossier. Je conclus que le Tribunal a substitu\u00e9 son \u00e9valuation des qualifications de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 celle du jury de s\u00e9lection en concluant que l\u2019appelant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination. Il est manifeste \u00e0 la lecture de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal que celui\u2011ci \u00e9tait en d\u00e9saccord avec les crit\u00e8res utilis\u00e9s par les jurys de s\u00e9lection et a commis une erreur fondamentale en concluant que le premier volet du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Shakes avait \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9, en partie sur le fondement d\u2019une concession qui n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par l\u2019intim\u00e9 (d\u00e9cision du Tribunal aux paragraphes 168, 189, 195, 212 et 220).\n[71] Je dois aussi souligner qu\u2019\u00e0 mon avis, rien ne justifie les conclusions d\u00e9favorables quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 tir\u00e9es par le Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9, en particulier en ce qui concerne M. Tarnawski (d\u00e9cision du Tribunal aux paragraphes 181, 189, 228 et 233) et M. Baird (idem aux paragraphes 135, 141, 149, 152, 252 et 253), et qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait certainement aucune raison de recourir \u00e0 des adjectifs p\u00e9joratifs. Apr\u00e8s examen de la transcription, il est manifeste que les conclusions du Tribunal en mati\u00e8re de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 ne sont pas \u00e9tay\u00e9es par le dossier.\nV. Conclusion\n[72] Pour tous ces motifs, je conclus, sur la base des faits et du droit, que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal se situe hors du cadre des issues justifiables. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\n[12] Lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance que j\u2019ai tenue le 20 mars 2017, les parties n\u2019ont pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 s\u2019entendre sur la proc\u00e9dure qu\u2019il convenait de suivre pour le r\u00e9examen de l\u2019affaire ordonn\u00e9 par les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales dans leurs d\u00e9cisions relatives \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision 2. J\u2019ai autoris\u00e9 les parties \u00e0 formuler des observations \u00e9crites \u00e9non\u00e7ant leur position respective quant \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour le r\u00e9examen, ce qu\u2019elles ont fait.\nIII. Positions des parties\nA. Position de M. Turner\n[13] La position de M. Turner est que rien ne justifie une audition de novo de la plainte. Le Tribunal devrait plut\u00f4t examiner le dossier de la d\u00e9cision 1 comme le membre Craig l\u2019a fait dans la d\u00e9cision 2. Toutefois, M. Turner veut que, dans le cadre de son r\u00e9examen, le Tribunal tienne une [traduction] \u00ab audience partielle de novo \u00bb pour recevoir de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve mis au jour. Les parties devraient \u00e9galement avoir le droit de formuler des observations orales devant le Tribunal.\n[14] Le plaignant pr\u00e9sente les arguments suivants \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa position :\nLa CAF a maintenant ordonn\u00e9 au Tribunal de r\u00e9examiner l\u2019affaire et de d\u00e9terminer la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre.Le Tribunal est \u00ab ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure \u00bb. Comme la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas ordonn\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019une audience de novo comme le demande l\u2019ASFC, on peut en d\u00e9duire que la CAF ne s\u2019attendait pas \u00e0 ce que le Tribunal tienne une audience de novo et le faire serait incompatible avec l\u2019arr\u00eat de la CAF.\nIl n\u2019est pas loisible au Tribunal de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la tenue d\u2019une audience compl\u00e8te de novo puisque le membre Craig avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9cid\u00e9, avec l\u2019accord de l\u2019ASFC, qu\u2019une audience de novo ne serait pas n\u00e9cessaire, et aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment nouveau depuis la d\u00e9cision 2 n\u2019\u00e9tait susceptible de justifier un changement de cap. L\u2019accord de l\u2019ASFC par rapport \u00e0 cette approche est not\u00e9 explicitement dans la d\u00e9cision de la CAF comme appuyant la pertinence du dossier existant pour les besoins d\u2019un r\u00e9examen. De plus, la tenue d\u2019une audience de novo retarderait inutilement les choses et ajouterait divers co\u00fbts, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 l\u2019estimation de la dur\u00e9e d\u2019une audience de novo \u2013 trois semaines, alors que les plaidoiries ne prendraient que deux jours (le plaignant n\u2019a pas express\u00e9ment fourni d\u2019estimation de temps pour [traduction] \u00ab [l']audience partielle de novo \u00bb qu\u2019il sollicite).\nIl n\u2019est pas logique de ne pas tenir compte de la transcription de l\u2019audience relative \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision 1 tenue en 2008 et 2009 et d\u2019entendre maintenant des t\u00e9moignages oraux qui seraient moins fiables et, par cons\u00e9quent, potentiellement pr\u00e9judiciables en raison de la longue p\u00e9riode \u00e9coul\u00e9e.\nDes probl\u00e8mes pourraient se poser si, \u00e0 l\u2019audience de novo, la preuve orale des t\u00e9moins \u00e9tait incompatible avec celle qu\u2019ils ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience initiale. D\u2019autres difficult\u00e9s pourraient survenir en raison de l\u2019absence d\u2019un t\u00e9moin cl\u00e9 de l\u2019ASFC qui a fait une d\u00e9position \u00e0 l\u2019audience initiale, mais dont on ne s\u2019attend pas \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il puisse t\u00e9moigner, pour des raisons personnelles, \u00e0 une nouvelle audience.\nIl n\u2019existe aucune obligation juridique de tenir une audience de novo. Aucune des \u00ab raisons traditionnelles \u00bb qui pourraient commander la tenue d\u2019une audience de novo n\u2019est pr\u00e9sente en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce (\u00e0 savoir partialit\u00e9, manquement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale ou questions de fait non r\u00e9solues).\nM. Turner soutient qu\u2019il existe des documents pertinents relatifs aux processus de s\u00e9lection en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produits avant l\u2019audience initiale et dont il a l\u2019intention de demander la production. La justice naturelle exige que l\u2019on permette aux parties de s'appuyer sur de tels \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e pour r\u00e9examen, et le Tribunal est tenu de les examiner. Par ailleurs, il pourrait y avoir d\u2019autres lacunes dans la preuve connue des parties, qu\u2019il serait appropri\u00e9 d\u2019examiner, selon M. Turner, dans le cadre de nouveaux t\u00e9moignages, sous r\u00e9serve du droit d\u2019objection des parties et de la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard du Tribunal.\nB. Position de l\u2019ASFC\n[15] La position de l\u2019ASFC est que les principes de justice naturelle et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale exigent l\u2019audition de novo de toute l\u2019affaire.\n[16] L\u2019ASFC pr\u00e9sente les arguments suivants \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa position :\nLes motifs de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la CAF relatif \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision 1 et les motifs de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la CAF relatif \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision 2 sont fonci\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rents, et la position de l\u2019ASFC concernant la proc\u00e9dure qui devrait dor\u00e9navant \u00eatre suivie par le Tribunal pour le r\u00e9examen est attribuable \u00e0 ces diff\u00e9rences.\nEn ce qui concerne la d\u00e9cision 1, la CAF a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire au Tribunal pour qu\u2019il rende une nouvelle d\u00e9cision en tenant pour acquis que les motifs du membre Sinclair \u00e9taient muets quant \u00e0 l\u2019un des motifs de discrimination (perception d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience fond\u00e9e sur la masse corporelle) et son interrelation avec les autres motifs, mais le membre Sinclair avait pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 une audience de plus de 10 jours et avait eu la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuer de fa\u00e7on compl\u00e8te le comportement des t\u00e9moins. Pour ce motif, l\u2019ASFC a accept\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision 2 soit rendue sur la seule base de l\u2019examen du dossier.\nEn ce qui concerne la d\u00e9cision 2, la CAF a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de renvoyer l\u2019affaire au Tribunal pour un r\u00e9examen en tenant pour acquis que les motifs du membre Craig \u00e9taient d\u00e9raisonnables, car il avait commis des erreurs fondamentales en tirant ses erreurs de fait et \u00e9tait parvenu \u00e0 des conclusions d\u00e9favorables quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 qui n\u2019\u00e9taient aucunement \u00e9tay\u00e9es par le dossier. La CAF a indiqu\u00e9 que le membre Craig avait fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur la preuve contenue dans les transcriptions sans entendre directement les d\u00e9positions des t\u00e9moins et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait par cons\u00e9quent pas en mesure d\u2019\u00e9valuer leur comportement. La CAF a exprim\u00e9 l\u2019avis suivant : [traduction] \u00ab Tout le monde s\u2019entend pour dire que, dans un monde id\u00e9al, le Tribunal aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre en mesure d\u2019entendre de nouveau les t\u00e9moins \u00bb (2017 CAF 2, par. 56).\nContrairement aux circonstances de la d\u00e9cision 2 dans lesquelles le membre Craig devait rendre sa d\u00e9cision, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les parties ne se sont pas entendues sur la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre par le Tribunal pour le r\u00e9examen. L\u2019absence de consentement de l\u2019ASFC \u00e0 un r\u00e9examen du Tribunal sur dossier plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 une audience de novo est attribuable aux diff\u00e9rences entre la d\u00e9cision 1 et la d\u00e9cision 2. Dans la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale relative \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision 2, celle-ci a jug\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision du membre Craig \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable en raison d\u2019erreurs de fait et de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tay\u00e9es par la preuve contenue dans les transcriptions, sans entendre directement les d\u00e9positions de t\u00e9moins.\nEn l\u2019absence d\u2019un consentement unanime des parties \u00e0 une audience sur la base de tout ou partie du dossier existant, la r\u00e8gle audi alteram partem -- \u00ab il appartient \u00e0 celui qui entend la cause de la trancher \u00bb -- exige qu\u2019une audience de novo soit tenue. L\u2019ASFC n\u2019a pas renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son droit. Il serait port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et \u00e0 la justice naturelle s\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019audience de novo, laquelle permettrait au Tribunal d\u2019entendre directement les d\u00e9positions des t\u00e9moins et d\u2019avoir la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuer leur comportement et leur cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9.\nL\u2019ASFC est fortement en d\u00e9saccord avec les d\u00e9clarations faites par M. Turner dans ses observations selon lesquelles [traduction] \u00ab pour une raison quelconque \u00bb l\u2019ASFC n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 ses obligations de divulgation [traduction] \u00ab avant l\u2019audience pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente \u00bb et qu\u2019il existait de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 communiquer par l\u2019ASFC dans le cadre d\u2019une [traduction] \u00ab audience partielle de novo \u00bb.\nL\u2019ASFC reconna\u00eet la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de r\u00e9duire les co\u00fbts et les d\u00e9lais en s\u2019entendant de bonne foi avec M. Turner sur les faits non en litige et les t\u00e9moignages et \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaires non contest\u00e9s, lesquels n\u2019ont pas besoin d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu\u2019ils l\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 devant le membre Sinclair. L\u2019ASFC confirme que l\u2019un des t\u00e9moins ne sera pas en mesure de t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 la nouvelle audience pour des raisons personnelles et qu\u2019il faut d\u00e9cider de la fa\u00e7on dont sa preuve devra \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\nIV. Analyse\n[17] Je n\u2019estime pas que le consentement de l\u2019ASFC \u00e0 utiliser le dossier ant\u00e9rieur pour la d\u00e9cision 2 la lie maintenant de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit quant \u00e0 un \u00e9ventuel nouvel emploi du dossier ant\u00e9rieur aux fins du pr\u00e9sent r\u00e9examen. Je n\u2019estime pas non plus que le commentaire de la CAF sur l\u2019accord ant\u00e9rieur de l\u2019ASFC \u00e0 un examen sur dossier puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une conclusion selon laquelle le dossier pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au membre Craig \u00e9tait ad\u00e9quat pour le r\u00e9examen en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. \u00c0 mon avis, la CAF rejetait simplement au paragraphe 56 \u2013 reproduit ci-dessus \u2013 de son arr\u00eat (2017 CAF 2) un argument formul\u00e9 par l\u2019ASFC devant elle, \u00e0 savoir que le membre Craig aurait pu entendre des t\u00e9moignages oraux s\u2019il l\u2019avait voulu. Elle faisait simplement remarquer que les parties avaient convenu, aux fins de l\u2019audience tenue par le membre Craig, que le dossier \u00e9tait ad\u00e9quat. Rien dans cet arr\u00eat ne me donne \u00e0 penser que la CAF \u00e9tait aussi parvenue \u00e0 la conclusion que la proc\u00e9dure suivie par le membre Craig \u00e9tait la meilleure fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der pour lui. En fait, ce paragraphe peut aussi \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme signifiant le contraire.\n[18] De plus, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord avec l\u2019affirmation de M. Turner selon laquelle la CAF, en ne pr\u00e9cisant pas qu\u2019une audience de novo devait maintenant \u00eatre tenue par le Tribunal pour son r\u00e9examen de l\u2019affaire, avait conclu implicitement qu\u2019une audience de novo n\u2019est pas une fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e de proc\u00e9der pour le r\u00e9examen ou que la proc\u00e9dure propos\u00e9e par M. Turner est plus appropri\u00e9e. On peut \u00e9galement soutenir qu\u2019en ne pr\u00e9cisant pas que le Tribunal doit maintenant statuer sur l\u2019affaire sur dossier, la CAF a implicitement d\u00e9sapprouv\u00e9 une telle proc\u00e9dure, particuli\u00e8rement en raison de ses commentaires au paragraphe 56 de son arr\u00eat (2017 CAF 2) au sujet des [traduction] \u00ab probl\u00e8mes \u00bb associ\u00e9s \u00e0 cette fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der et aux avantages de pouvoir [traduction] \u00ab entendre de nouveau les t\u00e9moins \u00bb.\n[19] Ce que nous savons, sans avoir besoin d\u2019inf\u00e9rer quoi que ce soit, c\u2019est que la CAF n\u2019a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 aucune fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der pour le r\u00e9examen actuel et a par cons\u00e9quent laiss\u00e9 au Tribunal le soin de trancher cette question. Pour d\u00e9cider de la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre, le Tribunal est avant tout tenu d\u2019agir \u00e9quitablement.\n[20] L\u2019obligation d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 commande que les parties touch\u00e9es par une d\u00e9cision aient \u00ab [\u2026] la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter enti\u00e8rement et \u00e9quitablement leur position, et [aient] droit \u00e0 ce que les d\u00e9cisions touchant leurs droits, int\u00e9r\u00eats ou privil\u00e8ges soient prises \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un processus \u00e9quitable, impartial et ouvert, adapt\u00e9 au contexte l\u00e9gal institutionnel et social de la d\u00e9cision \u00bb (voir Baker c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), [1999] 2 RCS 817, par. 28 [\u00ab Baker \u00bb]).\n[21] En effet, le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi dispose :\nLe membre instructeur, apr\u00e8s avis conforme \u00e0 la Commission, aux parties et, \u00e0 son appr\u00e9ciation, \u00e0 tout int\u00e9ress\u00e9, instruit la plainte pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9; il donne \u00e0 ceux-ci la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations.\nDe plus, le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que \u00ab [l\u2019]instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique \u00bb.\n[22] Un aspect de l\u2019obligation d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale est le principe selon lequel il appartient \u00e0 celui qui entend la cause de la trancher. Par cons\u00e9quent, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale exige que les d\u00e9cideurs entendent toute la preuve ainsi que tous les arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les parties (voir Sitba c. Consolidated-Bathurst Packaging Ltd., [1990] 1 RCS 282, p. 329 [\u00ab Consolidated-Bathurst \u00bb]). Pour reprendre les termes de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Consolidated-Bathurst, \u00e0 la page 335 :\nDans toute d\u00e9cision, les membres du banc doivent \u00e9tablir les faits, les normes juridiques \u00e0 appliquer \u00e0 ces faits et, enfin, ils doivent \u00e9valuer la preuve conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ces normes juridiques. [\u2026] La d\u00e9termination et l\u2019\u00e9valuation des faits sont des t\u00e2ches d\u00e9licates qui d\u00e9pendent de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins et de l\u2019\u00e9valuation globale de la pertinence de tous les renseignements pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les personnes qui n\u2019ont pas entendu toute la preuve ne sont pas \u00e0 m\u00eame de bien remplir cette t\u00e2che et les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle ne permettent pas \u00e0 ces personnes de voter sur l\u2019issue du litige.\n[23] Le d\u00e9cideur doit entendre toute la preuve et les arguments des parties, mais cela n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019audience a lieu. Autrement dit, l\u2019existence d\u2019une obligation d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas d\u00e9terminante quant aux exigences proc\u00e9durales applicables dans une situation donn\u00e9e. Il faut tenir compte du contexte de chaque affaire pour d\u00e9terminer le contenu de l\u2019obligation d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale (voir Baker, par. 21).\n[24] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas besoin d\u2019entendre toute la preuve orale pour trancher les questions de fond qui lui sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es (voir Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 445, par. 115-158 [\u00ab Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00bb]; et Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des Postes, 2004 CF 81, par. 5-20). Pour reprendre les mots de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations, aux paragraphes 128 et 148-149 :\n[128] L\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour parvenir promptement \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision \u00e9quitable et juste \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chaque plainte dont il est saisi rel\u00e8ve donc \u00e0 bon droit de la fonction juridictionnelle du Tribunal. La nature de cette proc\u00e9dure peut varier d\u2019un cas \u00e0 l\u2019autre, en fonction du genre de questions en cause.\n[\u2026]\n[148] [\u2026] Dans chaque cas, le Tribunal doit examiner les faits et les questions qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et d\u00e9terminer la proc\u00e9dure qu\u2019il convient de suivre dans le but de garantir un processus d\u2019audience aussi informel et rapide que le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure le permet.\n[149] Le processus retenu par le Tribunal doit cependant \u00eatre \u00e9quitable et il doit en toutes circonstances donner \u00e0 chacune des parties \u00ab la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre, [\u2026] de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations \u00bb en ce qui concerne la question en litige.\n[25] Ce raisonnement est conforme \u00e0 la description de l\u2019obligation d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale dans Baker ainsi qu\u2019au raisonnement de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Prassad c. Canada (Ministre de l\u2019Emploi et de l\u2019Immigration), [1989] 1 RCS 560, aux pages 568-569 :\nEn r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ces tribunaux sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s ma\u00eetres chez eux. En l\u2019absence de r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9cises \u00e9tablies par loi ou r\u00e8glement, ils fixent leur propre proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 la condition de respecter les r\u00e8gles de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et, dans l\u2019exercice de fonctions judiciaires ou quasi judiciaires, de respecter les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle.\n[26] Cela dit, en pr\u00e9sence de questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de preuves contradictoires, l\u2019audition de vive voix des t\u00e9moins devient plus n\u00e9cessaire. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au paragraphe 59 de Singh c. Ministre de l\u2019Emploi et de l\u2019Immigration, [1985] 1 RCS 177 :\nJe ferai cependant remarquer que, m\u00eame si les auditions fond\u00e9es sur des observations \u00e9crites sont compatibles avec les principes de justice fondamentale pour certaines fins, elles ne donnent pas satisfaction dans tous les cas. Je pense en particulier que, lorsqu\u2019une question importance de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 est en cause, la justice fondamentale exige que cette question soit tranch\u00e9e par voie d\u2019audition. Les cours d\u2019appel sont bien conscientes de la faiblesse inh\u00e9rente des transcriptions lorsque des questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 sont en jeu et elles sont donc tr\u00e8s peu dispos\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9viser les conclusions des tribunaux qui ont eu l\u2019avantage d\u2019entendre les t\u00e9moins en personne : voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Stein c. Le navire \u00ab Kathy K \u00bb, [1975 CanLII 146 (CSC)] [1976] 2 R.C.S. 802, aux pp. 806\u201108 (le juge Ritchie). Je puis difficilement concevoir une situation o\u00f9 un tribunal peut se conformer \u00e0 la justice fondamentale en tirant, uniquement \u00e0 partir d\u2019observations \u00e9crites, des conclusions importantes en mati\u00e8re de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9.\n[27] Dans le contexte des instances en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a aussi adopt\u00e9 un point de vue similaire, d\u00e9clarant dans Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations, au paragraphe 141 :\n[141] La majorit\u00e9 des affaires en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne sont tr\u00e8s fortement tributaires de faits qui leur sont propres, lesquels sont souvent vigoureusement contest\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, de nombreux cas mettent en jeu de graves questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Bien que le Tribunal puisse recevoir des preuves par affidavit, plus les faits sont \u00e2prement contest\u00e9s et plus les enjeux li\u00e9s \u00e0 des questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 sont importants, moins il convient de proc\u00e9der de la sorte. En pareils cas, il pourrait bien \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019entendre l\u2019affaire au fond, ce qui implique l\u2019audition de t\u00e9moins en preuve principale et en contre-interrogatoire en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un membre du Tribunal.\n[28] Dans l\u2019affaire qui nous occupe, je dois soupeser \u00e0 la fois l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et la rapidit\u00e9 avec laquelle on peut trancher la requ\u00eate. Les parties ont propos\u00e9 des arguments valides pour les deux types de proc\u00e9dures. Tout bien consid\u00e9r\u00e9, je crois toutefois qu\u2019il est plus \u00e9quitable et plus rapide de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une audition compl\u00e8te de novo pour les raisons suivantes :\nLes deux parties ne consentent pas \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation du dossier de l\u2019audience orale tenue devant le membre Sinclair comme elles l\u2019avaient fait pour le r\u00e9examen du membre Craig. Je ne connais aucune affaire o\u00f9 le Tribunal a refus\u00e9 de tenir une audience de novo lors d\u2019un r\u00e9examen lorsqu\u2019une partie l\u2019a demand\u00e9.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, des questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de preuve contradictoire sont en jeu. J\u2019ai la chance de pouvoir \u00e9viter les difficult\u00e9s auxquelles le membre Craig a \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9 en ayant la possibilit\u00e9 de voir et d\u2019entendre les t\u00e9moins en personne et de leur poser des questions moi-m\u00eame. Toutes les questions relatives \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 ou aux contradictions de la preuve susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre soulev\u00e9es lors de l\u2019audience de novo seront ainsi mieux trait\u00e9es si elles se pr\u00e9sentent.Le Tribunal et les parties seront alors mieux plac\u00e9s pour \u00e9valuer la situation.\nLe temps que cela me prendrait pour lire correctement les transcriptions et examiner en d\u00e9tail le dossier de l\u2019audience pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente doit \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration. Il est peu probable qu\u2019on gagnerait beaucoup de temps en examinant le dossier initial \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que M. Turner a demand\u00e9 une [traduction] \u00ab audience partielle de novo \u00bb qui elle-m\u00eame risque de rallonger la proc\u00e9dure et d\u2019apporter de la confusion.\nDe plus, je m\u2019attends \u00e0 ce que les parties agissent de bonne foi pour r\u00e9duire le temps et les co\u00fbts de l\u2019audience en s\u2019entendant sur les faits et les documents qui ne sont pas contest\u00e9s et en prenant les mesures n\u00e9cessaires et \u00e0 leur disposition pour simplifier les choses.\nV. D\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate\n[29] Pour ces motifs, la proc\u00e9dure pour le r\u00e9examen de la pr\u00e9sente affaire se fera au moyen d\u2019une audience de novo.\n[30] Les questions relatives aux nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, \u00e0 la divulgation et \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de la transcription de l\u2019audience pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente dans le cadre de l\u2019audience de novo seront discut\u00e9es lors de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

La pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, vise l\u2019obtention d\u2019une ordonnance fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 8(1) des R\u00e8gles et accordant \u00e0 Mme Stetskevych le statut de personne int\u00e9ress\u00e9e afin qu\u2019elle puisse pr\u00e9senter des observations \u00e9crites et orales \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[2] La plainte de M. Attaran contre d\u2019IRCC a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la CCDP ou la Commission) le 28 juillet 2010. Dans cette plainte, il \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les importants retards dans le traitement des demandes de parrainage de parents et de grands-parents, comparativement \u00e0 d\u2019autres groupes de la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial (au sens du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la Loi sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, S.C. 2001, ch. 27), \u00e9taient discriminatoires, ce qui allait en violation de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (la Loi).\n[3] Le 22 f\u00e9vrier 2012, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019une enqu\u00eate sur la plainte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9e. M. Attaran a ensuite pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire du refus, par la Commission, de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal). La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 sa demande; M. Attaran a alors interjet\u00e9 appel de cette d\u00e9cision aupr\u00e8s de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (la CAF).\n[4] Le 3 f\u00e9vrier 2015, la CAF a accueilli l\u2019appel et renvoy\u00e9 la plainte \u00e0 la CCDP, apr\u00e8s avoir conclu que celle-ci n\u2019avait pas examin\u00e9 ad\u00e9quatement la question du motif justifiable invoqu\u00e9 par IRCC (Attaran c. Canada (P.G.), 2015 CAF 37).\n[5] Le 6 septembre 2016, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi, la Commission a demand\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Attaran.\n[6] Les parties en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ont soumis leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions respectifs, mais les dates de l\u2019audience n\u2019ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9es.\n[7] \u00c0 l\u2019instar de M. Attaran, Mme Stetskevych a parrain\u00e9 ses parents pour qu\u2019ils immigrent au Canada. Elle soutient avoir subi des revers au cours du processus, et elle estime avoir, elle aussi, subi un traitement discriminatoire de la part d\u2019IRCC. Mme Stetskevych conteste certains points de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et affirme avoir souffert encore davantage que M. Attaran.\nII. Le droit\n[8] L\u2019article 50 de la Loi conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019accorder \u00e0 une personne le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e. Il incombe au demandeur de d\u00e9montrer en quoi son expertise aidera \u00e0 trancher les questions en litige. Le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e ne sera pas accord\u00e9 s\u2019il ne contribue pas de fa\u00e7on importante aux positions juridiques des parties all\u00e9guant un point de vue semblable : Schnell c. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc., [2001] D.C.D.P. no 14, au paragraphe 6 (T.C.D.P) (QL); Nkwazi c. Canada (Service correctionnel), 2000 CanLII 28883 (T.C.D.P.), au paragraphe 23 (QL); Warman c. Lemire, 2006 T.C.D.P. 8, au paragraphe 18.\n[9] L\u2019article 8 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal est libell\u00e9 comme suit :\n8(1) Une personne qui n\u2019est pas une partie et qui souhaite \u00eatre reconnue par le membre instructeur comme partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une instruction peut pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate \u00e0 cet effet.\n8(2) Toute requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 8(1) doit se conformer aux exigences \u00e9nonc\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 3 et doit pr\u00e9ciser le degr\u00e9 de participation \u00e0 l\u2019instruction recherch\u00e9.\n[10] Mme Stetskevych a fait savoir, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 8(2) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, qu\u2019elle souhaitait se voir accorder la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des observations \u00e9crites et orales au Tribunal.\nIII. Les positions des parties\n[11] Au paragraphe 11 de sa requ\u00eate, Mme Stetskevych indique que son [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] exp\u00e9rience et sa participation \u00e0 l\u2019instance ajouteraient \u00e0 la position juridique du plaignant et contribueraient \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer plus clairement le traitement d\u00e9favorable r\u00e9serv\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e aux parents parrain\u00e9s \u00e0 des fins d\u2019immigration au Canada, comparativement \u00e0 d\u2019autres membres de la famille \u00bb.\n[12] M. Attaran n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019observations en bonne et due forme au sujet de cette requ\u00eate. Toutefois, il a fait parvenir au Greffe du Tribunal un courriel o\u00f9 il indiquait qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab consentait \u00e0 l\u2019intervention \u00bb de Mme Stetskevych, [traduction] \u00ab avec pleins droits de participation \u00bb.\n[13] La Commission a exprim\u00e9 des pr\u00e9occupations quant au fait que Mme Stetskevych n\u2019a pas satisfait au crit\u00e8re appliqu\u00e9 par le Tribunal pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019ajouter une personne \u00e0 titre de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e. N\u00e9anmoins, la Commission fait valoir que Mme Stetskevych pourrait \u00eatre appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner par M. Attaran afin de faire part de son exp\u00e9rience.\n[14] L\u2019intim\u00e9e estime qu\u2019il ne serait pas acceptable d\u2019accorder \u00e0 Mme Stetskevych le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que celle-ci ne r\u00e9pond pas au crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Walden c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor) 2011 TCDP 19 (\u00ab Walden \u00bb). Au paragraphe 23 de la d\u00e9cision Walden, le Tribunal a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 comme suit le crit\u00e8re applicable :\n[23] En bref, la jurisprudence indique que le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 par le Tribunal dans les situations o\u00f9 :\na) l\u2019expertise de l\u2019\u00e9ventuelle partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e aiderait le Tribunal;\nb) sa participation ajouterait \u00e0 la position juridique des parties;\nc) l\u2019instance pourrait avoir des r\u00e9percussions sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la partie requ\u00e9rante.\n[15] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que Mme Stetskevych ne satisfait \u00e0 aucune des exigences pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. D\u2019abord, Mme Stetskevych a parrain\u00e9 ses parents aux fins d\u2019immigration, mais elle l\u2019a fait bien plus tard que M. Attaran, et en vertu d\u2019un nouveau r\u00e9gime qui comporte une part de chance ou repose sur un tirage au sort pour qu\u2019un demandeur puisse se voir accorder la possibilit\u00e9 de parrainer des parents ou des grands-parents. Cela rend sa situation sensiblement diff\u00e9rente de celle de M. Attaran. Ensuite, Mme Stetskevych n\u2019ajoutera pas \u00e0 la position juridique de M. Attaran, car sa plainte, ainsi qu\u2019elle le pr\u00e9cise au paragraphe 8 de sa requ\u00eate, [traduction] \u00ab porte exactement sur la m\u00eame question juridique \u00bb. Enfin, l\u2019issue de la plainte de M. Attaran n\u2019aura aucune incidence sur la situation de Mme Stetskevych, dans la mesure o\u00f9 la demande de parrainage de celle-ci est soumise \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble de r\u00e8gles nettement diff\u00e9rentes de celles qui s\u2019appliquent au cas de M. Attaran, notamment en ce qui concerne le nouveau syst\u00e8me de tirage au sort qui est employ\u00e9 pour s\u00e9lectionner les demandes, et qui vise \u00e0 g\u00e9rer le flux de celles-ci.\nIV. D\u00e9cision\n[16] De temps \u00e0 autre, le Tribunal re\u00e7oit des demandes visant l\u2019obtention du statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e. Habituellement, elles sont li\u00e9es \u00e0 des cas qui ont une grande visibilit\u00e9, et qui pr\u00e9sentent une dimension d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public importante. Or, bien souvent, les demandeurs omettent de traiter de la question de savoir s\u2019ils fourniront au Tribunal d\u2019autres pr\u00e9cisions et perspectives utiles qui l\u2019aideront effectivement \u00e0 la prise d\u2019une d\u00e9cision. Pour que sa demande soit accueillie, la personne qui pr\u00e9sente une requ\u00eate afin d\u2019agir en qualit\u00e9 de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e doit convaincre le Tribunal qu\u2019elle d\u00e9tient une expertise ou une perspective dont le Tribunal ne dispose pas d\u00e9j\u00e0. Le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e ne devrait pas \u00eatre accord\u00e9 \u00e0 un tiers afin de lui servir de tribune pour faire des d\u00e9clarations de principe sans rapport avec l\u2019affaire dont le Tribunal est saisi. Une telle participation devrait \u00eatre limit\u00e9e aux parties qui peuvent concr\u00e8tement ajouter aux d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Tribunal (voir p. ex. SEFPN c. Canada, 2016 TCDP 11, aux paragraphes 3 et 4, ainsi que 10 et 11).\n[17] Bien que je sois convaincu que la demande de parrainage de Mme Stetskevych est assujettie \u00e0 un ensemble de r\u00e8gles bien diff\u00e9rentes de celles ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9es dans le cas de M. Attaran, son argument est essentiellement le m\u00eame que celui avanc\u00e9 par M. Attaran, \u00e0 savoir que les demandes de parrainage des parents et des grands-parents sont trait\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re bien diff\u00e9rente de celles visant d\u2019autres membres de la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial. Par cons\u00e9quent, advenant que le Tribunal conclue \u00e0 une discrimination dans le cas de M. Attaran, il est envisageable que cette d\u00e9cision puisse avoir des effets sur la demande de parrainage de Mme Stetskevych et sur d\u2019autres demandes du m\u00eame genre.\n[18] Cela dit, Mme Stetskevych n\u2019a pas convaincu le Tribunal que ses observations orales et \u00e9crites d\u00e9crivant son exp\u00e9rience aideraient le Tribunal \u00e0 statuer sur la plainte dont il est saisi. Elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019elle poss\u00e9dait une expertise particuli\u00e8re, en dehors du fait qu\u2019elle soit elle aussi une r\u00e9pondante en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration dont les efforts ont \u00e9t\u00e9 contrari\u00e9s. M\u00eame si, \u00e0 certains \u00e9gards, son exp\u00e9rience a pu avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 similaire \u00e0 celle du plaignant, son intervention \u00e0 titre de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e n\u2019apporterait pas n\u00e9cessairement un point de vue diff\u00e9rent sur les positions juridiques d\u00e9j\u00e0 mises en avant par M. Attaran.\n[19] Peut-\u00eatre Mme Stetskevych a-t-elle des motifs valables qui justifieraient qu\u2019elle d\u00e9pose sa propre plainte distincte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne. N\u00e9anmoins, une telle plainte devra \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission et se fonder sur les faits applicables \u00e0 sa situation.\n[20] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, le Tribunal rejette la requ\u00eate en obtention du statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Stetskevych. Comme l\u2019ont sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 la Commission et l\u2019intim\u00e9e, M. Attaran peut envisager d\u2019appeler Mme Stetskevych \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner lors de l\u2019audience si cette derni\u00e8re a des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter, sous r\u00e9serve de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal quant \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage.\nSign\u00e9e par\nDavid L.

Introduction\n[1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, LRC 1985, ch. H\u20116 (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb) et selon laquelle l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 aurait fait preuve de discrimination envers le plaignant du fait de son \u00e2ge et de sa d\u00e9ficience en mettant fin \u00e0 son emploi en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 sa demande de r\u00e9duction du nombre d\u2019heures de travail. Le plaignant affirme avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente et pr\u00e9judiciable par l\u2019employeur qui l\u2019a licenci\u00e9 et a \u00e9tabli et appliqu\u00e9 une ligne de conduite discriminatoire, en violation de la Loi. La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) le 28 mai 2015, et cette derni\u00e8re a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne participerait pas \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[2] L\u2019instruction de la pr\u00e9sente affaire a eu lieu \u00e0 Toronto aux dates suivantes : du 31 octobre au 4 novembre 2016 inclusivement, du 14 au 18 novembre 2016 inclusivement, et les 23 et 25 janvier 2017, et les observations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es le 27 janvier.\n[3] Le 31 janvier 2017, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation par courrier \u00e9lectronique. Le plaignant a envoy\u00e9 par courrier \u00e9lectronique sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement r\u00e9pondu.\nII. Requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[4] La requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e exigeant ma r\u00e9cusation a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le lundi suivant la fin de l\u2019audience et de la pr\u00e9sentation des observations. Je me suis donc abstenue d\u2019examiner plus avant la preuve et les observations, ainsi que ma d\u00e9cision \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard en attendant mon examen de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n[5] L\u2019intim\u00e9e fonde sa requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation sur deux faits qui se sont produits \u00e0 la fin de la journ\u00e9e et qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9s :\nL\u2019avocat du plaignant m\u2019a remis une cl\u00e9 USB le 23 janvier 2017;\nLe plaignant et son avocat m\u2019ont serr\u00e9 la main et m\u2019ont remerci\u00e9e \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019audience du 27 janvier 2017.\n[6] Compte tenu de ces deux faits, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019il a une crainte raisonnable que je prenne parti pour le plaignant et peut-\u00eatre contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et qu\u2019il est possible que je ne sois pas impartiale dans mes d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations et ma d\u00e9cision.\n[7] L\u2019avocat du plaignant a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation en produisant une d\u00e9claration sous serment expliquant ce qu\u2019il a observ\u00e9. Le plaignant et son avocat soutiennent que la remise de la cl\u00e9 USB a eu lieu en la pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise \u00e0 tout le monde dans la salle avec une intention honn\u00eate. Le plaignant et son avocat affirment que les poign\u00e9es de main, les remerciements et l'\u00ab au revoir \u00bb s\u2019adressaient \u00e0 l\u2019agente du greffe et moi-m\u00eame par souci de courtoisie et sous les regards du repr\u00e9sentant et de l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[8] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019observation du plaignant, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e reconna\u00eet que l\u2019agente du greffe et moi-m\u00eame ne sommes pas les initiatrices de la distribution de la cl\u00e9 USB, des poign\u00e9es de main d\u2019\u00ab au revoir \u00bb ou des plaisanteries, et il reconna\u00eet que j\u2019ai peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 pris de court dans les deux cas. Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que j\u2019aurais d\u00fb refuser la cl\u00e9 USB ainsi que les poign\u00e9es de main offertes par le plaignant et son avocat, et que le fait que je les ai accept\u00e9es donne lieu \u00e0 la crainte de partialit\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9e.\n[9] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme qu\u2019il continue de craindre que j\u2019aie \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9e par ces faits de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 examiner sous un \u0153il plus favorable le dossier du plaignant que celui de l\u2019intim\u00e9e; effet que l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne peut contrecarrer. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne pr\u00e9tend pas qu\u2019il a vu des indices quelconques d\u2019une partialit\u00e9 de ma part, mais que le fait que je n\u2019ai pas refus\u00e9 les offres du plaignant a fait na\u00eetre une crainte de parti pris en faveur du plaignant, et peut-\u00eatre contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nIII. Rappel des faits par le membre du Tribunal\nA. Cl\u00e9 USB\n[10] Je me rappelle qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de la journ\u00e9e d\u2019audience du 23 janvier, l\u2019agente du greffe et moi-m\u00eame \u00e9tions encore \u00e0 nos places. Le plaignant, son avocat et l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9taient encore pr\u00e8s de leurs si\u00e8ges et emballaient leurs affaires avant de partir. Le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 quitt\u00e9 la salle. L\u2019avocat du plaignant a mentionn\u00e9 sur un ton de plaisanterie l\u00e9g\u00e8re qu\u2019il avait command\u00e9 des cl\u00e9s USB et venait justement de les recevoir \u00e0 titre de mat\u00e9riel de promotion pour sa firme. L\u2019avocat du plaignant a alors commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 distribuer un dispositif scell\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les personnes susmentionn\u00e9es se trouvant dans la salle.\n[11] En pr\u00e9sence des personnes susmentionn\u00e9es, j\u2019ai ouvert le plastique et tir\u00e9 sur le dispositif pour voir o\u00f9 se trouvait le connecteur USB. Le connecteur se trouvait sur le dessus de la partie inf\u00e9rieure de la figurine. J\u2019ai fait la remarque, en feignant l\u2019indignation, que la conception \u00ab \u00e9tait presque pornographique \u00bb (je ne me souviens pas d\u2019avoir entendu qui que ce soit utiliser le terme \u00ab phallique \u00bb comme l\u2019a pr\u00e9tendu l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans sa requ\u00eate), et tout le monde a ri. L\u2019avocat du plaignant a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas trouv\u00e9 une autre fa\u00e7on de la concevoir. Nous avons tous quitt\u00e9 la salle. Je suis entr\u00e9e dans la salle de conf\u00e9rence adjacente et j\u2019ai laiss\u00e9 le dispositif sur la table de la salle de conf\u00e9rence. L\u2019agente du greffe n\u2019a pas ouvert le sien, et l\u2019a laiss\u00e9 scell\u00e9 sur son bureau.\n[12] Lorsque nous avons repris l\u2019audience le mercredi 25 janvier, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait inscrire au dossier son objection quant \u00e0 la distribution de la cl\u00e9 USB ayant eu lieu le 23 janvier. Il a dit craindre qu\u2019il y ait des donn\u00e9es sur la cl\u00e9. L\u2019avocat du plaignant a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune donn\u00e9e sur les cl\u00e9s. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise du fait que j\u2019ai re\u00e7u cette cl\u00e9. J\u2019ai reconnu sa pr\u00e9occupation et ordonn\u00e9 que la cl\u00e9 qui m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e soit retourn\u00e9e. L\u2019agente du greffe a r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 la cl\u00e9 USB qui se trouvait sur la table de la salle de conf\u00e9rence, et l\u2019a remise en m\u00eame temps que celle qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7ue \u00e0 l\u2019avocat du plaignant. Tout cela est consign\u00e9 au dossier.\n[13] Ma perception de cet incident est que la cl\u00e9 USB \u00e9tait une blague ou une plaisanterie, distribu\u00e9e \u00e0 des fins d\u2019amusement et non pas sous le pr\u00e9texte de gagner une faveur de ma part. J\u2019ai tourn\u00e9 en ridicule la conception de la cl\u00e9, et je l\u2019ai qualifi\u00e9e de presque pornographique, dans le m\u00eame esprit. Je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas vraiment offusqu\u00e9e. Cet incident n\u2019avait rien \u00e0 voir avec les questions dont \u00e9tait saisi le Tribunal, et n\u2019a pas influenc\u00e9 mon examen de la preuve et des observations.\nB. Poign\u00e9es de main et remerciement du 27 janvier\n[14] Je me rappelle qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin des observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es le 27 janvier, on a cess\u00e9 l\u2019enregistrement, et le plaignant et son avocat se sont rapidement approch\u00e9s de l\u2019agente du greffe et moi-m\u00eame pour nous serrer la main et dire \u00ab au revoir \u00bb. Je ne me souviens pas de les entendre dire merci, mais c\u2019est possible qu\u2019ils l\u2019aient fait.\n[15] Je me rappelle qu\u2019imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir dit \u00ab au revoir \u00bb au plaignant et \u00e0 son avocat, je me suis retourn\u00e9e vers l\u2019avocat et le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans l\u2019intention de de faire la m\u00eame chose. Aucun d\u2019eux n\u2019a manifest\u00e9 le d\u00e9sir de me serrer la main, et je les ai donc salu\u00e9s de la main et leur ai souhait\u00e9 du succ\u00e8s, probablement en leur disant \u00ab prenez soin \u00bb ou \u00ab bonne chance \u00bb, qui sont les mots que j\u2019utilise habituellement au moment de dire \u00ab au revoir \u00bb. Je n\u2019ai pas march\u00e9 vers eux pour leur serrer la main parce qu\u2019ils ne semblaient pas vouloir le faire ou s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que je le fasse. En outre, j\u2019\u00e9tais consciente du fait qu\u2019on \u00e9tait le vendredi en fin de journ\u00e9e, et l\u2019agente du greffe et moi devions emballer les dossiers et appeler le messager avant de quitter la salle d\u2019audience. Imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir souhait\u00e9 du succ\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e et \u00e0 son avocat, je suis retourn\u00e9e \u00e0 mon bureau pour ranger le dossier.\n[16] Je me rappelle qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin du dernier jour d\u2019audience, le 18 novembre 2016, j\u2019ai serr\u00e9 la main de tout le monde, y compris celle du repr\u00e9sentant et de l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et je leur ai souhait\u00e9 joyeuses f\u00eates et prudence au cours de leurs d\u00e9placements pr\u00e9vus. Je crois que les \u00e9changes de civilit\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 amorc\u00e9s par le plaignant et son avocat \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 \u00e9galement, et j\u2019ai veill\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que le repr\u00e9sentant et l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne soient pas exclus des poign\u00e9es de main et des \u00ab au revoir \u00bb. Le repr\u00e9sentant et l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e avaient donc toutes les raisons de croire que j\u2019aurais serr\u00e9 leur main le 27 janvier, s\u2019ils l\u2019avaient voulu. \u00c0 mon avis, l'\u00ab au revoir \u00bb et les meilleurs v\u0153ux que j\u2019ai adress\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019avocat et au repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9e le 2 janvier 2017 \u00e9taient \u00e9quivalents aux \u00e9changes de civilit\u00e9s que j\u2019ai eus avec le plaignant et son avocat.\n[17] Selon ma perception, le fait que le plaignant et son avocat aient amorc\u00e9 les poign\u00e9es de main et les \u00ab au revoir \u00bb ne visaient pas \u00e0 m\u2019influencer. Selon mes constatations, le plaignant, en particulier, \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s poli, souriant et faisait des plaisanteries avec les avocats et les t\u00e9moins des deux camps. Afin de conserver une ambiance d\u2019impartialit\u00e9 dans la salle d\u2019audience, je me suis assur\u00e9e de traiter le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ses t\u00e9moins et son avocat avec la m\u00eame politesse et de les int\u00e9grer dans l\u2019\u00e9change de plaisanteries. Je suis tr\u00e8s consciente du fait que les gens n\u2019ont pas tous le m\u00eame degr\u00e9 de confort lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019exprimer des plaisanteries et, par cons\u00e9quent, je ne suis pas influenc\u00e9e ni n\u00e9gativement ni positivement par le comportement ext\u00e9rieur d\u2019une personne en ce qui concerne les \u00e9changes de courtoisie.\nIV. Test applicable \u00e0 la crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9\n[18] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. S. (R.D.), 1997 CanLII 324 (CSC), (ci-apr\u00e8s \u00ab S.(R.D) \u00bb), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, aux paragraphes 31 \u00e0 36, 38 \u00e0 40, et 48 \u00e0 49, a confirm\u00e9 l\u2019application du test relatif \u00e0 la partialit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par le juge de Grandpr\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Committee for Justice and Liberty c. Office national de l\u2019\u00e9nergie, 1976 CanLII 2 (CSC) :\nII. Le test applicable \u00e0 la crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9\n31 Le test applicable \u00e0 la crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par le juge de Grandpr\u00e9 dans Committee for Justice and Liberty c. Office national de l\u2019\u00e9nergie, [1978] 1 R.C.S. 369. Bien qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 dissident, le test qu\u2019il a formul\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 par la majorit\u00e9 et a \u00e9t\u00e9 constamment repris par notre Cour au cours des deux d\u00e9cennies subs\u00e9quentes: voir par exemple Valente c. La Reine, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 673; R. c. Lipp\u00e9, [1991] 2 R.C.S. 114; Ruffo c. Conseil de la magistrature, [1995] 4 R.C.S. 267. Le juge de Grandpr\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, aux pp. 394 et 39595 :\n\u2026 la crainte de partialit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre raisonnable et le fait d\u2019une personne sens\u00e9e et raisonnable qui se poserait elle-m\u00eame la question et prendrait les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 ce sujet. [. . .] [C]e crit\u00e8re consiste \u00e0 se demander \u00ab \u00e0 quelle conclusion en arriverait une personne bien renseign\u00e9e qui \u00e9tudierait la question en profondeur, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9aliste et pratique. Croirait-elle que, selon toute vraisemblance, [le d\u00e9cideur], consciemment ou non, ne rendra pas une d\u00e9cision juste? \u00bb.\nToutefois, les motifs de crainte doivent \u00eatre s\u00e9rieux et je [. . .] refuse d\u2019admettre que le crit\u00e8re doit \u00eatre celui d\u2019\u00ab une personne de nature scrupuleuse ou tatillonne \u00bb.\n32 Ainsi que le fait observer le juge Cory au par. 92, la port\u00e9e de l\u2019obligation d\u2019agir \u00e9quitablement d\u00e9finie par le juge de Grandpr\u00e9 et la rigueur avec laquelle elle s\u2019applique varieront grandement selon le r\u00f4le et les fonctions du tribunal en question. Bien que les proc\u00e9dures judiciaires soient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement davantage soumises aux imp\u00e9ratifs de justice naturelle que ne le sont les instances administratives, les juges des tribunaux judiciaires, de par leur position, ont n\u00e9anmoins, b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019une d\u00e9f\u00e9rence consid\u00e9rable de la part des cours d\u2019appel appel\u00e9es \u00e0 examiner une all\u00e9gation de crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9. C\u2019est que les juges [traduction] \u00ab sont tenus pour avoir une conscience et une discipline intellectuelle et \u00eatre capables de trancher \u00e9quitablement un litige \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ses circonstances propres \u00bb : United States c. Morgan, 313 U.S. 409 (1941), \u00e0 la p. 421. Cette pr\u00e9somption d\u2019impartialit\u00e9 a une importance consid\u00e9rable puisque, comme l\u2019a fait observer Blackstone, aux pp. 21 et 22, dans Commentaires sur les lois anglaises (1823), t. 5, cit\u00e9 au renvoi 49 de l\u2019article de Richard F. Devlin intitul\u00e9 \u00ab We Can\u2019t Go On Together with Suspicious Minds: Judicial Bias and Racialized Perspective in R. v. R.D.S \u00bb (1995), 18 Dalhousie L.J. 408, \u00e0 la p. 417, \u00abla loi ne peut supposer de la faveur, de la partialit\u00e9, dans un juge, qui, avant tout, s\u2019est engag\u00e9 par serment \u00e0 administrer la justice avec une s\u00e9v\u00e8re int\u00e9grit\u00e9, et dont l\u2019autorit\u00e9 d\u00e9pend en grande partie de l\u2019id\u00e9e qu\u2019on a con\u00e7ue de lui \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard\u00bb. C\u2019est ainsi que les cours d\u2019appel ont h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure \u00e0 la partialit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 en l\u2019absence d\u2019une preuve concluante en ce sens : R. c. Smith & Whiteway Fisheries Ltd. (1994), 133 N.S.R. (2d) 50 (C.A.), aux pp. 60 et 61.\n33 Malgr\u00e9 cette forte pr\u00e9somption d\u2019impartialit\u00e9, les juges sont tenus \u00e0 certaines normes strictes pour ce qui est de la partialit\u00e9 car la \u00ab crainte raisonnable que le juge pourrait ne pas agir d\u2019une fa\u00e7on compl\u00e8tement impartiale est un motif de r\u00e9cusation \u00bb : Blanchette c. C.I.S. Ltd., [1973] R.C.S. 833, aux pp. 842 et 843.\n34 Afin d\u2019appliquer le test, il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9tablir une distinction entre l\u2019impartialit\u00e9, \u00e0 laquelle sont tenus tous les juges, et la neutralit\u00e9. Cette distinction fait \u00e9cho aux propos de Benjamin N. Cardozo dans The Nature of the Judicial Process (1921), aux pp. 12, 13 et 167, o\u00f9 il a affirm\u00e9 l\u2019importance de l\u2019impartialit\u00e9 tout en reconnaissant l\u2019illusion de la neutralit\u00e9 du juge :\n[traduction] Il y a en chacun de nous une tendance, qu\u2019on peut appeler philosophie ou autre chose, qui donne coh\u00e9rence et orientation \u00e0 la pens\u00e9e et \u00e0 l\u2019action. Le juge ne peut pas plus se soustraire \u00e0 ce courant que le commun des mortels. Sa vie durant, des forces dont il n\u2019a pas conscience et qu\u2019il ne peut nommer, l\u2019ont entra\u00een\u00e9 -- instincts, atavismes, croyances traditionnelles, convictions acquises; et la r\u00e9sultante est une perspective sur la vie, une conception des besoins sociaux. . . Chaque probl\u00e8me qui se pose \u00e0 l\u2019esprit se d\u00e9tache sur cette toile de fond. Nous pouvons essayer de voir les choses le plus objectivement possible. Il n\u2019emp\u00eache que nous ne pouvons les voir avec d\u2019autres yeux que les n\u00f4tres propres.\n\u2026\nDans notre subconscient se trouvent enfouies d\u2019autres forces, pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences et aversions, pr\u00e9dilections et pr\u00e9ventions, tout un ensemble d\u2019instincts, d\u2019\u00e9motions, d\u2019habitudes et de convictions qui font l\u2019\u00eatre humain, qu\u2019il soit juge ou justiciable.\n35 Cardozo reconna\u00eet que l\u2019objectivit\u00e9 est chose impossible parce que les juges, comme tous les autres \u00eatres humains, sont conditionn\u00e9s par leur propre perspective. Ainsi que l\u2019a not\u00e9 le Conseil canadien de la magistrature dans ses Propos sur la conduite des juges (1991), \u00e0 la p. 15, \u00ab [t]out \u00eatre humain est le produit de son exp\u00e9rience sociale, de son \u00e9ducation et de ses contacts avec ceux et celles qui partagent le monde avec nous \u00bb. Ce qui est possible et souhaitable, selon le Conseil, c\u2019est l\u2019impartialit\u00e9 :\n. . . La sagesse que l\u2019on exige d\u2019un juge lui impose d\u2019admettre, de permettre consciemment, et peut-\u00eatre de remettre en question, l\u2019ensemble des attitudes et des sympathies que ses concitoyens sont libres d\u2019emporter \u00e0 la tombe sans en avoir v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 le bien-fond\u00e9.\nLa v\u00e9ritable impartialit\u00e9 n\u2019exige pas que le juge n\u2019ait ni sympathie ni opinion. Elle exige que le juge soit libre d\u2019accueillir et d\u2019utiliser diff\u00e9rents points de vue en gardant un esprit ouvert.\n.\nIII. La personne raisonnable\n36 L\u2019existence d\u2019une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 ou son absence est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une personne raisonnable, bien renseign\u00e9e, qui \u00e9tudierait la question en profondeur, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9aliste et pratique (Committee for Justice and Liberty, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9). Cette personne n\u2019est pas \u00ab de nature scrupuleuse ou tatillonne \u00bb, c\u2019est plut\u00f4t une personne sens\u00e9e qui conna\u00eet les circonstances de la cause.\n[\u2026]\nA. La nature de l\u2019art de juger\n38 Comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 not\u00e9, il est indubitable que dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 bilingue, multiraciale et multiculturelle, chaque juge aborde l\u2019exercice de la justice dans une perspective qui lui est propre. Il aura certainement \u00e9t\u00e9 conditionn\u00e9 et form\u00e9 par ses exp\u00e9riences personnelles, et on ne peut s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il s\u2019en d\u00e9partisse d\u00e8s qu\u2019il est nomm\u00e9 juge. En fait, pareille transformation priverait la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des pr\u00e9cieuses connaissances acquises alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait encore avocat. De m\u00eame, elle emp\u00eacherait la r\u00e9union d\u2019une diversit\u00e9 d\u2019exp\u00e9riences au sein de la magistrature. La personne raisonnable ne s\u2019attend pas \u00e0 ce que le juge joue le r\u00f4le d\u2019un figurant neutre; elle exige cependant qu\u2019il fasse preuve d\u2019impartialit\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il rend justice.\n39 Il est manifeste, et la personne raisonnable s\u2019y attend, que le juge des faits est \u00e0 juste titre influenc\u00e9 dans ses d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations par sa propre conception du monde dans lequel ont eu lieu les faits litigieux. En effet, il doit s\u2019appuyer sur ses acquis ant\u00e9rieurs pour exercer ses fonctions juridictionnelles. Ainsi que l\u2019ont \u00e9crit David M. Paciocco et Lee Stuesser dans The Law of Evidence (1996), \u00e0 la p. 277 :\n[traduction] En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le juge des faits est habilit\u00e9 simplement \u00e0 appliquer le bon sens et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience humaine pour d\u00e9cider si la preuve est digne de foi et quel usage, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, il peut en faire pour tirer ses conclusions de faits. [En italique dans l\u2019original.]\n40 Par contre, quand il s\u2019agit de savoir quelle r\u00e8gle de droit il faut appliquer aux conclusions de faits, ce sont les principes juridiques qui s\u2019imposent et non les croyances personnelles du juge qui peuvent aller \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de ces principes. Qui plus est, bien que sa compr\u00e9hension de la nature humaine influe l\u00e9gitimement sur ses conclusions concernant la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 ou les faits, le juge ne doit les tirer qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir fait preuve d\u2019ouverture d\u2019esprit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toutes les parties au litige et apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 leurs pr\u00e9tentions. La personne raisonnable, \u00e0 travers les yeux de laquelle est \u00e9valu\u00e9e la crainte de partialit\u00e9, s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce que le juge proc\u00e8de avec un esprit ouvert \u00e0 l\u2019examen prudent, d\u00e9tach\u00e9 et circonspect de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 complexe de chaque affaire dont il est saisi.\n[\u2026]\n48 Nous concluons que la personne raisonnable, dont parle le juge de Grandpr\u00e9 et qu\u2019ont adopt\u00e9e les tribunaux canadiens, aborde la question de savoir s\u2019il y a crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 avec une compr\u00e9hension nuanc\u00e9e et contextuelle des \u00e9l\u00e9ments en litige. Elle comprend qu\u2019il est impossible au juge d\u2019\u00eatre neutre, mais elle exige son impartialit\u00e9\u2026\n49 Cette personne raisonnable ne conclurait pas que les actes d\u2019un juge suscitent une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 sans une preuve \u00e9tablissant clairement qu\u2019il a ind\u00fbment fait intervenir son point de vue dans son jugement; cette exigence d\u00e9coule de la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019impartialit\u00e9 du juge. Il faut qu\u2019il y ait une indication que le juge n\u2019a pas abord\u00e9 l\u2019affaire avec un esprit ouvert et \u00e9quitable envers toutes les parties. La connaissance du contexte dans lequel l\u2019affaire a eu lieu ne saurait constituer une telle preuve; au contraire, elle est la marque de la plus haute tradition d\u2019impartialit\u00e9 judiciaire.\n[19] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bande indienne Wewaykum c. Canada, 2003 CSC 45, (ci-apr\u00e8s \u00ab Wewaykum \u00bb), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a \u00e9largi les directives de la Cour concernant le principe d\u2019impartialit\u00e9 aux paragraphes 57 \u00e0 59, et 67 :\nIV. Analyse\nA. L\u2019importance du principe d\u2019impartialit\u00e9\n57 Pour statuer sur les requ\u00eates pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les parties, il nous faut examiner les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce au regard du principe fondamental et bien \u00e9tabli de l\u2019impartialit\u00e9 des cours de justice. Point n\u2019est besoin en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de r\u00e9affirmer l\u2019importance de ce principe, question \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de laquelle on a pu observer un int\u00e9r\u00eat renouvel\u00e9 dans les pays de common law durant la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie. En termes simples, la confiance du public dans notre syst\u00e8me juridique prend sa source dans la conviction fondamentale selon laquelle ceux qui rendent jugement doivent non seulement toujours le faire sans partialit\u00e9 ni pr\u00e9jug\u00e9, mais doivent \u00e9galement \u00eatre per\u00e7us comme agissant de la sorte.\n58 L\u2019essence de l\u2019impartialit\u00e9 est l\u2019obligation qu\u2019a le juge d\u2019aborder avec un esprit ouvert l\u2019affaire qu\u2019il doit trancher. \u00c0 l\u2019inverse, voici comment on a d\u00e9fini la notion de partialit\u00e9 ou pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 :\n[traduction] . . . une tendance, une inclination ou une pr\u00e9disposition conduisant \u00e0 privil\u00e9gier une partie plut\u00f4t qu\u2019une autre ou un r\u00e9sultat particulier. Dans le domaine des proc\u00e9dures judiciaires, c\u2019est la pr\u00e9disposition \u00e0 trancher une question ou une affaire d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on qui ne permet pas au juge d\u2019\u00eatre parfaitement ouvert \u00e0 la persuasion. La partialit\u00e9 est un \u00e9tat d\u2019esprit qui infl\u00e9chit le jugement et rend l\u2019officier judiciaire inapte \u00e0 exercer ses fonctions impartialement dans une affaire donn\u00e9e.\n(R. c. Bertram, [1989] O.J. No. 2123 (QL) (H.C.), cit\u00e9 par le juge Cory dans R. c. S. (R.D.), [1997] 3 R.C.S. 484, par. 106.)\n59 Consid\u00e9r\u00e9e sous cet \u00e9clairage, \u00ab [l]\u2019impartialit\u00e9 est la qualit\u00e9 fondamentale des juges et l\u2019attribut central de la fonction judiciaire \u00bb (Conseil canadien de la magistrature, Principes de d\u00e9ontologie judiciaire (1998), p. 30). Elle est la cl\u00e9 de notre processus judiciaire et son existence doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e. Comme l\u2019ont signal\u00e9 les juges L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9 et McLachlin (maintenant Juge en chef) dans l\u2019arr\u00eat S. (R.D.), pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par. 32, cette pr\u00e9somption d\u2019impartialit\u00e9 a une importance consid\u00e9rable, et le droit ne devrait pas imprudemment \u00e9voquer la possibilit\u00e9 de partialit\u00e9 du juge, dont l\u2019autorit\u00e9 d\u00e9pend de cette pr\u00e9somption. Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que l\u2019impartialit\u00e9 judiciaire soit une exigence stricte, c\u2019est \u00e0 la partie qui plaide l\u2019inhabilit\u00e9 qu\u2019incombe le fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir que les circonstances permettent de conclure que le juge doit \u00eatre r\u00e9cus\u00e9.\n[\u2026]\nB. Crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 et partialit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle\n[\u2026]\n67 De ces trois justifications de la norme objective de la crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9, la derni\u00e8re est la plus exigeante pour le syst\u00e8me judiciaire, en ce qu\u2019elle admet la possibilit\u00e9 que justice puisse para\u00eetre ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019elle l\u2019a indubitablement \u00e9t\u00e9 \u2014 c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire qu\u2019elle envisage qu\u2019un d\u00e9cideur puisse \u00eatre totalement impartial dans des circonstances faisant n\u00e9anmoins na\u00eetre une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 requ\u00e9rant qu\u2019il soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 inhabile. Cependant, m\u00eame lorsque le principe est interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi, le crit\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de l\u2019inhabilit\u00e9 revient toujours \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019esprit du juge, quoique ce facteur soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9 du point de vue objectif de la personne raisonnable. On demande \u00e0 cette personne d\u2019imaginer l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019esprit du juge, dans les circonstances pertinentes. En ce sens, l\u2019id\u00e9e maintes fois \u00e9nonc\u00e9e selon laquelle \u00ab justice doit para\u00eetre \u00eatre rendue \u00bb, qu\u2019ont invoqu\u00e9 les avocats des bandes, ne peut \u00eatre dissoci\u00e9e de la norme de la crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9.\n[20] Le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne n\u2019est pas une cour comme l\u2019\u00e9taient les entit\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es dans R. c. S. (R.D.) et Wewaykum, et ses d\u00e9cideurs ne sont pas des juges; ils sont des arbitres. Les mots, l\u2019attitude et la conduite de l\u2019arbitre doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s dans le contexte d\u2019un tribunal administratif.\nV. Analyse\n[21] Les paragraphes 48.9(1) et 50(1) de la Loi \u00e9noncent que les parties ont la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre dans le cadre d\u2019une instance, sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle:\n48.9 (1) L\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique.\n[\u2026]\n50. (1) Le membre instructeur, apr\u00e8s avis conforme \u00e0 la Commission, aux parties et, \u00e0 son appr\u00e9ciation, \u00e0 tout int\u00e9ress\u00e9, instruit la plainte pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9; il donne \u00e0 ceux-ci la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations.\n[22] On m\u2019a confi\u00e9 ce dossier en mars 2016. J\u2019ai tenu de nombreuses t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rences de gestion de l\u2019instance, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consign\u00e9es et r\u00e9sum\u00e9es. J\u2019ai tranch\u00e9 deux requ\u00eates interlocutoires contest\u00e9es avant l\u2019audience qui a dur\u00e9 13 jours au cours de la p\u00e9riode entre le 13 octobre 2016 et le 27 janvier 2017.\n[23] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 \u00e0 fond les requ\u00eates pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l\u2019audience et les observations, et j\u2019ai fourni des motifs d\u00e9taill\u00e9s aux fins de directive et de d\u00e9cision. Tout au long de l\u2019audience, j\u2019ai veill\u00e9 \u00e0 respecter l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale en permettant aux parties de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, d\u2019interroger des t\u00e9moins, de soulever des questions en litige, de conna\u00eetre les arguments qu\u2019ils doivent r\u00e9futer, de r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gations, de pr\u00e9senter des objections et des requ\u00eates, et de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 leur sujet. J\u2019ai fait de mon mieux pour fournir une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9fl\u00e9chie et exhaustive \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des requ\u00eates et des objections. Tout cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 consign\u00e9 dans le dossier officiel, et je suis convaincue qu\u2019un examen du dossier confirmera que les parties ont eu pleinement l\u2019occasion de faire valoir leur cause.\n[24] Le principe de la justice naturelle qui est applicable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce correspond au droit \u00e0 un arbitre impartial. La neutralit\u00e9 et l\u2019impartialit\u00e9 ne sont pas la m\u00eame chose et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale n\u2019exige pas la neutralit\u00e9. (voir R. c. S.(R.D.), par les juges L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 et McLachlin pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par. 34)\n[25] Les arbitres et les juges mettent souvent au d\u00e9fi les avocats relativement \u00e0 leurs observations pour s\u2019assurer qu\u2019ils ont pleinement l\u2019occasion de s\u2019attaquer \u00e0 une question, et ils peuvent juger n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9orienter un avocat durant une audience. De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, il peut \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire de rappeler aux t\u00e9moins de r\u00e9pondre aux questions qui leur sont pos\u00e9es, de leur expliquer pourquoi une r\u00e9ponse est inadmissible, etc. Afin de pr\u00e9server l\u2019impartialit\u00e9, les interventions de l\u2019arbitre doivent viser \u00e0 ce que justice soit rendue, et appara\u00eetre \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue comme justes et propices \u00e0 l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de l\u2019audience (Yukon, par. 27). Lorsqu\u2019une telle conduite en mati\u00e8re proc\u00e9durale semble s\u00e9v\u00e8re, grossi\u00e8re, irrespectueuse, et injuste ou r\u00e9v\u00e8le un pr\u00e9-jugement, alors il est certain que la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019impartialit\u00e9 fera place \u00e0 une crainte de partialit\u00e9. (Zundel c Citron, [2000] 4 RCF 225 (C.A.) par. 36-37; Yukon, par. 54-55.)\n[26] Les circonstances entourant l\u2019audience peuvent exiger une mesure, une d\u00e9cision ou une intervention d\u2019ordre proc\u00e9dural de la part d\u2019un arbitre afin d\u2019assurer une audience compl\u00e8te et \u00e9quitable, par exemple, le bon d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019audience. Une telle intervention par un arbitre peut sembler ne pas \u00eatre neutre, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il existe un objectif express\u00e9ment vis\u00e9 par l\u2019intervention. Cependant, pareille intervention de la part d\u2019un arbitre doit maintenir l\u2019apparence d\u2019impartialit\u00e9; autrement dit l\u2019arbitre demeure ouvert aux arguments qui seront pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par l\u2019avocat et n\u2019a pas d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019avance de l\u2019affaire. (Wewaykum, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par. 58).\n[27] L\u2019absence d\u2019impartialit\u00e9 \u2013 ou le parti pris \u2013 peut s\u2019exprimer par des paroles ou des gestes laissant sugg\u00e9rer que l\u2019arbitre a pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 d\u2019une question en litige, ou que l\u2019arbitre pr\u00e9sente une pr\u00e9disposition \u00e0 privil\u00e9gier une partie plut\u00f4t qu\u2019une autre ou encore une conclusion en particulier. \u00c0 tort et injustement, la partialit\u00e9 a une incidence sur l\u2019issue d\u2019une affaire parce qu\u2019elle d\u00e9note une disposition favorable ou d\u00e9favorable qui n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9e, qui repose sur des connaissances que le sujet ne devrait pas poss\u00e9der, ou parce qu\u2019elle est excessive. (S.(R.D.) par le juge Cory, par. 105). Une partie ne peut contrer la partialit\u00e9 au moyen d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou d\u2019observations. L\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale exige que l\u2019issue ou la d\u00e9cision repose sur une audience \u00e9quitable, la preuve, la l\u00e9gislation, la jurisprudence et les observations s\u2019y rapportant. Le d\u00e9cideur doit \u00eatre transparent dans ses motifs de la d\u00e9cision et ne pas \u00eatre incit\u00e9 par des consid\u00e9rations non pertinentes. (Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon, district scolaire #23 c. Yukon (Procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale), 2015 CSC 25 (ci-apr\u00e8s \u00ab Yukon \u00bb), par. 24).\n[28] La crainte de partialit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre objective et raisonnable selon le contexte des circonstances et eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble de la proc\u00e9dure. (S.(R.D.) par le juge Cory, par. 111, 141). L\u2019intim\u00e9e ne pr\u00e9tend pas qu\u2019il y a un indice quelconque de partialit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle ou appr\u00e9hend\u00e9e avant le 23 janvier 2017. Elle ne pr\u00e9tend pas non plus qu\u2019il existe une indication quelconque de partialit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle d\u00e9coulant des faits qui se sont produits le 23 et le 27 janvier, mais seulement une crainte que j\u2019aie des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s d\u00e9favorables \u00e0 son endroit et favorables \u00e0 l\u2019endroit du plaignant dans le cadre de mon examen de la preuve et des observations, et au moment de trancher les questions.\n[29] Dans ses observations, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a soulign\u00e9 que le plaignant est une bonne personne, et l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e m\u2019a exhort\u00e9 \u00e0 ne pas me laisser influencer par cela dans ma d\u00e9cision. Apr\u00e8s les observations, j\u2019ai termin\u00e9 par des commentaires qui confirmaient que j\u2019examinerais soigneusement tous les t\u00e9moignages enregistr\u00e9s, toutes les pi\u00e8ces dans le contexte du t\u00e9moignage donn\u00e9, et que je lirais toutes les observations afin de trancher les questions en litige. Autrement dit, l\u2019amabilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un aspect pertinent au regard de ma d\u00e9cision.\n[30] Les parties et les avocats savent que j\u2019ai examin\u00e9 leurs observations et continuerai de le faire de fa\u00e7on exhaustive et attentive avant de rendre ma d\u00e9cision. Aucun de mes gestes, commentaires ou d\u00e9cisions dans cette demande n\u2019ont permis \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un fondement raisonnable de craindre que je tiendrais compte de tout ce qui exc\u00e8de la port\u00e9e de la preuve, des pi\u00e8ces ou des observations pour trancher les questions en litige.\n[31] J\u2019ai une exp\u00e9rience ant\u00e9rieure d\u2019avocat plaidant et arbitre d\u2019un tribunal administratif. Il est entendu que l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale exige que le d\u00e9cideur tranche les questions en litige en se fondant sur la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, et non sur l\u2019information ext\u00e9rieure au processus de l\u2019audience que les parties ne peuvent conna\u00eetre ou \u00e0 laquelle elles ne sont pas en mesure de r\u00e9pondre. Je ne peux que prendre en consid\u00e9ration les observations, le droit et la preuve qui me sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par une partie en pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019autre, avec la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre, pour trancher les questions en litige.\n[32] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est \u00e9galement au courant des principes de justice naturelle. J\u2019ai reconnu ces principes \u00e0 maintes reprises tout au long de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, de sorte que l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sait que je suis consciente des principes de justice naturelle, tant dans le contexte d\u2019une cour que d\u2019un tribunal administratif.\n[33] Ma r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la remise par le plaignant du dispositif de stockage USB, et de son initiative de poign\u00e9es de main et d\u2019\u00ab au revoir \u00bb, peut ne pas avoir sembl\u00e9 neutre, mais le manque d\u2019\u00e9clat ou la neutralit\u00e9 absolue ne sont pas n\u00e9cessaires pour faire preuve d\u2019impartialit\u00e9. Selon le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi, l\u2019absence de formalisme est encourag\u00e9e pourvu qu\u2019elle respecte les principes de justice naturelle. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, pourvu qu\u2019elle n\u2019entrave pas mon impartialit\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019arbitre, ni qu\u2019elle donne l\u2019impression de le faire.\n[34] Dans l\u2019audience en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, j\u2019ai parl\u00e9 aux avocats plusieurs fois pour leur demander de faire preuve de courtoisie l\u2019un envers l\u2019autre et \u00e0 l\u2019endroit du tribunal, et de ne pas s\u2019interrompre pendant les objections. J\u2019ai agi ainsi pour les besoins de la proc\u00e9dure et afin d\u2019assurer le d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019audience de fa\u00e7on compl\u00e8te, \u00e9quitable et ordonn\u00e9e, mais le fait que j\u2019ai d\u00fb parler aux avocats n\u2019aura aucune incidence en ce qui concerne le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte. Les questions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination soulev\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire ne seront pas tranch\u00e9es en fonction de la personnalit\u00e9 des avocats ou de leur conduite dans la salle d\u2019audience. Seule l\u2019attitude des t\u00e9moins durant leur t\u00e9moignage en ce qui touche la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9 est pertinente; le capital de sympathie d\u2019une personne ne l\u2019est pas.\n[35] Au cours de l\u2019audience en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, j\u2019ai conclu que, n\u2019ayant pas comp\u00e9tence en vertu de la Loi pour adjuger des d\u00e9pens, je ne devrais pas tirer une conclusion d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une r\u00e9vision judiciaire ou d\u2019un appel par l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties, surtout dans des proc\u00e9dures opposant diff\u00e9rentes parties ou vis\u00e9es par des lois diff\u00e9rentes. De la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re, tout commentaire par l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties, selon lequel elles envisagent de demander une r\u00e9vision judiciaire d\u2019une d\u00e9cision que je rendrai, n\u2019est pas pertinent dans mes d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations concernant la pr\u00e9sente affaire. La Loi conf\u00e8re \u00e0 chacune des parties le droit \u00e0 une participation pleine et \u00e9quitable, notamment en ce qui concerne la r\u00e9vision judiciaire.\n[36] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la crainte que je fasse preuve de partialit\u00e9 en faveur du plaignant ou \u00e0 son encontre en raison des faits survenus les 23 et 27 janvier, cette crainte n\u2019est pas objective ni raisonnable compte tenu de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience v\u00e9cue par l\u2019intim\u00e9e depuis mars 2016 \u00e0 mes c\u00f4t\u00e9s dans mon r\u00f4le d\u2019arbitre, et de la connaissance de l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e du concept d\u2019un d\u00e9cideur objectif et impartial. S\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s par une personne raisonnable et bien inform\u00e9e au sujet de ma conduite tout au long de la pr\u00e9sente instance, de mon exp\u00e9rience particuli\u00e8re, et des concepts de neutralit\u00e9 et d\u2019impartialit\u00e9, les faits en question n\u2019auraient pas soulev\u00e9 une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9.\nVI. Conclusion\n[37] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas me r\u00e9cuser de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[38] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019audience, j\u2019examinerai la preuve et les observations de fa\u00e7on exhaustive et attentive, et je rendrai une d\u00e9cision \u00e9tay\u00e9e par des motifs d\u00e9taill\u00e9s.\nSign\u00e9e par\nJ.

Paiement des frais juridiques 19\nIII. D\u00e9cision 22\nI. Requ\u00eate en divulgation et paiement des frais juridiques\n[1] Il s\u2019agit de la troisi\u00e8me d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal concernant la divulgation dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire (voir 2013 TCDP 3 [Louttit 1], et 2013 TCDP 27 [Louttit 2]). Les plaignants soutiennent par voie de requ\u00eate que le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (PG) doit encore divulguer une s\u00e9rie compl\u00e8te de documents pertinents et demandent qu\u2019il fasse des divulgations suppl\u00e9mentaires et de meilleure qualit\u00e9. Ils demandent \u00e9galement qu\u2019il soit ordonn\u00e9 au PG de leur rembourser les frais juridiques d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019inobservation pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e des ordonnances de divulgation pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes rendues par le Tribunal dans les d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate Louttit 1 et Louttit 2.\n[2] Ces questions de divulgation d\u00e9coulent d\u2019une plainte pr\u00e9tendant que les plaignants re\u00e7oivent des services de maintien de l\u2019ordre de qualit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure aux services qui sont fournis aux collectivit\u00e9s non autochtones au Canada, ce qui constituerait une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race au titre de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi).\n[3] Le Tribunal a tenu une audience relativement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate des plaignants. Deux t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s : M. Raymond Levesque, conseiller principal, Division de lutte contre la criminalit\u00e9, Direction des programmes de gestion des urgences, S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique Canada (SPC), et M. Scott Merrithew, directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, Direction des accords de services de police et strat\u00e9giques, Gendarmerie royale du Canada (GRC).\n[4] Apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience, le PG a effectu\u00e9 d\u2019autres recherches pour trouver les documents mentionn\u00e9s par M. Levesque et M. Merrithew. Le 15 avril 2016, le PG a fourni une mise \u00e0 jour, qui comprenait une description des cat\u00e9gories de documents subs\u00e9quemment pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s aux plaignants. Le PG estime avoir ainsi r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 leurs demandes de divulgation.\n[5] Les plaignants pr\u00e9tendent toutefois que le PG doit encore divulguer certains documents. D\u2019apr\u00e8s eux, les cat\u00e9gories de documents divulgu\u00e9s ne correspondent pas \u00e0 celles qui faisaient l\u2019objet de leur requ\u00eate, et la r\u00e9ponse du PG n\u2019expliquait pas en quoi sa divulgation suppl\u00e9mentaire se rapportait aux cat\u00e9gories de documents demand\u00e9s. Outre les modalit\u00e9s de la Politique sur la police des Premi\u00e8res nations et du Programme des services de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations, les plaignants attendent encore la divulgation des documents suivants : des courriels et autres dossiers de membres cl\u00e9s du personnel de SPC; des documents d\u00e9crivant le processus d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des niveaux de dotation et de financement dans les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es ou isol\u00e9es servies par la GRC; des documents se rapportant au processus d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des niveaux de dotation et de financement pour les services de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations; des documents se rapportant \u00e0 la n\u00e9gociation de l\u2019Accord tripartite sur le Service de police Nishnawbe-Aski (SPNA); d\u2019autres documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels le privil\u00e8ge relatif au secret du Cabinet est invoqu\u00e9; des documents d\u00e9crivant les normes applicables \u00e0 la GRC; des documents caviard\u00e9s auxquels manquent des pages et des extraits; des documents concernant les mesures prises par le Canada relativement aux recommandations issues de l\u2019enqu\u00eate Kashechewan; ainsi que des documents concernant les logements des agents de police dans la collectivit\u00e9 de Norman Wells (Territoires du Nord-Ouest).\n[6] Apr\u00e8s que le Tribunal a transmis d\u2019autres directives le 16 d\u00e9cembre 2016 et que des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment communiqu\u00e9s, les parties ont pu r\u00e9soudre certaines des requ\u00eates en divulgation susmentionn\u00e9es.\n[7] La Commission a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate en divulgation et a souscrit aux observations des plaignants. Elle a elle-m\u00eame demand\u00e9 que le PG divulgue des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires, ce qui est maintenant chose faite.\nII. Analyse\nA. Questions pr\u00e9liminaires : preuve relative \u00e0 la requ\u00eate\n[8] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, les parties ne s\u2019entendaient pas sur la question du r\u00f4le de certains documents qui figuraient dans le recueil de documents des plaignants, mais qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience ni pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s aux t\u00e9moins. Le PG fait valoir que ces documents devraient \u00eatre retir\u00e9s du recueil car, selon lui, les plaignants ont eu pleinement l\u2019occasion d\u2019interroger les t\u00e9moins au sujet des documents qui s\u2019y trouvaient. Par cons\u00e9quent, il serait injuste d\u2019autoriser les plaignants \u00e0 se fonder sur des documents qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s aux t\u00e9moins durant l\u2019audience.\n[9] Les plaignants ne croient pas que les documents devraient \u00eatre retir\u00e9s de leur recueil. D\u2019apr\u00e8s eux, les requ\u00eates sont habituellement tranch\u00e9es sur le fondement de la preuve \u00e9crite puisqu\u2019elles ont souvent trait \u00e0 des questions proc\u00e9durales. En outre, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les t\u00e9moins \u00e9tablissent l\u2019authenticit\u00e9 des documents lorsque la requ\u00eate concerne le caract\u00e8re ad\u00e9quat de la divulgation elle\u2011m\u00eame. La pertinence des documents peut simplement consister \u00e0 \u00e9tablir devant le tribunal les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits ou non.\n[10] Le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 aux parties de pr\u00e9ciser les documents qu\u2019elles estimaient faire partie du dossier de requ\u00eate, et celles-ci ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations au sujet des documents litigieux. Elles ont fourni subs\u00e9quemment des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires et ont d\u00e9sormais indiqu\u00e9 que cette question \u00e9tait r\u00e9solue. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019examinerai l\u2019ensemble des documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par les parties dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate.\nB. Demandes de divulgation\n[11] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 50(1) de la Loi, les parties qui comparaissent devant le Tribunal doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leurs arguments. Le Tribunal doit \u00e9galement mener l\u2019instance sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive, dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique (voir art. 48.9(1) de la Loi).\n[12] Afin de remplir ces obligations, le Tribunal exige notamment que les parties se communiquent les renseignements potentiellement pertinents avant l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire. En plus des faits et des questions que les parties soul\u00e8vent, la divulgation des renseignements permet \u00e0 chacune d\u2019elles de conna\u00eetre les arguments auxquels elle devra r\u00e9pondre, et donc de se pr\u00e9parer ad\u00e9quatement \u00e0 l\u2019audience. C\u2019est pourquoi, s\u2019il existe un lien rationnel entre un document et les faits, questions ou formes de redressement invoqu\u00e9s par les parties, le document doit \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux alin\u00e9as 6(1)d) et 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (03\u201105\u201104) (voir Guay c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada), 2004 TCDP 34, au par. 42).\n[13] Bien que le Tribunal exige que les renseignements potentiellement pertinents soient divulgu\u00e9s avant l\u2019audience, cela ne signifie pas que ceux-ci seront admis en preuve ou qu\u2019on leur accordera beaucoup de poids dans le processus d\u00e9cisionnel (voir Association des employ\u00e9(e)s de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications du Manitoba Inc. c. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 TCDP 28, au par. 4). En fait, il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t d\u2019aider les parties \u00e0 se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l\u2019audience et d\u2019\u00e9viter ainsi des retards [voir alin\u00e9a 9(3)c) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (03\u201105\u201104)].\n[14] C\u2019est en gardant ces principes \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que j\u2019examinerai maintenant chacune des demandes de divulgation des plaignants.\n(i) Courriels et autres dossiers de membres cl\u00e9s du personnel de SPC\n[15] M. Levesque a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 durant son t\u00e9moignage que des recherches avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es dans les comptes de courriel de quatre membres du personnel de SPC. Cependant, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les plaignants, il a mentionn\u00e9 d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s ayant pris part \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s vis\u00e9es par la pr\u00e9sente plainte, mais dont les courriels et les documents n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s. Ces employ\u00e9s sont notamment des analystes des politiques, divers gestionnaires r\u00e9gionaux affect\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019Ontario, des gestionnaires de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de soutien des programmes ainsi que des n\u00e9gociateurs des accords du SPNA.\n[16] En outre, les plaignants indiquent que 525 courriels provenant du compte de M. Levesque ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s pour la p\u00e9riode de 2001 \u00e0 2005, alors que cinq courriels seulement, sur l\u2019ensemble des comptes des employ\u00e9s, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s relativement \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode de 2006 \u00e0 2007. Les plaignants soulignent \u00e9galement que, m\u00eame si des courriels d\u2019anciens employ\u00e9s peuvent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019issue d\u2019une recherche dans les courriels de M. Levesque et de trois autres employ\u00e9s, rien n\u2019indique que les comptes de courriel de ces anciens employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 eux-m\u00eames examin\u00e9s. Selon les plaignants, cela d\u00e9montre que la recherche concernant les courriels et les documents des membres cl\u00e9s du personnel \u00e9tait insuffisante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Les plaignants craignent d\u2019ailleurs que le PG ait enfreint l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal et les r\u00e8gles g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en omettant d\u2019informer ce dernier et les parties que, depuis le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, il avait effac\u00e9 les comptes de courriel de nombreux employ\u00e9s de SPC lorsqu\u2019ils ont quitt\u00e9 le minist\u00e8re.\n[17] D\u2019apr\u00e8s le PG, M. Levesque a indiqu\u00e9 durant son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019une recherche exhaustive avait \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e pour retrouver tous les documents se rapportant \u00e0 la plainte, y compris les copies papier et \u00e9lectroniques des dossiers des quatre membres cl\u00e9s du personnel de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la police des Autochtones. Par ailleurs, le PG affirme que de nombreux courriels d\u2019anciens employ\u00e9s du bureau r\u00e9gional de l\u2019Ontario ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s, ce qui comprend un grand nombre de courriels remontant \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2000.\n[18] Le PG reconna\u00eet s\u2019\u00eatre rendu compte, durant le t\u00e9moignage de M. Levesque, que la divulgation des courriels des employ\u00e9s de la division des politiques de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la police des Autochtones ainsi que des gestionnaires de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de soutien des programmes \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre incompl\u00e8te. Il a pris les dispositions n\u00e9cessaires pour obtenir tous les autres courriels pertinents, lesquels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits selon ses dires.\n[19] D\u2019apr\u00e8s les plaignants, les courriels suppl\u00e9mentaires produits par le PG n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 class\u00e9s en fonction de la teneur de leur requ\u00eate et sont organis\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re confuse. \u00c0 ce titre, ils n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d\u2019\u00e9tablir si les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires r\u00e9pondent effectivement \u00e0 leur demande de divulgation.\n[20] Dans la d\u00e9cision Louttit 1, j\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 que m\u00eame si les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (03\u201105\u201104) ne pr\u00e9cisent pas la mani\u00e8re ou la forme que doit prendre la divulgation, leur objet et, plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, les principes d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 exigent que la divulgation et la production des documents soient suffisantes pour que chaque partie ait la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de se faire entendre. J\u2019ai conclu en l\u2019occurrence que la production par le PG d\u2019un CD dont le contenu n\u2019\u00e9tait pas structur\u00e9, qui ne comportait pas de table des mati\u00e8res et renfermait des documents non class\u00e9s, ne permettait pas aux plaignants de bien conna\u00eetre les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que le PG estimait pertinents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ou d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre. J\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 que tous les documents divulgu\u00e9s soient clairement intitul\u00e9s ou \u00e9tiquet\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que la partie adverse puisse facilement les identifier et les consulter (voir Louttit 1, aux par. 12 \u00e0 15).\n[21] De m\u00eame, dans Louttit 2, le PG avait produit des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une demande de divulgation des plaignants et \u00e0 une ordonnance rendue subs\u00e9quemment par le Tribunal. Il n\u2019avait pas indiqu\u00e9 en quoi ces documents r\u00e9pondaient aux diff\u00e9rentes demandes ou ordonnances de divulgation, et ne les avait pas produits d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui permette aux plaignants de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il avait respect\u00e9 l\u2019ordonnance en question. Il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 d\u2019indiquer par \u00e9crit en quoi il s\u2019\u00e9tait conform\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance de divulgation du Tribunal, et de montrer pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment en quoi la divulgation de documents suppl\u00e9mentaires r\u00e9pondait aux demandes des plaignants (voir Louttit 2, aux par. 22 \u00e0 27).\n[22] Dans cette troisi\u00e8me d\u00e9cision concernant la divulgation, je dois l\u00e0 encore me pencher sur une situation o\u00f9 le PG n\u2019a pas produit les documents d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui permette aux plaignants de d\u00e9terminer si sa divulgation est compl\u00e8te. Suivant les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans les d\u00e9cisions Louttit 1 et Louttit 2, j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 au PG, dans une lettre du 16 d\u00e9cembre 2016, d\u2019indiquer par \u00e9crit au Tribunal et d\u2019expliquer aux autres parties en quoi il s\u2019\u00e9tait conform\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande de divulgation des [traduction] \u00ab courriels et autres dossiers des membres cl\u00e9s du personnel de SPC \u00bb pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les plaignants. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il devait r\u00e9pondre par \u00e9crit aux paragraphes 7 \u00e0 12 des observations des plaignants dat\u00e9es du 30 janvier 2015. Le PG devait expliquer en quoi les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires r\u00e9pondaient \u00e0 ces demandes ou, inversement, attester qu\u2019il n\u2019existait aucun autre document susceptible d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre.\n[23] Apr\u00e8s quelques prorogations, le PG a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa r\u00e9ponse le 19 mai 2017. Le 31 mai suivant, les plaignants ont confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 leur sens, la derni\u00e8re r\u00e9ponse du PG \u00e9puisait les questions que le Tribunal avait enjoint aux parties de traiter le 16 d\u00e9cembre 2016. D\u00e9sormais, les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans les d\u00e9cisions Louttit 1 et Louttit 2 guideront les parties lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agira de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des demandes ou \u00e0 des ordonnances de divulgation.\n[24] Enfin, les plaignants pensent qu\u2019un nombre important de courriels potentiellement pertinents peuvent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 effac\u00e9s par SPC apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une all\u00e9gation grave et la correspondance la plus r\u00e9cente des parties ne permet pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir clairement si elle est encore en jeu. Les parties seront invit\u00e9es \u00e0 aborder cette question lors de la prochaine t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance.\n(ii) Documents d\u00e9crivant le processus d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des niveaux de dotation et de financement dans les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es ou isol\u00e9es desservies par la GRC\n[25] Dans la d\u00e9cision Louttit 1, j\u2019ai estim\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate des plaignants visant \u00e0 obtenir des documents de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale se rapportant au processus d\u2019\u00e9tablissement par la GRC des niveaux de dotation et de financement dans les collectivit\u00e9s isol\u00e9es \u00e9tait potentiellement pertinente quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire et que les documents vis\u00e9s devaient \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s (au par. 26). En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision, le PG a divulgu\u00e9 trois documents. D\u2019apr\u00e8s les plaignants, ces documents n\u2019expliquent pas de mani\u00e8re assez d\u00e9taill\u00e9e comment les niveaux de dotation et de financement sont \u00e9tablis dans les collectivit\u00e9s isol\u00e9es ou \u00e9loign\u00e9es desservies par la GRC.\n[26] \u00c0 l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, les plaignants ont fait valoir que M. Merrithew avait reconnu que la GRC se servait d\u2019un mod\u00e8le d\u2019estimation des ressources polici\u00e8res (MERP) pour d\u00e9terminer les besoins g\u00e9n\u00e9raux en dotation d\u2019un d\u00e9tachement. Cependant, les plaignants avancent que le MERP et le manuel d\u2019instructions correspondant n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s. D\u2019autre part, une pr\u00e9sentation divulgu\u00e9e par le PG \u00e9num\u00e8re sept autres mod\u00e8les utilis\u00e9s par la GRC pour d\u00e9terminer les besoins en dotation, lesquels n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s non plus. Si la GRC s\u2019est servie de ces sept mod\u00e8les pour \u00e9valuer les besoins en dotation, ils sont pertinents pour d\u00e9terminer les niveaux de dotation n\u00e9cessaires pour les Premi\u00e8res Nations Mushkegowuk, soutiennent les plaignants.\n[27] Le PG affirme que le MERP a \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9, ainsi qu\u2019un mod\u00e8le appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 une collectivit\u00e9 de Premi\u00e8res Nations isol\u00e9e et \u00e9loign\u00e9e des Territoires du Nord-Ouest : la collectivit\u00e9 de Norman Wells. Quant au manuel d\u2019instructions relatif au MERP, le PG fait valoir qu\u2019il peut \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9 au moyen d\u2019une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9.\n[28] Pour ce qui est des autres mod\u00e8les vis\u00e9s par la requ\u00eate des plaignants, le PG soutient qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9s par divers entrepreneurs du secteur priv\u00e9, qu\u2019ils ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement propres \u00e0 la GRC, et qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re uniforme par ses services. En fait, l\u2019\u00e9laboration du MERP r\u00e9sulte directement du recensement des lacunes de ces autres mod\u00e8les. Par cons\u00e9quent, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le PG, ceux-ci ne sont pas pertinents aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Subsidiairement, il soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucun document d\u00e9crivant le mode d\u2019\u00e9tablissement pr\u00e9cis des niveaux de ressources par la GRC dans les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es ou isol\u00e9es. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le PG, M. Merrithew a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 plut\u00f4t que les niveaux de dotation sont \u00e9tablis en fonction du d\u00e9tachement, sur le fondement d\u2019un dialogue entre la GRC et l\u2019administration contractante, cette derni\u00e8re ayant le dernier mot sur le niveau de ressources n\u00e9cessaires.\n[29] L\u2019affidavit de M. Merrithew indique d\u2019ailleurs que [traduction] \u00ab [l]a d\u00e9termination des ressources en mati\u00e8re de services policiers s\u2019effectue en collaboration entre l\u2019administration contractante et la GRC \u00bb et que [traduction] \u00ab [c]ette d\u00e9termination rel\u00e8ve d\u2019un processus continu propre \u00e0 chaque administration contractante \u00bb (au par. 7). Le paragraphe 8 de son affidavit pr\u00e9cise que de nombreux facteurs entrent en compte dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des niveaux de ressources de maintien de l\u2019ordre, notamment les exigences op\u00e9rationnelles, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des agents, les priorit\u00e9s provinciales et municipales en mati\u00e8re de maintien de l\u2019ordre ainsi que les moyens financiers.\n[30] Cependant, M. Merrithew a \u00e9galement d\u00e9sign\u00e9 certains articles normalis\u00e9s figurant dans les ententes sur les services de police. L\u2019article 5 concerne le niveau de maintien de l\u2019ordre dans les collectivit\u00e9s desservies par la GRC. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le paragraphe 9 de son affidavit, [traduction] \u00ab [c]ette disposition pr\u00e9voit que le niveau de maintien de l\u2019ordre, d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par la GRC et l\u2019administration contractante, devra satisfaire aux exigences minimales requises pour assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public ou des agents \u00bb.\n[31] En outre, l\u2019article 18 de l\u2019Entente sur les services de police pr\u00e9voit que la GRC soumettra chaque ann\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019examen de l\u2019administration contractante un plan financier pluriannuel. M. Merrithew indique aussi au paragraphe 11 de son affidavit qu\u2019[traduction] \u00ab [a]u minimum, le plan pluriannuel traitera du nombre de postes requis pour le service de police, des consid\u00e9rations budg\u00e9taires, des plans concernant l\u2019infrastructure et l\u2019\u00e9quipement, des \u00e9carts budg\u00e9taires de l\u2019ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente et d\u2019autres renseignements convenus par les parties \u00bb. Ce plan est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019administration contractante au plus tard le 1er juin de chaque ann\u00e9e.\n[32] Le 15 juin suivant, l\u2019administration contractante remet \u00e0 la GRC le budget annuel pr\u00e9vu du service de police pour l\u2019exercice financier suivant, et toutes ses mises \u00e0 jour d\u00e8s qu\u2019elles sont disponibles. Comme le pr\u00e9cise M. Merrithew au paragraphe 13 de son affidavit : [traduction] [c]e processus continu, qui se d\u00e9roule \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle locale, est essentiel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des exigences en mati\u00e8re de ressources dans les diverses administrations contractantes et il est propre \u00e0 chacune d\u2019elles \u00bb.\n[33] Par cons\u00e9quent, si je comprends bien, la GRC et l\u2019administration contractante ont de nombreux \u00e9changes avant que les accords et les budgets soient adopt\u00e9s. Cette n\u00e9gociation \u00e0 double sens ne se fait pas seulement par voie orale : divers documents sont \u00e9chang\u00e9s durant le processus.\n[34] Ainsi, m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019existe pas de document qui d\u00e9crive ou explique en d\u00e9tail le processus par lequel la GRC et une administration contractante ont conclu une entente sur les services de police, il existe toutefois, comme l\u2019indique l\u2019affidavit de M. Merrithew, des documents potentiellement pertinents li\u00e9s \u00e0 ce processus et susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s, comme les ententes sur les services de police et les plans financiers pluriannuels. Cela dit, si j\u2019en crois la demande des plaignants, les ententes sur les services de police et les plans financiers pluriannuels ne seront pas tous potentiellement pertinents quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Seuls ceux qui concernent des collectivit\u00e9s ou des administrations comparables au Service de police Nishnawbe-Aski ou, comme le disent les plaignants, [traduction] \u00ab des collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es ou isol\u00e9es \u00bb, le seront. Par cons\u00e9quent, le PG divulguera toutes les ententes sur les services de police, tous les plans financiers pluriannuels et tous les documents connexes concernant les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es et isol\u00e9es desservies par la GRC.\n[35] S\u2019agissant du manuel d\u2019instructions relatif au MERP, le PG le divulguera sous r\u00e9serve des restrictions suivantes : 1) il ne le divulguera qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019avocat des plaignants et \u00e0 la Commission; 2) l\u2019avocat des plaignants et la Commission ne s\u2019en serviront que pour se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire et pour communiquer avec leurs clients afin d\u2019obtenir les instructions n\u00e9cessaires; 3) l\u2019avocat des plaignants et la Commission ne le divulgueront \u00e0 personne d\u2019autre sans l\u2019autorisation pr\u00e9alable du Tribunal et sans notification au PG; 4) l\u2019avocat des plaignants et la Commission ne s\u2019en serviront \u00e0 aucune autre fin que la pr\u00e9sente instance. Si le manuel d\u2019instructions relatif au MERP devait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pendant l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, ces mesures de confidentialit\u00e9 pourront \u00eatre r\u00e9examin\u00e9es en vertu de l\u2019article 52 de la Loi.\n(iii) Documents se rapportant au processus de d\u00e9termination du budget global pour le Programme des services de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations et au processus d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des niveaux de dotation et de financement pour les services de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations\n[36] Dans la d\u00e9cision Louttit 1, j\u2019ai conclu que les documents de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale demand\u00e9s par les plaignants et concernant le processus d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des niveaux de dotation et de financement des services de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations, au titre de la Politique sur la police des Premi\u00e8res nations administr\u00e9e par SPC, \u00e9taient potentiellement pertinents au regard de la pr\u00e9sente affaire et devaient \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s (par. 26). Les plaignants affirment que le PG n\u2019a divulgu\u00e9 qu\u2019un seul document en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision; ils croient qu\u2019il existe d\u2019autres documents relevant de cette cat\u00e9gorie, potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire et qui devraient \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s par le PG.\n[37] D\u2019apr\u00e8s les plaignants, M. Levesque a cit\u00e9 de nombreux cas o\u00f9 le processus d\u2019\u00e9tablissement du budget d\u2019un service de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations entra\u00eenerait la production de documents potentiellement pertinents, mais que le PG n\u2019a pas divulgu\u00e9s :\n\u00b7 Les budgets pr\u00e9liminaires sont pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par des analystes de la division des politiques.\n\u00b7 Les budgets pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par les analystes sont bas\u00e9s sur les consultations men\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s des homologues provinciaux et territoriaux, des partenaires financiers, des agents financiers et des cadres minist\u00e9riels.\n\u00b7 Les versions pr\u00e9liminaires des budgets pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par les analystes sont examin\u00e9es par le directeur du secteur des d\u00e9penses, par la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la gestion minist\u00e9rielle et par les agents financiers.\n\u00b7 Les besoins li\u00e9s au programme sont communiqu\u00e9s aux analystes du secteur des d\u00e9penses par les agents du secteur des programmes par le biais de divers documents, tels que des courriels et des tableaux de ventilation.\n\u00b7 L\u2019un des documents transmis par le secteur des programmes au secteur des d\u00e9penses est un tableau de ventilation \u00e9num\u00e9rant les diverses forces de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations et les fonds \u00e0 attribuer \u00e0 chacune d\u2019elles sur une p\u00e9riode d\u2019\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s cinq ans.\n\u00b7 Au sein du secteur des programmes, les gestionnaires r\u00e9gionaux fournissent une estimation initiale des besoins en mati\u00e8re de maintien de l\u2019ordre pour les Premi\u00e8res Nations au(x) gestionnaire(s) de soutien des programmes par le biais de divers documents tels que des tableaux de ventilation. Le(s) gestionnaire(s) de soutien des programmes \u00ab r\u00e9sume(nt) \u00bb les renseignements des gestionnaires r\u00e9gionaux qui seront communiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019analyste politique du secteur des politiques.\n[38] Le PG maintient que tous les documents pertinents se rapportant \u00e0 la dotation et au financement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s, et que M. Levesque l\u2019a confirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage. Pour ce qui est des budgets pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par les analystes, il fait valoir que M. Levesque a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019ils faisaient partie des documents vis\u00e9s par le privil\u00e8ge relatif au secret du Cabinet (\u00e9voqu\u00e9 plus loin). Subsidiairement, M. Levesque a confirm\u00e9 que des dossiers de documents papier avaient fait l\u2019objet de recherches. Le PG ajoute que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Levesque lui a permis de se rendre compte que certains documents pr\u00e9paratoires relatifs au budget de 2013 n\u2019avaient peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s, que des courriels et des dossiers papier d\u2019employ\u00e9s concern\u00e9s ont fait l\u2019objet de recherches, puis que des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9s et divulgu\u00e9s.\n[39] Les plaignants reconnaissent en r\u00e9ponse que 12 nouveaux documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s et d\u00e9crits comme [traduction] \u00ab se rapportant au budget de 2013 \u00bb. Au moins la moiti\u00e9 de ces documents semblent avoir un caract\u00e8re m\u00e9diatique, comme des communiqu\u00e9s de presse ou des descriptions d\u00e9taill\u00e9es d\u2019infocapsules. Apparemment, aucun d\u2019eux ne correspond au type de documents concernant l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des niveaux de financement et de dotation qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9s et qui existent d\u2019apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de M. Levesque. Les plaignants soulignent par ailleurs que les observations du PG concernent uniquement les budgets pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par les analystes politiques et pas les autres documents d\u2019\u00e9tablissement du budget n\u2019ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s, comme les tableaux de ventilation produits par le personnel du secteur des programmes.\n[40] S\u2019agissant des budgets dont le PG affirme qu\u2019ils font partie des documents vis\u00e9s par le privil\u00e8ge relatif au secret du Cabinet, les plaignants font valoir que celui-ci leur a fourni une liste de documents soumis \u00e0 l\u2019examen du Bureau du Conseil priv\u00e9. Les budgets pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par les analystes n\u2019y figurent pas. Par cons\u00e9quent, les plaignants soutiennent que l\u2019affirmation du PG est fausse ou que d\u2019autres documents contenant des renseignements confidentiels du Cabinet doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s.\n[41] L\u00e0 encore, m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019existe peut-\u00eatre aucun document qui d\u00e9crive ou explique en d\u00e9tail le processus d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des niveaux de dotation et de financement pour des services de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations, il ressort clairement du t\u00e9moignage de M. Levesque qu\u2019il existe des documents potentiellement pertinents ayant trait \u00e0 ce processus et vis\u00e9s par la divulgation, y compris les \u00e9bauches de budgets et leurs versions pr\u00e9liminaires, les tableaux de ventilation justificatifs et les communications connexes, comme les courriels, qui attestent la contribution des divers int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e0 ces budgets et tableaux de ventilation. Comme l\u2019indiquent \u00e9galement les plaignants, leur demande vise d\u2019autres documents d\u2019\u00e9tablissement du budget cr\u00e9\u00e9s par le personnel du secteur des programmes, comme les projections budg\u00e9taires pour l\u2019ensemble du Programme des services de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations, et d\u2019autres estimations initiales, par les gestionnaires r\u00e9gionaux, des besoins en mati\u00e8re de maintien de l\u2019ordre pour les Premi\u00e8res Nations. Les plaignants soutiennent que cette demande est fondamentale au regard de leur plainte, et qu\u2019il pourrait leur \u00eatre pr\u00e9judiciable de poursuivre sans disposer de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est ordonn\u00e9 au PG de divulguer ces documents lorsqu\u2019ils ne sont pas vis\u00e9s par le secret du Cabinet. S\u2019il invoque le secret du Cabinet, il devra clairement identifier les documents en cause dans sa liste de documents.\n(iv) Documents se rapportant \u00e0 la n\u00e9gociation de l\u2019accord tripartite concernant le SPNA\n[42] Selon les plaignants, le PG a produit une lettre dans laquelle le SPNA demande des fonds suppl\u00e9mentaires et un ensemble de communications du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 certaines de ces demandes. Cependant, les plaignants affirment qu\u2019il manque \u00e0 cette divulgation des documents internes du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ayant pour objet d\u2019\u00e9valuer les demandes et les propositions de financement, ainsi que les r\u00e9ponses auxquelles elles ont donn\u00e9 lieu, les documents visant \u00e0 formuler des positions de n\u00e9gociation budg\u00e9taire, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de justifier les budgets propos\u00e9s ou de refuser une augmentation des ressources, ou d\u2019autres documents concernant l\u2019analyse des ressources dont le service de police a r\u00e9ellement besoin. Les plaignants estiment que ces documents se trouveraient probablement dans les courriels ou dossiers des gestionnaires r\u00e9gionaux qui n\u2019entraient pas tout \u00e0 fait dans le champ de la recherche documentaire initiale effectu\u00e9e par le PG, comme nous l\u2019avons vu plus haut. Les plaignants citent \u00e9galement le t\u00e9moignage de M. Levesque suivant lequel il y aurait eu des \u00e9changes de courriel entre les n\u00e9gociateurs provinciaux et f\u00e9d\u00e9raux, ainsi que des comptes rendus formels ou informels des r\u00e9unions.\n[43] Les plaignants indiquent qu\u2019un certain nombre de nouveaux documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s sous cette cat\u00e9gorie apr\u00e8s l\u2019audition de leur requ\u00eate. Cependant, ils font valoir que ces nouveaux documents ne semblent pas se rapporter aux n\u00e9gociations de l\u2019accord concernant le SPNA, ou au SPNA en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Ils soutiennent donc qu\u2019il manque encore des documents dans cette cat\u00e9gorie.\n[44] Une demande d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de financement adress\u00e9e par le SPNA au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral figure \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 6 du recueil de documents des plaignants. Cependant, comme l\u2019indiquent ces derniers, aucun document ayant trait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation de cette proposition par le gouvernement, ou \u00e0 sa r\u00e9ponse, n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9. Conform\u00e9ment au t\u00e9moignage de M. Levesque, j\u2019accepte l\u2019affirmation des plaignants selon laquelle il existe probablement des notes de service, des comptes rendus, des courriels ou d\u2019autres documents potentiellement pertinents traitant de l\u2019examen et de l\u2019analyse de cette proposition par le gouvernement, et de la n\u00e9gociation de l\u2019accord tripartite concernant le SPNA en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Il est ordonn\u00e9 au PG de divulguer et de produire tous les documents potentiellement pertinents quant \u00e0 cette demande, en accordant une attention particuli\u00e8re aux types de documents mentionn\u00e9s par M. Levesque et dont la date va jusqu\u2019au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2013, comme l\u2019ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 les plaignants. Il devra divulguer et produire ces documents \u00e0 l\u2019intention des plaignants et de la Commission.\n(v) Les modalit\u00e9s de la Politique sur la police des Premi\u00e8res nations et des Programmes des services de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations\n[45] Le PG a divulgu\u00e9 les modalit\u00e9s de la Politique sur la police des Premi\u00e8res nations et des Programmes des services de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations ayant pris fin le 31 mars 2014, et ceux prenant fin le 31 mars 2018. Cependant, les plaignants avaient \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 la divulgation de versions plus anciennes, y compris celles qui \u00e9taient en vigueur durant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte et \u00e0 la date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de celle\u2011ci.\n[46] Le 2 mai 2016, les plaignants ont indiqu\u00e9 que les documents de cette cat\u00e9gorie avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s.\n(vi) Autres documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels le privil\u00e8ge relatif au secret du Cabinet est invoqu\u00e9\n[47] En vertu de l\u2019article 39 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada, des documents ne peuvent \u00eatre soustraits \u00e0 la divulgation au motif qu\u2019ils sont vis\u00e9s par le privil\u00e8ge relatif au secret du Cabinet \u00e0 moins que le greffier du Conseil priv\u00e9 atteste par \u00e9crit que le renseignement constitue un renseignement confidentiel du Cabinet. Le PG a refus\u00e9 de divulguer certains documents en application de cette disposition, mais n\u2019a pas produit d\u2019attestation \u00e9crite du greffier du Conseil priv\u00e9. Cela dit, les parties se sont entendues sur un processus de remplacement en vertu duquel le PG a communiqu\u00e9 aux plaignants la d\u00e9cision du greffier du Conseil priv\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de 138 documents dont il a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019ils contenaient potentiellement des renseignements confidentiels du Cabinet, en indiquant le fondement l\u00e9gislatif de chaque d\u00e9cision et en incluant une br\u00e8ve description de chaque document. Cinq documents expurg\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s aux plaignants.\n[48] Le PG estime par cons\u00e9quent que cette question est r\u00e9solue. Cependant, comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 plus haut, les plaignants sont pr\u00e9occup\u00e9s de voir le PG affirmer que les budgets li\u00e9s au Programme des services de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par les analystes constituent des m\u00e9moires adress\u00e9s au Cabinet et qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis au Bureau du Conseil priv\u00e9. D\u2019apr\u00e8s eux, ces budgets ne figuraient pas auparavant sur la liste des documents du BCP fournie par le PG. Les autres cat\u00e9gories de documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels le privil\u00e8ge relatif au secret du Cabinet est invoqu\u00e9 incluent ceux qui concernent l\u2019examen global du Programme des services de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations, y compris les options politiques envisag\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019examen, ainsi que des documents du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor portant sur la qualit\u00e9 des services de police dans les Premi\u00e8res Nations Mushkegowuk ou dans les Premi\u00e8res Nations en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n[49] Comme l\u2019ont indiqu\u00e9 les plaignants, et comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus haut au paragraphe 38, une incertitude demeure quant \u00e0 certains documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels le secret du Cabinet est invoqu\u00e9. \u00c0 ce titre, je reporte ma d\u00e9cision sur ce point jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la divulgation ordonn\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce soit compl\u00e8te.\n[50] Cependant, tous les documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels le secret du Cabinet est invoqu\u00e9 devraient \u00eatre clairement identifi\u00e9s dans la liste r\u00e9capitulative des documents du PG. Les plaignants devront indiquer lors de la prochaine t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance si la question de ces documents est encore en jeu.\n(vii) Documents d\u00e9crivant les normes applicables \u00e0 la GRC\n[51] Dans la d\u00e9cision Louttit 1, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 au PG de divulguer tous les documents d\u00e9crivant les normes adopt\u00e9es par la GRC en mati\u00e8re de niveaux de service, d\u2019installations, d\u2019\u00e9quipement, de salaires, d\u2019avantages sociaux et d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9loignement, et toute norme relative au maintien de l\u2019ordre dans les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es ou isol\u00e9es.\n[52] Le PG s\u2019inqui\u00e8te du volume des documents que cherchent \u00e0 obtenir les plaignants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. D\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, M. Merrithew a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 durant son t\u00e9moignage le caract\u00e8re abondant et interd\u00e9pendant des divers manuels contenant les proc\u00e9dures d\u2019exploitation et les normes nationales de la GRC. C\u2019est pourquoi il affirme que la divulgation compl\u00e8te des normes de la GRC demand\u00e9e par les plaignants entra\u00eenerait un flux interminable de production de documents qui exigerait plusieurs mois.\n[53] Le PG n\u2019est pas convaincu de la valeur probante d\u2019une divulgation si globale et soutient que si tous les documents de la GRC concernant les normes \u00e9taient divulgu\u00e9s, il faudrait les compter par dizaines de milliers et la vaste majorit\u00e9 serait sans int\u00e9r\u00eat. Il affirme que cela \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une recherche \u00e0 l\u2019aveuglette. Il a donc produit une copie de la table des mati\u00e8res des manuels op\u00e9rationnels, administratifs et auxiliaires de la GRC, invitant ainsi les plaignants \u00e0 y rechercher les normes sp\u00e9cifiques qu\u2019ils estiment \u00eatre pertinentes au regard de la plainte.\n[54] Les plaignants font valoir que les arguments avanc\u00e9s par le PG pour avoir soustrait les documents de cette cat\u00e9gorie \u00e0 la divulgation sont invalides, puisque le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 ordonn\u00e9 qu\u2019ils soient divulgu\u00e9s. Ils soutiennent que le volume des documents peut \u00eatre pris en charge par voie de communication \u00e9lectronique, et ajoutent qu\u2019ils sont dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 signer un engagement de non\u2011divulgation et \u00e0 collaborer avec le PG \u00e0 toute autre mesure qui permettrait une divulgation plus efficace et plus rapide de ces pi\u00e8ces. Sous r\u00e9serve de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal quant au proc\u00e9d\u00e9 le plus opportun en ce qui concerne ces documents, les plaignants indiquent qu\u2019ils chercheraient peut-\u00eatre maintenant \u00e0 obtenir des documents sp\u00e9cifiques \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la table des mati\u00e8res fournie.\n[55] Une lettre dat\u00e9e du 16 d\u00e9cembre 2016 enjoignait aux plaignants d\u2019examiner l\u2019index et de pr\u00e9ciser au PG quels documents il faudrait divulguer, ce qu\u2019ils ont fait le 10 janvier 2017. Le 30 mai suivant, le PG a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait fourni les documents demand\u00e9s. Le 31 mai, les plaignants ont fait savoir qu\u2019en ce qui les concernait, la derni\u00e8re r\u00e9ponse du PG avait \u00e9puis\u00e9 les questions que le Tribunal avait demand\u00e9 aux parties de traiter le 16 d\u00e9cembre 2016. Par cons\u00e9quent, je crois comprendre que cette demande de divulgation est d\u00e9sormais r\u00e9solue et je n\u2019ai plus \u00e0 statuer sur la question.\n(viii) Documents illisibles, pages manquantes et renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires\n[56] Les plaignants affirment que certains documents divulgu\u00e9s sont illisibles ou qu\u2019il y manque des pages. Ils cherchent \u00e9galement \u00e0 obtenir plus de renseignements concernant un document cens\u00e9 d\u00e9crire les lacunes du SPNA (auteur, pages de couverture, courriels connexes). Les plaignants soutiennent que M. Levesque a reconnu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible de d\u00e9couvrir d\u2019autres d\u00e9tails sur ce document. \u00c0 la suite de l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate, les plaignants ont indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019aucun nouveau document n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni relativement \u00e0 cette cat\u00e9gorie.\n[57] Le PG affirme qu\u2019il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 effectu\u00e9 d\u2019autres recherches regardant les documents identifi\u00e9s par les plaignants et qu\u2019il a fourni une r\u00e9ponse concernant chacun d\u2019eux. Quant aux commentaires de M. Levesque, le PG soutient qu\u2019il ignorait au moment de son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019un compl\u00e9ment de recherche avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu lieu afin de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des renseignements manquants sur le document en question et d\u2019autres pi\u00e8ces. \u00c0 ce titre, il fait valoir qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun autre document de cette cat\u00e9gorie \u00e0 divulguer.\n[58] Dans la mesure o\u00f9 il peut corriger les documents illisibles ou qui manquent de pages, le PG est tenu de le faire au titre de son obligation de divulgation (voir les par. 20 \u00e0 23 pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents). Cela dit, j\u2019accepte sa d\u00e9claration selon laquelle il a effectu\u00e9 d\u2019autres recherches au sujet des documents identifi\u00e9s par les plaignants et qu\u2019il a fourni une r\u00e9ponse concernant chacun d\u2019eux. Cependant, nous rappellerons au PG qu\u2019il est soumis \u00e0 une obligation continue de divulgation et de production en vertu du paragraphe 6(5) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (03\u201105\u201104). S\u2019il est subs\u00e9quemment \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas divulgu\u00e9 les documents, le Tribunal a le pouvoir d\u2019assigner les t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre et de les contraindre \u00e0 produire les documents (voir l\u2019al. 50(3)a) de la Loi).\n(ix) Documents concernant les mesures prises par le Canada relativement aux recommandations issues de l\u2019enqu\u00eate Kashechewan\n[59] L\u2019enqu\u00eate Kashechewan concernait le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de deux jeunes hommes des Premi\u00e8res Nations dans l\u2019incendie d\u2019un poste de police de l\u2019une des collectivit\u00e9s Mushkegowuk. D\u2019apr\u00e8s les plaignants, les recommandations issues de cette enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9voyaient notamment l\u2019allocation de ressources en vue d\u2019assurer la qualit\u00e9 des services de maintien de l\u2019ordre, ainsi que l\u2019am\u00e9lioration du SPNA. Les plaignants sollicitent les documents concernant les mesures prises par le Canada relativement auxdites recommandations. Ils affirment que le PG n\u2019a fourni \u00e0 ce jour qu\u2019un seul document pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette demande et ils estiment qu\u2019il est tr\u00e8s improbable qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait qu\u2019un seul document pertinent en cette mati\u00e8re. Les plaignants pr\u00e9tendent que M. Levesque a reconnu qu\u2019il existerait normalement des comptes rendus de r\u00e9unions entre les fonctionnaires f\u00e9d\u00e9raux au sujet des recommandations issues de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, ainsi que des documents relatifs aux appels, aux r\u00e9unions et \u00e0 la correspondance avec les partenaires provinciaux concernant certaines recommandations cl\u00e9s. Cependant, ces documents n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s.\n[60] Le PG a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 retrouver tout document suppl\u00e9mentaire pertinent ayant trait \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate Kashechewan, mais sans succ\u00e8s.\n[61] Compte tenu du t\u00e9moignage de M. Levesque, il me para\u00eet \u00e9galement difficile \u00e0 croire qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucun autre document concernant cette question. Il est ordonn\u00e9 au PG de divulguer tous les documents potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 cette demande, en accordant une attention particuli\u00e8re aux types de documents mentionn\u00e9s par M. Levesque. Il lui est ordonn\u00e9 de divulguer et de produire ces documents \u00e0 l\u2019intention des plaignants et de la Commission.\n(x) Documents se rapportant aux logements des agents dans la collectivit\u00e9 de Norman Wells (Territoires du Nord-Ouest)\n[62] D\u2019apr\u00e8s les plaignants, Norman Wells est une collectivit\u00e9 en grande majorit\u00e9 non autochtone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, sans acc\u00e8s routier, et dont le maintien de l\u2019ordre est assur\u00e9 par la GRC. Ils croient possible d\u2019utiliser cette collectivit\u00e9 pour comparer les services de maintien de l\u2019ordre offerts aux collectivit\u00e9s autochtones et non autochtones. Bien que le PG ait divulgu\u00e9 un certain nombre de documents concernant Norman Wells, les plaignants exigent des documents additionnels relatifs aux logements des agents dans la collectivit\u00e9. Plus sp\u00e9cifiquement, ils veulent savoir si les renseignements d\u00e9j\u00e0 fournis traitent de toutes les unit\u00e9s lou\u00e9es par la GRC pour ses agents \u00e0 Norman Wells, et demandent \u00e0 conna\u00eetre les co\u00fbts de construction des trois propri\u00e9t\u00e9s utilis\u00e9es par la GRC dans cette collectivit\u00e9.\n[63] Le PG fait valoir que les trois propri\u00e9t\u00e9s utilis\u00e9es par la GRC \u00e0 Norman Wells ont \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9es en 1977. La construction des unit\u00e9s daterait des ann\u00e9es 1970, et le PG affirme que tous les documents relatifs aux co\u00fbts de construction ont disparu. Il n\u2019existe non plus aucun renseignement regardant l\u2019\u00e9valuation actuelle des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s sur le march\u00e9.\n[64] J\u2019accepte les observations du PG concernant les co\u00fbts de construction des trois propri\u00e9t\u00e9s utilis\u00e9es par la GRC \u00e0 Norman Wells.\n[65] Je note que le PG n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la question de savoir si les renseignements d\u00e9j\u00e0 fournis traitent de toutes les unit\u00e9s lou\u00e9es par la GRC pour ses agents \u00e0 Norman Wells, que lui posaient les plaignants. Le PG devra y r\u00e9pondre. Encore une fois, nous rappelons au PG qu\u2019il est soumis \u00e0 une obligation continue de divulgation et de production en vertu du paragraphe 6(5) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (03\u201105\u201104). S\u2019il est subs\u00e9quemment \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas divulgu\u00e9 les documents, le Tribunal a le pouvoir d\u2019assigner les t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre et de les contraindre \u00e0 produire des documents (voir l\u2019art. 50(3)a) de la Loi).\nC. Paiement des frais juridiques\n[66] Les plaignants demandent \u00e9galement qu\u2019il soit ordonn\u00e9 au PG de leur rembourser les frais d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019inobservation de l\u2019ordonnance de divulgation du Tribunal du 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012 (voir la d\u00e9cision Louttit 1, au par. 8), qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 selon eux des co\u00fbts et des retards injustifi\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. En outre, ils font valoir que l\u2019adjudication des frais juridiques en leur faveur permettra d\u2019assurer l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La Commission appuie leurs observations, mais ne sollicite pas le remboursement de ses d\u00e9pens.\n[67] Les plaignants invoquent l\u2019arr\u00eat Tipple c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CAF 158 [Tipple], et soutiennent que les tribunaux administratifs ont comp\u00e9tence pour adjuger les d\u00e9pens afin de contr\u00f4ler leur propre proc\u00e9dure. Il s\u2019agit \u00e0 leur avis d\u2019un pouvoir distinct de celui d\u2019octroyer les d\u00e9pens \u00e0 la partie ayant gain de cause, pouvoir que ne d\u00e9tient pas le Tribunal ainsi que l\u2019a conclu la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CSC 53 (Mowat).\n[68] L\u2019ordonnance de divulgation rendue par le Tribunal le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012 exigeait la divulgation de 11 cat\u00e9gories de documents. Les plaignants avancent qu\u2019une seule cat\u00e9gorie de documents a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie \u00e0 la date fix\u00e9e par le Tribunal. Ils pr\u00e9cisent que : trois cat\u00e9gories de documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9lai et seulement parce qu\u2019ils ont insist\u00e9 pour les obtenir; une cat\u00e9gorie de documents n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie, mais ils ont r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 trouver les renseignements par d\u2019autres moyens; et six cat\u00e9gories de documents sont vis\u00e9es par la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. Les plaignants notent par ailleurs que le Tribunal a d\u00fb rendre en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce une deuxi\u00e8me d\u00e9cision concernant la divulgation, Louttit 2, pour obliger le PG \u00e0 indiquer en quoi il s\u2019\u00e9tait conform\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance de divulgation initiale rendue dans la d\u00e9cision Louttit 1. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, ils ajoutent que le Tribunal avait estim\u00e9 que la position du PG \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette requ\u00eate \u00ab n\u2019[\u00e9tait] pas compatible avec l\u2019intention de l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal ou avec la divulgation en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00bb (Louttit 2, au par. 24).\n[69] Les plaignants avancent que le d\u00e9faut du PG de se conformer en temps voulu aux ordonnances de divulgation a entra\u00een\u00e9 des co\u00fbts et des retards injustifi\u00e9s. En effet, il s\u2019agit de la troisi\u00e8me requ\u00eate en divulgation visant \u00e0 obtenir des documents demand\u00e9s il y a plus de deux ans; les avocats des plaignants ont r\u00e9dig\u00e9 beaucoup de lettres concernant la divulgation et ont eu \u00e0 examiner et \u00e0 comparer de multiples trousses de documents; enfin, de nombreuses t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rences de gestion de l\u2019instance ont eu lieu relativement \u00e0 la divulgation. De l\u2019avis des plaignants, aucune de ces mesures additionnelles n\u2019\u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire.\n[70] Enfin, les plaignants font valoir que l\u2019octroi des frais juridiques permettrait d\u2019assurer l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Si le Tribunal n\u2019intervient pas, les plaignants soutiennent que les parties disposant de ressources et de fonds juridiques plus importants peuvent avoir raison de la partie adverse \u00e0 l\u2019usure. En refusant de divulguer des documents, en retardant la proc\u00e9dure, en ne r\u00e9pondant pas \u00e0 la correspondance, en soulevant des objections r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es et en refusant de se conformer aux ordonnances du Tribunal, la partie la plus forte peut contraindre l\u2019autre \u00e0 engager des frais juridiques jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle ne puisse plus plaider sa cause. Par cons\u00e9quent, les plaignants estiment que l\u2019octroi des d\u00e9pens est un moyen pour le Tribunal de contr\u00f4ler ses proc\u00e9dures, d\u2019assurer la conformit\u00e9 \u00e0 ses ordonnances et de garantir des proc\u00e9dures \u00e9quitables.\n[71] Le PG fait valoir que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour adjuger les d\u00e9pens. Ni la LCDP ni les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (03\u201105\u201104) ne contiennent la moindre disposition l\u2019autorisant \u00e0 imposer la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 demand\u00e9e par les plaignants. Il rappelle que dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mowat, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir d\u2019adjuger les \u00ab d\u00e9pens \u00bb. Le PG ajoute que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence requise pour faire ex\u00e9cuter directement ses ordonnances. Cette question rel\u00e8ve plut\u00f4t de la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[72] En outre, m\u00eame si le Tribunal \u00e9tait comp\u00e9tent pour adjuger les d\u00e9pens, le PG soutient que les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne justifient pas qu\u2019il le fasse. Il soutient que dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Tipple, des circonstances rares et exceptionnelles avaient justifi\u00e9 un octroi de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour cause d\u2019obstruction des proc\u00e9dures. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le PG soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas fait obstruction et qu\u2019il a produit avec diligence et constance les documents pertinents qui \u00e9taient en sa possession. D\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, il est in\u00e9vitable que dans une affaire de cette ampleur et de cette complexit\u00e9, faisant intervenir des milliers de pages de documents et de multiples minist\u00e8res clients se trouvant \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents endroits, certains documents soient oubli\u00e9s. Pour corriger les lacunes imput\u00e9es \u00e0 sa divulgation, le PG rappelle qu\u2019il a fourni les affidavits et facilit\u00e9 le contre-interrogatoire de ses t\u00e9moins sur la question de la divulgation, alors que le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas exig\u00e9 ces mesures. \u00c0 son avis, ce niveau de transparence dans la divulgation d\u00e9ment l\u2019affirmation des plaignants selon laquelle il y aurait eu obstruction.\n[73] Comme la pr\u00e9sente affaire soul\u00e8ve encore des questions de divulgation, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable d\u2019examiner la requ\u00eate des plaignants concernant le paiement des frais juridiques apr\u00e8s l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire sur le fond. Les parties et le Tribunal auront alors une image plus compl\u00e8te de l\u2019impact des questions de divulgation sur la pr\u00e9sente instance, en incluant les pr\u00e9occupations susmentionn\u00e9es des plaignants et toute question additionnelle susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre soulev\u00e9e au terme de cette instruction. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je souligne que les plaignants ont fait valoir tout au long de cette requ\u00eate que le PG avait encore, \u00e0 leur avis, d\u2019autres documents potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 divulguer. M\u00eame si j\u2019ai accept\u00e9 certaines des d\u00e9clarations du PG concernant le caract\u00e8re suffisant de sa divulgation \u00e0 ce stade, les motifs de la requ\u00eate concernant le paiement des frais juridiques pourraient changer si ces d\u00e9clarations s\u2019av\u00e8rent inexactes. Par cons\u00e9quent, aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3(2)c) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (03\u201105\u201104), tout argument ou \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve se rapportant \u00e0 la requ\u00eate des plaignants en paiement des frais juridiques peut \u00eatre soumis durant l\u2019audition de la plainte sur le fond.\nIII. D\u00e9cision\n[74] Le PG doit terminer la divulgation ordonn\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u2019ici le 21 ao\u00fbt 2017 et fournir une liste r\u00e9capitulative \u00e0 jour des documents au Tribunal et aux autres parties. \u00c0 cette m\u00eame date, il devra indiquer au Tribunal et aux autres parties par \u00e9crit quelles mesures il a prises pour se conformer \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, et nommer tous les nouveaux documents divulgu\u00e9s en cons\u00e9quence. Si aucun nouveau document n\u2019est divulgu\u00e9 en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une ordonnance particuli\u00e8re, le PG devra aussi clairement l\u2019indiquer. Les observations \u00e9crites du PG devront \u00eatre accompagn\u00e9es d\u2019un affidavit justificatif. Sur demande, le PG fera en sorte que le ou les auteurs d\u2019affidavits puissent \u00eatre contre-interrog\u00e9s. De plus, le ou les auteurs d\u2019affidavits r\u00e9pondront aux demandes d\u2019\u00e9claircissement du Tribunal, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n[75] Une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance sera fix\u00e9e lorsque le PG aura termin\u00e9 la divulgation et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses observations \u00e9crites pour discuter de toute question qui en d\u00e9coule et pour examiner certaines autres questions abord\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En travaillant avec les parties par t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence, j\u2019esp\u00e8re \u00e9viter d\u2019avoir \u00e0 rendre une quatri\u00e8me d\u00e9cision concernant la divulgation et passer \u00e0 l\u2019audition de cette affaire aussi rapidement que possible.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nJuge administrative\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 19 juin 2017\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal :\nT1683\/3811, T1684\/3911\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nGrand Chef Stan Louttit en sa qualit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentant des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Conseil Mushkegowuk et Grand Chef Stan Louttit en sa qualit\u00e9 personnelle c.

Introduction\n[1] Dans le cadre de l\u2019instruction, par le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab TCDP \u00bb ou le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb), de l\u2019all\u00e9gation formul\u00e9e par Kathleen Mahood (\u00ab Mme Mahood \u00bb ou la \u00ab plaignante \u00bb) et selon laquelle l\u2019Administration canadienne de la s\u00fbret\u00e9 du transport a\u00e9rien (l\u2019\u00ab ACSTA \u00bb) aurait fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard dans la prestation d\u2019un service, le ministre des Transports a invoqu\u00e9 la proc\u00e9dure prescrite \u00e0 l\u2019article 4.79 de la Loi sur l\u2019a\u00e9ronautique, L.R.C. 1985, ch. A\u20112 (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb) et a demand\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019une audience en vue d\u2019\u00e9valuer certains probl\u00e8mes potentiels de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 li\u00e9s \u00e0 la communication d\u2019images de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision en circuit ferm\u00e9 (les \u00ab images de TVCF \u00bb) capt\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019a\u00e9roport de Calgary.\n[2] Le ministre estime que cette audience devrait avoir lieu ex parte.\n[3] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 attentivement les lois applicables, de m\u00eame que la jurisprudence et les observations qui m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises, et je suis d\u2019avis que la Loi pr\u00e9voit la tenue d\u2019une audience \u00e0 huis clos dans laquelle le ministre des Transports est en droit de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter des observations sur le caract\u00e8re confidentiel des mesures de s\u00fbret\u00e9 qu\u2019il est possible de communiquer dans le contexte d\u2019une instance devant le TCDP.\n[4] Je ne suis pas d\u2019avis que la Loi exige la pr\u00e9sentation de ces observations ex parte, ni qu\u2019il existe, au vu des faits qui m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis, des motifs suffisants pour ordonner la tenue d\u2019une audience ex parte.\n[5] Je n\u2019\u00e9carte pas la possibilit\u00e9 que certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments des observations du ministre puissent justifier la tenue d\u2019une audience ex parte, mais l\u2019exclusion automatique des parties d\u00e9rogerait aux principes fondamentaux de justice naturelle, et cette mesure ne peut \u00eatre prise que sur ordre expr\u00e8s du Parlement, ou s\u2019il est \u00e9tabli que les faits particuliers de l\u2019affaire l\u2019exigent.\n[6] Il existe fort peu de jurisprudence au sujet de la proc\u00e9dure qu\u2019envisage l\u2019article 4.79 de la Loi pour ce qui est d\u2019examiner la communication de mesures de s\u00fbret\u00e9. En raison de la nature des droits et des int\u00e9r\u00eats touch\u00e9s, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter formellement mes conclusions dans une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\nII. Contexte\n[7] La question de proc\u00e9dure en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce se pr\u00e9sente dans le contexte de l\u2019instruction d\u2019une plainte qu\u2019a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e Kathleen Mahood par suite du traitement que lui auraient r\u00e9serv\u00e9 les services de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l\u2019a\u00e9roport de Calgary le 9 juillet 2015.\n[8] En bref, Mme Mahood pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience dans la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019ont trait\u00e9e les agents de contr\u00f4le de l\u2019ACSTA, lesquels ont trouv\u00e9 de la marijuana et un vaporisateur dans ses effets personnels le 9 juillet 2015, durant son voyage de Calgary \u00e0 Toronto (la \u00ab plainte \u00bb).\n[9] La plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) le 13 octobre 2016.\n[10] Les faits li\u00e9s \u00e0 la plainte sont survenus dans la zone de contr\u00f4le des voyageurs internes de l\u2019a\u00e9roport de Calgary. On consid\u00e8re que ces faits ont \u00e9t\u00e9 capt\u00e9s par des images de TVCF, et que l\u2019ACSTA est en possession des s\u00e9quences.\n[11] Lors d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance tenue le 5 avril 2017, les parties ont toutes parl\u00e9 de la pertinence des images de TVCF, et tant l\u2019ACSTA (qui les a vues) que Mme Mahood (qui ne les a pas vues) ont indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elles aimeraient se fonder sur la vid\u00e9o \u00e0 l\u2019audition de la plainte. Il est donc convenu que les images de TVCF sont pertinentes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[12] Avant de communiquer les images de TVCF aux autres parties vis\u00e9es par la pr\u00e9sente instance, l\u2019ACSTA a fait \u00e9tat de ses pr\u00e9occupations quant au caract\u00e8re confidentiel des images capt\u00e9es, et elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance de mise sous scell\u00e9s et de non-communication des images en question, de m\u00eame qu\u2019une ordonnance portant que les autres parties soient autoris\u00e9es \u00e0 consulter les images de TVCF dans les bureaux de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019en recevoir une copie.\n[13] Le dossier de requ\u00eate de l\u2019ACSTA est fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019article 4.79(1) de la Loi, qui interdit de communiquer des mesures de s\u00fbret\u00e9, sauf en cas d\u2019obligation l\u00e9gale.\n[14] Apr\u00e8s un nouvel examen, il est devenu \u00e9vident que les articles 4.79(2) et 4.79(3) sont applicables \u00e9galement : le premier autorise le ministre \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des observations avant qu\u2019une ordonnance de communication soit rendue, et le second habilite le ministre \u00e0 rendre une ordonnance de communication, sous r\u00e9serve des restrictions ou des conditions que le Tribunal juge indiqu\u00e9es.\n[15] Compte tenu de l\u2019importance potentielle de la vid\u00e9o pour la cause de la plaignante, du pr\u00e9judice consid\u00e9rable que subirait Mme Mahood si l\u2019on faisait droit \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance que l\u2019ACSTA a propos\u00e9e, et de l\u2019obligation l\u00e9gislative d\u2019inviter le ministre des Transports \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des observations, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 aux parties de produire \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate des observations plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9es, dont un affidavit de l\u2019ACSTA.\n[16] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 4.79(2) de la Loi, le greffe du Tribunal a signifi\u00e9 au ministre des Transports une copie du dossier de requ\u00eate de l\u2019ACSTA, ainsi que le projet de calendrier de pr\u00e9sentation des observations relatives \u00e0 la requ\u00eate.\n[17] Le 10 mai 2017, le ministre a \u00e9crit au Tribunal et a fait part de sa position selon laquelle la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019examen \u00e9tablie \u00e0 l\u2019article 4.79(2) de la Loi [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] envisage la tenue d\u2019une audience \u00e0 huis clos distincte dans laquelle le ministre des Transports pr\u00e9senterait des observations au Tribunal au sujet des effets d\u2019une ordonnance de production ou d\u2019examen des images de TVCF \u00bb.\n[18] Le ministre a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 que ses observations soient d\u00e9pos\u00e9es sous scell\u00e9s, et que seul le membre instructeur du Tribunal l\u2019examine.\n[19] Le ministre n\u2019a pas pris position au sujet de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019ACSTA.\n[20] Le 12 mai 2017, le greffe du Tribunal a \u00e9crit aux parties et au ministre pour leur faire savoir que je me pr\u00e9occupais du fait que la tenue d\u2019une audience ex parte sur la pr\u00e9sente affaire repr\u00e9senterait un \u00e9cart marqu\u00e9 par rapport aux principes de justice naturelle qui r\u00e9gissent les instances du Tribunal. J\u2019ai donc demand\u00e9 aux parties de fournir des observations suppl\u00e9mentaires sur la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019examen que proposait le ministre et qui est indiqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 4.79(2) de la Loi.\n[21] Le 19 mai 2017, le ministre a produit ses observations, invoquant deux affaires \u00e0 l\u2019appui de l\u2019affirmation selon laquelle la Loi pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une audience \u00e0 huis clos doit avoir lieu ex parte.\n[22] La Commission n\u2019a pas consenti \u00e0 la demande du ministre, mais elle s\u2019est abstenue de pr\u00e9senter des observations suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[23] L\u2019ACSTA s\u2019est elle aussi abstenue de pr\u00e9senter des observations.\n[24] Le 2 juin 2017 \u2013 apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu pour la pr\u00e9sentation des observations \u2013 la plaignante (qui se repr\u00e9sente elle-m\u00eame en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce) a \u00e9crit aux parties et au Tribunal pour contester l\u2019affirmation de l\u2019ACSTA et du ministre des Transports selon laquelle les images de TVCF \u00e9taient [traduction] \u00ab privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es \u00bb et pour r\u00e9it\u00e9rer sa demande de communication.\nIII. Question en litige\n[25] Le principal point dont je suis saisie consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la bonne proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour examiner la question de la production ou de l\u2019examen d\u2019une mesure de s\u00fbret\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019article 4.79(2) de la Loi.\n[26] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, il existe fort peu de jurisprudence publi\u00e9e sur l\u2019application de l\u2019article 4.79 de la Loi.\n[27] En raison de l\u2019importance des droits qui doivent \u00eatre soupes\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment au r\u00e9gime qu\u2019envisage la Loi, je crois qu\u2019il est justifi\u00e9 d\u2019examiner avec soin la bonne proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre.\n[28] Le libell\u00e9 exact des dispositions applicables de la Loi sont d\u2019une importance primordiale pour mes motifs, et je reproduis donc ici l\u2019article 4.79 dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 :\n4.79 (1) Sauf si le ministre soustrait la mesure de s\u00fbret\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019application du pr\u00e9sent paragraphe en vertu du paragraphe 4.72(3), seule la personne qui a pris la mesure peut en communiquer la teneur, sauf si la communication est soit l\u00e9galement exig\u00e9e, soit n\u00e9cessaire pour la rendre efficace.\n(2) Dans le cadre d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure engag\u00e9e devant lui, le tribunal ou tout autre organisme habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 exiger la production et l\u2019examen de renseignements et qui est saisi d\u2019une demande \u00e0 cet effet relativement \u00e0 une mesure de s\u00fbret\u00e9 a\u00e9rienne fait notifier la demande au ministre si celui-ci n\u2019est pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 partie \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure et, apr\u00e8s examen de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e0 huis clos, lui donne la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter ses observations \u00e0 ce sujet.\n(3) S\u2019il conclut que, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public en ce qui touche la bonne administration de la justice a pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public en ce qui touche la s\u00fbret\u00e9 a\u00e9rienne, le tribunal ou autre organisme doit ordonner la production et l\u2019examen de la mesure de s\u00fbret\u00e9, sous r\u00e9serve des restrictions ou conditions qu\u2019il juge indiqu\u00e9es; il peut en outre enjoindre \u00e0 toute personne de t\u00e9moigner au sujet de la mesure.\nA. Observations du ministre des Transports\n[29] Selon l\u2019avocat du ministre des Transports, m\u00eame si la Loi prescrit express\u00e9ment la tenue d\u2019une audience \u00e0 huis clos, celle-ci doit avoir lieu ex parte de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 \u00e9viter de communiquer la teneur de mesures de s\u00fbret\u00e9 que la Loi prot\u00e8ge.\n[30] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de son argument, le ministre se fonde sur deux d\u00e9cisions rendues dans le cadre de l\u2019affaire Re CUPE and Air Canada (dossiers nos 2015-29 et 2015-30; d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 10 ao\u00fbt 2016, d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 15 d\u00e9cembre 2016), une instance men\u00e9e devant un agent d\u2019appel du Tribunal de sant\u00e9 et s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail Canada (le \u00ab TSSTC \u00bb). Dans cette affaire, l\u2019agent d\u2019appel a souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019observation du ministre et d\u2019Air Canada selon laquelle on ferait \u00e9chec \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 qu\u2019exige l\u2019article 4.79(1) de la Loi si l\u2019on menait l\u2019instance qu\u2019envisage l\u2019article 4.79(2) en pr\u00e9sence des parties. Je signale que, dans cette affaire, il semble qu\u2019on ait remis au Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique (le \u00ab SCFP \u00bb) des copies des mesures de s\u00fbret\u00e9 en litige avec des passages caviard\u00e9s.\n[31] Le ministre cite aussi un jugement rendu dans une affaire criminelle : R. c. Herman, 2017 BCSC 241, dans lequel la Cour indique que l\u2019audience que pr\u00e9voit l\u2019article 4.79(2) a eu lieu en l\u2019absence de l\u2019accus\u00e9. Il soutient que si l\u2019on peut autoriser une telle exclusion dans une instance de nature criminelle (dans le cadre de laquelle la Constitution garantit le droit \u00e0 une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re), il s\u2019ensuit que cette exclusion doit s\u00fbrement \u00eatre suffisante pour les besoins d\u2019une instruction men\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb).\n[32] Les motifs accompagnant la d\u00e9cision Re CUPE and Air Canada font \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 deux affaires instruites devant le Conseil canadien des relations industrielles (le \u00ab CCRI \u00bb) et que le SCFP a invoqu\u00e9es dans les observations qu\u2019il a soumises \u00e0 l\u2019agent d\u2019appel (voir : Securiguard Services Ltd., 2005 CCRI 342, aux par. 17 et 18; A.S.P Inc., 2006 CCRI 368, aux par. 3 \u00e0 5). Aucune de ces deux affaires n\u2019est mentionn\u00e9e dans les observations que le ministre a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal, mais il semble, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les motifs de l\u2019agent d\u2019appel dans l\u2019affaire Re CUPE and Air Canada, que dans ces deux affaires, les audiences de communication n\u2019ont pas eu lieu ex parte.\nIV. Analyse\n[33] Une d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique, \u00e0 savoir que l\u2019article 4.79(2) exige qu\u2019une audience ait lieu ex parte, aurait un caract\u00e8re tr\u00e8s persuasif pour le Tribunal, mais il ressort d\u2019un examen approfondi du jugement rendu dans R. c. Herman qu\u2019aucune d\u00e9cision de la sorte n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue dans cette affaire. Le fait qu\u2019une audience a eu lieu ex parte ne veut pas dire qu\u2019elle doit l\u2019\u00eatre.\n[34] Pour ce qui est de la d\u00e9cision du TSSTC selon laquelle l\u2019article 4.79(2) prescrit la tenue d\u2019une audience ex parte, je fais remarquer que je ne suis pas li\u00e9e par la conclusion de l\u2019agent d\u2019appel. Pour les motifs qui suivent, et pour des raisons d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative, je ne puis souscrire \u00e0 la conclusion de cet agent.\n[35] Je conviens que l\u2019article 4.79(1) interdit que l\u2019on communique une mesure de s\u00fbret\u00e9, mais cette interdiction est de nature g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, et elle est nuanc\u00e9e par la limite suivante : \u00ab [\u2026] sauf si la communication est [\u2026] l\u00e9galement exig\u00e9e \u00bb.\n[36] Il s\u2019av\u00e8re que les parties ne contestent pas la pertinence des images de TVCF en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et que, de ce fait, leur production serait exig\u00e9e par la LCDP et par les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[37] En ce sens, les images de TVCF ne tombent pas sous le coup de l\u2019interdiction de communication dont il est question \u00e0 l\u2019article 4.79(1), mais plut\u00f4t sous celui de l\u2019exception.\n[38] Cela r\u00e9pond donc \u00e0 la pr\u00e9occupation du ministre selon laquelle on ferait \u00e9chec \u00e0 l\u2019objet de l\u2019article 4.79(1) en communiquant les images aux parties \u00e0 la faveur d\u2019une audience qui n\u2019est pas tenue ex parte et dans le contexte du paragraphe (2), car au vu de ces faits, l\u2019interdiction pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe (1) ne s\u2019applique pas.\n[39] Cela nous am\u00e8ne donc \u00e0 lire attentivement l\u2019article 4.79(2), lequel s\u2019applique lorsqu\u2019une demande de production ou d\u2019examen d\u2019une mesure de s\u00fbret\u00e9 est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans le contexte d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure engag\u00e9e devant un tribunal ou un autre organisme habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 exiger la production et l\u2019examen de renseignements.\n[40] Les questions qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner et de trancher sont les suivantes :\nS\u2019agissant de la production ou de l\u2019examen de la mesure de s\u00fbret\u00e9, est-ce que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public en ce qui touche la bonne administration de la justice l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public en ce qui touche la s\u00fbret\u00e9 a\u00e9rienne?\nAdmettons qu\u2019il soit justifi\u00e9 de produire ou d\u2019examiner une mesure de s\u00fbret\u00e9 au vu des faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, quelles restrictions ou conditions devrait-on imposer?\n[41] Lorsque (comme c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce) le ministre n\u2019est pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 partie \u00e0 l\u2019instance, celui-ci doit recevoir avis de la demande de production, et il doit avoir une possibilit\u00e9 de formuler des observations \u00e0 propos de la mesure de s\u00fbret\u00e9 en question.\n[42] La Loi pr\u00e9voit explicitement que le tribunal ou l\u2019autre organisme doit examiner la mesure de s\u00fbret\u00e9 et entendre les observations du ministre \u00e0 huis clos.\n[43] La question qui m\u2019est soumise est due au fait que le ministre a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019audience doit \u00e9galement avoir lieu ex parte, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire sans que les parties \u00e0 la plainte soient pr\u00e9sentes ou sachent ce qui se dit.\n[44] Comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 aux parties et au ministre dans la lettre du Tribunal dat\u00e9e du 12 mai 2017, une audience ex parte est une d\u00e9rogation extraordinaire aux exigences de justice naturelle qui doivent guider les instances engag\u00e9es devant le Tribunal, ainsi que le confirme l\u2019article 48.9(1) de la LCDP.\n[45] J\u2019estime que ces exigences en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale sont encore plus graves quand l\u2019une des parties se repr\u00e9sente elle-m\u00eame, ce qui est le cas de Mme Mahood.\n[46] Le droit d\u2019\u00eatre entendu est un principe de justice naturelle bien connu. Compte tenu, notamment, de la nature des d\u00e9cisions que rend le Tribunal, de la nature quasi judiciaire de ses proc\u00e9dures, de l\u2019importance des droits et des questions en litige, ainsi que de l\u2019absence d\u2019un appel des d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal, celui-ci met tout en \u0153uvre pour veiller \u00e0 ce que l\u2019on donne un effet concret \u00e0 ces principes dans le cadre de ses instances.\n[47] Pour qu\u2019il soit justifi\u00e9 de s\u2019\u00e9carter du principe de base voulant que toutes les parties doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre entendues sur une question ayant une incidence sur leurs droits, leurs privil\u00e8ges ou leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats, il faudrait qu\u2019il y ait une raison bien claire pour le faire, notamment un motif pr\u00e9vu express\u00e9ment par le l\u00e9gislateur. D\u2019ailleurs, en l\u2019absence d\u2019un mandat l\u00e9gislatif pr\u00e9cis, un tribunal judiciaire ou administratif doit veiller \u00e0 ce que cet \u00e9cart porte le moins possible atteinte aux principes de justice naturelle.\n[48] Dans le cas de la Loi, il y a trois dispositions distinctes dans lesquelles le l\u00e9gislateur a jug\u00e9 bon de pr\u00e9voir une proc\u00e9dure ex parte :\nart. 4.5(2) : la demande d\u2019une ordonnance de saisie dans le cas du non-paiement de redevances ou d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 payer au ministre;\nart. 8.7(5) : une demande de mandat autorisant \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la visite d\u2019une maison d\u2019habitation;\nart. 14(4) : une demande de mandat de perquisition, relativement \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate sur un accident militaro-civil.\n[49] Dans chaque cas, le l\u00e9gislateur a pr\u00e9vu express\u00e9ment une proc\u00e9dure ex parte.\n[50] Selon les r\u00e8gles d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative, le fait que le l\u00e9gislateur ait express\u00e9ment pr\u00e9vu une audience ex parte dans les trois situations susmentionn\u00e9es et non dans le cas de l\u2019article 4.79(2), d\u00e9note qu\u2019il n\u2019envisageait pas que l\u2019audience de production ou d\u2019examen ait lieu ex parte.\n[51] L\u2019avocat du ministre a fait valoir que l\u2019article 4.79(2) prescrit la tenue d\u2019une audience ex parte, mais je ne vois aucune preuve qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse l\u00e0 de l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur. Une lecture contextuelle de la disposition, conform\u00e9ment au sens ordinaire de son libell\u00e9, indique plut\u00f4t que le l\u00e9gislateur envisageait que l\u2019audience ait lieu \u00e0 huis clos, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 assurer une protection contre la communication publique de la mesure de s\u00fbret\u00e9, mais pas en l\u2019absence des parties, sauf s\u2019il y avait une autre raison de le faire, compte tenu des faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[52] La Loi exige que le Tribunal donne au ministre la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des observations sur la mesure de s\u00fbret\u00e9 \u2013 en l\u2019occurrence, les images de TVCF \u2013 avant de d\u00e9cider d\u2019ordonner ou non la production ou l\u2019examen.

D\u00e9cision 21\nI. Contexte\n[1] Cette d\u00e9cision d\u00e9termine une requ\u00eate en irrecevabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la Ville d\u2019Ottawa (\u00ab l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00bb) pour abus de proc\u00e9dure. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) rejette la plainte de Cheryl Bezoine (la \u00ab plaignante \u00bb) pour abus de proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re d\u2019un r\u00e8glement de son grief li\u00e9 aux relations de travail qui touchait les m\u00eames faits.\n[2] Le 10 ao\u00fbt 2009, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e en tant que conductrice d\u2019autobus de remplacement apr\u00e8s avoir termin\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s un programme de formation r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9e de six semaines et particip\u00e9 \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode d\u2019essai de neuf (9) mois.\n[3] Au cours de cette p\u00e9riode d\u2019essai, la plaignante a manqu\u00e9 environ 52 jours de travail. Certaines de ces absences ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es sans faute (neuf jours) et \u00e9taient dues \u00e0 des raisons m\u00e9dicales, d\u2019autres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es fautives (huit jours) et une absence d\u2019environ 35 jours \u00e9tait due \u00e0 un accident de travail couvert par la CSPAAT aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un employeur ant\u00e9rieur. La p\u00e9riode d\u2019essai de la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 tenir compte de ses absences m\u00e9dicales.\n[4] Le 22 juin 2010, avant l\u2019ach\u00e8vement r\u00e9ussi de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019essai, l\u2019emploi de la plaignante a pris fin. Les motifs invoqu\u00e9s pour son licenciement \u00e9taient les suivants : [traduction]\u00bb d\u00e9faut d\u2019assurer une pr\u00e9sence r\u00e9guli\u00e8re et fiable \u00bb. La plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un grief concernant son licenciement.\nA. Le grief\n[5] La plaignante est membre d\u2019un syndicat. Son emploi est r\u00e9gi par une convention collective entre le Syndicat uni du transport, section locale 279 (le \u00ab syndicat \u00bb) et l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[6] Le 29 juin 2010, le syndicat a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief au nom de la plaignante affirmant que la r\u00e9siliation \u00e9tait \u00ab injuste et injustifi\u00e9e \u00bb.\n[7] Le grief a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 l\u2019arbitrage. Une audience a eu lieu le 6 avril, le 24 mai et le 8 juin 2011 devant l\u2019arbitre Christine Schmidt. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 sous serment lors de cette audience. Il n\u2019existe aucune transcription du t\u00e9moignage de cette audience.\n[8] En juin 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9e et le syndicat ont r\u00e9gl\u00e9 le grief de la plaignante par un accord \u00e9tablissant que le licenciement soit remplac\u00e9 par une d\u00e9mission aux fins limit\u00e9es des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences d\u2019emploi et qu\u2019une recommandation neutre soit fournie \u00e0 toute demande de renseignements des employeurs. La plaignante avait initialement accept\u00e9 le r\u00e8glement le ou vers le 8 juin 2011, la derni\u00e8re date de l\u2019audience, et a, par la suite, retir\u00e9 son accord quelque temps avant que le compte rendu de r\u00e8glement soit ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 le 15 juin 2011. Ce retrait a eu lieu en une semaine, ce qui laisse entendre que la plaignante avait exerc\u00e9 une diligence raisonnable.\n[9] Le compte rendu de r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 le 15 juin 2011 selon les conditions suivantes : [traduction]\n(\u2026)\nATTENDU QUE la plaignante a soutenu que le licenciement \u00e9tait \u00e0 la fois injuste et discriminatoire au sens de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne;\n(\u2026)\nATTENDU QUE les parties, y compris la plaignante, apr\u00e8s la cl\u00f4ture du dossier du syndicat et une discussion avec l\u2019arbitre Schmidt, ont accept\u00e9 un r\u00e8glement de son grief et un r\u00e8glement de sa plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne dont la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne est actuellement saisie;\nATTENDU QUE la plaignante a ensuite inform\u00e9 le syndicat qu\u2019elle ne voulait plus r\u00e9gler ni son grief ni sa plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne;\nATTENDU QUE le syndicat, dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des bonnes relations de travail harmonieuses, n\u2019est plus dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 continuer \u00e0 plaider un grief qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solu;\nPOUR CES MOTIFS, les parties conviennent de ce qui suit :\nLe licenciement de la plaignante, Cheryl Bezoine, aux fins limit\u00e9es de son dossier d\u2019emploi et pour toutes les recommandations aux futurs employeurs, est retir\u00e9 et remplac\u00e9 par une d\u00e9mission \u00e0 compter de la m\u00eame date.\nLa plaignante devrait obtenir une recommandation neutre de la part de la Ville d\u2019Ottawa en ce qui concerne tous les futurs employeurs. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, tous les employeurs qui demandent des renseignements sur la plaignante ne seront inform\u00e9s que des dates de son emploi, de la nature de ses fonctions et du fait qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son poste aupr\u00e8s de la Ville en date du 24 juin 2010.\nLes parties conviennent que la preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant l\u2019arbitre Schmidt a permis d\u2019examiner la question de l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 et si, oui ou non, la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination de la part de la Ville contrairement aux dispositions de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\nLes parties conviennent que rien dans ce compte rendu de r\u00e8glementn\u2019emp\u00eache ou ne restreint la Ville d\u2019offrir un moyen de d\u00e9fense contre la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\nEn contrepartie des paragraphes 1 et 2 ci-dessus, le syndicat accepte de retirer le grief no T-65-10 en date du 29 juin 2010.\nLe compte rendu de r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 joint aux documents relatifs \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la Commission. Aucune des parties n\u2019a soulev\u00e9 de questions en ce qui concerne la confidentialit\u00e9.\n[10] Bien que le compte rendu de r\u00e8glement indique que le grief affirmait que le licenciement \u00e9tait \u00e0 la fois injuste et discriminatoire, il n\u2019y a aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, dans le formulaire de grief, aux pr\u00e9occupations en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[11] Le compte rendu de r\u00e8glement fait \u00e9galement remarquer que la plaignante [traduction] \u00ab a ensuite inform\u00e9 le syndicat qu\u2019elle ne voulait plus r\u00e9gler ni son grief ni sa plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne \u00bb.\n[12] Le compte rendu de r\u00e8glement indique \u00e9galement que la preuve de la question de l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 et de la discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019arbitre et examin\u00e9e par celle-ci :\n3. Les parties conviennent que la preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant l\u2019arbitre Schmidt a permis d\u2019examiner la question de l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 et si, oui ou non, la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination de la part de la Ville contrairement aux dispositions de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[13] Le compte rendu de r\u00e8glement fait \u00e9galement remarquer que rien dans les pr\u00e9sentes n\u2019emp\u00eache la Ville d\u2019offrir un moyen de d\u00e9fense contre la plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne :\n4. Les parties conviennent que rien dans ce compte rendu de r\u00e8glement n\u2019emp\u00eache ou ne restreint la Ville d\u2019offrir un moyen de d\u00e9fense contre la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[14] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la question a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019arbitrage, l\u2019arbitre n\u2019a rendu aucune d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive sur la question de savoir si, oui ou non, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plaignante sur la foi de son invalidit\u00e9 ou de toute autre question. Il n\u2019y a aucune preuve indiquant qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise sur cette question.\nB. La plainte relative aux droits de la personne\n[15] Le 20 ao\u00fbt 2010, environ un mois apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne affirmant qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e en raison des absences li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019invalidit\u00e9.\n[16] La plainte initiale \u00e9nonce les pratiques de discrimination pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es suivantes :\n\u00b7 traitement diff\u00e9rent et pr\u00e9judiciable (d\u00e9faut d\u2019adaptation);\n\u00b7 cessation d\u2019emploi:\n\u00b7 politique ou pratique discriminatoire.\n[17] Le 8 septembre 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 que la plainte soit rejet\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)d) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb) au motif que les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es dans le cadre du processus de r\u00e8glement des griefs.\n[18] Le 8 d\u00e9cembre 2011, la Commission a publi\u00e9 un rapport sur les articles 40 et 41 recommandant qu\u2019elle traite la plainte en vertu du paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi, car elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas convaincue que l\u2019autre processus avait abord\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations de discrimination.\n[19] Le 22 d\u00e9cembre 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a reconnu dans ses observations \u00e9crites que le r\u00e8glement n\u2019avait pas emp\u00each\u00e9 la plaignante de d\u00e9poser sa plainte concernant les droits de la personne.\n[20] Le 17 f\u00e9vrier 2012, la Commission a adopt\u00e9 le rapport sur les articles 40 et 41 et a inform\u00e9 les parties qu\u2019elles avaient 30 jours pour effectuer un contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision. Aucune des parties n\u2019a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de cette d\u00e9cision.\n[21] Le 23 juin 2014, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions affirmant que la plainte constituait un abus de proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 la suite du r\u00e8glement du grief. L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audition de cette affaire, affirmant qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[22] Le Tribunal a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que les arguments sur cette affaire devaient suivre l\u2019audition des t\u00e9moins et que la requ\u00eate ne pouvait pas \u00eatre trait\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire.\n[23] Une audience sur la plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne a eu lieu en novembre 2015. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, la plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de la nature de son grief et des circonstances de l\u2019arbitrage, y compris le t\u00e9moignage selon lequel son absent\u00e9isme \u00e9tait li\u00e9 \u00e0 un \u00ab probl\u00e8me f\u00e9minin \u00bb et que d\u2019autres probl\u00e8mes qu\u2019elle consid\u00e9rait comme des invalidit\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9s au cours de l\u2019audience d\u2019arbitrage.\n[24] L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit de pr\u00e9senter cette requ\u00eate de rejeter la plainte dans sa d\u00e9claration d\u2019ouverture. Aucune objection n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e.\n[25] Le 5 novembre 2015, apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante, mais avant que tous les autres t\u00e9moins aient \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 que la demande soit rejet\u00e9e au motif que le grief avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9.\n[26] Le 4 d\u00e9cembre 2015, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte.\ni.) Requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e visant \u00e0 faire rejeter la plainte\n[27] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plainte devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e parce que cela \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 un abus de proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le grief de la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9.\nii.) Position de la Commission sur la requ\u00eate en rejet\n[28] La Commission soutient que la requ\u00eate en rejet n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e parce que :\na) le processus d\u2019arbitrage n\u2019a pas abouti \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive d\u00e9terminant si, oui ou non, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Bezoine en raison de son invalidit\u00e9;\nb) le r\u00e8glement entre l\u2019intim\u00e9e et le syndicat n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu aux affirmations de Mme Bezoine en ce qui concerne les droits de la personne;\nc) Mme Bezoine n\u2019est pas une partie \u00e0 ladite transaction;\nd) l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9j\u00e0 admis devant la Commission que le r\u00e8glement entre le syndicat et elle n\u2019emp\u00eachait pas Mme Bezoine de d\u00e9poser sa plainte.\niii.) Position de la plaignante sur la requ\u00eate en rejet\n[29] La plaignante a adopt\u00e9 les observations de la Commission.\nII. Questions \u00e0 trancher\n[30] Le Tribunal a-t-il le pouvoir de trancher les questions susceptibles d\u2019entra\u00eener le rejet d\u2019une plainte relative aux droits de la personne sans tenir une audience compl\u00e8te sur le fond de la plainte?\n[31] Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, la plainte de Cheryl Bezoine devrait-elle \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e pour abus de proc\u00e9dure, au motif que l\u2019intim\u00e9e et le syndicat ont collabor\u00e9 au r\u00e8glement d\u2019un grief li\u00e9 aux relations de travail?\nIII. Le droit applicable\n[32] Apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents et la jurisprudence applicable, j\u2019ai conclu que le Tribunal a le pouvoir de trancher des questions qui pourraient entra\u00eener un rejet d\u2019une plainte relative aux droits de la personne \u00e0 un stade interlocutoire sans tenir une audience compl\u00e8te et d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas accueillir la requ\u00eate en rejet de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour les motifs ci-apr\u00e8s.\nA. Le Tribunal a-t-il le pouvoir de trancher les questions susceptibles d\u2019entra\u00eener le rejet d\u2019une plainte relative aux droits de la personne sans tenir une audience compl\u00e8te sur le fond de la plainte?\n[33] Le paragraphe 50(2) de la Loi est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nIl [le membre instructeur du Tribunal] tranche les questions de droit et les questions de fait dans les affaires dont il est saisi en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie.\n[34] J\u2019en conclus que cet article est assez vaste pour que le Tribunal puisse trancher des questions qui rel\u00e8vent de sa propre comp\u00e9tence.\n[35] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c Postes Canada (re Cremasco), 2004 CF 81, aux paragraphes 14 et 15, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le Tribunal est un \u00ab ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure \u00bb et peut rejeter une affaire sans tenir une audience compl\u00e8te au titre de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure :\n15 Il m\u2019appara\u00eet \u00e9vident que l\u2019on ne peut affirmer que le Tribunal est \u00ab ma\u00eetre chez lui \u00bb s\u2019il ne peut pr\u00e9munir sa propre proc\u00e9dure contre les abus.\n[\u2026]\n18 Finalement, il est difficile de voir pourquoi il serait dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de quiconque que le Tribunal tienne une audience dans un cas o\u00f9 il estime qu\u2019une telle audience \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 un abus de sa proc\u00e9dure.\n19 Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis d\u2019avis que ni la jurisprudence ni le droit \u00e9crit n\u2019emp\u00eachent le Tribunal de rejeter, par voie de requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, et pour abus de sa proc\u00e9dure, une affaire qui lui est renvoy\u00e9e par la Commission, \u00e0 supposer dans tous les cas qu\u2019il existe des motifs valables d\u2019agir ainsi.\n[36] Bien que cela portait sur une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, je n\u2019ai aucune raison de conclure qu\u2019on ne peut en dire autant d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 un stade interlocutoire.\n[37] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada 2012 CF 445, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait remarquer que si le Tribunal peut rejeter une plainte sans tenir une audience compl\u00e8te, ce pouvoir doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 \u00ab prudemment \u00bb et \u00ab seulement dans les cas les plus clairs \u00bb :\n[140] Je comprends cependant que le gouvernement soit d\u2019accord avec l\u2019affirmation, formul\u00e9e dans Buffet, selon laquelle la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour rejeter une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00e0 une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire ne devrait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e qu\u2019avec prudence, et seulement dans les cas les plus clairs : pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au par. 39. Je suis \u00e9galement d\u2019accord avec cette d\u00e9claration.\n[38] J\u2019en conclus donc que le Tribunal a le pouvoir de trancher les questions susceptibles d\u2019entra\u00eener le rejet d\u2019une plainte relative aux droits de la personne, sans tenir une audience compl\u00e8te sur le fond de la plainte. Ce pouvoir pourrait notamment \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 dans le cadre de la prise d\u2019une d\u00e9cision au stade interlocutoire. Je tiens cependant \u00e0 faire remarquer que, comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019affaire de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des premi\u00e8res nations du Canada, ce pouvoir doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 avec prudence et uniquement dans les cas les plus clairs.\n[39] Comme il sera expliqu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on plus exhaustive plus loin, je ne suis pas convaincue qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un \u00ab cas des plus clairs \u00bb.\nB. La plainte de Cheryl Bezoine devrait-elle \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e pour cause d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, au motif que le l\u2019intim\u00e9e et le syndicat se sont entendus sur le r\u00e8glement d\u2019un grief li\u00e9 aux relations de travail?\n[40] Rappelons bri\u00e8vement que la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure emp\u00eache la r\u00e9ouverture des litiges dans les circonstances o\u00f9 les exigences strictes de la pr\u00e9clusion pour m\u00eame question en litige (exigences portant g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement sur l\u2019acquiescement tacite\/la r\u00e9ciprocit\u00e9) ne sont pas remplies, mais o\u00f9 la r\u00e9ouverture porterait n\u00e9anmoins atteinte \u00e0 des principes tels que :\nl\u2019\u00e9conomie des ressources judiciaires;\nla coh\u00e9rence;\nle caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif;\nl\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019administration de la justice\n(voir le paragraphe 37 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Toronto (Ville) c.

Les exigences strictes li\u00e9es \u00e0 la pr\u00e9clusion pour m\u00eame question en litige ont-elles \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies?\n[41] Bien que cela ne soit pas exig\u00e9, lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer si la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019un litige constituerait un abus de proc\u00e9dure, l\u2019\u00e9valuation des conditions pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 la pr\u00e9clusion pour m\u00eame question en litige peut aider le Tribunal \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser son analyse de cette question. Les conditions pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 la pr\u00e9clusion pour m\u00eame question en litige sont les suivantes :\n[45] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Danyluk, la Cour supr\u00eame expose \u00e0 grands traits les principes associ\u00e9s au caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif, qui servent de base \u00e0 la doctrine de pr\u00e9clusion pour m\u00eame question en litige, et rappelle les trois conditions pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l\u2019application de cette doctrine :\n(...)\n25. Les conditions d\u2019application de la pr\u00e9clusion pour m\u00eame question en litige ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9es par le juge Dickson, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Angle, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, p. 254 :\n(1) que la m\u00eame question ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e;\n(2) que la d\u00e9cision judiciaire invoqu\u00e9e comme cr\u00e9ant la pr\u00e9clusion soit finale;\n(3) que les parties dans la d\u00e9cision judiciaire invoqu\u00e9e, ou leurs ayants droit, soient les m\u00eames que les parties engag\u00e9es dans l\u2019affaire o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9clusion est soulev\u00e9e, ou leurs ayants droit.\n[46] La Cour a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 que la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e selon une analyse \u00e0 deux \u00e9tapes. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape exige que la cour ou le tribunal d\u00e9termine si les trois conditions sont r\u00e9unies. Dans l\u2019affirmative, \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, le d\u00e9cideur doit se demander, dans l\u2019exercice de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, si la doctrine devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019affaire (...).\n[Voir Murray c Canada, 2014 CF 139]\na) La m\u00eame question a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e?\n[42] La formule de grief indique que le licenciement \u00e9tait injuste et injustifi\u00e9, mais ne fait pas r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une politique ou pratique favorisant les droits de la personne, l\u2019accommodement ou la discrimination.\nPr\u00e9cisions concernant le grief\nLe grief conteste le licenciement par la Ville d\u2019Ottawa de cette employ\u00e9e, au motif qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un licenciement injuste et injustifi\u00e9.\n[43] Selon le compte rendu de r\u00e8glement, la plaignante a soutenu que le licenciement \u00e9tait \u00e0 la fois injuste et discriminatoire au sens de la Loi.\nCONSID\u00c9RANT que la plaignante a soutenu que le licenciement \u00e9tait \u00e0 la fois injuste et discriminatoire au sens de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[44] Le compte rendu de r\u00e8glement indique que les parties ont convenu que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve li\u00e9s \u00e0 la question de l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 et de la discrimination au sens de la Loi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 l\u2019arbitre Schmidt et examin\u00e9s par ce dernier :\n3. Les parties conviennent que la preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant l\u2019arbitre Schmidt a permis d\u2019examiner la question de l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 et si, oui ou non, la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination de la part de la Ville contrairement aux dispositions de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[45] Le compte rendu de r\u00e8glement ne fait \u00e9tat d\u2019aucun accommodement, et n\u2019indique pas si la question du caract\u00e8re discriminatoire de certaines pratiques ou politiques l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e.\n[46] Le compte rendu de r\u00e8glement pr\u00e9cise que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve soumis \u00e0 l\u2019arbitre ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 l\u2019examen de la question de l\u2019invalidit\u00e9, mais je ne dispose d\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve attestant qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue \u00e0 ce sujet. Par ailleurs, le compte rendu de r\u00e8glement n\u2019indique pas s\u2019il y a eu discrimination, et ne fait pas \u00e9tat d\u2019un retrait de la plainte relative aux droits de la personne. Il ne fait pas non plus r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des redressements \u00e0 l\u2019appui de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, et ne pr\u00e9cise pas si la question concernant les politiques ou pratiques de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en consid\u00e9ration. En outre, il n\u2019est fait mention d\u2019aucun accommodement.\n[47] J\u2019estime donc que rien ne prouve que la question soumise au Tribunal \u2013 soit la question de savoir s\u2019il y a eu discrimination, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9pondu aux besoins de la plaignante, et si des politiques ou pratiques discriminatoires \u00e9taient en place \u2013 est la m\u00eame que celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e dans le cadre de l\u2019audience d\u2019arbitrage. Au mieux, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dont je dispose indiquent que la question de la discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e et que la question de la caract\u00e9risation de la cessation d\u2019emploi de la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e dans le cadre d\u2019un accord entre l\u2019intim\u00e9e et le syndicat. Or, il ne s\u2019agit l\u00e0 que de l\u2019une des pr\u00e9tendues pratiques discriminatoires mentionn\u00e9es dans la plainte.\nb) La d\u00e9cision judiciaire invoqu\u00e9e comme cr\u00e9ant la pr\u00e9clusion \u00e9tait-elle finale?\n[48] Pour d\u00e9terminer si une d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait finale, il convient de se demander si le fait de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de la plainte remettrait en question le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif de cette d\u00e9cision. Le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9 par un accord conclu entre le syndicat et l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Aucune d\u00e9cision judiciaire n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue.\n[49] Bon nombre des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents invoqu\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9e y compris la d\u00e9cision rendue dans l\u2019affaire Dunn c. Sault Ste. Marie (City), 2008 HRTO 149 (\u00ab Dunn \u00bb), font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019article 45.1 du Code des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario. Cela a son importance, car dans cet article il est question d\u2019une affaire \u00ab trait\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e \u00bb, formule \u00e0 la port\u00e9e plus large que celle d\u2019un mot comme \u00ab d\u00e9cision \u00bb qui laisserait entendre que l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 instruite. Ce fait et son importance ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9s par le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario au paragraphe 37 de la d\u00e9cision : [traduction]\n[37] Je commencerai par chercher \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le r\u00e8glement d\u2019une affaire entrepris devant un autre tribunal peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une \u00ab instance \u00bb dans laquelle \u00ab le fond \u00bb des plaintes \u00ab a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e \u00bb au sens de cet article. Je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019article 45.1 pourrait s\u2019appliquer au r\u00e8glement des proc\u00e9dures en vertu d\u2019autres textes l\u00e9gislatifs. Cette conclusion est \u00e9tay\u00e9e par le libell\u00e9 et l\u2019intention de l\u2019article 45.1. En effet, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019employer des termes plus restrictifs comme \u00ab d\u00e9cision \u00bb ou \u00ab motifs \u00bb, qui renverraient uniquement \u00e0 une affaire instruite, l\u2019article fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une \u00ab instance \u00bb dans laquelle l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab trait\u00e9e \u00bb... [Traduction]\n[50] Dans l\u2019affaire Dunn, la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue express\u00e9ment en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019article 45.1 du Code de l\u2019Ontario. Ce texte l\u00e9gislatif a un sens \u00e0 la fois pr\u00e9cis et large. N\u00e9anmoins, l\u2019article 45.1 du Code de l\u2019Ontario ne s\u2019applique pas dans cette affaire; le Code ne conf\u00e8re aucune autorit\u00e9 analogue au tribunal f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Ainsi, nous nous fondons sur les doctrines de la finalit\u00e9 en common law.\n[51] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019arbitrage s\u2019est conclu par l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du r\u00e8glement amiable le 15 juin 2011. Ce r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu par l\u2019intim\u00e9e et le syndicat. M\u00eame s\u2019il est incontestable que le syndicat est comp\u00e9tent pour obtenir un r\u00e8glement, il convient de noter que la plaignante n\u2019est pas partie au r\u00e8glement amiable. Le r\u00e8glement amiable n\u2019est pas une d\u00e9cision judiciaire en la mati\u00e8re et n\u2019indique en aucun cas qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en ce qui concerne les politiques ou pratiques discriminatoires ou le d\u00e9faut de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement, alors que ces points sont avanc\u00e9s dans la plainte.\n[52] Le r\u00e8glement amiable ne fait aucune mention d\u2019une d\u00e9cision au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9ventuelle discrimination de la plaignante par l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur la base d\u2019une pr\u00e9tendue invalidit\u00e9 en violation de la Loi, de l\u2019\u00e9ventuel d\u00e9faut de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement et\/ou de l\u2019existence \u00e9ventuelle d\u2019une politique ou pratique discriminatoire, or c\u2019est de ces questions que le tribunal est saisi dans le cadre de cette plainte.\n[53] En outre, le r\u00e8glement amiable ne fait pas mention d\u2019un quelconque d\u00e9gagement de responsabilit\u00e9 ni de la renonciation par la plaignante de son droit \u00e0 engager une proc\u00e9dure pour atteinte aux droits de la personne. En l\u2019absence d\u2019une telle clause, il appara\u00eet que l\u2019intim\u00e9e demande au tribunal de pr\u00e9sumer que la plaignante a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 ses droits quasi constitutionnels. Cela est en contradiction avec les principes d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation associ\u00e9s aux lois sur les droits de la personne.\n[54] Le tribunal doit r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question en litige et d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a eu discrimination. L\u2019arbitrage traite de la cessation d\u2019emploi de la plaignante et ne fait aucune mention de conclusions relatives aux questions de droits de la personne soulev\u00e9es devant le tribunal. Alors que la caract\u00e9risation de la cessation d\u2019emploi pourrait \u00eatre un point abord\u00e9, la proc\u00e9dure sera centr\u00e9e sur les questions relatives aux droits de la personne, sur l\u2019atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 de la plaignante qui en d\u00e9coule et sur les politiques ou pratiques discriminatoires. Aucun de ces crit\u00e8res n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 dans le r\u00e8glement amiable. Les questions relatives aux droits de la personne n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es par le r\u00e8glement amiable.\nc) Les parties dans la d\u00e9cision judiciaire invoqu\u00e9e, ou leurs ayants droit, sont-elles les m\u00eames que les parties engag\u00e9es dans l\u2019affaire o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9clusion est soulev\u00e9e, ou leurs ayants droit\n[55] Afin de conclure \u00e0 la pr\u00e9clusion, les parties \u00e0 chaque proc\u00e9dure doivent \u00eatre les m\u00eames. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les parties \u00e0 l\u2019arbitrage sont le syndicat et l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Les parties qui se pr\u00e9sentent devant le tribunal sont la plaignante, la Commission et l\u2019intim\u00e9e. La plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas partie au r\u00e8glement amiable et le syndicat n\u2019est pas partie \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure portant sur les droits de la personne.\n[56] Sur la base de l\u2019\u00e9valuation ci-dessus, je conclus que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne satisfait pas aux trois crit\u00e8res de la pr\u00e9clusion pour m\u00eame question en litige, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il n\u2019existe pas de d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive sur l\u2019affaire dont le tribunal est saisi, o\u00f9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ne laisse supposer que les questions dont le tribunal est saisi sont les m\u00eames que celles sur lesquelles l\u2019arbitre a statu\u00e9 et o\u00f9 les parties aux deux proc\u00e9dures ne sont pas les m\u00eames.\n[57] M\u00eame si l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9chouait lors de la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une requ\u00eate en rejet sur la base de la pr\u00e9clusion pour m\u00eame question en litige, comme cela a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, dans les situations o\u00f9 une application stricte de la pr\u00e9clusion pour m\u00eame question en litige ne s\u2019applique pas, les tribunaux peuvent s\u2019orienter vers la doctrine du recours abusif par r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019un litige.\nii.) Principes applicables au recours abusif\na) \u00c9conomie des ressources judiciaires\n[58] L\u2019\u00e9conomie des ressources judiciaires am\u00e8ne \u00e0 examiner si le fait de donner suite \u00e0 une plainte constituerait un gaspillage des ressources publiques. Tel n\u2019est pas le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Rien n\u2019indique dans le r\u00e8glement amiable que les questions relatives aux droits de la personne de la plaignante ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage. Par cons\u00e9quent, lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019appara\u00eet pas clairement qu\u2019une question a \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement trait\u00e9e, le fait de l\u2019examiner ne constituerait pas un chevauchement de proc\u00e9dure ni un gaspillage de ressources.\nb) Coh\u00e9rence\n[59] La coh\u00e9rence n\u00e9cessite de d\u00e9terminer si un verdict du tribunal sur les questions de droits de la personne entra\u00eenerait des r\u00e9sultats contradictoires avec la d\u00e9cision\/le r\u00e8glement pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le r\u00e8glement amiable traite seulement de la caract\u00e9risation de la cessation d\u2019emploi et non des questions de droits de la personne. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est peu probable qu\u2019il existe un probl\u00e8me de coh\u00e9rence si l\u2019affaire est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 s\u2019instruire. S\u2019il y avait des probl\u00e8mes concernant les recours ou l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 d\u2019une double indemnisation, ils peuvent \u00eatre abord\u00e9s au moment des recours lors de l\u2019audition.\nc) Irr\u00e9vocabilit\u00e9\n[60] L\u2019instruction de la plainte ne remettrait pas en question l\u2019irr\u00e9vocabilit\u00e9 d\u2019une autre d\u00e9cision, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune d\u00e9cision judiciaire. Si le syndicat et l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont sign\u00e9 le r\u00e8glement amiable et ont une attente d\u2019irr\u00e9vocabilit\u00e9, cette attente se limite \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure close et aux termes de ce r\u00e8glement amiable. La plaignante dans cette affaire a retir\u00e9 son soutien au r\u00e8glement avant sa finalisation. Si le r\u00e8glement amiable indique que l\u2019intim\u00e9e et le syndicat avaient l\u2019intention de r\u00e9soudre la plainte, il \u00e9tablit \u00e9galement que la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord avec le r\u00e8glement et qu\u2019elle a mentionn\u00e9 le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e devrait faire face \u00e0 une plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne. Le syndicat a le pouvoir d\u2019obtenir un r\u00e8glement malgr\u00e9 l\u2019objection de la plaignante, mais le retrait de la plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne ne peut avoir lieu sans le consentement de cette derni\u00e8re. Le r\u00e8glement amiable \u00e9nonce clairement que la plaignante n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 son accord et pr\u00e9voyait un maintien de la plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne en all\u00e9guant que rien dans le r\u00e8glement \u00ab \u2026n\u2019emp\u00eache ou ne restreint la Ville d\u2019offrir un moyen de d\u00e9fense contre la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne \u00bb.\n[61] Je conclus que les questions relatives aux droits de la personne n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on irr\u00e9vocable et, ainsi, que la tenue d\u2019une audience portant sur les points en litige ne remettrait aucunement en question l\u2019irr\u00e9vocabilit\u00e9 d\u2019une autre d\u00e9cision judiciaire.\nd) Int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019administration de la justice\n[62] Le Tribunal est mis en place pour aider les parties \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre des questions de droits de la personne. La Loi est de nature r\u00e9paratrice. La plaignante dans cette affaire demande l\u2019examen et la r\u00e9solution de questions de droits de la personne qui la concernent. En l\u2019\u00e9tat, le compte rendu de r\u00e8glement pr\u00e9voit une plainte relative aux droits de la personne. Compte tenu de la fa\u00e7on dont le document de r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9, il est peu probable que l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 ou l\u2019administration de la justice serait compromise si cette affaire est instruite.\n[63] Il est \u00e9galement important de noter les observations de la Cour dans l\u2019affaire Blencoe c. Colombie-Britannique (Human Rights Commission) 2000 CSC 44. La Cour a conclu qu\u2019il y a abus de proc\u00e9dure lorsque les proc\u00e9dures sont \u00ab injustes au point qu\u2019elles sont contraires \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice \u00bb :\n[120] Pour conclure qu\u2019il y a eu abus de proc\u00e9dure, la cour doit \u00eatre convaincue que [traduction] \u00ab le pr\u00e9judice qui serait caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public dans l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du processus administratif, si les proc\u00e9dures suivaient leur cours, exc\u00e9derait celui qui serait caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public dans l\u2019application de la loi, s\u2019il \u00e9tait mis fin \u00e0 ces proc\u00e9dures \u00bb (Brown et Evans, op. cit., \u00e0 la p. 9-68). Le juge L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 affirme dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Power, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, \u00e0 la p. 616, que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la jurisprudence, il y a \u00ab abus de proc\u00e9dure \u00bb lorsque la situation est \u00e0 ce point vici\u00e9e qu\u2019elle constitue l\u2019un des cas les plus manifestes. \u00c0 mon sens, cela s\u2019appliquerait autant \u00e0 l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en mati\u00e8re administrative. Pour reprendre les termes employ\u00e9s par le juge L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9, il y a abus de proc\u00e9dure lorsque les proc\u00e9dures sont \u00ab injustes au point qu\u2019elles sont contraires \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice \u00bb (p. 616). \u00ab Les cas de cette nature seront toutefois extr\u00eamement rares \u00bb...\n[64] Dans les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, je ne suis pas convaincue qu\u2019instruire cette audience aboutirait \u00e0 un processus qui est in\u00e9quitable au point qu\u2019il est contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice. Bien que la question de cessation d\u2019emploi a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e et que la question de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab examin\u00e9e \u00bb, il n\u2019y a aucune preuve d\u00e9montrant que toutes les all\u00e9gations de la plainte ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en consid\u00e9ration. En cons\u00e9quence, j\u2019estime qu\u2019instruire l\u2019audience et examiner les questions de droits de la personne n\u2019auraient pas pour cons\u00e9quence de jeter le discr\u00e9dit sur l\u2019administration de la justice.\niii.) \u00c9quit\u00e9\n[65] L\u2019arr\u00eat SCFP pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada (la \u00ab Cour \u00bb) demeure une d\u00e9cision qui fait jurisprudence concernant l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure. Dans cet arr\u00eat, les facteurs discr\u00e9tionnaires d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 qui s\u2019appliquent pour emp\u00eacher que la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e s\u2019applique d\u2019une fa\u00e7on injuste ou in\u00e9quitable existent \u00e9galement pour emp\u00eacher que l\u2019application de la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure m\u00e8ne au m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat ind\u00e9sirable (voir le paragraphe 53 de l\u2019arr\u00eat SCFP).\n[66] Par cons\u00e9quent, lorsqu\u2019on examine la question de savoir s\u2019il faut rejeter une plainte sur la base de la pr\u00e9clusion ou d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner la question de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9.\n[67] La Cour a reconnu l\u2019importance de la doctrine de la finalit\u00e9 dans deux arr\u00eats r\u00e9cents : Colombie-Britannique (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) c. Figliola, 2011 CSC 52 (\u00ab Figliola \u00bb) (Can LII) et Penner c. Niagara (Regional Police Services Board), 2013 CSC 19 (\u00ab Penner \u00bb) (Can LII).\n[68] En bref, l\u2019arr\u00eat Penner aborde la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion en common law. En particulier, la Cour a statu\u00e9 sur une tentative d\u2019emp\u00eacher d\u2019autres proc\u00e9dures sur la base d\u2019une d\u00e9cision administrative ant\u00e9rieure o\u00f9 le plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas partie et avait une participation limit\u00e9e, voire aucune, dans la proc\u00e9dure administrative. Attendu que dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Figliola, la Cour a examin\u00e9 les lois provinciales qui habilitaient express\u00e9ment la Human Rights Tribunal de la Colombie-Britannique de rejeter sommairement une plainte qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e dans une autre instance. Les juges majoritaires ont conclu que la disposition du Human Rights Code de la Colombie-Britannique ne se limitait pas \u00e0 l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9clusion, mais int\u00e9grait tous les principes qui sous-tendent les doctrines de la finalit\u00e9 en common law, notamment la chose jug\u00e9e, l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, la contestation indirecte et l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9clusion. Aucune disposition analogue de la Loi n\u2019est en litige dans l\u2019affaire en cause.\n[69] J\u2019estime que les arr\u00eats Penner et Figliola fournissent des conseils pour d\u00e9terminer et \u00e9valuer les doctrines de la finalit\u00e9 comme l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, mais je suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019observation de la Commission qu\u2019il faut s\u2019appuyer sur les faits pour trancher la question de savoir si une plainte est un abus de proc\u00e9dure par la remise en cause d\u2019un r\u00e8glement ou d\u2019une d\u00e9cision finale.\n[70] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Penner, la Cour a examin\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail la question de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9. Elle a conclu que l\u2019\u00e9valuation visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si une deuxi\u00e8me instance devrait se poursuivre doit tenir compte de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale de la premi\u00e8re instance et d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il serait juste d\u2019utiliser la premi\u00e8re instance pour arr\u00eater la seconde.\n[71] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je ne suis pas convaincue qu\u2019il y aura \u00e9quit\u00e9 si la requ\u00eate en irrecevabilit\u00e9 est accord\u00e9e. Il n\u2019y a aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce que les pr\u00e9occupations des droits de la personne de la plaignante ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solues lors de la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente ou premi\u00e8re audience ou que toutes les pratiques all\u00e9gu\u00e9es de discrimination, telles qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la plainte, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es. Il y a une mention que certaines de ces questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab examin\u00e9es \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019audience, mais il n\u2019y a aucune preuve dans le compte rendu de r\u00e8glement pour indiquer qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue dans le cadre de l\u2019une de ces questions. Le compte rendu de r\u00e8glement fait mention de la suppression du mot \u00ab r\u00e9siliation \u00bb de relev\u00e9 d\u2019emploi de la plaignante aux fins limit\u00e9es de son dossier d\u2019emploi et son remplacement par le mot \u00ab d\u00e9mission \u00bb, ainsi que la fourniture d\u2019une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence d\u2019emploi limit\u00e9e. Aucune de ces r\u00e9parations ne fait mention d\u2019une conclusion de discrimination ou d\u2019absence de discrimination, ou ne d\u00e9montre qu\u2019une attention particuli\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e aux politiques ou pratiques discriminatoires vis\u00e9es par les plaintes des droits de la personne de la plaignante. Il n\u2019y a aucune preuve que toutes les pratiques all\u00e9gu\u00e9es de discrimination ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9es dans le r\u00e8glement.\n[72] Bien que la plaignante ne soit pas n\u00e9cessairement oblig\u00e9e d\u2019\u00eatre en accord avec l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement pour qu\u2019il repr\u00e9sente un obstacle \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me instance de la proc\u00e9dure, il convient de souligner que le r\u00e8glement, que la plaignante a explicitement rejet\u00e9, l\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9e d\u2019obtenir une d\u00e9cision finale d\u2019un arbitre concernant la question de discrimination en milieu de travail.\n[73] La d\u00e9cision ne diminue en aucun cas l\u2019importance du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des r\u00e8glements en milieu de travail. Dans l\u2019affaire Dunn, le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 l\u2019importance des r\u00e8glements dans un milieu de travail syndiqu\u00e9.\nL\u2019importance des r\u00e8glements d\u00e9finitifs et obligatoires en milieu de travail syndiqu\u00e9 est \u00e9tablie dans les objets de la Loi sur les relations de travail, qui comprennent : \u00ab Promouvoir le r\u00e8glement rapide des diff\u00e9rends relatifs au lieu de travail. \u00bb L\u2019importance des conventions obligatoires a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e par la Commission des relations de travail de l\u2019Ontario dans TRW Automotive (Kelsey-Hayes Canada Ltd) [2000] OLRB Rep. Juillet\/ao\u00fbt 731, au paragraphe 14 :\nLes parties ont le droit d\u2019invoquer les ententes librement conclues. Rien ne serait plus d\u00e9routant pour des relations de travail ordonn\u00e9es que de permettre aux parties de r\u00e9voquer les ententes entre les employ\u00e9s, leur syndicat et leurs employeurs dans lesquelles elles ont conclu de r\u00e9soudre leurs diff\u00e9rends ou leurs diff\u00e9rends potentiels.\nC\u2019est le cas pour les litiges li\u00e9s aux droits de la personne, peu importe le domaine social dans lequel ils surviennent. Lorsque les parties choisissent librement de r\u00e9soudre le fond d\u2019un litige li\u00e9 aux droits de la personne, le public a un fort int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 s\u2019assurer que le litige prend fin, et ce, peu importe la tribune o\u00f9 il est soumis. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un principe fondamental qui devrait orienter le Tribunal concernant l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 45.1, car faire autrement pourrait rendre le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des r\u00e8glements fort incertain.\n[74] Tout en reconnaissant l\u2019importance des r\u00e8glements qui ont force obligatoire en milieu de travail, apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives pertinentes et la jurisprudence applicable dans l\u2019affaire, le Tribunal a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas permettre la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e demandant le rejet de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[75] Permettre l\u2019instruction de la plainte ne constitue pas un abus de proc\u00e9dure parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de preuve que le r\u00e8glement a r\u00e9solu les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante relatives aux droits de la personne. Le processus de r\u00e8glement des griefs n\u2019a pas men\u00e9 \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive sur les pr\u00e9tendues pratiques discriminatoires \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la plainte, mais a plut\u00f4t men\u00e9 au r\u00e8glement de la question li\u00e9e \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont la cessation d\u2019emploi sera caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e pour les futurs employeurs. Il n\u2019y a aucune preuve d\u2019entente pour retirer la plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne. Cette situation peut \u00eatre attribuable au fait que l\u2019auteure du grief a inform\u00e9 le syndicat qu\u2019elle ne souhaitait pas r\u00e9gler son grief ou sa plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne et qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une partie \u00e0 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement. Toutefois, peu importe la raison, le retrait de la plainte n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 et, en plus, on fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre cette revendication. Cela indique que les parties se sont pench\u00e9es sur cette question et \u00e9taient au courant du fait que cette plainte serait soumise apr\u00e8s le r\u00e8glement du grief. Je ne suis pas convaincue que les parties ont voulu r\u00e9gler le grief pour aboutir \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution de cette plainte. \u00c0 la simple lecture, le compte rendu de r\u00e8glement pr\u00e9voit que la plainte continuera \u00e0 faire express\u00e9ment r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une occasion de d\u00e9fense pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans la poursuite de la plainte.\n[76] De plus, alors que le compte rendu de r\u00e8glement fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au r\u00e8glement de la plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne, il mentionne aussi que la plaignante n\u2019a pas souhait\u00e9 r\u00e9gler le grief ou la plainte au moment de l\u2019entente. En supposant, sans toutefois en d\u00e9cider, que le syndicat avait le pouvoir de d\u00e9cider de renoncer ou de retirer le droit de la plaignante de pr\u00e9senter une plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne en vertu de la Loi, il n\u2019est pas question de cette intention dans le compte rendu de r\u00e8glement. Selon la teneur du compte rendu de r\u00e8glement, une d\u00e9cision ne semble pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 prise \u00e0 savoir s\u2019il y a eu ou non-discrimination. Il semble seulement qu\u2019une entente a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue pour mettre fin au processus de r\u00e8glement de grief.\n[77] Pour ces raisons, je conclus que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que le Tribunal devrait rejeter la plainte aux termes de cette requ\u00eate.\nC. La plaignante aurait-elle d\u00fb obtenir le contr\u00f4le judiciaire du compte rendu de r\u00e8glement ou se pr\u00e9senter aux commissions des relations du travail pour une plainte de manquement au devoir de repr\u00e9sentation plut\u00f4t que de porter cette question devant le Tribunal?\n[78] Finalement, je remarque que l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plaignante aurait d\u00fb obtenir le contr\u00f4le judiciaire du compte rendu de r\u00e8glement ou se pr\u00e9senter au conseil des relations du travail pour plainte de manquement au devoir de repr\u00e9sentation plut\u00f4t que de porter cette question devant le Tribunal. En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord.\n[79] La fa\u00e7on dont la plaignante pourrait chercher \u00e0 obtenir le contr\u00f4le judiciaire du compte rendu de r\u00e8glement n\u2019est pas claire \u00e0 mes yeux, puisqu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas de la m\u00eame partie et il est difficile de comprendre comment il s\u2019agirait d\u2019une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive susceptible de r\u00e9vision.\n[80] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement soutenu que la plaignante aurait d\u00fb se pr\u00e9senter au conseil des relations de travail si elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas satisfaite de la d\u00e9cision du syndicat de signer le compte rendu de r\u00e8glement, pas \u00e0 la Commission. Encore l\u00e0, je ne puis \u00eatre d\u2019accord.\n[81] Dans l\u2019affaire Kelsh c. Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique, 2014 TCDP 36, le Tribunal explique ce qui suit :\n[26] Par cons\u00e9quent, le l\u00e9gislateur a express\u00e9ment conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission le pouvoir et la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour \u00ab statue [r] sur toute plainte dont elle est saisie \u00bb, sous r\u00e9serve des alin\u00e9as 41 (1) a) et suivants de la Loi.\n[27] Le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a pas accord\u00e9 ce pouvoir au Tribunal \u2013 autrement, ce pouvoir lui serait confi\u00e9 dans la Loi, comme l\u2019\u00e9nonce la d\u00e9cision Harkin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 21 et 22.\n[28] En outre, le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 au Tribunal le pouvoir d\u2019effectuer une deuxi\u00e8me fonction d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable \u2013 tel n\u2019est pas l\u2019esprit de la Loi.\n[29] Si une partie n\u2019est pas satisfaite de la mani\u00e8re dont la Commission a exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41 (1)a) de la Loi, elle dispose d\u2019un recours aupr\u00e8s de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, qu\u2019elle exerce en pr\u00e9sentant une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission.\n[82] De m\u00eame, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019argument que la plaignante aurait d\u00fb demander une dispense ailleurs serait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re plus appropri\u00e9e devant la Commission.\nIV.

Elle a r\u00e9pondu aux actes de proc\u00e9dure de la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des demandes incluses dans la requ\u00eate, mais elle a \u00e9galement [traduction] \u00ab consenti \u00e0 ce que la plaignante d\u00e9pose par \u00e9crit des observations en r\u00e9plique, pourvu qu\u2019elles portent et se fondent sur les seuls \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que le Tribunal a entendus et que l\u2019intim\u00e9e puisse d\u00e9poser des observations \u00e9crites en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la r\u00e9plique de la plaignante \u00bb.\n[3] La plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une r\u00e9plique \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e le 19 juin 2017.\nII. Analyse\n[4] J\u2019ai pass\u00e9 en revue les observations de la plaignante et, ceci \u00e9tant dit avec \u00e9gards, je conclus qu\u2019un grand nombre des questions qu\u2019elle soul\u00e8ve sont attribuables \u00e0 son impression que l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a men\u00e9 l\u2019audience en manquant de respect envers elle et en \u00e9tant insensible \u00e0 ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9, et qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment tent\u00e9 d\u2019interrompre et de tirer avantage de sa connaissance des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure et de la mani\u00e8re de conduire une audience, face \u00e0 une profane et, plus important encore, une partie non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e qui souffre de troubles psychologiques.\n[5] En premier lieu, le Tribunal affirme cat\u00e9goriquement que cette conviction de la plaignante est d\u00e9nu\u00e9e de tout fondement. Sans pr\u00e9sumer du succ\u00e8s ou de l\u2019\u00e9chec de la cause de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, je peux dire sans ambages que le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est comport\u00e9e avec professionnalisme et respect, tant envers le Tribunal qu\u2019envers la plaignante. Je rejette formellement les all\u00e9gations contraires de la plaignante, qui sont, selon moi, sans fondement; le Tribunal n\u2019en tiendra pas compte dans son processus d\u00e9cisionnel. En cons\u00e9quence, seront ray\u00e9es toutes les mentions relev\u00e9es dans l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate de la plaignante et dans ses observations en r\u00e9plique qui ont un caract\u00e8re d\u00e9rogatoire \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la mani\u00e8re dont celle-ci a assur\u00e9 la d\u00e9fense de sa cliente.\n[6] Cependant, le Tribunal a bel et bien tent\u00e9 de tenir largement compte du fait que la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat, et malgr\u00e9 une tentative impressionnante de sa part pour se pr\u00e9parer convenablement \u00e0 l\u2019audience, Mme O\u2019Grady, comme le d\u00e9couvrent la plupart, sinon la totalit\u00e9, des plaignants non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, s\u2019est retrouv\u00e9e dans un lieu qu\u2019elle conna\u00eet mal \u2013 une situation qui s\u2019est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e peut-\u00eatre encore plus ardue en raison de ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9. N\u00e9anmoins, bien qu\u2019il soit obligatoire de faire en sorte que toutes les parties aient la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de leur cause, la plaignante ne peut pas se servir de ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 pour obtenir des privil\u00e8ges sp\u00e9ciaux comme la r\u00e9ouverture de l\u2019audience. Elle n\u2019a pas soutenu avoir d\u00e9couvert de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dont elle ne disposait pas au moment de l\u2019audience.\n[7] Les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03-05-04) (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles du TCDP \u00bb) sont diff\u00e9rentes des r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure que l\u2019on applique dans les tribunaux civils. Les R\u00e8gles du TCDP se veulent \u00eatre nettement plus simples, en partie pour faciliter la t\u00e2che d\u2019une partie non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat-conseil et pour permettre de tenir une audience compl\u00e8te, m\u00eame si elles semblent parfois contraires \u00e0 celles que conna\u00eet un \u00e9minent avocat, habitu\u00e9 \u00e0 compara\u00eetre devant les plus hautes cours de justice de notre pays.\n[8] Mme O\u2019Grady dit pr\u00e9senter sa requ\u00eate en vue de faire ajourner le processus d\u00e9cisionnel et d\u2019obtenir [traduction] \u00ab un r\u00e9examen aux fins d\u2019une reprise de l\u2019audience du Tribunal, y compris une modification de 30 % des onglets de preuve inadmissibles et la participation de la Commission \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u00bb, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3(1)b) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du TCDP.\n[9] Bien que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3(1)b) des R\u00e8gles autorise le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une requ\u00eate d\u2019ajournement au cours du processus d\u2019audition, je conviens que cela permet \u00e0 la plaignante de d\u00e9poser sa requ\u00eate avant que la d\u00e9cision sur le fond soit rendue. Je suis toutefois d\u2019avis que cette r\u00e8gle, ni aucune autre r\u00e8gle de proc\u00e9dure du TCDP, n\u2019autorise pas la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019une audience qui a pris fin et n\u2019autorise pas la continuation du d\u00e9p\u00f4t des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des demandes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience, et que le Tribunal a jug\u00e9s inadmissibles.\n[10] Lorsqu\u2019une partie invoque des arguments concernant l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une preuve, c\u2019est au Tribunal qu\u2019il incombe de se prononcer sur la question. Le paragraphe 50(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb) pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut trancher les questions de droit et les questions de fait dans les affaires dont il est saisi. En outre, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)e) permet au Tribunal de trancher toute question de proc\u00e9dure ou de preuve.\n[11] Mme O\u2019Grady n\u2019a pas fait \u00e9tat de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que les parties n\u2019avaient pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 en main \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Elle souhaite plut\u00f4t discuter ou rediscuter de la raison pour laquelle il faudrait consid\u00e9rer comme admissibles certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s inadmissibles.\n[12] En cons\u00e9quence, je ne rendrai pas d\u2019ordonnance de [traduction] \u00ab reprise \u00bb ou r\u00e9ouverture de l\u2019audience dans le but de tenter de faire valoir des arguments qui, en fait, constituent un appel de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal selon laquelle les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9taient inadmissibles. La premi\u00e8re demande vis\u00e9e par l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate de la plaignante est donc rejet\u00e9e.\n[13] Dans sa premi\u00e8re demande vis\u00e9e par la requ\u00eate, Mme O\u2019Grady demande \u00e9galement la [traduction] \u00ab participation de la Commission \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u00bb. Le pouvoir qu\u2019a la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb ou la \u00ab CCDP \u00bb) de compara\u00eetre \u00e0 une audience du Tribunal est r\u00e9gi par l\u2019article 51 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, dont le texte est le suivant : \u00ab [e]n comparaissant devant le membre instructeur et en pr\u00e9sentant ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et ses observations, la Commission adopte l\u2019attitude la plus proche, \u00e0 son avis, de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, compte tenu de la nature de la plainte \u00bb.\n[14] La CCDP est un organisme ind\u00e9pendant du TCDP. La Commission d\u00e9cide si elle prendra part \u00e0 une audience du Tribunal conform\u00e9ment au mandat que lui conf\u00e8re l\u2019article 51 de la Loi. Le Tribunal donne avis de l\u2019audience \u00e0 la Commission au moyen de l\u2019avis d\u2019audience, lequel est envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les parties \u00e0 une affaire dont le Tribunal est saisi, et il invite la Commission (comme les autres parties qui re\u00e7oivent l\u2019avis d\u2019audience), qui a donc le droit de compara\u00eetre \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Il appartient alors \u00e0 la Commission de d\u00e9cider si elle y participera et, dans l\u2019affirmative, de d\u00e9finir l\u2019\u00e9tendue de sa participation (une participation enti\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019audience, par opposition \u00e0 une participation qui se limite au processus de gestion de l\u2019instance, sans prendre part \u00e0 l\u2019audience). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Commission a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal, au moment de lui renvoyer la plainte, qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de limiter sa participation au processus de gestion de l\u2019instance. Il est loisible \u00e0 la Commission de reconsid\u00e9rer sa d\u00e9cision pour prendre part \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u00e0 n\u2019importe quel moment au cours du processus, mais elle ne l\u2019a pas fait dans le cas pr\u00e9sent. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence pour ordonner \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019assister \u00e0 ses audiences.\n[15] En cons\u00e9quence, la premi\u00e8re demande incluse dans la requ\u00eate de la plaignante est rejet\u00e9e en totalit\u00e9.\n[16] La plaignante souhaite modifier les observations \u00e9crites finales qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es lors de son argumentation finale le 9 mai 2017 et les soumettre par \u00e9crit dans les 60 jours suivant le prononc\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[17] Le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le plaignant a la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de faire valoir son point de vue. La r\u00e8gle 1 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du TCDP pr\u00e9voit que les parties ont la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de se faire entendre.\n[18] Je crois que la plaignante, au cours de l\u2019audience, a eu cette possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de faire valoir son point de vue et de pr\u00e9senter ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Dans les observations qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, elle a dit qu\u2019il lui est arriv\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre saisie d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, ce qui l\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9e de participer pleinement \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Elle fait valoir qu\u2019\u00e0 cause des objections de l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, on l\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9e de pr\u00e9senter de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dans le cadre de son argumentation finale, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ni pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience ni jug\u00e9s inadmissibles.\n[19] Il y a toutefois de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions du TCDP qui souscrivent au principe selon lequel les parties ont droit \u00e0 une audience pleine et enti\u00e8re.\n[20] En cons\u00e9quence, j\u2019autoriserai la plaignante \u00e0 d\u00e9poser de nouveau ses observations \u00e9crites finales, qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es lors de l\u2019argumentation finale, et ce, dans les 60 jours suivant le prononc\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Elle limitera ses observations \u00e9crites finales aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 admis et d\u00e9battus \u00e0 l\u2019audience, par l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties. Ces observations \u00e9crites finales ne pourront pas servir \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter de nouvelles all\u00e9gations ou des \u00e9nonc\u00e9s qui, par ailleurs, conviendraient davantage \u00e0 un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Elle ne pourra traiter que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve admis \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Le Tribunal examinera ensuite la version modifi\u00e9e de ses observations \u00e9crites finales et d\u00e9terminera si les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sont convaincants.\n[21] Je rejette par ailleurs la demande de la plaignante concernant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t, dans une bo\u00eete verrouill\u00e9e prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, du document qui figure \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 30 de la pi\u00e8ce R\u20112.

Introduction\n[1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision portant sur la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant, Amir Attaran, en date du 17 f\u00e9vrier 2017, et visant \u00e0 modifier sa plainte contre l\u2019intim\u00e9, Immigration, R\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et Citoyennet\u00e9 Canada (\u00ab IRCC \u00bb), par l\u2019ajout de motifs de discrimination et d\u2019une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles, aux termes de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb).\n[2] La plainte contre IRCC a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) le 28 juillet 2010. Dans cette plainte, il \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les importants retards dans le traitement des demandes de parrainage de parents et de grands-parents, comparativement \u00e0 d\u2019autres groupes de la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial (au sens du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la Loi sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, L.C. 2001, ch. 27), \u00e9taient discriminatoires, en violation de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. Les motifs de distinction illicite all\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e9taient l\u2019\u00e2ge des personnes parrain\u00e9es et\/ou la situation de famille du r\u00e9pondant, M. Attaran.\n[3] Le 22 f\u00e9vrier 2012, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019instruction de la plainte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9e. M. Attaran a ensuite pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire du refus, par la Commission, de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb). La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 sa demande; M. Attaran a alors interjet\u00e9 appel de cette d\u00e9cision aupr\u00e8s de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (la \u00ab CAF \u00bb).\n[4] Le 3 f\u00e9vrier 2015, la CAF a accueilli l\u2019appel et renvoy\u00e9 la plainte \u00e0 la Commission, apr\u00e8s avoir conclu que celle-ci n\u2019avait pas examin\u00e9 ad\u00e9quatement la justification bona fide d\u2019IRCC (Attaran c. Canada (P.G.), 2015 CAF 37).\n[5] Le 6 septembre 2016, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 44(3)a) de la Loi, la Commission a demand\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Attaran.\n[6] Les parties en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ont soumis leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions respectifs dans le cours normal de l\u2019instance. Toutefois, dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9, M. Attaran a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 modifier sa plainte par l\u2019ajout des motifs de distinction illicite que sont la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique. Cette demande de modification a \u00e9t\u00e9 provoqu\u00e9e par un passage pr\u00e9cis dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions d\u2019IRCC qui porte sur la notion de [traduction] \u00ab famille nucl\u00e9aire \u00bb. Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, M. Attaran a \u00e9galement cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 ajouter une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles concernant des commentaires formul\u00e9s dans la Chambre des communes par un d\u00e9put\u00e9, dont les d\u00e9tails ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[7] Les articles 3(1),5 et 14.1 de la Loi sont ainsi libell\u00e9s :\n3(1) Pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs* de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n[...]\n5. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\na) d\u2019en priver un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture.\n[...]\n14.1 Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e [1] .\n[8] Le plaignant soutient que l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9 contient un aveu d\u2019une application de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes de la part d\u2019IRCC, qui constitue de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur les motifs de la race et de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique. M. Attaran cite les paragraphes 30 \u00e0 32, qui font mention de la [traduction] \u00ab famille nucl\u00e9aire \u00bb, d\u00e9crite par l\u2019intim\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant les [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9poux, conjoints et enfants \u00e0 charge \u00bb d\u2019un r\u00e9pondant. M. Attaran qualifie l\u2019expression [traduction] \u00ab famille nucl\u00e9aire \u00bb de [traduction] \u00ab st\u00e9r\u00e9otype occidental \u00bb, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 son avis, il ne tient pas compte du concept non occidental tout aussi valide d\u2019une [traduction] \u00ab famille \u00e9largie \u00bb, qui pr\u00e9vaut dans de nombreuses autres r\u00e9gions du monde. Par cons\u00e9quent, il soutient que l\u2019application de ce st\u00e9r\u00e9otype occidental constitue une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique.\n[9] La plainte de repr\u00e9sailles d\u00e9coule des commentaires formul\u00e9s par un d\u00e9put\u00e9, Paul Calandra, dans la Chambre des communes le 14 f\u00e9vrier 2011. M. Calandra si\u00e9geait en tant que membre du Parti conservateur du Canada, le parti au pouvoir \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Le compte rendu officiel (Hansard) des d\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes \u00e0 cette date consigne les commentaires de M. Calandra de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\nMonsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Amir Attaran a peut-\u00eatre enseign\u00e9 \u00e0 Harvard avec le chef lib\u00e9ral, mais cela ne le place certainement pas au-dessus de nous.\nPlus t\u00f4t aujourd\u2019hui, Amir Attaran a eu \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre sa cause dans le cadre d\u2019une poursuite qu\u2019il a intent\u00e9e pour faire acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le traitement de la demande de parrainage de ses parents am\u00e9ricains. Attaran ne demande pas un traitement plus rapide pour les parents de qui que ce soit d\u2019autre, juste pour les siens.\nAttaran a le droit, comme tout le monde, de parrainer ses parents am\u00e9ricains, s\u2019ils veulent venir vivre au Canada, mais ils doivent attendre leur tour, tout comme mes \u00e9lecteurs et les \u00e9lecteurs de tous les d\u00e9put\u00e9s.\nImmigration Canada \u00e9tudie les demandes de parrainage dans l\u2019ordre dans lequel elles sont re\u00e7ues. Amir Attaran pense peut-\u00eatre que, le chef lib\u00e9ral ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 son mentor, parce qu\u2019il a fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 Harvard, il est au-dessus de nous tous.\nJ\u2019ai des petites nouvelles pour M. Attaran. Il n\u2019est pas sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 mes \u00e9lecteurs et ses parents ne sont pas sup\u00e9rieurs aux 150 000 immigrants qui attendent une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une demande de parrainage ou aux 280 000 immigrants \u2013 un nombre record \u2013 que notre gouvernement a accueillis au Canada en 2010.\nPourquoi les parents d\u2019Amir Attaran n\u2019attendraient-ils pas leur tour comme les autres et pourquoi ne se joindraient-ils pas \u00e0\u00ad\u00ad\u2026\n(D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, vol. 145, no 130, 3e session, 40e l\u00e9gislature, 14 f\u00e9vrier 2011, \u00e0 la page 8104).\n[10] Puisque les deux diff\u00e9rents types de modifications \u00e0 la requ\u00eate du plaignant ne font pas appel \u00e0 des consid\u00e9rations identiques, il convient de les traiter s\u00e9par\u00e9ment. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, la r\u00e8gle concernant les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles peut probablement \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une exception \u00e0 la pratique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en mati\u00e8re de modification. Alors que la proposition d\u2019ajouter de nouveaux motifs de discrimination sera examin\u00e9e essentiellement en d\u00e9terminant si ces modifications modifient le fond de la plainte initiale, des repr\u00e9sailles peuvent d\u00e9couler d\u2019un ensemble de faits ou de circonstances compl\u00e8tement distinct (voir Cook c. Premi\u00e8re nation d\u2019Onion Lake, 2002 CanLII 61849 (TCDP), au paragraphe 20). J\u2019examinerai d\u2019abord la partie de la requ\u00eate qui vise \u00e0 ajouter les nouveaux motifs de discrimination. J\u2019aborderai ensuite la deuxi\u00e8me partie de la requ\u00eate qui vise \u00e0 ajouter une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles.\nII. Positions des parties sur la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 ajouter les motifs fond\u00e9s sur la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique\nA. Position du plaignant\n[11] La position du plaignant est la suivante :\n1. les nouveaux motifs de discrimination d\u00e9coulent du m\u00eame ensemble de faits contenu dans la plainte initiale;\n2. les nouveaux motifs sont admis par l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions;\n3. l\u2019ajout de ces motifs de discrimination ne causerait pas de pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nB. Position de la Commission\n[12] La position de la Commission est la suivante :\n1. le Tribunal a l\u2019autorit\u00e9 d\u2019accorder le redressement demand\u00e9 par M. Attaran;\n2. les nouveaux motifs de discrimination propos\u00e9s \u00e9manent de la m\u00eame matrice factuelle que la plainte initiale de M. Attaran;\n3. l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne subira aucun pr\u00e9judice si la modification est accord\u00e9e, surtout que l\u2019enqu\u00eate n\u2019est pas encore tr\u00e8s avanc\u00e9e;\n4. le Tribunal a la responsabilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9terminer si un droit a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9, et a la comp\u00e9tence pour le faire, m\u00eame si la plainte n\u2019est pas officiellement modifi\u00e9e;\n5. la position du plaignant sur la requ\u00eate satisfait \u00e0 toutes les exigences qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies pour de telles modifications, conform\u00e9ment aux d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures du Tribunal.\nC. Position d\u2019IRCC\n[13] L\u2019intim\u00e9 reconna\u00eet essentiellement au paragraphe 32 de ses observations que les modifications propos\u00e9es d\u00e9coulent des m\u00eames faits que la plainte initiale. Toutefois, l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019oppose aux modifications pour les raisons suivantes :\n1. les nouveaux motifs ne devraient pas \u00eatre ajout\u00e9s \u00e0 la plainte, car ils n\u2019ont aucune chance d\u2019\u00eatre retenus;\n2. les all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le st\u00e9r\u00e9otype occidental de la famille nucl\u00e9aire ne sauraient \u00eatre accueillies parce que le terme [traduction] \u00ab occidental \u00bb est trop g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et ne d\u00e9signe pas une race ou une origine nationale ou ethnique en particulier.\nIII. Droit et analyse (modification par l\u2019ajout de motifs)\n[14] Le Tribunal est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 modifier une plainte pour y ajouter des motifs de discrimination lorsqu\u2019un fil conducteur lie la modification \u00e0 la plainte initiale, ou qu\u2019un facteur commun sous-tend les all\u00e9gations nouvelles et initiales (voir Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Parent, 2006 CF 1313 (\u00ab Parent \u00bb), aux paragraphes 41 et 43).\n[15] Le Tribunal s\u2019inspire en outre d\u2019un jugement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Association canadienne des employ\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, 2002 CFPI 776, aux paragraphes 30 et 31 :\n[30] La jurisprudence dit clairement que le Tribunal a la comp\u00e9tence de modifier les plaintes de discrimination. Le juge Sopinka, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Central Okanagan School District No. 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.S.C. 970, aux pages 978 et 996, au nom de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, a reconnu que la Commission des droits de la personne pouvait modifier une plainte non conforme pour la rendre conforme \u00e0 la nature de l\u2019audience devant le Tribunal. Cela peut se faire \u00e0 n\u2019importe quel moment pendant l\u2019audience.\n[31] Cette jurisprudence est reprise dans les d\u00e9cisions de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale quant aux modifications de plaidoirie selon la r\u00e8gle 75 des R\u00e8gles de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, 1998. Je fais r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Rolls Royce plc c. Fitzwilliam 2000 CanLII 16748 (CF), (2000), 10 C.P.R. (4e) 1 (C.F. 1er inst.), dans lequel le juge Blanchard a \u00e9tabli, en tant que r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, que les modifications propos\u00e9es soient autoris\u00e9es lorsque la partie adverse ne subit aucun pr\u00e9judice :\n10 Bien que la Cour exerce \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, elle devrait, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, autoriser les modifications lorsque la partie adverse n\u2019en subit aucun pr\u00e9judice. Le juge D\u00e9cary, s\u2019exprimant au nom de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans l\u2019affaire Canderel Ltd. c. Canada, 1993 CanLII 2990 (CAF), [1994] 1 C.F. 3 (C.A.F.) \u00e0 la page 9] :\n... la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est qu\u2019une modification devrait \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 tout stade de l\u2019action aux fins de d\u00e9terminer les v\u00e9ritables questions litigieuses entre les parties, pourvu, notamment, que cette autorisation ne cause pas d\u2019injustice \u00e0 l\u2019autre partie que des d\u00e9pens ne pourraient r\u00e9parer, et qu\u2019elle serve les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice.\n[16] Il peut aussi s\u2019inspirer du jugement rendu dans Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du mus\u00e9e canadien des civilisations c. Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada (section locale 70396), 2006 CF 704. La Cour a reconnu que, lorsqu\u2019une plainte est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant le Tribunal, une modification propos\u00e9e pourrait alt\u00e9rer les all\u00e9gations expos\u00e9es dans la plainte initiale de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que celle\u2011ci porte sur une nouvelle question qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal par la Commission (paragraphe 30). Toutefois, l\u2019extension, l\u2019\u00e9laboration ou la clarification d\u2019une plainte est autoris\u00e9e dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle ne fait pas en sorte que la plainte exc\u00e8de le cadre du renvoi et cause un pr\u00e9judice aux parties (paragraphes 40 et 50). Les plaintes sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 le fond de la plainte originale est respect\u00e9, le plaignant et la Commission devraient \u00eatre autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 clarifier et \u00e0 expliquer les all\u00e9gations initiales avant la tenue d\u2019une audience \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019affaire (paragraphe 52).\n[17] Les all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur les motifs additionnels de la race et de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique \u00e9manent de la m\u00eame matrice factuelle que la plainte initiale. Le plaignant all\u00e8gue qu\u2019IRCC a fait preuve de discrimination dans la fa\u00e7on dont il a trait\u00e9 en priorit\u00e9 certaines demandes au titre de la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial. Les autres motifs de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e9manent de l\u2019explication donn\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 au sujet de cette hi\u00e9rarchisation. Par cons\u00e9quent, il y a un facteur commun qui sous-tend les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 la situation de famille et les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, \u00e0 savoir la hi\u00e9rarchisation par l\u2019intim\u00e9 des demandes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au titre de la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement et les hypoth\u00e8ses voulant que cette hi\u00e9rarchisation concerne les familles d\u2019origines diff\u00e9rentes. Il s\u2019agit du fil conducteur entre la plainte initiale et la modification propos\u00e9e (voir Parent, au paragraphe 43).\n[18] \u00c0 mon avis, la modification visant \u00e0 ajouter les motifs additionnels de discrimination ne cr\u00e9era pas de pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 IRCC, parce qu\u2019il aura amplement le temps de r\u00e9pondre avant l\u2019audition aux nouveaux motifs soulev\u00e9s. En outre, m\u00eame avec cette modification, les faits et les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui sous-tendent la plainte demeurent ceux dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9.\n[19] Toutefois, je partage la pr\u00e9occupation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 voulant que l\u2019utilisation faite par M. Attaran du terme [traduction] \u00ab occidental \u00bb est trop g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Afin de permettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de prendre connaissance de toutes les all\u00e9gations auxquelles il doit r\u00e9pondre concernant ces nouveaux motifs, il sera n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019apporter davantage de pr\u00e9cisions. Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, et sans me prononcer sur le bien-fond\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations, je me propose d\u2019accueillir cette partie de la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 ajouter les motifs de la race et de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, sous r\u00e9serve des dispositions de l\u2019ordonnance que je rendrai \u00e0 la fin de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nIV. Positions des parties sur la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 ajouter l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles\nA. Position du plaignant\n[20] La position du plaignant est la suivante :\n1. l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement qu\u2019il consid\u00e8re comme des repr\u00e9sailles est survenu en 2011 et, \u00e0 ce titre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est au courant depuis longtemps;\n2. il a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible d\u2019attaques au Parlement parce qu\u2019il a jadis connu Michael Ignatieff, alors chef du Parti lib\u00e9ral, pendant qu\u2019ils fr\u00e9quentaient tous deux l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Harvard, faisant de lui une [traduction] \u00ab cible l\u00e9gitime d\u2019attaques \u00bb pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne;\n3. il a une perception raisonnable que les d\u00e9clarations du d\u00e9put\u00e9 constituaient des repr\u00e9sailles et que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la jurisprudence, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de prouver qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de repr\u00e9sailles intentionnelles;\n4. les repr\u00e9sailles constituent une all\u00e9gation grave et ne doivent pas \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es \u00e0 une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire de l\u2019enqu\u00eate;\n5. l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne subirait aucun pr\u00e9judice si l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e9tait ajout\u00e9e.\nB. Position de la Commission\n[21] La position de la Commission est la suivante :\n1. il n\u2019appara\u00eet pas clairement que les d\u00e9clarations de M. Calandra correspondent \u00e0 des d\u00e9clarations formul\u00e9es par, ou au nom de l\u2019intim\u00e9, au titre de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi;\n2. le privil\u00e8ge parlementaire, qui donne aux parlementaires la libert\u00e9 de parole lors de d\u00e9clarations faites au Parlement, pourrait \u00eatre un obstacle au succ\u00e8s de cette partie de la requ\u00eate;\n3. l\u2019all\u00e9gation ne peut \u00e0 juste titre \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e de repr\u00e9sailles, sauf si M. Attaran peut all\u00e9guer des faits d\u00e9montrant un lien plausible entre la d\u00e9claration de M. Calandra et l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nC. Position d\u2019IRCC\n[22] La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 est la suivante :\n1. l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles ne devrait pas \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 la plainte, parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a aucune chance d\u2019\u00eatre accueillie;\n2. l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles n\u2019a aucun lien factuel avec la plainte initiale;\n3. les actes de repr\u00e9sailles all\u00e9gu\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par IRCC et ne sont d\u2019aucune fa\u00e7on li\u00e9s \u00e0 IRCC.\nV. Droit et analyse (repr\u00e9sailles)\n[23] Les principes directeurs dans la d\u00e9cision Parent, mentionn\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, demeurent pertinents dans le contexte de requ\u00eates visant \u00e0 ajouter une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles. En outre, dans les requ\u00eates en modification de plaintes par ajout d\u2019une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles, le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer si les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles sont li\u00e9es, de par leur nature, du moins par le plaignant, aux all\u00e9gations qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte initiale et peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme soutenables (Virk c. Bell Canada, 2004 TCDP 10 (\u00ab Virk \u00bb), au paragraphe 7).\n[24] Le Tribunal doit \u00e9galement tenir compte du pr\u00e9judice que pourrait subir IRCC s\u2019il permettait au plaignant de modifier sa plainte par l\u2019ajout d\u2019une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles. Dans la d\u00e9cision Virk, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e au paragraphe 10, le Tribunal a fait remarquer que le plaignant dans cette affaire avait clairement identifi\u00e9 les faits sur lesquels il avait fond\u00e9 ses all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait bien inform\u00e9e des arguments qu\u2019elle allait devoir r\u00e9futer relativement aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles, et elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait d\u2019un pr\u00e9avis suffisant \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard pour pouvoir se d\u00e9fendre ad\u00e9quatement contre ces all\u00e9gations.\n[25] Pour d\u00e9terminer si la requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte doit \u00eatre accueillie, le Tribunal ne devrait pas s\u2019engager dans un examen approfondi du bien-fond\u00e9 de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles au moment o\u00f9 la modification est demand\u00e9e (voir Bressette c. Conseil de bande de la premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle et Stony Point, 2004 TCDP 2 (\u00ab Bressette \u00bb), au paragraphe 6). Un tel examen devrait \u00eatre fait uniquement au terme d\u2019une audience en bonne et due forme, apr\u00e8s que les parties auront eu amplement le temps de formuler et pr\u00e9senter des observations.\n[26] En ce qui concerne la partie de la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 ajouter une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles, M. Attaran ne m\u2019a pas convaincu que les d\u00e9clarations de M. Calandra soient un motif l\u00e9gitime en l\u2019occurrence. Je reconnais que le plaignant lie la d\u00e9claration de M. Calandra \u00e0 la plainte initiale en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne et qu\u2019un examen approfondi de cette all\u00e9gation n\u2019est pas appropri\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la modification. N\u00e9anmoins, le principe du privil\u00e8ge parlementaire fait obstacle \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation. Le privil\u00e8ge de la libert\u00e9 de parole dans les d\u00e9bats parlementaires est l\u2019un des plus importants privil\u00e8ges dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient les d\u00e9put\u00e9s (voir Michaud c. Bissonnette, 2006 QCCA 775 (\u00ab Michaud \u00bb), demande de pourvoi rejet\u00e9e, [2006] C.S.C.R. no 333, aux paragraphes 33 et 46).\n[27] Le privil\u00e8ge parlementaire est une composante importante du droit public g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, h\u00e9rit\u00e9e du Parlement de Westminster aux termes de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 (Royaume\u2011Uni), 30 & 31 Victoria, ch. 3, art. 18, promulgu\u00e9e par la Loi sur le Parlement du Canada, L.R.C. 1985, ch. P-1. L\u2019article 4 de la Loi sur le Parlement du Canada pr\u00e9voit que les privil\u00e8ges, immunit\u00e9s et pouvoirs du S\u00e9nat et de la Chambre des communes, ainsi que de leurs membres, sont ceux que poss\u00e9daient, \u00e0 l\u2019adoption de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867, les membres de la Chambre des communes du Parlement du Royaume-Uni. Il y a notamment la libert\u00e9 de parole des parlementaires garantie par l\u2019article 9 du Bill of Rights de 1689 du Royaume\u2011Uni (voir Canada (Chambre des communes) c. Vaid, 2005 CSC 30, au paragraphe 29, principes 3 et 10).\n[28] La libert\u00e9 de parole prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par le privil\u00e8ge parlementaire permet aux d\u00e9put\u00e9s de se livrer librement au d\u00e9bat d\u00e9mocratique (arr\u00eat Michaud, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9). Cette libert\u00e9 de d\u00e9battre rev\u00eat un int\u00e9r\u00eat national crucial pour tous les Canadiens. On a fait valoir que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la libert\u00e9 de parole \u00e0 l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e est tellement \u00e9vidente qu\u2019elle se passe de commentaires, et que le droit de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e d\u2019\u00eatre le seul juge de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de ses d\u00e9bats est tout aussi \u00e9vident (Ontario (Speaker of the Legislative Assembly) v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), 2001 CanLII 8549 (ON CA), au paragraphe 27). Voir aussi New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. c. Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse (Pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative), [1993] 1 R.C.S. 319, par la juge McLachlin, aux paragraphes 385 et 386.)\n[29] Les commentaires de M. Calandra peuvent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9s \u00e0 des fins partisanes, comme le plaignant le pr\u00e9tend. Ils peuvent \u00e9galement avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab totalement inappropri\u00e9s \u00bb comme l\u2019a soutenu la Commission. Toutefois, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas l\u2019endroit pour juger des d\u00e9clarations faites par un d\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00e0 la Chambre des communes. En outre, en tenant l\u2019intim\u00e9 responsable des commentaires formul\u00e9s par M. Calandra dans ce contexte, le Tribunal irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la s\u00e9paration constitutionnelle des pouvoirs (arr\u00eat Vaid, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 21). Si une telle violation \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e, cela viendrait entraver la libert\u00e9 du d\u00e9bat dans les chambres du Parlement. Les parlementaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lus pour parler, d\u00e9battre et exprimer des points de vue, et leur libert\u00e9 de parole n\u2019est pas confin\u00e9e aux points de vue populaires. Toutefois, les tribunaux des droits de la personne ne doivent pas, en principe, nuire \u00e0 ce niveau de discours hautement prot\u00e9g\u00e9, si essentiel \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 des parlementaires de s\u2019acquitter de leurs fonctions constitutionnelles (arr\u00eat Vaid, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 29).\nVI. D\u00e9cision et ordonnance\n[30] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la partie de la requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte pour y ajouter les motifs de discrimination fond\u00e9s sur la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique est accueillie. Cependant, le plaignant doit donner des d\u00e9tails suppl\u00e9mentaires concernant la d\u00e9finition des termes qu\u2019il a utilis\u00e9s dans cette requ\u00eate, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment les termes [traduction] \u00ab occidental \u00bb et [traduction] \u00ab non occidental \u00bb, et sur leur utilisation comme fondement de ses all\u00e9gations de discrimination. Le greffier communiquera avec M. Attaran concernant les dates de transmission de ces d\u00e9tails, et l\u2019intim\u00e9 et la Commission auront l\u2019occasion d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre dans le cours normal de l\u2019instance.\n[31] La partie de la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 ajouter l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nDavid L.

Demande en rejet\n[1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision portant sur la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 15 mars 2016 par un des intim\u00e9s, l\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada (\u00ab APAC \u00bb) en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance rejetant les plaintes. L\u2019APAC expose plusieurs motifs pour lesquels les plaintes devraient \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire, avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience. L\u2019autre intim\u00e9, Air Canada, a appuy\u00e9 la requ\u00eate en adoptant les observations de l\u2019APAC et en y ajoutant d\u2019autres motifs.\n[2] Ces plaintes font partie d\u2019une affaire complexe concernant la retraite obligatoire des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada \u00e0 60 ans. Le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb ou le \u00ab TCDP \u00bb) est saisi de la question depuis plus de 10 ans. Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s plus bas, je fais droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019APAC et rejette les plaintes des plaignants qui ont atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans avant le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2009. Pour les autres plaignants qui ont atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans le 1er janvier 2010 ou plus tard, la requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e, et j\u2019accorderai une audience.\nII. Contexte\n[3] Cette affaire porte sur les plaintes de pilotes retrait\u00e9s d\u2019Air Canada, qui soutiennent qu\u2019Air Canada a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire et appliqu\u00e9 une politique discriminatoire en les obligeant \u00e0 prendre leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans. La retraite obligatoire \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 la convention collective n\u00e9goci\u00e9e entre Air Canada et l\u2019agent n\u00e9gociateur, l\u2019APAC, et conforme au r\u00e9gime de pension des pilotes. Par cons\u00e9quent, ces pilotes retrait\u00e9s ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grand nombre de plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droit de la personne contre Air Canada et l\u2019APAC, et, dans ce cas, les 97 pilotes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 regroup\u00e9s en une seule audience devant le Tribunal, ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9e l\u2019affaire \u00ab Bailie \u00bb. Les pilotes soutiennent que l\u2019obligation de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans contrevient aux articles 7, 9 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6, version modifi\u00e9e (la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb).\n[4] Avant le groupe de plaignants de l\u2019affaire Bailie, il y a eu devant le Tribunal deux groupes similaires de plaignants compos\u00e9s de pilotes retrait\u00e9s d\u2019Air Canada. Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement regroup\u00e9 ces plaignants dans le cadre d\u2019audiences distinctes. Le premier sera ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9 l\u2019affaire Vilven\/Kelly, et le deuxi\u00e8me groupe, l\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson.\n[5] L\u2019affaire Bailie a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue par le membre Garfield, dont le mandat au sein du Tribunal a expir\u00e9 depuis. En 2011, l\u2019APAC a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue de faire ajourner l\u2019affaire Bailie \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des appels en cours dans les affaires Vilven\/Kelly et Thwaites\/Adamson. Ces affaires allaient se rendre \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (la \u00ab CAF \u00bb). Le membre Garfield a fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en f\u00e9vrier 2012 (2012 TCDP 6). Il \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que les questions de droit dans les affaires Vilven\/Kelly, Thwaites\/Adamson et Bailie \u00e9taient essentiellement les m\u00eames. En outre, il ressortait de l\u2019historique des instances des affaires Vilven\/Kelly et Thwaites\/Adamson que chacune des d\u00e9cisions importantes du Tribunal avait fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la part d\u2019une partie ou plus. Par cons\u00e9quent, le membre Garfield a conclu qu\u2019un ajournement assorti de certaines conditions \u00e9tait une option pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable et moins intrusive que le fait de trancher sur certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la plainte pour cause de chose jug\u00e9e, de pr\u00e9clusion li\u00e9e \u00e0 une question en litige ou d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, comme certaines parties l\u2019ont mentionn\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019ajournement, les plaintes dont il est question dans l\u2019affaire Bailie sont demeur\u00e9es intactes aux fins de d\u00e9cision, une fois que l\u2019on a eu les \u00e9claircissements judiciaires dans les autres cas. Par cons\u00e9quent, le membre Garfield a ajourn\u00e9 l\u2019instance.\n[6] L\u2019ajournement de l\u2019affaire Bailie a dur\u00e9 quatre ans, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada (la \u00ab CSC \u00bb) rejette la demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel du jugement de la CAF dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson (la demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e le 10 mars 2016, voir Robert Adamson, et al. c. Air Canada, et al., 2016 CanLII 12161).\n[7] Dans l\u2019affaire Bailie, il y a 97 plaignants, et la majorit\u00e9 est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat, Me Raymond Hall, qui est \u00e9galement un pilote d\u2019Air Canada et un des plaignants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Les plaignants repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Me Hall sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme la \u00ab coalition de plaignants \u00bb. Les dates de retraite des plaignants de l\u2019affaire Bailie vont de juin 2004 \u00e0 f\u00e9vrier 2012. Au total, 52 pilotes ont eu 60 ans avant 2010, et les 45 autres ont pris leur retraite \u00e0 divers moments apr\u00e8s le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2009 jusqu\u2019en f\u00e9vrier 2012. L\u2019importance de distinguer ces deux groupes sera \u00e9tablie dans ces motifs.\n[8] L\u2019APAC a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande en rejet pour les plaintes de l\u2019affaire Bailie, laquelle demande est dat\u00e9e du 15 mars 2016. Dans une correspondance dat\u00e9e du 16 mars 2016, l\u2019avocat de la coalition de plaignants a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait besoin de beaucoup de temps pour communiquer avec ses clients, les consulter et recevoir des directives concernant la requ\u00eate et un certain nombre de questions importantes, vu les ann\u00e9es qui se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9es depuis l\u2019ajournement de l\u2019instance et le nombre de d\u00e9cisions de la cour. L\u2019avocat de la coalition de plaignants a fait valoir que toutes les parties devraient r\u00e9affirmer leur position compte tenu des changements d\u2019ordre juridique et des faits depuis la pr\u00e9sentation des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions (\u00ab EDP \u00bb).\n[9] L\u2019APAC a r\u00e9pondu en faisant valoir que les parties ne devraient pas modifier leurs EDP avant une requ\u00eate en rejet. L\u2019APAC a plut\u00f4t sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que la coalition de plaignants soul\u00e8ve tout nouveau fait ou tout changement du cadre juridique en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire rejeter les plaintes.\n[10] Le 4 avril 2016, le membre Garfield a ordonn\u00e9 aux parties de signifier et de pr\u00e9senter les documents de la requ\u00eate \u00e0 des dates pr\u00e9cises. Il a poursuivi en disant que [TRADUCTION] \u00ab le Tribunal peut d\u00e9cider de tenir une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pour entendre les observations de vive voix, ou toute partie peut en faire la demande \u00bb. Toutes les observations \u00e9crites sur la requ\u00eate en rejet ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ues, et j\u2019ai entendu les observations de vive voix par conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique le 19 septembre 2016.\nIII. Historique judiciaire des plaintes similaires dans les affaires Vilven\/Kelly et Thwaites\/Adamson\n[11] L\u2019affaire Vilven\/Kelly a \u00e9t\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re instance concernant les r\u00e8gles de retraite obligatoire et les pilotes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9s de prendre leur retraite d\u2019Air Canada \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans. Trois plaintes de deux plaignants, M. Vilven et M. Kelly, tous deux repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Me Hall, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 regroup\u00e9es pour l\u2019instance. La p\u00e9riode \u00e9valu\u00e9e dans le cadre de l\u2019instance relative \u00e0 l\u2019affaire Vilven\/Kelly concernait les pilotes qui ont pris leur retraite de 2003 \u00e0 2005.\n[12] La question principale de cette affaire \u00e9tait de savoir si la r\u00e8gle de retraite obligatoire sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019article 15(1)c) de la LCDP \u00e9tait constitutionnelle. L\u2019article 15(1)c) (abrog\u00e9 depuis) permettait la cessation d\u2019emploi fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, s\u2019il s\u2019agissait de \u00ab l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pour ce genre d\u2019emploi \u00bb. Si l\u2019article 15(1)c) est appliqu\u00e9, alors quel \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pour les pilotes occupant ce genre de poste au Canada et comment serait\u2011il d\u00e9termin\u00e9?\n[13] Les plaignants dans l\u2019affaire Vilven\/Kelly ont contest\u00e9 la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019article 15(1)c). Cette question a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e dans une d\u00e9cision de la CAF (2012 CAF 209) confirmant la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019article 15(1)c) sur le plan constitutionnel (la demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel devant la CSC a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e (2013 CanLII 15565)). Compte tenu du jugement ant\u00e9rieur de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019affaire Vilven c. Air Canada (Vilven CF) (2009 CF 367), maintenant la conclusion du Tribunal selon laquelle 60 ans \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur des pilotes et selon laquelle M. Kelly et M. Vilven \u00e9taient vis\u00e9s par l\u2019article 15(1)c), la CAF a confirm\u00e9 que les plaintes devraient \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es. (Voir la d\u00e9cision Vilven\/Kelly c. Air Canada et l\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada, 2007 TCDP 36, dans laquelle le Tribunal \u00e9tablit l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur).\n[14] Il est \u00e0 noter que le l\u00e9gislateur a abrog\u00e9 l\u2019article 15(1)c) de la LCDP en d\u00e9cembre 2012, et que les intim\u00e9s ont par la suite cess\u00e9 d\u2019exiger que les pilotes prennent leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans.\n[15] L\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson \u00e9tait la deuxi\u00e8me instance concernant les r\u00e8gles de retraite obligatoire et les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9s de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans. Il y avait 70 pilotes dans ce groupe, et les dates de retraite allaient de 2005 \u00e0 2009. La majorit\u00e9 des plaignants \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Me Hall.\n[16] La d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par la CAF, qui a expliqu\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019affaire Vilven CF, rendue par la juge Mactavish, ne lie pas n\u00e9cessairement le Tribunal compte tenu de la situation factuelle. La CAF a indiqu\u00e9 que cette d\u00e9cision devrait avoir pour r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9clairer le contexte dans lequel le Tribunal rend sa d\u00e9cision et devrait restreindre la gamme des options raisonnables offertes au Tribunal dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du groupe de comparaison aux fins de l\u2019article 15(1)c). (Voir les paragraphes 31 et 60 de l\u2019affaire Adamson c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), 2015 CAF 153).\n[17] Dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson, la CAF a \u00e9galement conclu que les facteurs du groupe de comparaison d\u00e9termin\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Vilven CF ne sont pas un \u00ab crit\u00e8re \u00bb, mais plut\u00f4t des \u00ab facteurs \u00bb qui doivent \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s par le Tribunal. Il faut examiner les activit\u00e9s des autres pilotes de transporteurs a\u00e9riens canadiens en fonction des facteurs recens\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision de la CF dans l\u2019affaire bas\u00e9 sur les facteurs identifi\u00e9s dans Vilven CF, mais pas n\u00e9cessairement les appliquer de mani\u00e8re rigide comme un crit\u00e8re. Les facteurs suivants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9s :\n1. piloter vers des destinations int\u00e9rieures;\n2. piloter vers des destinations internationales;\n3. transporter des voyageurs;\n4. piloter des a\u00e9ronefs de tailles diverses;\n5. piloter des a\u00e9ronefs de types divers.\n(Voir le paragraphe 41 de l\u2019affaire Adamson c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), 2015 CAF 153).\n[18] Dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson, les parties \u00e9taient en d\u00e9saccord quant aux facteurs primordiaux de la d\u00e9cision Vilven CF dans l\u2019affaire et, plus important encore, quant \u00e0 savoir s\u2019il fallait interpr\u00e9ter les facteurs de mani\u00e8re conjonctive par le Tribunal, ou de mani\u00e8re disjonctive, comme en a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson.\n[19] La CAF a expliqu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Thwaites\/Adamson que le Tribunal n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenu d\u2019appliquer les facteurs de la d\u00e9cision Vilven CF de la mani\u00e8re avanc\u00e9e par la juge Mactavish dans l\u2019affaire Vilven\/Kelly, mais disposait plut\u00f4t d\u2019une plus grande marge de man\u0153uvre pour d\u00e9cider de leur mode d\u2019emploi. Par cons\u00e9quent, il \u00e9tait plus loisible au Tribunal, en appliquant les facteurs consacr\u00e9s par la d\u00e9cision Vilven CF, d\u2019opter pour une interpr\u00e9tation conjointe.\n[20] La CAF a conclu, au final, que le crit\u00e8re requis aux fins de la r\u00e9vision judiciaire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas rempli. Le juge de la CAF ne pouvait pas annuler la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal relative \u00e0 la question de l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur, car il y avait au dossier des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve allant dans le sens des conclusions du Tribunal (voir les paragraphes 82 et 83 de la d\u00e9cision de la CAF dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson). La CAF a expliqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[82] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal a entendu une preuve abondante sur le choix des groupes de comparaison. Au final, le Tribunal s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur le t\u00e9moignage du capitaine Duke, un t\u00e9moin d\u2019Air Canada, en vue d\u2019\u00e9tablir le groupe de comparaison pour les ann\u00e9es 2005 \u00e0 2008 (d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, au paragraphe 173). Quant \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2009, le Tribunal s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur les t\u00e9moignages de deux t\u00e9moins, le capitaine Paul Prentice, un t\u00e9moin des plaignants, et Harlan Clark, un t\u00e9moin d\u2019Air Canada.\n[83] Il y avait au dossier des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve allant dans le sens des conclusions du Tribunal. Je conclus qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune raison d\u2019intervenir.\n[21] Par cons\u00e9quent, la CAF a accept\u00e9, dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson, la conclusion du Tribunal selon laquelle \u00ab [\u2026] pour chacune des ann\u00e9es de la p\u00e9riode de 2005 \u00e0 2009, la majorit\u00e9 des pilotes \u0153uvrant pour les compagnies a\u00e9riennes canadiennes, y compris Air Canada, dans des postes similaires \u00e0 ceux des plaignants, ont pris leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans \u00bb (voir le paragraphe 181 de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson (2011 TCDP 11)).\nIV. Conclusions de la CAF\n[22] Dans les affaires Vilven\/Kelly et Thwaites\/Adamson, les conclusions de la CAF se pr\u00e9sentent comme suit :\n1. L\u2019article 15(1)c) de la LCDP est constitutionnellement valide (maintenant abrog\u00e9);\n2. Le Tribunal devrait appliquer les facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Vilven CF lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer le groupe de comparaison conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 15(1)c) de la LCDP pour les plaintes relatives \u00e0 la retraite des pilotes;\n3. Le Tribunal a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire relativement \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont il d\u00e9sire appliquer les facteurs en s\u2019inspirant des d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures;\n4. Soixante ans \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur des pilotes occupant un poste similaire \u00e0 celui occup\u00e9 par M. Vilven et M. Kelly au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 2003 \u00e0 2005;\n5. Soixante ans \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pour les pilotes de compagnies a\u00e9riennes canadiennes occupant un poste similaire \u00e0 celui des plaignants au cours des ann\u00e9es 2005 \u00e0 2009 (voir le paragraphe 181 de la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson (2011 TCDP 11)).\nV. Droit\nA. Pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal de rejeter une plainte sans tenir d\u2019audience\n[23] Dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 445 (\u00ab Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00bb), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 le pouvoir du Tribunal de rejeter une plainte dans le cadre d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire. La juge Mactavish a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, cit\u00e9e ci\u2011dessous, avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 confirm\u00e9 ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire ainsi :\n[137] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 quelques\u2011unes des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives susmentionn\u00e9es, le juge von Finckenstein a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00ab difficile de voir \u00bb pourquoi il serait dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de quiconque que le Tribunal tienne une audience qui \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 un abus de proc\u00e9dure : paragraphe 18. Il a conclu qu\u2019aucune interdiction l\u00e9gale ou jurisprudentielle n\u2019emp\u00eachait le Tribunal de rejeter une plainte pour abus de proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 l\u2019issue d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire \u00ab \u00e0 supposer dans tous les cas qu\u2019il existe des motifs valables d\u2019agir ainsi \u00bb : paragraphe 19. Sa d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale : 2004 CAF 363 (CanLII), 329 N.R. 95.\nVoir \u00e9galement la d\u00e9cision Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 CF 81 (\u00ab Cremasco \u00bb), confirm\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 CAF 363.\n[24] La comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour rejeter une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00e0 une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire \u00ab ne devrait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e qu\u2019avec prudence, et seulement dans les cas les plus clairs [\u2026] \u00bb (voir le paragraphe 140 de la d\u00e9cision Premi\u00e8res Nations, supra). Dans les cas o\u00f9 il peut y avoir de graves questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 ou que les questions de fait et de droit sont complexes et entrem\u00eal\u00e9es, il serait peut-\u00eatre pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable, pour des raisons d\u2019efficacit\u00e9, d\u2019attendre la tenue d\u2019une instruction compl\u00e8te avant de trancher la question pr\u00e9liminaire. Toutefois, la juge Mactavish a ajout\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[143] Cela dit, il est possible que dans certains cas il ne soit pas n\u00e9cessairement requis de tenir une instruction compl\u00e8te comportant l\u2019audition de t\u00e9moins. Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 le Tribunal, il pourrait s\u2019agir de cas o\u00f9 les faits ne sont pas contest\u00e9s, ou lorsque l\u2019enjeu repose sur une pure question de droit.\n[\u2026]\n[148] [\u2026] Dans chaque cas, le Tribunal doit examiner les faits et les questions qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et d\u00e9terminer la proc\u00e9dure qu\u2019il convient de suivre dans le but de garantir un processus d\u2019audience aussi informel et rapide que le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure le permet.\n[149] Le processus retenu par le Tribunal doit cependant \u00eatre \u00e9quitable et il doit en toutes circonstances donner \u00e0 chacune des parties \u00ab la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre, [\u2026] de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations \u00bb en ce qui concerne la question en litige.\n[25] En cons\u00e9quence, le Tribunal a la comp\u00e9tence de rejeter une plainte pour abus de proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 l\u2019issue d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire. Toutefois, si le Tribunal rejette une plainte \u00e0 l\u2019issue d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, le processus adopt\u00e9 doit respecter les exigences de la justice naturelle et de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et devrait seulement \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 dans les cas les plus clairs.\nB. Abus de proc\u00e9dure par r\u00e9ouverture de litiges\n[26] La d\u00e9cision de la CSC dans Toronto (Ville) c. S.C.F.P., section locale 79, 2003 CSC 63 (\u00ab S.C.F.P. \u00bb) demeure un arr\u00eat faisant jurisprudence concernant l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure. La doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure emp\u00eache la r\u00e9ouverture de litiges dans des circonstances o\u00f9 les exigences strictes de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e (g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement les exigences de lien de droit et de r\u00e9ciprocit\u00e9) n\u2019\u00e9taient pas remplies, mais o\u00f9 la r\u00e9ouverture aurait n\u00e9anmoins port\u00e9 atteinte aux principes d\u2019\u00e9conomie, de coh\u00e9rence, de caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des instances et d\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019administration de la justice (voir le paragraphe 37 de l\u2019arr\u00eat S.C.F.P., voir \u00e9galement la d\u00e9cision Cremasco).\n[27] La d\u00e9cision de savoir si la remise en cause de questions et de faits importants constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure en raison de la r\u00e9ouverture de litiges est une question discr\u00e9tionnaire (voir le paragraphe 35 de l\u2019arr\u00eat S.C.F.P.). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat S.C.F.P., la CSC a examin\u00e9 les justifications qui sous-tendent la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e et l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en expliquant que la doctrine fait intervenir \u00ab le pouvoir inh\u00e9rent du tribunal d\u2019emp\u00eacher que ses proc\u00e9dures soient utilis\u00e9es abusivement, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re [\u2026] qui aurait [...] pour effet de discr\u00e9diter l\u2019administration de la justice \u00bb et qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e lorsque le tribunal est convaincu que le litige a essentiellement pour but de rouvrir une question qu\u2019il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e (voir le paragraphe 37 de l\u2019arr\u00eat S.C.F.P., voir \u00e9galement le paragraphe 56 de la d\u00e9cision Canam Enterprises Inc. c. Coles, 2000 CanLII 8514, approuv\u00e9e avec dissidence par la CSC (2002 CSC 63)).\n[28] La doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure vise essentiellement \u00e0 pr\u00e9server l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus juridictionnel. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat S.C.F.P., la CSC fait trois observations pr\u00e9liminaires lorsqu\u2019elle \u00e9value ce processus :\n1. on ne peut pr\u00e9sumer que la remise en cause produira un r\u00e9sultat plus exact que l\u2019instance originale;\n2. si l\u2019instance subs\u00e9quente donne lieu \u00e0 une conclusion similaire, la remise en cause aura-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 un gaspillage de ressources suppl\u00e9mentaires et une source de d\u00e9penses inutiles pour les parties?\n3. si le r\u00e9sultat de la seconde instance diff\u00e8re de la conclusion formul\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la m\u00eame question dans la premi\u00e8re, l\u2019incoh\u00e9rence, en soi, \u00e9branlera-t-elle la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de tout le processus judiciaire et en affaiblira-t-elle ainsi l\u2019autorit\u00e9, la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la vocation \u00e0 l\u2019irr\u00e9vocabilit\u00e9?\n(Voir le paragraphe 51 de l\u2019arr\u00eat S.C.F.P.)\n[29] La remise en cause s\u2019accompagne de graves effets pr\u00e9judiciables et il faut s\u2019en garder, \u00e0 moins que des circonstances n\u2019\u00e9tablissent qu\u2019elle est, dans les faits, n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du processus juridictionnel dans son ensemble. La CSC reconna\u00eet les situations suivantes o\u00f9 la remise en cause peut \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire :\n1. lorsque la premi\u00e8re instance est entach\u00e9e de fraude ou de malhonn\u00eatet\u00e9;\n2. lorsque de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, qui n\u2019avaient pu \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s auparavant, jettent de fa\u00e7on probante un doute sur le r\u00e9sultat initial;\n3. lorsque l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 exige que le r\u00e9sultat initial n\u2019ait pas force obligatoire dans le nouveau contexte.\n(Voir le paragraphe 52 de l\u2019arr\u00eat S.C.F.P.)\n[30] M\u00eame si aucune des parties \u00e0 la requ\u00eate n\u2019ont mentionn\u00e9 les arr\u00eats de la CSC dans les affaires Colombie-Britannique (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) c. Figliola, 2011 CSC 52) (\u00ab Figliola \u00bb) et Penner c. Niagara (Commission r\u00e9gionale de services policiers), 2013 CSC 19 (\u00ab Penner \u00bb), il s\u2019agit de deux arr\u00eats importants de la CSC dans lesquels la cour a r\u00e9cemment examin\u00e9 la doctrine du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif.\n[31] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Penner, la CSC s\u2019est pench\u00e9e sur l\u2019application discr\u00e9tionnaire de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e et le besoin de souplesse et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9. Bien que la d\u00e9cision Penner n\u2019\u00e9voque pas la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, comme la cour l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat S.C.F.P., les facteurs discr\u00e9tionnaires relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, qui visent \u00e0 emp\u00eacher que la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e ne produise des effets injustes, jouent \u00e9galement en mati\u00e8re d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure pour \u00e9viter de pareils r\u00e9sultats ind\u00e9sirables (voir le paragraphe 53 de l\u2019arr\u00eat S.C.F.P.).\n[32] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Penner, la CSC a reconfirm\u00e9 une de ses d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures, soit Danyluk c. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., 2001 CSC 44, dans laquelle elle a \u00e9tabli une liste de facteurs pour indiquer certaines circonstances susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre pertinentes dans un cas particulier pour d\u00e9terminer si, dans l\u2019ensemble, il est \u00e9quitable d\u2019appliquer la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e. Au paragraphe 39, la CSC a expliqu\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on dont les facteurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9s et dont ils peuvent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s :\nDe mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les facteurs relev\u00e9s dans la jurisprudence montrent que l\u2019iniquit\u00e9 peut se manifester de deux fa\u00e7ons principales qui se chevauchent et ne s\u2019excluent pas l\u2019une l\u2019autre. Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019iniquit\u00e9 de l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e peut r\u00e9sulter de l\u2019iniquit\u00e9 de l\u2019instance ant\u00e9rieure. Deuxi\u00e8mement, m\u00eame si l\u2019instance ant\u00e9rieure s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re juste et r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 son objet, il pourrait n\u00e9anmoins se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler injuste d\u2019opposer la d\u00e9cision en r\u00e9sultant \u00e0 toute action ult\u00e9rieure.\n[Soulignement ajout\u00e9]\n[33] La liste de facteurs n\u2019est pas exhaustive, et la CSC pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019elle ne doit pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re m\u00e9canique (voir les paragraphes 37 et 38 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Penner). Les facteurs proviennent d\u2019une d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure de la CSC et sont appel\u00e9s \u00ab facteurs Danyluk \u00bb. Les facteurs dont on pourrait tenir compte au moment d\u2019exercer un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire sont les suivants :\na. le libell\u00e9 du texte de loi;\nb. l\u2019objet de la loi;\nc. l\u2019existence d\u2019un droit d\u2019appel;\nd. les garanties proc\u00e9durales;\ne. l\u2019expertise du d\u00e9cideur administratif;\nf. les circonstances entra\u00eenant la d\u00e9cision initiale;\ng. le risque d\u2019injustice qui peut d\u00e9couler de l\u2019application ou de la non-application de la doctrine.\n(Voir les paragraphes 66 \u00e0 80 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Danyluk, supra)\n[34] Bien que les faits dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Figliola soient diff\u00e9rents de ceux de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la CSC a fourni, au paragraphe 34, un bon r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des principes sous-jacents communs de la doctrine du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif, qui vise \u00e0 emp\u00eacher \u00ab les recours abusifs \u00bb :\n\u00b7 La capacit\u00e9 de se fier au caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif d\u2019une d\u00e9cision sert l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public et celui des parties (Danyluk, par. 18; Boucher, par. 35).\n\u00b7 Le respect du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif d\u2019une d\u00e9cision judiciaire ou administrative renforce l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 des tribunaux judiciaires et administratifs ainsi que de l\u2019administration de la justice; \u00e0 l\u2019oppos\u00e9, la remise en cause de questions d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9es par un forum comp\u00e9tent peut miner la confiance envers l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me en cr\u00e9ant de l\u2019incoh\u00e9rence et en suscitant des recours faisant inutilement double emploi (Toronto (Ville), par. 38 et 51).\n\u00b7 La contestation de la validit\u00e9 ou du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 d\u2019une d\u00e9cision judiciaire ou administrative se fait au moyen de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019appel ou de contr\u00f4le judiciaire pr\u00e9vue par le l\u00e9gislateur (Boucher, par. 35; Danyluk, par. 74).\n\u00b7 Les parties ne doivent pas \u00e9luder le m\u00e9canisme de r\u00e9vision pr\u00e9vu en s\u2019adressant \u00e0 un autre forum pour contester une d\u00e9cision judiciaire ou administrative (TeleZone, par. 61; Boucher, par. 35; Garland, par. 72).\n\u00b7 En \u00e9vitant les remises en cause inutiles, on \u00e9vite le gaspillage de ressources (Toronto (Ville), par. 37 et 51).\n[Soulignement ajout\u00e9]\n[35] Les principes ci-dessus sont tr\u00e8s utiles pour guider le tribunal dans l\u2019analyse n\u00e9cessaire relativement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, l\u2019application de la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure est discr\u00e9tionnaire, et divers facteurs sont examin\u00e9s pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une r\u00e9ouverture de litiges, ce qui aurait pour effet de jeter le discr\u00e9dit sur l\u2019administration de la justice. Enfin, je dois \u00e9galement examiner l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et v\u00e9rifier s\u2019il y a des motifs qui justifient de ne pas appliquer la doctrine du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif.\nVI. Positions des parties relativement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate\n[36] Les plaintes dont il est question dans l\u2019affaire Bailie et les plaintes des pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs sont inhabituelles et \u00e9tablissent un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent parce que les questions juridiques et la plupart des questions factuelles sont les m\u00eames dans toutes les affaires connexes, \u00e0 l\u2019exception des plaignants et de leur date de naissance. En outre, l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de retraite devrait s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 tous les plaignants de mani\u00e8re \u00e9gale dans une p\u00e9riode donn\u00e9e. Cependant, il demeure possible que l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de retraite lui-m\u00eame ait chang\u00e9 au fil des ans en raison de changements dans l\u2019industrie.\nA. Position de l\u2019APAC relativement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate\n[37] L\u2019APAC s\u2019appuie sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Cremasco pour confirmer la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal de rejeter l\u2019affaire au moyen d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire au motif de l\u2019abus de sa proc\u00e9dure, attendu que le Tribunal est \u00ab ma\u00eetre chez lui \u00bb. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une question de droit contest\u00e9e. Le Tribunal poss\u00e8de cette comp\u00e9tence, mais, comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 la CF dans sa d\u00e9cision Premi\u00e8res Nations, elle doit seulement \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e dans les \u00ab cas les plus clairs \u00bb.\n[38] L\u2019APAC soutient que la d\u00e9cision S.C.F.P. s\u2019applique directement \u00e0 l\u2019affaire Bailie. L\u2019APAC s\u2019appuie sur la d\u00e9cision Thwaites\/Adamson pour expliquer que le traitement des plaintes dont il est question dans l\u2019affaire Bailie serait un abus de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal et la remise en cause d\u2019une affaire qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e. L\u2019APAC cite abondamment la d\u00e9cision Thwaites\/Adamson de la CAF, en s\u2019appuyant particuli\u00e8rement sur le paragraphe 16 :\nAu vu du dossier, il \u00e9tait raisonnable pour le Tribunal de conclure, au paragraphe 181 de sa d\u00e9cision, que \u00ab [\u2026] pour chacune des ann\u00e9es de la p\u00e9riode de 2005 \u00e0 2009, la majorit\u00e9 des pilotes \u0153uvrant pour les compagnies a\u00e9riennes canadiennes, y compris Air Canada, dans des postes similaires \u00e0 ceux des plaignants, ont pris leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans \u00bb.\n[39] L\u2019APAC fait valoir qu\u2019il ne reste simplement plus aucune question \u00e0 d\u00e9battre. Malheureusement, l\u2019APAC n\u2019a pas abord\u00e9 le fait que la d\u00e9cision de la cour relativement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur ne visait que la p\u00e9riode de 2005 \u00e0 2009. L\u2019APAC n\u2019a \u00e9tabli aucune distinction relativement aux 45 pilotes de l\u2019affaire Bailie qui ont eu 60 ans apr\u00e8s le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2009.\n[40] L\u2019APAC soutient qu\u2019en cas de r\u00e9ouverture de litiges, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve examin\u00e9s au cours des audiences ant\u00e9rieures seront les seuls \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dont sera saisi le Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Bailie. La coalition de plaignants a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment admis dans ses EDP qu\u2019elle s\u2019appuierait sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve des affaires Vilven\/Kelly et Thwaites\/Adamson. En fait, la coalition de plaignants a m\u00eame fait valoir que ce serait un abus de proc\u00e9dure que de les obliger \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Dans ses observations relatives \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, l\u2019APAC a fourni des exemples tir\u00e9s des EDP de la coalition de plaignants et des avis de requ\u00eate ant\u00e9rieurs dans l\u2019affaire Bailie.\n[41] L\u2019APAC soutient \u00e9galement que le rejet des affaires favoriserait l\u2019\u00e9conomie des ressources judiciaires, car il y avait une quantit\u00e9 consid\u00e9rable d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience de l\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson. En outre, comme les plaignants ont admis qu\u2019ils s\u2019appuieraient sur les m\u00eames \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, il n\u2019y a aucun fondement factuel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du r\u00e8glement de leurs requ\u00eates. L\u2019APAC estime que le Tribunal a re\u00e7u des \u00e9claircissements judiciaires des d\u00e9cisions de la CAF et il devrait \u00e9viter les instances faisant double emploi.\nB. R\u00e9plique de l\u2019APAC\n[42] La r\u00e9plique de l\u2019APAC aux r\u00e9ponses de la coalition de plaignants et des autres plaignants qui se repr\u00e9sentent eux-m\u00eames souligne que la coalition de plaignants n\u2019a rien fourni d\u2019autre qu\u2019une affirmation appuyant sa position selon laquelle l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur peut \u00eatre diff\u00e9rent dans l\u2019affaire Bailie. Bien que la coalition de plaignants affirme que des faits importants qui toucheraient l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de retraite sont diff\u00e9rents de ceux en cause dans les instances des affaires Vilven\/Kelly et Thwaites\/Adamson, aucun d\u00e9tail n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni.\n[43] L\u2019APAC affirme que les autres aspects de la position de la coalition de plaignants concernant l\u2019inapplicabilit\u00e9 des d\u00e9cisions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes ne sont rien de plus qu\u2019une r\u00e9p\u00e9tition des positions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es sans succ\u00e8s devant la CAF et dans le cadre de sa demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel \u00e0 la CSC.\nC. Position d\u2019Air Canada relativement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate\n[44] Air Canada s\u2019appuie sur les observations relatives \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019APAC. En outre, aux paragraphes 8 et 9 de ses observations, Air Canada mentionne que certains pilotes ont pris leur retraite apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment abord\u00e9e dans l\u2019instance de l\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson :\n[TRADUCTION]\n8. Un abus de proc\u00e9dure similaire est soulev\u00e9 concernant les plaignants qui ont pris leur retraite peu apr\u00e8s les derniers plaignants de l\u2019affaire Thwaites. Les plaignants qui ont pris leur retraite apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode analys\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites, l\u2019ont fait peu apr\u00e8s cette p\u00e9riode. En outre, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites concernaient l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite de milliers de pilotes au Canada (voir le paragraphe 176 de la d\u00e9cision Thwaites, 2011 TCDP 11, dans les documents de l\u2019APAC).\n9. Compte tenu de la stabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de retraite dans la p\u00e9riode examin\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites, ainsi, d\u2019ailleurs, que l\u2019affaire Vilven c. Air Canada, et compte tenu du fait qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli dans les deux cas qu\u2019il y a des milliers de pilotes dans le groupe de comparaison, il est tr\u00e8s improbable qu\u2019il y ait eu un changement important de l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pendant la courte p\u00e9riode entre la retraite des plaignants de l\u2019affaire Thwaites et de celle de ces plaignants (Ibid. et Vilven c. Air Canada, 2007 TCDP 36, (\u00ab Vilven \u00bb), joint comme onglet 1).\n[45] Air Canada soul\u00e8ve \u00e9galement la question des co\u00fbts en affirmant que le Tribunal doit \u00eatre vigilant pour \u00e9viter un abus de proc\u00e9dure. Les intim\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 consacr\u00e9 beaucoup de temps et d\u2019efforts \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre les plaintes dans le cadre des affaires Vilven\/Kelly et Thwaites\/Adamson. Aucun d\u2019entre eux ne devrait avoir \u00e0 reprendre le processus \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les plaintes ont aussi peu de chances d\u2019\u00eatre maintenues qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En outre, Air Canada soutient que la remise en cause ajoute \u00e0 l\u2019iniquit\u00e9 parce que les intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9s pour les d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CSC 53 (\u00ab Mowat \u00bb) de la CSC.\nD. Position de la coalition de plaignants relativement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate\n[46] Au total, 89 pilotes sont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Me Hall, et 8 autres plaignants se repr\u00e9sentent eux-m\u00eames pour un total de 97 plaignants dans l\u2019affaire Bailie. Quatre des plaignants qui se repr\u00e9sentent eux-m\u00eames ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations relativement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. Malheureusement, je consid\u00e8re qu\u2019ils n\u2019abordent pas les questions juridiques, mais qu\u2019ils r\u00e9affirment plut\u00f4t leur plainte g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, en vue de faire entendre \u00ab leur \u00bb plainte \u00ab individuelle \u00bb.\n[47] Voici un bref aper\u00e7u des arguments de la coalition de plaignants. Je n\u2019ai conserv\u00e9 que les arguments que je crois \u00eatre pertinents en l\u2019occurrence. Le premier argument de la coalition de plaignants est fond\u00e9 sur la connexit\u00e9 d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats. Elle fait valoir qu\u2019aucun des plaignants de l\u2019affaire Bailie ne participait aux instances pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 chaque plaignant est unique, chaque plainte devrait \u00eatre entendue s\u00e9par\u00e9ment. Aucun des plaignants de l\u2019affaire Bailie n\u2019a eu l\u2019occasion de participer aux deux proc\u00e9dures ant\u00e9rieures, ni le droit de pr\u00e9senter des observations au Tribunal concernant les questions soulev\u00e9es, ni d\u2019\u00eatre inform\u00e9 des questions en litige dans ces instances.\n[48] Dans la plupart des observations relatives \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la coalition de plaignants, il est affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle veut rouvrir l\u2019affaire parce qu\u2019elle croit que le Tribunal devrait appliquer les facteurs du groupe de comparaison diff\u00e9remment dans l\u2019affaire Bailie par rapport \u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans le cadre des instances des affaires Vilven\/Kelly et Thwaites\/Adamson. La coalition de plaignants fait valoir que, m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019une cour d\u2019appel a jug\u00e9 une interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable, la d\u00e9cision ne liera pas n\u00e9cessairement ult\u00e9rieurement un tribunal administratif. \u00c0 proprement parler, un tribunal administratif n\u2019est pas li\u00e9 par ses d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures ni par les d\u00e9cisions de ses pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs (voir la d\u00e9cision Altus Group Limited c. Calgary (Ville), 2015 ABCA 85, au paragraphe 16).\n[49] La coalition de plaignants s\u2019appuie sur la d\u00e9cision Morel c. Canada, 2008 CAF 53 (\u00ab Morel \u00bb) rendue par la CAF pour aborder la mise en balance d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats entre les droits des personnes qui doivent \u00eatre entendues et les int\u00e9r\u00eats relatifs \u00e0 la finalit\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 des d\u00e9cisions judiciaires concernant la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure. Elle s\u2019appuie sur la d\u00e9cision Morel pour affirmer son droit d\u2019\u00eatre entendue par rapport \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 que rev\u00eat le fait de mettre en doute les instances pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle affirme que les droits quasi constitutionnels d\u2019une partie \u00e0 une audience impartiale doivent l\u2019emporter sur l\u2019irr\u00e9vocabilit\u00e9 et sur la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9sultats contradictoires.\nVII. Analyse\n[50] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 tous les arguments des parties, mais je ne les aborderai pas tous en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. J\u2019aborde ceux qui, selon moi, sont n\u00e9cessaires en l\u2019occurrence et en rapport avec ma d\u00e9cision.\nA Observations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales\n[51] La coalition de plaignants se trouve dans une position quelque peu d\u00e9licate : elle pr\u00e9sente des arguments contre une partie de sa position prise dans le cadre de son EDP du 18 mars 2011 et de ses r\u00e9pliques \u00e0 Air Canada et \u00e0 l\u2019APAC dat\u00e9es du 11 et du 12 avril 2011, respectivement. Au paragraphe 13 de son EDP, elle affirme ce qui suit : [TRADUCTION] \u00ab En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la composante \u00ab responsabilit\u00e9 civile \u00bb de l\u2019audience, les plaignants s\u2019attendent \u00e0 se fonder sur la preuve et l\u2019argument pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s tant dans l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire Vilven\u2011Kelly que dans celle de l\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson. \u00bb Seuls un ou deux t\u00e9moins auraient \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 nouveau ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Autrement dit, on soutenait que les nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant la responsabilit\u00e9 ne seraient pas n\u00e9cessaires dans l\u2019affaire Bailie.\n[52] La coalition de plaignants, au paragraphe 16 de sa r\u00e9plique \u00e0 Air Canada, dat\u00e9e du 11 avril 2011, a confirm\u00e9 la question de l\u2019\u00e2ge obligatoire qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e :\n[TRADUCTION]\n16. La question de d\u00e9terminer si la mise \u00e0 la retraite obligatoire de ses pilotes par Air Canada respecte les exigences de l\u2019article 15(1)c) de la LCDP a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e \u00e0 fond par toutes les parties au cours de l\u2019audience de l\u2019affaire Thwaites.\n[53] La coalition de plaignants, aux paragraphes 9 et 10 de sa r\u00e9plique \u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019APAC, dat\u00e9e du 12 avril 2011, a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\n9. L\u2019instance repr\u00e9sente le troisi\u00e8me litige portant sur la m\u00eame question, mettant en cause les m\u00eames dispositions relatives \u00e0 la retraite obligatoire de la convention collective et du r\u00e9gime de retraite d\u2019Air Canada \u2013 APAC, par les quatre m\u00eames parties (mais avec un ensemble diff\u00e9rent de plaintes de la coalition de plaignants ayant connexit\u00e9 d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats). Bien que les caract\u00e9ristiques et les comportements propres \u00e0 chaque plaignant puissent \u00eatre en rapport avec les questions li\u00e9es au recours, y compris les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, aucune des caract\u00e9ristiques propres aux plaignants ne permet de faire une distinction entre la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 qui nous occupe et la question qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 instruite deux fois et tranch\u00e9e par le Tribunal et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Ces plaignants, comme tous ceux des deux instances ant\u00e9rieures, sont devant le Tribunal uniquement parce que leur emploi a pris fin conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la convention collective et du r\u00e9gime de retraite d\u2019Air Canada \u2013 APAC, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019ils avaient atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019ensemble de l\u2019audience propos\u00e9e concernant la responsabilit\u00e9 n\u2019est rien d\u2019autre qu\u2019une remise en cause des m\u00eames questions qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive par le Tribunal et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n10. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par l\u2019APAC dans le pr\u00e9sent expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, les plaignants, d\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu, s\u2019opposent \u00e0 la remise en cause des questions qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive par le Tribunal et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans les affaires Vilven-Kelly et\/ou Thwaites. Les plaignants soutiennent avec respect que la remise en cause de la plupart des questions soulev\u00e9es dans les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019APAC, voire toutes, peuvent et devraient \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es par le Tribunal selon les principes de courtoisie judiciaire, de stare decisis, de pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e et\/ou d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n(Gras et soulignement ajout\u00e9s.)\n[54] Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9, la coalition de plaignants avait exprim\u00e9 son d\u00e9sir de modifier ses EDP \u00e0 la suite de la communication des d\u00e9cisions rendues par la CAF dans les affaires Vilven\/Kelly et Thwaites\/Adamson. Les intim\u00e9s ont adopt\u00e9 la position selon laquelle la coalition de plaignants pouvait soulever n\u2019importe lequel des nouveaux faits importants en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet.\n[55] Dans ses observations relatives \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en rejet, la coalition de plaignants a adopt\u00e9 un point de vue diff\u00e9rent de celui de ses EDP de 2011 et a indiqu\u00e9 que [TRADUCTION] \u00ab [\u2026] les faits importants concernant l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite dans l\u2019industrie, comme les dates de cessation d\u2019emploi respectives, sont diff\u00e9rentes de celles des plaignants de l\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson \u00bb (paragraphe 4). Toutefois, les observations n\u2019expliquent pas du tout ce qui est diff\u00e9rent. Quels sont les faits importants qui sont diff\u00e9rents de ceux du groupe de plaignants de l\u2019affaire Bailie? Les observations \u00e9crites n\u2019en parlent pas du tout.\n[56] Lorsque les parties ont formul\u00e9 leurs observations de vive voix, j\u2019ai profit\u00e9 de l\u2019occasion pour poser certaines questions afin d\u2019essayer de d\u00e9terminer ce qui avait chang\u00e9. L\u2019avocat de la coalition de plaignants ne m\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 de r\u00e9ponses satisfaisantes, et la possibilit\u00e9 offerte aux plaignants qui se repr\u00e9sentent eux-m\u00eames n\u2019a permis d\u2019obtenir aucune information convaincante concernant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui pourraient \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s lors d\u2019une audience ou \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9s au moment de la plaidoirie. M\u00eame si les plaignants ont d\u2019embl\u00e9e affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur serait diff\u00e9rent pour eux, ils n\u2019ont pas parl\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019ils avaient l\u2019intention de pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l\u2019audience pour appuyer cette affirmation.\nVIII. Principes applicables \u00e0 l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure\n[57] Dans l\u2019analyse suivante des principes applicables \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, les plaignants sont s\u00e9par\u00e9s en deux groupes selon leur \u00e2ge. On a tir\u00e9 des conclusions diff\u00e9rentes pour chaque groupe.\nA. \u00c9conomie des ressources judiciaires\n[58] Air Canada soutient que le Tribunal doit \u00eatre plus vigilant concernant la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, vu notre incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 attribuer les d\u00e9pens. Au paragraphe 13 des observations d\u2019Air Canada, la compagnie d\u00e9crit le fardeau qui lui incombe d\u00e9j\u00e0 en raison de ces cas :\n[TRADUCTION]\n13. Ce qui suit fournit une illustration convaincante de la raison pour laquelle c\u2019est le cas : les plaintes soul\u00e8vent essentiellement les m\u00eames questions, sauf pour ce qui est de l\u2019identit\u00e9 des plaignants, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es dans Vilven, plus haut, o\u00f9 le plaignant principal a pris sa retraite en 2003. Environ 13 ans plus tard et selon les calculs de l\u2019avocat, apr\u00e8s 50 jours d\u2019audience sur le bien-fond\u00e9 devant le Tribunal, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et en d\u00e9pit du fait que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a entendu deux fois ces questions et que l\u2019avocat du plaignant a demand\u00e9 deux fois l\u2019autorisation que ces questions soient entendues par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, le m\u00eame avocat du plaignant demande de poursuivre ce litige.\n[59] Bien que je sois sensible \u00e0 son argument, la jurisprudence tend \u00e0 expliquer l\u2019\u00e9conomie des ressources judiciaires dans le contexte de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure comme relevant des ressources d\u2019une cour ou d\u2019un tribunal administratif. Cela dit, une quantit\u00e9 importante d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les parties au cours des instances pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, et la d\u00e9cision de 77 pages rendue par le Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson contenait 30 pages d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. En outre, l\u2019EDP de la coalition de plaignants et les documents ant\u00e9rieurs relatifs \u00e0 la requ\u00eate montrent que la coalition n\u2019a pas de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et que ses cas sont essentiellement identiques \u00e0 ceux dont il est question dans les affaires Thwaites\/Adamson et Vilven\/Kelly. Les plaignants, dans l\u2019affaire Bailie, dont la date de la retraite est ant\u00e9rieure au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2009 se retrouveraient directement dans cette p\u00e9riode. En cons\u00e9quence, je juge que ce serait dommageable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9conomie des ressources judiciaires que de remettre en cause et de recevoir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s devant le Tribunal concernant la m\u00eame question, le m\u00eame sc\u00e9nario factuel et la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode.\n[60] Les intim\u00e9s ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un argument convaincant selon lequel, de 2003 jusqu\u2019au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2009, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dont disposait le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal montraient que l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur des pilotes \u00e9tait de 60 ans. Vu le nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, ils ont fait valoir que sans nouveaux faits ou \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pour les pilotes demeure 60 ans pour tous les plaignants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La coalition de plaignants n\u2019a pas abord\u00e9 l\u2019argument de l\u2019\u00e9conomie des ressources judiciaires ni n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour soutenir son argument selon lequel il existe de nouveaux faits qui ont chang\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur, malgr\u00e9 mes questions directes au cours des observations de vive voix.\n[61] L\u2019argument de l\u2019\u00e9conomie des ressources judiciaires est moins convaincant dans le contexte du groupe de plaignants plus jeunes. Le Tribunal ne dispose pas de faits importants relativement \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode dont tient compte le groupe de plaignants plus jeunes. Cela ne devrait pas emp\u00eacher les plaignants qui ont eu 60 ans apr\u00e8s le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2009 d\u2019avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter leur argumentation.\nB. Coh\u00e9rence\n[62] Les plaintes dans l\u2019affaire Bailie suivent deux d\u00e9cisions de la CAF (demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel devant la CSC rejet\u00e9e), lesquelles portent sur les m\u00eames questions juridiques, sauf pour des p\u00e9riodes diff\u00e9rentes. Dans la d\u00e9cision Morel, la CAF explique que, lorsque la juge Arbour a appliqu\u00e9 la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure aux faits en appel dans l\u2019affaire S.C.F.P., \u00ab elle \u00e9tait surtout pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par le maintien de l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me judiciaire, en particulier au regard de la possibilit\u00e9 que des d\u00e9cisions contradictoires d\u00e9consid\u00e8rent l\u2019administration de la justice \u00bb (voir le paragraphe 38 de la d\u00e9cision Morel).\n[63] Je crois que cela cr\u00e9erait une incoh\u00e9rence judiciaire si le Tribunal rendait une nouvelle d\u00e9cision sur le bien-fond\u00e9 qui ferait en sorte qu\u2019un pilote qui a pris sa retraite le 1er f\u00e9vrier 2009 et qui faisait partie du groupe Thwaites\/Adamson re\u00e7oive un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent d\u2019un pilote du groupe Bailie, qui a pris sa retraite \u00e0 la m\u00eame date, ou m\u00eame plus t\u00f4t. Le fait d\u2019obtenir un r\u00e9sultat incoh\u00e9rent remettrait en question l\u2019autorit\u00e9 et le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif d\u2019une d\u00e9cision judiciaire rendue par l\u2019un des plus hauts tribunaux du Canada, la CAF (demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel devant la CSC rejet\u00e9e). Je conclus que le Tribunal risquerait de cr\u00e9er une incoh\u00e9rence judiciaire s\u2019il permettait au groupe de pilotes plus \u00e2g\u00e9s, qui ont eu 60 ans avant le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2009, de rouvrir ce litige.\n[64] Pour les pilotes qui ont eu 60 ans apr\u00e8s le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2009, aucune incoh\u00e9rence judiciaire ne serait cr\u00e9\u00e9e si leurs plaintes \u00e9taient instruites. Le Tribunal ne dispose d\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve relativement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pour cette p\u00e9riode. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est impossible d\u2019affirmer qu\u2019il y aurait une incoh\u00e9rence judiciaire au sens propre si une conclusion diff\u00e9rente \u00e9tait tir\u00e9e.\nC. Caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif\n[65] Il est important de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter la premi\u00e8re partie d\u2019un des principes sous-jacents \u00e0 la doctrine du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif, principes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s au paragraphe 34 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Figliola : \u00ab Le respect du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif d\u2019une d\u00e9cision judiciaire ou administrative renforce l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 des tribunaux judiciaires et administratifs ainsi que de l\u2019administration de la justice [\u2026] \u00bb (voir \u00e9galement les paragraphes 38 et 51 de l\u2019arr\u00eat S.C.F.P.).\n[66] Dans l\u2019ensemble, Me Hall a utilis\u00e9 sa plaidoirie pour critiquer l\u2019approche ant\u00e9rieure utilis\u00e9e par le Tribunal au cours des affaires pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes afin de d\u00e9terminer le groupe de comparaison. Me Hall a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le groupe de comparaison choisi par le Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson m\u00e8ne \u00e0 [TRADUCTION] \u00ab une absurdit\u00e9 profonde \u00bb (voir le paragraphe 26 des observations de la coalition de plaignants).\n[67] La r\u00e9plique \u00e0 cette d\u00e9claration effectu\u00e9e par l\u2019avocat de l\u2019APAC, avec laquelle j\u2019ai tendance \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u2019accord, a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie au paragraphe 12 de la r\u00e9plique de l\u2019APAC :\n[TRADUCTION]\n12. L\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9, au paragraphe 26 de la r\u00e9plique, selon lequel le groupe de comparaison choisi dans le cadre de l\u2019affaire Thwaites m\u00e8ne \u00e0 une absurdit\u00e9 profonde est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la position rejet\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. S\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 question d\u2019une absurdit\u00e9 profonde, la Cour d\u2019appel n\u2019aurait pas conclu que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal \u00e9tait raisonnable.\n[68] Il me semble que l\u2019objectif principal de la coalition de plaignants est de tenter de remettre en question les groupes de comparaison qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis lors des instances pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s ult\u00e9rieurement par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et la CAF. Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement li\u00e9 par ces d\u00e9cisions. Cependant, il doit y avoir un certain caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif aux d\u00e9cisions judiciaires, particuli\u00e8rement celles des cours sup\u00e9rieures. \u00c0 mon avis, le fait de permettre la remise en cause de cette question serait en effet un abus de proc\u00e9dure. Il ne serait pas juste d\u2019exiger des intim\u00e9s qu\u2019ils recommencent le processus. En outre, l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente instance serait remise en question si j\u2019ordonnais cette reprise.\n[69] Pour les pilotes qui ont eu 60 ans apr\u00e8s le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2009, il est impossible d\u2019affirmer que leur affaire a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9finitive. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, le Tribunal ne dispose d\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve concernant l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pour la p\u00e9riode apr\u00e8s 2009. En outre, les intim\u00e9s ne m\u2019ont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019arguments convaincants, mis \u00e0 part l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite pour les pilotes qui ont eu 60 ans apr\u00e8s le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2009 n\u2019a pas chang\u00e9. La p\u00e9riode touchant les plaignants plus jeunes ne fait l\u2019objet d\u2019aucune d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive.\nD. Int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019administration de la justice\n[70] Comme il est indiqu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Thwaites\/Adamson de la CAF, le Tribunal avait le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019appliquer les facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Vilven CF qu\u2019il jugeait appropri\u00e9s compte tenu des faits. Aucune partie n\u2019a fourni de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui permettraient au Tribunal de conclure que la remise en cause des retrait\u00e9s de 2003 \u00e0 2009 donnerait lieu \u00e0 un meilleur r\u00e9sultat que celui de l\u2019instance initiale. On a utilis\u00e9 beaucoup de temps et de ressources judiciaires pour les deux premi\u00e8res instances. La r\u00e9ouverture du litige par les parties donnerait lieu \u00e0 un gaspillage au chapitre des ressources judiciaires et des d\u00e9penses. Enfin, si, pour une raison ou une autre, le Tribunal devait en arriver \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent de celui de l\u2019instance pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, je crois que l\u2019incoh\u00e9rence, en soi, \u00e9branlerait la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019ensemble du processus judiciaire, entra\u00eenerait des r\u00e9sultats contradictoires et jetterait le discr\u00e9dit sur l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019administration de la justice.\n[71] Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, pour les personnes qui ont pris leur retraite apr\u00e8s le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2009, la tenue d\u2019une audience ne jetterait pas le discr\u00e9dit sur l\u2019administration de la justice, car le Tribunal ne s\u2019est pas pench\u00e9 sur cette p\u00e9riode.\nE. \u00c9quit\u00e9\n[72] Les plaignants n\u2019ont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve selon lesquels les conclusions ant\u00e9rieures du Tribunal \u00e9taient entach\u00e9es de fraude ou de malhonn\u00eatet\u00e9. Ils n\u2019ont pas affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dont ne disposait pas le Tribunal dans les affaires Thwaites\/Adamson et Vilven\/Kelly. Le fait que les plaignants n\u2019aiment pas les conclusions des affaires ant\u00e9rieures n\u2019est pas un argument suffisant au chapitre de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9.\n[73] Toutefois, pour ce qui est des pilotes qui ont eu 60 ans apr\u00e8s le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2009, un argument diff\u00e9rent relativement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 se pose. Ces pilotes n\u2019\u00e9taient pas au courant des affaires ant\u00e9rieures dont \u00e9tait saisi le Tribunal. Les faits des plaignants sont diff\u00e9rents en ce sens qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9s de prendre leur retraite au cours d\u2019une p\u00e9riode sur laquelle le Tribunal ne s\u2019est pas pench\u00e9 dans le cadre des autres plaintes.\n[74] En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, le Tribunal ne dispose d\u2019aucun fait de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ni d\u2019aucune donn\u00e9e probante concernant l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur de 2010 \u00e0 2012. Un plaignant qui se repr\u00e9sente lui-m\u00eame, M. Collier, qui a eu 60 ans en septembre 2011, a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de r\u00e9\u00e9valuer l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite obligatoire, en 2011, car il croyait qu\u2019il y avait eu des changements dans l\u2019industrie.\n[75] L\u2019article 50(1) de la LCDP exige que je\u00ab [\u2026] donne [aux parties] la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter [\u2026] des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations \u00bb. Pour des plaignants comme M. Collier, qui a eu 60 ans apr\u00e8s le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2009, la LCDP est claire, \u00e0 mon avis : on doit lui donner la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre entendu. La doctrine de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 est convaincante dans le cas de plaignants comme M. Collier.\nIX. D\u00e9cision Gregg et al c. Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada et Air Canada, 2017 CF 506 (\u00ab Gregg \u00bb), rendue r\u00e9cemment par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale\n[76] Apr\u00e8s la fin de la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019observations relatives \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, mais avant la communication de ma d\u00e9cision, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendu le jugement susmentionn\u00e9, dans lequel les arguments des intim\u00e9s sont en rapport avec la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. La d\u00e9cision Gregg est un contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb), depuis 2013, de ne pas renvoyer des plaintes similaires de pilotes d\u2019Air Canada au Tribunal parce qu\u2019il est [TRADUCTION] \u00ab manifeste et \u00e9vident que les plaintes sont vou\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chec \u00bb. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a maintenu la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas renvoyer les pilotes au Tribunal.\n[77] En mai 2017, les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9es \u00e0 fournir des observations \u00e9crites suppl\u00e9mentaires concernant la d\u00e9cision Gregg. L\u2019APAC a soutenu que la [TRADUCTION] \u00ab d\u00e9cision Gregg est directement applicable \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet en instance et renforce les arguments avanc\u00e9s dans la requ\u00eate \u00bb. Air Canada affirme qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision diff\u00e9rente de celle rendue dans l\u2019affaire Gregg am\u00e8nerait les observateurs \u00e0 conclure que la [TRADUCTION] \u00ab forme l\u2019emporte sur le fond ou que la d\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 la requ\u00eate \u00e9tait entach\u00e9e d\u2019arguments sur des d\u00e9tails techniques \u00bb.\n[78] L\u2019avocat de la coalition de plaignants souligne la distinction entre la t\u00e2che de la cour et celle du Tribunal. Dans la d\u00e9cision Gregg, la cour a examin\u00e9 le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de la Commission au moment d\u2019\u00e9valuer le bien-fond\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire des plaintes. En revanche, le Tribunal, dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate dont il est saisi, \u00e9value l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure afin de d\u00e9terminer si les plaintes devraient \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire. N\u00e9anmoins, Me Hall d\u00e9crit la d\u00e9cision Gregg comme comportant de [TRADUCTION] \u00ab graves lacunes \u00bb et a depuis donn\u00e9 un avis d\u2019appel \u00e0 la CAF.\n[79] De prime abord, ces deux d\u00e9cisions peuvent sembler tr\u00e8s similaires. Cependant, la t\u00e2che du Tribunal est en fait diff\u00e9rente de celle de la Commission. Selon la LCDP, la Commission peut rejeter sommairement une plainte conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de l\u2019article 41(1). Toutefois, la LCDP n\u2019offre aucune possibilit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale au Tribunal concernant le rejet pr\u00e9liminaire d\u2019une plainte. Le seul fondement sur lequel le Tribunal peut rejeter une plainte avant une audience est pr\u00e9vu sous le r\u00e9gime de la common law.\n[80] La d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas renvoyer les plaintes de la d\u00e9cision Gregg au Tribunal \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 41(1)d) de la LCDP :\n41 (1) Sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 40, la Commission statue sur toute plainte dont elle est saisie \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle estime celle-ci irrecevable pour un des motifs suivants :\n[\u2026]\n(d) la plainte est frivole, vexatoire ou entach\u00e9e de mauvaise foi;\n[\u2026]\n[Soulignement ajout\u00e9.]\nLes cours ont \u00e9tabli une jurisprudence importante donnant une orientation concernant cette disposition. Dans la d\u00e9cision Gregg, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que les mesures prises par la Commission \u00e9taient raisonnables et, par cons\u00e9quent, ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre examin\u00e9es.\n[81] La d\u00e9cision doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur la common law et la doctrine d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure mentionn\u00e9e plus haut. Les pouvoirs et les fonctions du Tribunal sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP sont diff\u00e9rents de ceux de la Commission. La Commission joue un r\u00f4le de s\u00e9lection pr\u00e9liminaire et d\u2019enqu\u00eate et agit comme protecteur du processus d\u2019instruction, ce qui comprend la prise en consid\u00e9ration de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Le Tribunal, par ailleurs, poss\u00e8de les pouvoirs d\u00e9cisionnels, en vertu de la LCDP, de tenir une nouvelle enqu\u00eate quasi judiciaire compl\u00e8te.\n[82] Cela ne signifie pas que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas le pouvoir de refuser \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire une plainte qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e. Mais le Tribunal ne peut pas le faire en s\u2019appuyant sur le pouvoir l\u00e9gal dont la Commission est investie au titre de l\u2019article 41(1) de la LCDP, comme cela s\u2019est produit dans l\u2019affaire Gregg. Le Tribunal doit plut\u00f4t appliquer la doctrine du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif de la common law, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure par r\u00e9ouverture de litiges. Le rejet d\u2019une plainte renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re d\u2019une conclusion d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure par r\u00e9ouverture de litiges, n\u2019est pas identique au crit\u00e8re applicable au titre de l\u2019article 41(1)d) de la LCDP. Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que la d\u00e9cision Gregg guide certainement le Tribunal, elle ne le lie dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[83] Je n\u2019oublie pas que la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision a la possibilit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er une apparente incoh\u00e9rence judiciaire pour les plaignants plus jeunes par rapport aux plaignants dans l\u2019affaire Gregg. Toutefois, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 plus haut, le Tribunal joue un r\u00f4le diff\u00e9rent de celui de la Commission. \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas effectu\u00e9 d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des faits ni n\u2019a rendu de d\u00e9cision finale. Le Tribunal ne tire pas avantage de la s\u00e9lection pr\u00e9liminaire que la Commission a mise en place. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, il est possible qu\u2019aucune incoh\u00e9rence judiciaire ne se produise apr\u00e8s que le Tribunal aura rendu une d\u00e9cision. Le r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019appel de l\u2019affaire Gregg devant la CAF n\u2019est pas certain non plus. La question de l\u2019incertitude judiciaire n\u2019est qu\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure par r\u00e9ouverture de litiges. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je ne crois pas que cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment l\u2019emporte sur les autres motifs qui permettent aux plaignants plus jeunes de poursuivre leur d\u00e9marche devant le Tribunal, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9crit plus haut.\nX. Conclusion\n[84] Dans sa requ\u00eate en rejet, l\u2019APAC r\u00e9it\u00e8re, au paragraphe 20, la position ant\u00e9rieure de la coalition de plaignants, selon laquelle : [TRADUCTION] \u00ab il n\u2019y a aucun fait nouveau qui minerait les conclusions rendues par le Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson. En fait, les plaignants ont affirm\u00e9 que, s\u2019ils devaient pr\u00e9senter de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, il s\u2019agirait d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure. \u00bb\n[85] Dans ses observations relatives \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet, Air Canada soutient, au paragraphe 9, qu\u2019il [TRADUCTION] \u00ab [\u2026] est tr\u00e8s improbable qu\u2019un changement concret de l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur ait pu se produire au cours de la courte p\u00e9riode entre le d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite des plaignants dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson et celui des plaignants. \u00bb\n[86] Les premi\u00e8res objections de la coalition de plaignants concernant la remise en cause de l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites en mars et en avril 2011, avant que le Tribunal rejette la demande des plaignants dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson. Environ 15 mois apr\u00e8s la derni\u00e8re p\u00e9riode prise en consid\u00e9ration dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites\/Adamson, les plaignants n\u2019ont pas avanc\u00e9 d\u2019arguments selon lesquels des [TRADUCTION] \u00ab faits importants \u00bb avaient chang\u00e9 dans l\u2019industrie, ce qui remettrait en question la conclusion ant\u00e9rieure. Le dernier plaignant dans l\u2019affaire Bailie a eu 60 ans en f\u00e9vrier 2012.\n[87] Dans les int\u00e9r\u00eats de l\u2019\u00e9conomie des ressources judiciaires, de la coh\u00e9rence et du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif, pour prot\u00e9ger l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du Tribunal et par souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 pour les intim\u00e9s, je ne ferai pas droit \u00e0 la r\u00e9ouverture de litiges du groupe de comparaison pour les pilotes plus \u00e2g\u00e9s dans le groupe de plaignants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Je suis convaincu que l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pour les pilotes de transporteurs a\u00e9riens canadiens, pour les p\u00e9riodes prises en consid\u00e9ration dans les affaires Vilven\/Kelly et Thwaites\/Adamson, \u00e0 savoir jusqu\u2019au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2009, \u00e9tait de 60 ans.\n[88] Bien que je sois sensible aux arguments des intim\u00e9s selon lesquels il est [TRADUCTION] \u00ab tr\u00e8s improbable \u00bb qu\u2019un changement concret relatif aux faits importants touchant l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur se soit produit durant la courte p\u00e9riode allant du 31 d\u00e9cembre 2009 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le dernier plaignant de l\u2019affaire Bailie ait 60 ans, en f\u00e9vrier 2012, je n\u2019ai pas re\u00e7u d\u2019information satisfaisante selon laquelle aucun changement ne s\u2019est produit dans l\u2019industrie.\n[89] Je reconnais les difficult\u00e9s des intim\u00e9s apr\u00e8s tout ce temps. Cependant, la juge Mactavish, dans la d\u00e9cision Premi\u00e8res Nations, supra, pr\u00e9cise clairement que la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour rejeter une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00e0 une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire \u00ab ne devrait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e qu\u2019avec prudence, et seulement dans les cas les plus clairs [\u2026] \u00bb (paragraphe 140). Air Canada utilise les mots [TRADUCTION] \u00ab tr\u00e8s improbable \u00bb pour d\u00e9crire la probabilit\u00e9 d\u2019une conclusion diff\u00e9rente en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Dans la d\u00e9cision Gregg, le juge Annis d\u00e9crit l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve concluante montrant une conclusion diff\u00e9rente comme \u00e9tant [TRADUCTION] \u00ab tr\u00e8s peu probable \u00bb. Cependant, il incombe au Tribunal d\u2019examiner les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui lui sont r\u00e9ellement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s. M\u00eame si la Commission doit n\u00e9cessairement \u00e9valuer la probabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019existence d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve lorsqu\u2019elle s\u2019acquitte de son mandat conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 41, ce n\u2019est pas le r\u00f4le du Tribunal d\u2019\u00e9mettre des hypoth\u00e8ses \u00e0 savoir si certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve peuvent ou non exister. Le Tribunal ne poss\u00e8de pas de pouvoirs d\u2019enqu\u00eate ni ne dispose d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve importants concernant les plaignants plus jeunes. Les parties ont le droit et l\u2019obligation de pr\u00e9senter ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve au Tribunal dans le cadre d\u2019une instance quasi judiciaire. Au stade de l\u2019audience devant le Tribunal, un rejet sommaire ne devrait se produire que dans les cas o\u00f9 il s\u2019agit clairement du moyen le plus appropri\u00e9 pour qu\u2019une plainte soit tranch\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. Pour les plaignants plus jeunes, il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un de ces cas. Le Tribunal ne devrait pas rejeter sommairement une plainte en se fondant uniquement sur des probabilit\u00e9s ou des hypoth\u00e8ses.\n[90] S\u2019agissant d\u2019une requ\u00eate en rejet, il incombe \u00e0 la partie requ\u00e9rante de convaincre le Tribunal qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019APAC a affirm\u00e9 que le fardeau de la preuve devrait passer aux plaignants afin qu\u2019ils montrent qu\u2019il y avait de nouveaux facteurs touchant l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en 2010, en 2011 et en 2012. Toutefois, je ne crois pas que ce soit exact. Comme l\u2019a conclu la juge McTavish dans la d\u00e9cision Premi\u00e8res Nations, supra, les parties devraient avoir droit \u00e0 une audience compl\u00e8te sauf dans les cas les plus clairs, ce qui soutient le droit pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u00e0 une audience. Cela est coh\u00e9rent avec l\u2019article 50(1) de la LCDP, qui pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal doit donner aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations. Il s\u2019ensuit que, dans une requ\u00eate en rejet pour abus de proc\u00e9dure, c\u2019est la partie requ\u00e9rante qui doit convaincre le Tribunal qu\u2019il s\u2019agit du cas le plus clair o\u00f9 la plainte devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[91] Le Tribunal ne dispose d\u2019aucun fait de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ni d\u2019aucune donn\u00e9e probante concernant l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur de 2010 \u00e0 2012. L\u2019article 50(1) de la LCDP exige que le Tribunal \u00ab donne [aux parties] la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, [\u2026] des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations \u00bb. Pour les plaignants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qui ont eu 60 ans apr\u00e8s le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2009, la LCDP nous oblige \u00e0 leur donner la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre entendus.\n[92] Bien que dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision il soit stipul\u00e9 que nous tiendrons une audience pour les plaignants plus jeunes, je compatis \u00e0 la situation des intim\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Ils se sont battus pendant plus de 10 ans, ont d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 des efforts consid\u00e9rables et assum\u00e9 des d\u00e9pens importants; en citant la d\u00e9cision Mowat, supra, ils affirment qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9pens qu\u2019ils ne peuvent pas recouvrer. La dur\u00e9e et les d\u00e9pens des instances se d\u00e9roulant devant le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne ont \u00e9t\u00e9 critiqu\u00e9s par le pass\u00e9.\n[93] Bien que le Tribunal soit d\u00e9crit comme un \u00ab tribunal administratif \u00bb, la nature quasi constitutionnelle de notre sujet fait en sorte que les parties devant nous d\u00e9sirent en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u00e9fendre leur position dans toute la mesure que le pr\u00e9voit la loi, car c\u2019est leur droit. Les blessures peuvent \u00eatre profondes, et les r\u00e9putations sont d\u00e9fendues vigoureusement. M\u00eame si le l\u00e9gislateur a \u00e9tabli une attente relativement \u00e0 une instruction \u00ab exp\u00e9ditive \u00bb, selon la formulation de la loi applicable, cette attente est att\u00e9nu\u00e9e par les exigences de justice naturelle et les droits proc\u00e9duraux pr\u00e9vus aux articles 48.9(1) et 50(1) de la LCDP. Par cons\u00e9quent, les audiences du TCDP se d\u00e9roulent rarement aussi rapidement que ce que l\u2019on pourrait s\u2019attendre d\u2019un processus \u00ab administratif \u00bb.\n[94] En conclusion, il est fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet des plaintes pour les plaignants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qui ont atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2009 ou avant, pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s.\n[95] Pour les 45 autres plaignants qui ont atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans le 1er janvier 2010 ou apr\u00e8s, la requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e sous r\u00e9serve du droit des intim\u00e9s de pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 nouveau une requ\u00eate en rejet plus tard.\nSign\u00e9e par\nDavid L.

D\u00c9CISION 19\nI. CONTEXTE\n[1] Monsieur Todd, (le \u00ab plaignant \u00bb) a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 par OC Transpo (l\u2019intim\u00e9e) en 2001 pour travailler comme chauffeur d\u2019autobus.\n[2] Le plaignant affirme qu\u2019en 2004 il a re\u00e7u un diagnostic de syndrome du c\u00f4lon irritable (\u00ab SCI \u00bb) et de reflux gatro-oesophagien (\u00ab RGO \u00bb) et avait besoin d\u2019accommodement de la part de son employeur relativement \u00e0 ces probl\u00e8mes.\n[3] Le plaignant affirme \u00e9galement que depuis 2004 il vit des \u00e9pisodes de douleurs chroniques au cou et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9paule, et depuis 2012, \u00e0 la hanche et \u00e0 la jambe.\n[4] Le plaignant soutient qu\u2019en raison de ces probl\u00e8mes et d\u2019autres probl\u00e8mes, il a d\u00fb s\u2019absenter \u00e0 diverses reprises du travail pendant un certain temps. Ses absences du travail ont fini par pr\u00e9occuper son employeur.\n[5] Le plaignant et l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont conclu un contrat d\u2019emploi permanent (le \u00ab CEP \u00bb), qui r\u00e9gissait notamment les absences du travail du plaignant.\n[6] Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en cong\u00e9 administratif en janvier 2014, et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 le 10 mars 2014 au motif qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas respect\u00e9 le CEP.\n[7] Les circonstances ayant pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le cong\u00e9diement du plaignant ainsi que le cong\u00e9diement en soi sont l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\nA. La plainte de manquement au devoir de repr\u00e9sentation juste\n[8] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque pertinente, le plaignant \u00e9tait membre du Syndicat uni du transport (le \u00ab SUT \u00bb). Son emploi chez l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait r\u00e9gi par une convention collective conclue entre le SUT, section 279 (le \u00ab syndicat \u00bb) et l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[9] Le 8 mai 2014, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Conseil canadien des relations industrielles (le \u00ab CCRI \u00bb), en vertu de l\u2019article 37 du Code canadien du travail (\u00ab CCT \u00bb), une plainte selon laquelle le syndicat ne se serait pas acquitt\u00e9 de son obligation de repr\u00e9sentation juste en refusant de d\u00e9poser en son nom un grief pour discrimination, contestant son cong\u00e9diement (la \u00ab plainte de manquement au DRJ \u00bb).\n[10] L\u2019article 37 du CCT est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nIl est interdit au syndicat, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 ses repr\u00e9sentants, d\u2019agir de mani\u00e8re arbitraire ou discriminatoire ou de mauvaise foi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation dans l\u2019exercice des droits reconnus \u00e0 ceux-ci par la convention collective.\n[11] Le plaignant a demand\u00e9 que le CCRI statue sur la plainte de manquement au DRJ (l\u2019\u00ab instance devant le CCRI \u00bb) et a affirm\u00e9 que, en refusant de d\u00e9poser un grief \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de son cong\u00e9diement, le syndicat ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9 du devoir qu\u2019il avait envers lui au titre de l\u2019article 37 du CCT.\n[12] Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9e semble avoir particip\u00e9 \u00e0 ces instances, la plainte de manquement au DRJ n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une poursuite contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e ni un examen de l\u2019all\u00e9gation du plaignant selon laquelle il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[13] Il semble que le CCRI a fait un examen fond\u00e9 sur le dossier papier dont il \u00e9tait saisi, ayant re\u00e7u des observations de la part du plaignant, du syndicat et de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[14] Le 25 novembre 2014, le CCRI a rejet\u00e9 par \u00e9crit la plainte de manquement au DRJ (la \u00ab d\u00e9cision du CCRI \u00bb).\n[15] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, le CCRI a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que \u00ab [s]elon l\u2019article 37, le Conseil a pour r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuer le comportement du syndicat et le processus d\u00e9cisionnel dans le cadre du traitement d\u2019une affaire et non pas le bien-fond\u00e9 du grief \u00bb.\n[16] La d\u00e9cision du CCRI est d\u00e9finitive.\nB. La plainte relative aux droits de la personne\n[17] Le 16 novembre 2014, en vertu des articles et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb), le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne, selon laquelle il aurait fait l\u2019objet, de la part de son employeur, de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience (la \u00ab plainte \u00bb).\n[18] Le 20 avril 2015, lors du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa r\u00e9ponse aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 que la plainte soit rejet\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 41(1)d) de la LCDP. Selon elle, les questions soulev\u00e9es par le plaignant auraient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par le CCRI dans sa d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure.\n[19] Le 5 avril 2016, la Commission a rejet\u00e9 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et a produit, au titre de l\u2019article 41(1) de la LCDP, un rapport (le \u00ab Rapport \u00bb) recommandant que la plainte fasse l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate devant le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb). Dans le Rapport, la Commission a conclu que le CCRI :\n[Traduction]\nne s\u2019est pench\u00e9 que sur la question de savoir si le syndicat du plaignant avait manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son devoir de repr\u00e9sentation juste auquel il \u00e9tait tenu en vertu de l\u2019article 37 du CCT et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00fbment saisi des all\u00e9gations relatives aux droits de la personne formul\u00e9es par le plaignant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, la teneur de la plainte n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e. Compte tenu de tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, la justice exige que la Commission instruise la plainte.\n[20] La Commission a ent\u00e9rin\u00e9 le Rapport (la \u00ab d\u00e9cision de la Commission \u00bb) et a avis\u00e9 les parties qu\u2019elles disposaient de 30 jours pour demander la r\u00e9vision judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission.\n[21] Aucune des parties n\u2019a demand\u00e9 la r\u00e9vision judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission.\n[22] Par lettre dat\u00e9e du 28 juin 2016, la Commission a saisi le Tribunal de la plainte.\n[23] Le 22 d\u00e9cembre 2016, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions expliquant sa plainte en d\u00e9tail.\n[24] Le 17 janvier 2017, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions dans lequel elle a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la plainte et a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 (entre autres choses) que la plainte constituait un abus de proc\u00e9dure. L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est en outre r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire rejeter la plainte pour ce motif.\n[25] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 31 janvier 2017, le plaignant a ni\u00e9 que la plainte constituait un abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[26] Dans une lettre envoy\u00e9e au Tribunal le 3 f\u00e9vrier 2017, la Commission (qui ne participe pas \u00e0 l\u2019audience relative \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire, mais qui s\u2019est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit de participer au processus pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience) a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal qu\u2019elle souhaitait formuler des observations quant \u00e0 la requ\u00eate propos\u00e9e, qui vise \u00e0 faire rejeter la plainte d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure. La Commission a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 que cette requ\u00eate en rejet soit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e comme question pr\u00e9liminaire, et non pas \u00e0 l\u2019audience finale, pour que la Commission puisse avoir l\u2019occasion de formuler des observations.\n[27] Le 8 f\u00e9vrier 2017, le Tribunal a \u00e9crit aux parties pour demander que l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9sente sa requ\u00eate en rejet \u00e0 titre de requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire.\n[28] Le 24 mars 2017, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte (la \u00ab requ\u00eate \u00bb).\nC. La requ\u00eate en rejet\n(i) La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[29] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plainte devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e pour les motifs suivants :\ni. Elle fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e,\nou, subsidiairement :\ni. Elle constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure et\/ou\nii. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une contestation incidente de la d\u00e9cision du CCRI.\n[30] Subsidiairement encore, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que les conclusions de fait tir\u00e9es par le CCRI lient le Tribunal et qu\u2019il devrait \u00eatre interdit aux parties de contester ces conclusions devant le Tribunal.\n(ii) La position du plaignant\n[31] Le plaignant affirme que la requ\u00eate n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e, et ce, pour les raisons suivantes :\ni. Les questions dont le Tribunal est saisi sont diff\u00e9rentes de celles dont le CCRI \u00e9tait saisi;\nii. Les parties devant le Tribunal sont diff\u00e9rentes de celles qui ont comparu devant le CCRI;\n[32] Le plaignant affirme de plus que le Tribunal n\u2019est pas li\u00e9 par les conclusions tir\u00e9es dans une instance ant\u00e9rieure, car :\ni. Aucun pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent ne justifie de faire cela en l\u2019absence d\u2019une conclusion selon laquelle les doctrines de pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e ou d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure s\u2019appliquent;\nii. Si c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas, des renseignements hors contexte pourraient \u00eatre introduits d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui nuirait \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate du Tribunal;\niii. Lors de l\u2019instance devant le CCRI, des questions de fait n\u2019ont peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e9t\u00e9 convenablement examin\u00e9es dans le but de trancher la plainte relative aux droits de la personne du plaignant;\niv. Il va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de trancher des questions relatives aux droits de la personne sans avoir eu l\u2019avantage d\u2019entendre les t\u00e9moignages de vive voix.\n(iii) La position de la Commission\n[33] La Commission a souscrit \u00e0 la position du plaignant et a affirm\u00e9 que :\ni. La requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est une contestation indirecte de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission;\nii. Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas li\u00e9 par les conclusions de fait du CCRI. Ces conclusions ou ces propos doivent \u00eatre trait\u00e9s par le Tribunal comme \u00e9tant du ou\u00ef-dire.\nII. LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE\nA. Le Tribunal a-t-il comp\u00e9tence pour rejeter une plainte par voie de requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire?\nB. La plainte devrait-elle \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e par application des doctrines suivantes qui consacrent le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des d\u00e9cisions judiciaires :\na. Contestation indirecte;\nb. Pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e;\nc. Abus de proc\u00e9dure?\nC. Quelle incidence, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, les conclusions de fait tir\u00e9es lors d\u2019une instance ant\u00e9rieure devraient-elles avoir lorsqu\u2019il est question de trancher la plainte?\nIII. LE DROIT\nA. La comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal\n[34] Les instances devant le Tribunal sont men\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la LCDP. L\u2019article 50(2) de la LCDP dispose :\n[Le membre instructeur] tranche les questions de droit et les questions de fait dans les affaires dont il est saisi en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie.\nIl est bien reconnu que le Tribunal a le pouvoir de rejeter une plainte \u00e0 une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire (Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 CF 81 (\u00ab Cremasco \u00bb), confirm\u00e9e dans Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 CAF 363, aux paragraphes 14-15; Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 445 (\u00ab SSEFPNC \u00bb), au paragraphe 140; Bezoine c. la ville d\u2019Ottawa, 2017 TCDP 2, aux paragraphes 33-39). Toutefois, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a mis en garde contre le fait de rejeter une plainte sans tenir une audience compl\u00e8te, sauf dans \u00ab les cas les plus clairs \u00bb (SSEFPNC, au paragraphe 140).\n[35] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour trancher la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate \u00e0 ce stade.\nB. Les doctrines consacrant le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des d\u00e9cisions judiciaires\n[36] Les doctrines consacrant le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des d\u00e9cisions judiciaires que sont la contestation indirecte, la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e et l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure pour remise en cause d\u00e9coulent de l\u2019un des principes les plus fondamentaux de la common law : une question, une fois tranch\u00e9e par une cour ou un tribunal comp\u00e9tent, ne peut pas \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e de nouveau, sauf dans le cadre d\u2019un appel ou d\u2019une r\u00e9vision judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision initiale. Ce principe est parfois formul\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on axiomatique, de la fa\u00e7on suivante : \u00ab une personne ne devrait \u00eatre tracass\u00e9e qu\u2019une seule fois \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une m\u00eame cause d\u2019action \u00bb.\n[37] Les valeurs jumelles que sont le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 sont au c\u0153ur de ces doctrines et elles doivent jouer de mani\u00e8re \u00e9gale, aucune ne doit \u00e9clipser l\u2019autre. Ce point a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada (la \u00ab CSC \u00bb) dans le cadre de son examen des doctrines consacrant le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des d\u00e9cisions judiciaires dans Colombie\u2011Britannique (Workers' Compensation Board) c. Figliola, 2011 CSC 52 (\u00ab Figliola \u00bb). La juge Abella a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\nToutes ces questions visent \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab a \u00e9t\u00e9 statu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e \u00bb sur le fond de la plainte. Il s\u2019agit, en d\u00e9finitive, de se demander s\u2019il est logique de consacrer des ressources publiques et priv\u00e9es \u00e0 la remise en cause de ce qui est essentiellement le m\u00eame litige. (paragraphe 37)\n[38] \u00c0 de nombreux \u00e9gards, l\u2019application des doctrines consacrant le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des d\u00e9cisions judiciaires est un exercice hautement discr\u00e9tionnaire, qui repose sur les besoins de la justice substantielle et de la justice proc\u00e9durale. La Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans Danyluk c. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., 2001 CSC 44 (\u00ab Danyluk \u00bb), et elle a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9, \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9, dans Penner c. Niagara (Commission r\u00e9gionale de services policiers), 2013 CSC 19 (\u00ab Penner \u00bb): \u00ab qu\u2019[u]ne doctrine \u00e9labor\u00e9e par les tribunaux dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice ne devrait pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e m\u00e9caniquement et donner lieu \u00e0 une injustice \u00bb (Danyluk, au paragraphe 1; Penner, au paragraphe 30).\n[39] Dans la requ\u00eate dont je suis saisie, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que la d\u00e9cision du CCRI selon laquelle le Syndicat s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 de l\u2019obligation de repr\u00e9sentation juste auquel il \u00e9tait tenu envers le plaignant portait sur la m\u00eame question que celle dont le Tribunal est saisi dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente enqu\u00eate. Le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif de la d\u00e9cision du CCRI n\u2019est pas compromis par l\u2019examen de la plainte par le Tribunal.\n[40] En l\u2019absence d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant que la m\u00eame question a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e dans une instance ant\u00e9rieure, les doctrines du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des d\u00e9cisions judiciaires, de la contestation indirecte, de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant pour une question tranch\u00e9e et de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure par remise en cause sont peu pertinentes.\n[41] J\u2019estime qu\u2019il est possible qu\u2019une conclusion de fait ant\u00e9rieur lie un processus d\u00e9cisionnel ult\u00e9rieur par application de la doctrine du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des d\u00e9cisions judiciaires, mais je ne rel\u00e8ve pas suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour justifier de rendre \u00e0 ce stade une ordonnance en ce sens. De plus, je ne suis pas convaincue que les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice ou la cause de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 seraient servis par l\u2019imposition d\u2019une telle limite \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de l\u2019enqu\u00eate du Tribunal sur la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[42] Examinons maintenant plus en d\u00e9tail chacune des doctrines invoqu\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate.\n(i) Attaque indirecte\n[43] La doctrine de la contestation indirecte a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9e par la CSC dans Wilson c. La Reine, [1983] 2 RCS 594, \u00e0 la page 599 :\nSelon un principe fondamental \u00e9tabli depuis longtemps, une ordonnance rendue par une cour comp\u00e9tente est valide, concluante et a force ex\u00e9cutoire, \u00e0 moins d'\u00eatre infirm\u00e9e en appel ou l\u00e9galement annul\u00e9e. De plus, la jurisprudence \u00e9tablit tr\u00e8s clairement qu'une telle ordonnance ne peut faire l'objet d'une attaque indirecte; l'attaque indirecte peut \u00eatre d\u00e9crite comme une attaque dans le cadre de proc\u00e9dures autres que celles visant pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 obtenir l'infirmation, la modification ou l'annulation de l'ordonnance ou du jugement. (Wilson, \u00e0 la page 599)\n[44] Il ne faut pas confondre l\u2019attaque indirecte avec la remise en cause de questions de fait d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9es dans le cadre d\u2019une ordonnance (Toronto (Ville) c. S.C.F.P., section locale 79, 2003 CSC 63 (\u00ab SCFP \u00bb), au paragraphe 33; Garland c. Consumers' Gas Co., 2004 CSC 25, au paragraphe 71). Il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t d\u2019une doctrine qui interdit la contestation d\u2019une ordonnance ou de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une ordonnance.\n[45] Si une ordonnance ult\u00e9rieure ne constitue pas une attaque indirecte contre une ordonnance d\u00e9finitive, ou repr\u00e9sente une tentative d\u2019emp\u00eacher l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une ordonnance, alors la doctrine de l\u2019attaque indirecte ne trouve pas application (Donald J. Lange, The Doctrine of Res Judicata in Canada, 4e \u00e9d.

Une pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e peut \u00eatre cr\u00e9\u00e9e par une instance o\u00f9 les conditions pr\u00e9alables suivantes sont satisfaites :\ni. la d\u00e9cision judiciaire invoqu\u00e9e comme cr\u00e9ant la pr\u00e9clusion est d\u00e9finitive;\nii. la m\u00eame question a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e dans l\u2019instance ant\u00e9rieure;\niii. les parties dans la d\u00e9cision judiciaire invoqu\u00e9e, ou leurs ayants droit, sont les m\u00eames que les parties engag\u00e9es dans l\u2019affaire o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9clusion est soulev\u00e9e, ou leurs ayants droit.

La doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure s\u2019applique lorsqu\u2019une partie, insatisfaite du r\u00e9sultat obtenu devant un d\u00e9cideur, tente d\u2019obtenir un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent dans un autre forum et que cela occasionne aux parties un gaspillage de temps et de ressources et nuit \u00e0 la bonne administration de la justice (Danyluk, au paragraphe 20; SCFP, aux paragraphes 37, 51).\n[68] Lorsqu\u2019elle a examin\u00e9 si la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure s\u2019appliquait (dans le contexte, toutefois, d\u2019un cadre l\u00e9gislatif diff\u00e9rent), la CSC, dans Figliola, a confirm\u00e9 plusieurs principes cl\u00e9s qui doivent \u00eatre pris en compte dans l\u2019analyse de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019\u00e9conomie des ressources judiciaires, la coh\u00e9rence, le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des instances et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019administration de la justice (Figliola, au paragraphe 33; SCFP, au paragraphe 37).\n[69] La d\u00e9cision portant sur la question de savoir si la tenue d\u2019une instance ult\u00e9rieure constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure est de nature discr\u00e9tionnaire.\n[70] Dans Penner, la CSC a donn\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions quant \u00e0 l\u2019application discr\u00e9tionnaire de la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant de la question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e et de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de faire preuve de souplesse et, dans SCFP, la CSC a confirm\u00e9 que les facteurs discr\u00e9tionnaires relatifs \u00e0 la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e s\u2019appliquent \u00e9galement \u00e0 la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure (SCFP, au paragraphe 53)\n[71] La CSC a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que les consid\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 requises s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 la conduite de l\u2019instance ant\u00e9rieure et \u00e0 l\u2019examen de la question de savoir si la tenue d\u2019une instance ant\u00e9rieure peut emp\u00eacher que soient d\u00e9battus, dans une instance ult\u00e9rieure, des faits ou des conclusions connexes.\nDe mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les facteurs relev\u00e9s dans la jurisprudence montrent que l\u2019iniquit\u00e9 peut se manifester de deux fa\u00e7ons principales qui se chevauchent et ne s\u2019excluent pas l\u2019une l\u2019autre.

[soulignement ajout\u00e9] (Penner, au paragraphe 39)\n[72] J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que la d\u00e9cision du CCRI ne portait pas sur la plainte du plaignant ou ne tentait pas de r\u00e9gler celle-ci. Le CCRI a express\u00e9ment d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne tentait pas de faire cela.\n[73] Bien que les documents dont je suis saisie dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate soient quelque peu incomplets \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, il ne semble pas que les parties \u00e0 l\u2019instance devant le CCRI ou le Conseil aient examin\u00e9 ou trait\u00e9 le grief pour discrimination sous-jacent. Compte tenu de l\u2019objet et de la port\u00e9e d\u2019une instance fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 37, les parties ne pouvaient pas non plus avoir raisonnablement conclu que la d\u00e9cision du CCRI trancherait l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination de la part de l\u2019employeur formul\u00e9e par le plaignant.\n[74] Bien que la plainte de manquement au DRJ et la plainte d\u00e9coulent d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments factuels qui se recoupent, les deux instances ne portent pas sur les m\u00eames questions et n\u2019engagent pas les m\u00eames parties.\n[75] Une d\u00e9cision future du Tribunal concernant le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte ne risque pas de trancher de nouveau les questions tranch\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision du CCRI, et toute d\u00e9cision concernant la discrimination de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e subie (ou non) par le plaignant ne risque pas non plus de miner la d\u00e9cision du CCRI; il n\u2019y a donc pas vraiment lieu de s\u2019inqui\u00e9ter concernant le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif et la coh\u00e9rence des d\u00e9cisions ou l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019administration de la justice en ce qui concerne l\u2019instance devant le CCRI et l\u2019instance devant le Tribunal.\n[76] En raison de la nature distincte des deux instances, je conclus \u00e9galement que, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019y a pas vraiment lieu de s\u2019inqui\u00e9ter quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9conomie des ressources judiciaires. Toute perte de ressources judiciaires occasionn\u00e9e par l\u2019examen par le Tribunal des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui faisaient partie de la d\u00e9cision du CCRI est contrebalanc\u00e9e par l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment plus important qui consiste \u00e0 veiller \u00e0 ce que la plainte fasse l\u2019objet d\u2019une audience compl\u00e8te et \u00e9quitable sur le plan de la proc\u00e9dure. Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je conclus que la plainte ne constitue pas un abus de proc\u00e9dure.\nC. Conclusions de fait ant\u00e9rieures\n[77] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soul\u00e8ve un argument subsidiaire selon lequel certaines conclusions de fait tir\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision du CCRI lient le Tribunal, et que le plaignant devrait \u00eatre emp\u00each\u00e9 de soulever ces questions dans une audience devant le Tribunal.\n[78] Pour tirer une telle conclusion, il faudrait que le Tribunal soit convaincu que les int\u00e9r\u00eats de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de l\u2019administration de la justice sont mieux servis par l\u2019exclusion \u00e0 l\u2019audience de certains volets d\u2019enqu\u00eate.\n[79] Selon moi, limiter de cette fa\u00e7on la port\u00e9e de l\u2019audience serait une mesure inhabituelle, mais non sans pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent (Davidson c. Sant\u00e9 Canada, 2012 TCDP 1, au paragraphe 16 (\u00ab Davidson \u00bb)).\n[80] Bien que je sois d\u2019accord avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour affirmer que le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour rendre une telle ordonnance lorsqu\u2019une remise en cause de faits d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tablis constituerait un abus de proc\u00e9dure, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord pour affirmer qu\u2019un r\u00e9examen des faits constitue n\u00e9cessairement un abus de proc\u00e9dure. De plus, pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s en d\u00e9tail ci-dessous, et compte tenu des faits dont je suis saisie, j\u2019estime que, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il ne serait pas dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice de rendre une telle ordonnance.\n(i) Les arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[81] En formulant son argument subsidiaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9e invoque trois affaires \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son argument selon lequel le plaignant devrait \u00eatre emp\u00each\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels le CCRI a tir\u00e9 une conclusion de fait. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019une remise en cause de faits qui ont fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une conclusion de la part du CCRI constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure et qu\u2019elle devrait \u00eatre interdite par le Tribunal.\n[82] L\u2019intim\u00e9e invoque OC Transpo v A.T.U., Local 279, [2005] 142 L.A.C. (4th) 343 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa requ\u00eate. Dans cette affaire, un tribunal d\u2019arbitrage a conclu qu\u2019une remise en cause de conclusions de fait d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une instance p\u00e9nale ant\u00e9rieure constituerait un abus de proc\u00e9dure. Il semble que dans cette affaire chacune des instances d\u00e9cisionnelles examinait la m\u00eame conduite relativement \u00e0 la m\u00eame partie, mais \u00e0 travers un prisme juridique diff\u00e9rent et en appliquant une norme de preuve diff\u00e9rente.\n[83] Le tribunal d\u2019arbitrage a relev\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on toute particuli\u00e8re les propos tenus par la CSC dans SCFP et selon lesquels une conclusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une instance ant\u00e9rieure vigoureusement d\u00e9battue devrait faire l\u2019objet de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\n[84] Dans In re George Brown, 1644-13-M OLRB, 2014 CanLII 38605 (ON LRB), la Commission des relations de travail de l\u2019Ontario (la \u00ab CRTO \u00bb) a examin\u00e9 la question de savoir si elle devait adopter les conclusions de fait tir\u00e9es par les m\u00eames parties devant un arbitre en relations de travail interpr\u00e9tant un article diff\u00e9rent, mais connexe, de la Loi sur les relations de travail (la \u00ab LRT \u00bb). S\u2019il est vrai que la CRTO examinait diff\u00e9rents paragraphes de l\u2019article 5 de la LRT, elle a n\u00e9anmoins conclu que, dans le contexte particulier de l\u2019affaire, des conclusions contradictoires visant les m\u00eames parties dans le cadre de questions connexes [traduction] \u00ab porteraient atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de relations de travail \u00bb.\n[85] Dans Davidson, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 s\u2019il devrait \u00eatre saisi de la preuve relative \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 d\u2019un processus de s\u00e9lection qui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tait fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une instance devant le Comit\u00e9 d\u2019appel de la Commission de la Fonction publique (le \u00ab CACFP \u00bb). Une fois encore, le Tribunal a conclu que l\u2019affaire en cause dans la deuxi\u00e8me instance avait fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un processus rigoureux et avait fait l\u2019objet de deux appels dans le cadre desquels l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du traitement du plaignant dans le processus de s\u00e9lection avait \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e.\n[86] Le Tribunal, dans Davidson, a conclu que les all\u00e9gations d\u2019iniquit\u00e9 en cause avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es et avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es par le CACFP. Le Tribunal a conclu que les documents en question avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9s et re\u00e7us et le membre a conclu que la tenue d\u2019un nouvel examen ne constituerait pas, dans ce cas, une utilisation judicieuse des ressources judiciaires.\n(ii) Les arguments du plaignant\n[87] Le plaignant soutient que les conclusions du CCRI ont, en fait, \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9es dans un autre but l\u00e9gislatif, en l\u2019absence de certaines protections d\u2019ordre proc\u00e9dural dont dispose le Tribunal, et n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9es dans le contexte d\u2019une analyse relative aux droits de la personne. Le plaignant ajoute qu\u2019il serait in\u00e9quitable de s'inspirer de conclusions tir\u00e9es par une autre instance.\n[88] Le plaignant n\u2019a cit\u00e9 aucun pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses arguments.\n(iii) Les arguments de la Commission\n[89] La Commission n\u2019a trait\u00e9 de cette question que de mani\u00e8re incidente et a affirm\u00e9 que les conclusions du CCRI sont des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019un tribunal peut prendre en compte et qui doivent se voir accorder le m\u00eame poids que du ou\u00ef-dire, mais elle ne renvoie \u00e0 aucune jurisprudence \u00e9tayant cette affirmation.\n(iv) Analyse\n[90] Dans chacune des affaires invoqu\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019instance d\u00e9cisionnelle qui rend une ordonnance visant \u00e0 interdire la remise en cause de certains faits a conclu, compte tenu des faits dont elle \u00e9tait saisie, qu\u2019une remise en cause serait in\u00e9quitable et risquerait de miner l\u2019administration de la justice.\n[91] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, la question essentielle dont le CCRI \u00e9tait saisi est fondamentalement diff\u00e9rente de celle dont le Tribunal est saisi. De plus, les deux instances comportent des diff\u00e9rences fondamentales qui doivent \u00eatre soupes\u00e9es lorsqu\u2019on examine l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 des conclusions tir\u00e9es dans le contexte du CCRI \u00e0 l\u2019exercice d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des faits men\u00e9 devant le Tribunal, comme les objectifs l\u00e9gislatifs diff\u00e9rents, les questions juridiques diff\u00e9rentes, les garanties proc\u00e9durales disparates et m\u00eames les parties diff\u00e9rentes qui sont vis\u00e9es par chacune des instances.\n[92] Aucune des affaires invoqu\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne dit qu\u2019une remise en cause des faits examin\u00e9s dans une instance ant\u00e9rieure ne peut pas \u00eatre faite devant une autre instance d\u00e9cisionnelle lorsqu\u2019il serait dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice de le faire. La doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure est un outil qui vise \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer l\u2019administration de la justice, et ne devrait pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour commettre une injustice.\n[93] L\u2019application de la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure pour remise en cause est hautement discr\u00e9tionnaire et exige un examen minutieux des faits en cause dans l\u2019instance.\n[94] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il me semble que plus les diff\u00e9rences entre les deux instances sont grandes, moins l\u2019instance ult\u00e9rieure devrait \u00eatre li\u00e9e par l\u2019instance ant\u00e9rieure.\n[95] Toute application de la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure aux faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce devrait faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une analyse des facteurs de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans Danyluk. Compte tenu de ce dont je suis saisie \u00e0 ce stade, les questions suivantes me pr\u00e9occupent particuli\u00e8rement :\ni. Les objectifs l\u00e9gislatifs diff\u00e9rents vis\u00e9s par une formation qui rend une d\u00e9cision en vertu de l\u2019article 37 et le Tribunal;\nii. Les garanties proc\u00e9durales diff\u00e9rentes dont disposent les parties dans chacune des instances;\niii. La qualit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et sur lesquels on s\u2019est fi\u00e9 dans chacune des instances;\niv. L\u2019expertise de la formation du CCRI en mati\u00e8re d\u2019examen de questions relatives aux droits de la personne;\nv. Le caract\u00e8re potentiellement in\u00e9quitable de la d\u00e9cision du CCRI limitant la port\u00e9e de l\u2019examen de la plainte par le Tribunal.\n[96] Je ne suis pas convaincue \u00e0 ce stade qu\u2019il serait dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice de limiter les faits \u00e0 prendre en compte \u00e0 l\u2019audience relative \u00e0 la plainte. Toutefois, je n\u2019exclus pas la possibilit\u00e9 de tirer une telle conclusion \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re d\u2019un tableau factuel plus complet.\n[97] Bien que je ne trouve aucune raison d\u2019accueillir la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour le moment, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de trancher \u2013 dans le contexte de l\u2019instruction de la plainte \u2013 toute question relative \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des faits soulev\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente enqu\u00eate et au poids qu\u2019il convient de leur accorder.\nIV. D\u00c9CISION\n[98] Compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble des facteurs susmentionn\u00e9s, je ne suis pas convaincue que les questions dont le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on ad\u00e9quate dans une instance ant\u00e9rieure. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019estime que rien ne justifie d\u2019appliquer la doctrine du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif pour rejeter la plainte.\n[99] Bien qu\u2019il y ait un certain chevauchement entre les faits qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis au CCRI dans le cadre de son examen de la plainte de manquement au DRJ et les faits qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis au Tribunal, compte tenu de la preuve et des arguments qui m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, j\u2019estime qu\u2019\u00e0 ce stade de l\u2019instance il n\u2019y a pas de motifs suffisants pour justifier que je fasse droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e visant \u00e0 emp\u00eacher les parties de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve relativement \u00e0 des questions de fait qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es par le CCRI.\n[100] J\u2019estime que faire obstacle \u00e0 toute enqu\u00eate possible \u00e0 ce stade ne servirait pas les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice.\n[101] Par cons\u00e9quent, je rejette la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e visant \u00e0 faire rejeter la plainte.\n[102] Je rejette \u00e9galement \u00e0 ce stade de l\u2019instance la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e visant \u00e0 faire circonscrire l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur les faits.\nSign\u00e9 par\nKirsten Mercer\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 10 juillet 2017\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du Tribunal : T2160\/3416\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Jamison Todd c.

Introduction\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision concerne deux plaintes distinctes dat\u00e9es du 13 avril 2012 et d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par M. Keith Waddle (le plaignant) devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la CCDP). Selon ces plaintes, les intim\u00e9s, le Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique (le CFCP ou l\u2019employeur) et la Conf\u00e9rence ferroviaire de Teamsters Canada (la CFTC ou le syndicat) auraient fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, dans le cadre de son emploi, en raison d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience et de sa situation de famille.\n[2] Le 30 juillet 2014, en application de l\u2019article 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985), ch. H-6 (LCDP), la CCDP a demand\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire les plaintes. Les deux plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jointes, puisqu\u2019elles portaient essentiellement sur les m\u00eames questions de fait et de droit (la plainte).\n[3] Le plaignant, par le truchement de l\u2019avocat qui le repr\u00e9sentait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, pr\u00e9sentant sa plainte de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9taill\u00e9e. Les intim\u00e9s ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 chacun une r\u00e9ponse. Le plaignant a comparu \u00e0 l\u2019audience, o\u00f9 il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9, accompagn\u00e9 au d\u00e9part par son avocat, mais assurant ensuite sa propre repr\u00e9sentation. Le plaignant a \u00e9galement appel\u00e9 un expert \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner en sa faveur. Les deux intim\u00e9s, accompagn\u00e9s de leurs avocats, ont eux aussi comparu \u00e0 l\u2019audience et appel\u00e9 plusieurs personnes \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. La CCDP n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l\u2019audience et elle n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019arguments.\nII. D\u00e9cision\n[4] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-dessous, j\u2019estime qu\u2019aucune preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille du plaignant n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des intim\u00e9s et cette partie de la plainte est, par cons\u00e9quent, rejet\u00e9e.\n[5] Mais, pour les motifs ci-dessous expos\u00e9s, je consid\u00e8re que le plaignant a, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de chacun des intim\u00e9s, produit des preuves prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience. Cela dit, les restrictions impos\u00e9es \u00e0 son emploi reposaient sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e (EPJ) et, sans s\u2019imposer de contrainte excessive, l\u2019employeur a pris les mesures d\u2019adaptation n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du plaignant. La plainte en discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience est donc rejet\u00e9e.\nIII. Questions en litige\n1. Le plaignant a-t-il produit, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du CFCP, des preuves prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille aux termes de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP?\n2. Le plaignant a-t-il produit \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du CFCP des preuves prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience aux termes de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP?\n3. Le plaignant a-t-il produit \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la CFTC des preuves prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille aux termes de l\u2019article 10 de la LCDP?\n4. Le plaignant a-t-il produit \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la CFTC des preuves prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience aux termes de l\u2019article 10 de la LCDP?\n5. Dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 le plaignant produit des preuves prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience, les intim\u00e9s, ou l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre d\u2019entre eux, peuvent-ils d\u00e9montrer que les restrictions dont il est fait \u00e9tat dans la plainte reposaient sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e?\na. La restriction impos\u00e9e au travail du plaignant l\u2019a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 dans un but entretenant un lien rationnel avec l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions?\nb. La restriction en cause a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser un but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail?\nc. La restriction en cause \u00e9tait-elle raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire dans la mesure o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait sans cela impossible de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du plaignant sans imposer \u00e0 l\u2019employeur une contrainte excessive au plan de la sant\u00e9, de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et du co\u00fbt?\nd. La CFTC intim\u00e9e a-t-elle, conform\u00e9ment aux obligations qui lui incombaient en tant que tierce partie au processus d\u2019adaptation, et sans s\u2019imposer de contrainte excessive, pris des mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du plaignant?\n6. Le plaignant a-t-il, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, pris des mesures raisonnables pour faciliter le processus d\u2019adaptation?\nIV. Les faits\n[6] Le plaignant est entr\u00e9 au CFCP en 1986. En 2011, il occupait les fonctions de m\u00e9canicien de locomotive (ML) \u00e0 la gare du CFCP \u00e0 Lethbridge (Alberta) (la gare d\u2019attache) et \u00e9tait membre de la CFTC intim\u00e9e. Ses fonctions consistaient \u00e0 conduire des trains entre sa gare d\u2019attache et diverses autres gares du sud de l\u2019Alberta (les gares de d\u00e9tachement).\n[7] En 2011, le plaignant travaillait en service non assign\u00e9. Cela veut dire qu\u2019il devait, pendant ses horaires de travail, \u00eatre disponible en attente d\u2019un coup de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone qui lui signalerait, avec au moins deux heures de pr\u00e9avis, le d\u00e9but de son service. Il devait alors, \u00e0 l\u2019heure voulue, conduire un train vers une gare de d\u00e9tachement. Apr\u00e8s 12 heures de service, il avait droit \u00e0 8 heures de repos, apr\u00e8s quoi il devait \u00eatre \u00e0 nouveau disponible en attendant d\u2019avoir \u00e0 assurer un retour \u00e0 la gare d\u2019attache, trajet pouvant durer jusqu\u2019\u00e0 12 heures.\n[8] Le plaignant a eu, alors qu\u2019il travaillait pour le CFCP, plusieurs probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9dicaux, y compris des douleurs au cou et \u00e0 la colonne vert\u00e9brale, et de l\u2019arthrose au genou. Ces troubles m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9taient connus du service S\u00e9curit\u00e9 et sant\u00e9 au travail (SST) du CFCP depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, mais n\u2019avaient pas emp\u00each\u00e9 le plaignant d\u2019exercer les fonctions de ML en service non assign\u00e9. En 2010 cependant, le plaignant \u00e9prouvait d\u00e9j\u00e0 des troubles du sommeil plus prononc\u00e9s et ressentait, en attendant son affectation, une anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 croissante. C\u2019est pour cela qu\u2019en 2010, il s\u2019est 59 fois d\u00e9clar\u00e9 m\u00e9dicalement inapte au service, et 33 fois dans la premi\u00e8re moiti\u00e9 de 2011. Il a \u00e9galement fait savoir \u00e0 son m\u00e9decin qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait, \u00e0 deux ou trois reprises, endormi aux commandes d\u2019un train.\n[9] Selon son t\u00e9moignage constant et malgr\u00e9 son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, le plaignant pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait demeurer en service non assign\u00e9 en tant que ML attach\u00e9 \u00e0 la gare de Lethbridge. S\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ML en service assign\u00e9, il aurait en effet eu un horaire de travail r\u00e9gulier \u00e0 la gare de Lethbridge, sans p\u00e9riode de disponibilit\u00e9 au service.\n[10] Le CFCP a produit des t\u00e9moignages, que n\u2019ont contest\u00e9s ni la CFTC ni le plaignant, selon lesquels les fonctions de ML exerc\u00e9es par le plaignant \u00e9taient essentielles \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. S\u2019agissant de fonctions essentielles \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, tout manquement d\u00fb \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du titulaire risque d\u2019entra\u00eener un incident affectant la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s, du public et des biens, ou l\u2019environnement.\n[11] Le 11 avril 2011, le plaignant a consult\u00e9 une experte m\u00e9dicale, sp\u00e9cialiste agr\u00e9\u00e9e en m\u00e9decine du sommeil, et m\u00e9decin-conseil en ce domaine (la sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil). D\u2019apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant et de la sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil, t\u00e9moin expert appel\u00e9 par le plaignant, ce dernier ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas entretenu avec cette sp\u00e9cialiste des conditions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de travail ou des divers autres postes qui pourraient lui \u00eatre confi\u00e9s au CFCP, et la sp\u00e9cialiste n\u2019\u00e9tait gu\u00e8re au courant de la mani\u00e8re dont fonctionne un chemin de fer. Le plaignant avait simplement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil de recommander \u00e0 l\u2019employeur qu\u2019on le maintienne dans ses fonctions de ML en service non assign\u00e9, \u00e0 condition de ne lui transmettre les appels au travail qu\u2019entre 5 h et 17 h. Il a demand\u00e9 cet horaire parce qu\u2019il en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait lorsque, plusieurs ann\u00e9es auparavant, il \u00e9tait bas\u00e9 \u00e0 la gare de Calgary et que cette plage horaire s\u2019appliquait aux appels au travail de tous les ML en service non assign\u00e9.\n[12] Ayant diagnostiqu\u00e9 chez le plaignant des troubles du rythme circadien, la sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil a recommand\u00e9, avec mise \u00e0 l\u2019essai pendant trois mois, que l\u2019on ne transmette des appels de travail au plaignant qu\u2019entre 5 h \u00e0 17 h. Selon le t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle a livr\u00e9, la sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil a fait cette recommandation sans conna\u00eetre les diverses autres solutions auxquelles le plaignant aurait pu recourir, et sans savoir non plus que cette plage horaire applicable aux appels n\u2019excluait pas que le plaignant ait n\u00e9anmoins \u00e0 assurer la conduite d\u2019un train pendant la nuit. Elle a fait cette recommandation \u00e0 la demande du plaignant.\n[13] Le 20 juin 2011, le service de SST a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil de pr\u00e9ciser que le plaignant \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 travailler 12 heures d\u2019affil\u00e9e, et \u00e0 travailler apr\u00e8s 17 h, dans la mesure o\u00f9 son affectation lui \u00e9tait signal\u00e9e avant 17 h. La sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il en \u00e9tait effectivement ainsi. Le m\u00e9decin-chef (MC) a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir pris connaissance du rapport de la sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil, des pr\u00e9cisions qu\u2019elle avait apport\u00e9es et du dossier m\u00e9dical faisant \u00e9tat des autres troubles \u00e9prouv\u00e9s par le plaignant, Sant\u00e9 et s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail a rempli un formulaire d\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019aptitude au travail (FEAT) confirmant que le plaignant pouvait continuer \u00e0 exercer les fonctions de ML, fonctions essentielles \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, \u00e9tant apte au travail dans la mesure o\u00f9 il recevait sa convocation entre 5 h et 17 h, et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait capable de travailler 12 heures d\u2019affil\u00e9e, sans autre restriction.\n[14] Sant\u00e9 et s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail a envoy\u00e9 le FEAT au comit\u00e9 de retour au travail (CRAT) du CFCP qui devait alors examiner les mesures d\u2019adaptation qui s\u2019imposeraient. Le 6 juillet 2011, le FEAT et les mesures d\u2019adaptation envisag\u00e9es ont fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une r\u00e9union du CRAT avec le plaignant, un membre du comit\u00e9 appartenant au CFCP, et deux membres de la CFTC (la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union du CRAT).\n[15] Selon le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant, lors de la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union du CRAT, il a demand\u00e9 au CFCP de lui cr\u00e9er un poste de ML en service non assign\u00e9 \u00e0 la gare de Lethbridge, les convocations au travail ne pouvant lui \u00eatre transmises qu\u2019entre 5 h et 17 h. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage du CFCP, l\u2019employeur a rejet\u00e9 cette solution, cette plage horaire pour les appels au travail ne pouvant pas s\u2019appliquer dans les gares de d\u00e9tachement, aucun autre employ\u00e9 n\u2019en b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant \u00e0 la garde de Lethbridge.\n[16] D\u2019apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant pensait que ceux qui avaient particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de retour au travail avaient compris que la plage horaire des appels au travail, qui, selon la sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil, ne devaient avoir lieu qu\u2019entre 5 h et 17 h, ne s\u2019appliquerait pas dans les gares de d\u00e9tachement. Il affirme avoir dit au CFCP et \u00e0 la CFTC, lors de la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union du CRAT, qu\u2019il entendait demander qu\u2019un changement soit apport\u00e9 aux restrictions m\u00e9dicales le concernant, afin que la plage horaire des appels le convoquant au travail, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire de 5 h \u00e0 17 h, ne s\u2019applique que dans sa gare d\u2019attache.\n[17] Mais, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union du CRAT, quelle que soit la gare, le plaignant ne devait toujours \u00eatre convoqu\u00e9 au travail qu\u2019entre 5 h \u00e0 17 h, le comit\u00e9 envisagea les diverses autres mesures d\u2019accommodement possibles. Citons \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard l\u2019affectation \u00e0 des travaux de bureau \u2013 solution \u00e9cart\u00e9e, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les difficult\u00e9s de lecture \u00e9prouv\u00e9es par le plaignant; le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement \u2013 solution \u00e9cart\u00e9e, car le plaignant ne souhaitait pas d\u00e9m\u00e9nager; un poste d\u2019ing\u00e9nieur m\u00e9canicien \u2013 solution \u00e9cart\u00e9e, car elle aurait exig\u00e9 de d\u00e9placer un employ\u00e9 ayant plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9; et, enfin, des mesures d\u2019adaptation dans le cadre de ses fonctions actuelles \u2013 solution \u00e9cart\u00e9e, car, en raison de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, le plaignant ne pouvait pas s\u2019en tenir aux horaires en vigueur.\n[18] D\u2019apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage, lors de la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union du CRAT, le plaignant a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ses repr\u00e9sentants syndicaux de pr\u00e9ciser, dans le cadre du plan de retour au travail, que ses obligations familiales excluaient tout d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement. La question du d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement s\u2019est en effet pos\u00e9e dans le cadre du processus d\u2019accommodement, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait \u00e0 Calgary des postes qui auraient pu \u00eatre adapt\u00e9s aux besoins du plaignant. Le premier plan de retour au travail ne dit rien des obligations familiales du plaignant, indiquant simplement qu\u2019il refusait de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le plaignant a soulev\u00e9 une objection \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, estimant que le fait que le formulaire en question n\u2019ait rien dit de ses obligations familiales s\u2019inscrivait dans le cadre d\u2019un calcul visant \u00e0 le contraindre \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager. Les t\u00e9moins appel\u00e9s par la CFTC ont contest\u00e9 cette version des faits. Le Tribunal n\u2019entend pas reprendre en d\u00e9tail la teneur de ce t\u00e9moignage, car le plan de retour au travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9vis\u00e9 par la suite afin de pr\u00e9ciser que le refus du d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement \u00e9tait d\u00fb aux obligations familiales du plaignant, \u00e0 qui l\u2019on n\u2019a finalement pas demand\u00e9 de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager.\n[19] Le plan de retour au travail qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019issue de la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union du CRAT comprenait les restrictions m\u00e9dicales propos\u00e9es par Sant\u00e9 et s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail. Selon ce plan, le plaignant aurait, en tant que ML \u00e0 la gare de Lethbridge, assur\u00e9 en service assign\u00e9 le quart du matin ou le quart de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi. Il n\u2019y aurait donc plus eu de plage horaire pour les convocations au travail, le plaignant effectuant chaque semaine cinq quarts de travail dans les limites qui s\u2019appliquaient \u00e0 son travail \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque.\n[20] Le CFCP intim\u00e9 a produit des t\u00e9moignages au sujet de son refus de cr\u00e9er \u00e0 la gare de Lethbridge un poste qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 unique, en l\u2019occurrence un poste en service non assign\u00e9 pour lequel les appels au travail n\u2019auraient pu \u00eatre transmis au plaignant qu\u2019entre 5 h et 17 h :\na. Cette plage horaire de 5 h \u00e0 17 h pour les appels au travail s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 tous les ML en service non assign\u00e9 de la gare de Calgary, mais n\u2019existait pas \u00e0 Lethbridge;\nb. Il aurait fallu, selon l\u2019heure \u00e0 laquelle \u00e9tait transmis l\u2019appel au travail, demander \u00e0 d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s de se rendre dans une gare de d\u00e9tachement pour assurer le retour de trains dont on avait besoin en dehors de la plage horaire applicable au plaignant;\nc. Un tel horaire de travail aurait cr\u00e9\u00e9 davantage d\u2019incertitude pour les autres employ\u00e9s, y compris le conducteur effectuant le trajet avec le plaignant, car l\u2019instauration de cette plage horaire leur aurait impos\u00e9 une plus longue attente \u00e0 la gare de d\u00e9tachement;\nd. Cette plus grande incertitude quant aux horaires de travail des employ\u00e9s aurait \u00e9ventuellement pu poser des probl\u00e8mes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, le travail qu\u2019ils effectuent \u00e9tant en effet consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme essentiel \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9;\ne. La plage horaire en question aurait vraisemblablement entra\u00een\u00e9 pour le plaignant une perte de revenu, car il n\u2019aurait pas pu effectuer les quarts de travail pour lesquels il aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre contact\u00e9 en dehors de la plage horaire en question. Ces quarts seraient alors confi\u00e9s \u00e0 un ML dont l\u2019horaire de travail n\u2019\u00e9tait pas soumis \u00e0 de telles restrictions.\n[21] Je consid\u00e8re que l\u2019instauration, dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du plaignant, d\u2019une plage horaire de 5 h \u00e0 17 h \u00e0 la gare de Lethbridge aurait entra\u00een\u00e9 pour le CFCP des d\u00e9penses consid\u00e9rables et un risque pour la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des autres employ\u00e9s du CFCP. L\u2019id\u00e9e, propos\u00e9e par le plaignant dans le cadre du processus d\u2019accommodement, selon laquelle la plage horaire des appels au travail ne se serait appliqu\u00e9e qu\u2019\u00e0 la gare d\u2019attache \u2013 et non \u00e0 une gare de d\u00e9tachement \u2013 \u00e9tait m\u00e9dicalement contre-indiqu\u00e9e et ne pouvait pas \u00eatre envisag\u00e9e par Sant\u00e9 et s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les restrictions qu\u2019avait recommand\u00e9 d\u2019adopter la sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil \u00e0 laquelle le plaignant avait fait appel. J\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage livr\u00e9 par le MC du CFCP, selon lequel une restriction m\u00e9dicale, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle est n\u00e9cessaire, doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e sur toute la ligne. Je constate par ailleurs, me basant notamment en cela sur le t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle a livr\u00e9, que la sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil n\u2019aurait pas recommand\u00e9 l\u2019adoption de cette plage horaire de 5 h \u00e0 17 h si elle avait su que le plaignant aurait parfois eu \u00e0 passer la nuit aux commandes d\u2019un train. Cette mesure d\u2019adaptation propos\u00e9e par le plaignant, m\u00e9dicalement contre\u2011indiqu\u00e9e de l\u2019aveu de son propre m\u00e9decin, n\u2019appelle donc pas un examen d\u00e9taill\u00e9.\n[22] Bien que, \u00e0 la suite de la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union du CRAT, l\u2019employeur ait pris dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du plaignant une mesure d\u2019adaptation en service assign\u00e9, ce dernier continua \u00e0 demander une modification de ses restrictions m\u00e9dicales afin de r\u00e9pondre aux inqui\u00e9tudes qu\u2019inspirait \u00e0 l\u2019employeur cette id\u00e9e d\u2019une plage horaire de 5 h \u00e0 17 h applicable aux appels au travail dans les gares de d\u00e9tachement. Le plaignant s\u2019est entretenu avec sa sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil, lui demandant de confirmer qu\u2019il souhaitait que la restriction limitant les appels au travail \u00e0 la plage horaire de 5 h \u00e0 17 h ne s\u2019applique qu\u2019\u00e0 la gare d\u2019attache. Elle l\u2019a effectivement confirm\u00e9.\n[23] D\u2019apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage du MC, il \u00e9tait incompatible avec le diagnostic m\u00e9dical du plaignant, qu\u2019une restriction m\u00e9dicale s\u2019applique dans certaines gares, mais pas dans d\u2019autres. Cela \u00e9tant, le service de Sant\u00e9 et s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail n\u2019a pas transmis \u00e0 la direction de l\u2019entreprise et au syndicat la restriction modifi\u00e9e, mais a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard des pr\u00e9cisions \u00e0 la sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil.\n[24] Alors que la discussion au sujet de ces restrictions se poursuivait entre la sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil et le service de SST, le CFCP et la CFTC ont, le 19 juillet 2011, conclu une entente avalisant les conditions de retour au travail du plaignant (la premi\u00e8re entente de retour au travail). Aux termes de cette entente, le plaignant travaillerait en tant que ML en service assign\u00e9 \u00e0 la gare de Lethbridge et, en cas de besoin, un membre de la CFTC avec davantage d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 serait d\u00e9plac\u00e9, ses quarts de travail \u00e9tant donn\u00e9s au plaignant. Il n\u2019a toutefois pas \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9placer un autre employ\u00e9, car les restrictions adopt\u00e9es dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du plaignant (restrictions qui, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, lui permettaient de travailler de nuit) auraient assur\u00e9 au plaignant cinq quarts de travail par semaine, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 son degr\u00e9 d\u2019anciennet\u00e9.\n[25] Apr\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re entente de retour au travail, le plaignant a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 une infirmi\u00e8re du service de SST du CFCP, et a enregistr\u00e9 l\u2019appel. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le plaignant a produit plusieurs enregistrements de conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques qu\u2019il avait eues avec des membres de la direction du CFCP, des employ\u00e9s du service de SST ou des repr\u00e9sentants syndicaux. Les appels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019insu des correspondants du plaignant. Ces enregistrements n\u2019avaient pas, avant cela, \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9s \u00e0 la connaissance de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des intim\u00e9s. Invoquant des probl\u00e8mes de contemporan\u00e9it\u00e9, de fiabilit\u00e9 et de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, les intim\u00e9s ont demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de ne pas admettre ces enregistrements en preuve. La CFTC a en outre fait valoir que le fait d\u2019admettre en preuve ces enregistrements effectu\u00e9s subrepticement risquerait de nuire \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 des \u00e9changes en mati\u00e8re de relations de travail.\n[26] Malgr\u00e9 les arguments avanc\u00e9s par les intim\u00e9s, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019admettre ces enregistrements, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 50(3)c), sous r\u00e9serve du poids qui leur serait accord\u00e9 par la suite. J\u2019ai \u00e9valu\u00e9 la fiabilit\u00e9 et la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des propos enregistr\u00e9s, et je rel\u00e8ve un certain nombre de points qui paraissent effectivement probl\u00e9matiques. Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas en effet en mesure de savoir dans quelle mesure les correspondants se sentaient, lors de ces \u00e9changes, tenus de dire la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Certains enregistrements sont de mauvaise qualit\u00e9 et en partie inaudibles. D\u2019autres enregistrements sont incomplets. Le plaignant n\u2019a, dans de nombreux cas, pas pu donner la date de l\u2019enregistrement, ne pouvant qu\u2019indiquer une date approximative. Ajoutons que souvent le plaignant ne fait que r\u00e9p\u00e9ter dans ces enregistrements les arguments qu\u2019il a invoqu\u00e9s devant le Tribunal.\n[27] Je ne retiens pas, cependant, l\u2019argument avanc\u00e9 par la CFTC qui fait valoir que l\u2019admission de ces enregistrements aurait pour effet de nuire \u00e0 la franchise des \u00e9changes en mati\u00e8re de relations de travail. En effet, les \u00e9changes qui ont lieu en ce domaine, qu\u2019ils soient enregistr\u00e9s ou non, seraient en grande partie admissibles en l\u2019occurrence selon la pertinence des propos tenus. La seule distinction tient \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont le t\u00e9moignage a \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9, par enregistrement plut\u00f4t que de vive voix.\n[28] Lorsque les pr\u00e9occupations dont je viens de faire \u00e9tat ont port\u00e9 \u00e0 mettre en doute la fiabilit\u00e9 et la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des propos enregistr\u00e9s, je n\u2019ai accord\u00e9 que peu de poids aux enregistrements. De plus, dans la mesure o\u00f9 ces enregistrements ne font que reprendre ce que le plaignant a lui-m\u00eame affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience, ils n\u2019aident gu\u00e8re le Tribunal \u00e0 se prononcer sur les faits essentiels du dossier.\n[29] Selon l\u2019enregistrement de la conversation qu\u2019il a eue avec l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re du service de SST apr\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re entente de retour au travail, le plaignant a accept\u00e9 de travailler de nuit en service non assign\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de d\u00e9placements, pr\u00e9cisant qu\u2019il ne pouvait toutefois pas travailler de nuit en service assign\u00e9 \u00e0 la gare de triage. L\u2019infirmi\u00e8re du service de SST lui a fait savoir que d\u2019apr\u00e8s son profil m\u00e9dical, rien n\u2019emp\u00eachait le plaignant de travailler de nuit, car les restrictions ne s\u2019appliquaient qu\u2019\u00e0 certains appels au travail et que, par cons\u00e9quent, les restrictions m\u00e9dicales applicables jusque-l\u00e0 devraient \u00eatre mises \u00e0 jour afin de permettre au plaignant de travailler de nuit.\n[30] En ao\u00fbt 2011, le plaignant a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil de mettre \u00e0 jour les restrictions m\u00e9dicales s\u2019appliquant jusqu\u2019alors, afin de lui permettre de travailler dans la gare de triage, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il aurait un horaire quotidien r\u00e9gulier et ne serait pas oblig\u00e9 de travailler de nuit. C\u2019est seulement alors que les restrictions m\u00e9dicales ne se sont plus uniquement appliqu\u00e9es aux appels, mais \u00e9galement aux quarts de travail. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage livr\u00e9 par la sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil, ce n\u2019est qu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 que le plaignant a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de travailler en service assign\u00e9.\n[31] Le MC a transmis ces restrictions modifi\u00e9es au superviseur du plaignant ainsi qu\u2019au syndicat. Vu la confusion quant \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il convient d\u2019entendre par travail de nuit, le plaignant a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 se voir confier deux quarts de travail l\u2019obligeant \u00e0 travailler apr\u00e8s minuit. Apr\u00e8s des contacts entre le plaignant et le service de SST, le CRAT, l\u2019employeur et la CFTC, en novembre 2011, cette restriction a fini par \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e correctement.\n[32] Vers le mois de septembre 2011, le CFCP a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une deuxi\u00e8me entente de retour au travail (la seconde entente de retour au travail), limitant notamment le travail du plaignant aux quarts du matin et de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi. La seconde entente de retour au travail obligeait au besoin la CFTC \u00e0 d\u00e9placer un employ\u00e9 ayant davantage d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 afin de permettre au plaignant de travailler dans le cadre des restrictions convenues. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage livr\u00e9 par la CFTC, pour assurer au plaignant cinq quarts de travail par semaine dans le cadre des restrictions applicables, il aurait fallu d\u00e9placer un ML ayant plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, proche de l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite et \u00e9prouvant lui aussi des probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9dicaux. Le syndicat n\u2019a pas sign\u00e9 la seconde entente de retour au travail.\n[33] Aux \u00e9poques en cause, les quarts de travail \u00e9taient attribu\u00e9s aux employ\u00e9s du CFCP en fonction de la fiche de demande qu\u2019ils remettaient \u00e0 l\u2019employeur, et de leur degr\u00e9 d\u2019anciennet\u00e9. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de la CFTC, il a \u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 de multiples reprises, demand\u00e9 au plaignant de mettre \u00e0 jour sa fiche de demande afin d\u2019obtenir (en plus des trois quarts qu\u2019il effectuait d\u00e9j\u00e0 chaque semaine) les quarts de travail suppl\u00e9mentaires auxquels il avait droit compte tenu de son degr\u00e9 d\u2019anciennet\u00e9. Selon la CFTC, la fiche de demande est facile \u00e0 remplir et cela est bien connu des employ\u00e9s du CFCP.\n[34] Entre la fin du mois de septembre et le mois de novembre 2011, \u00e9poque pendant laquelle, tout en pouvant demander des quarts suppl\u00e9mentaires, il effectuait chaque semaine trois quarts de travail en service assign\u00e9, le plaignant a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 solliciter la prise d\u2019autres mesures d\u2019adaptation, demandant notamment \u00e0 pouvoir travailler \u00e0 nouveau en service non assign\u00e9. Les dossiers de sa sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil comprennent notamment le passage suivant consign\u00e9 en novembre 2011 :\n[traduction] Il souhaiterait pouvoir \u00e0 nouveau \u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des quarts de travail en d\u00e9placement, au lieu de ne pouvoir travailler que dans la gare de triage. Ainsi que nous en avions discut\u00e9, il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 de quelque chose que nous avions demand\u00e9 uniquement parce qu\u2019il ne pensait pas pouvoir, en d\u00e9placement, obtenir des quarts de travail compatibles avec ses besoins [\u2026]. Il m\u2019a demand\u00e9 de l\u2019aider \u00e0 se faire affecter \u00e0 d\u2019autres quarts de travail. J\u2019ai r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 Keith que je pouvais formuler des recommandations quant \u00e0 l\u2019heure \u00e0 laquelle il devrait commencer le travail, mais que je ne pouvais faire aucune recommandation concernant la nature ou le lieu de son travail.\n[35] Selon le t\u00e9moignage du MC, le dossier du plaignant \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement compliqu\u00e9. Entre le mois d\u2019avril et le mois de novembre 2011, le service de SST et les m\u00e9decins du plaignant se sont attach\u00e9s \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser non seulement les nouvelles restrictions qu\u2019imposaient ses troubles du sommeil, mais \u00e9galement les restrictions suppl\u00e9mentaires dues \u00e0 son arthrose du genou (affection permanente et en \u00e9volution constante), ainsi que les restrictions quant au poids qu\u2019il pouvait soulever compte tenu d\u2019une blessure \u00e0 la colonne cervicale. Au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, le service de SST a fait de gros efforts, et le dossier permet de constater le suivi de la situation en permanence et les nombreuses demandes de pr\u00e9cisions et de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux. Il ressort du dossier que le plaignant \u00e9tait \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard en contact t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec le service de SST.\n[36] \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, la CFTC, le plaignant et le CFCP \u00e9taient, en mati\u00e8re d\u2019adaptation, en pourparlers au sujet de trois solutions possibles, en plus des quarts de travail en service assign\u00e9 auxquels le plaignant avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9.\na. On a demand\u00e9 au syndicat de d\u00e9placer un ML ayant plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 afin de permettre \u00e0 M. Waddle d\u2019effectuer chaque semaine, en tant que ML, cinq quarts de travail en service assign\u00e9 \u00e0 la gare de triage de Lethbridge. La CFTC n\u2019a pas, cependant, d\u00e9plac\u00e9 l\u2019employ\u00e9 en question.\nb. Afin de pouvoir assurer chaque semaine au plaignant deux quarts de travail suppl\u00e9mentaires, on a demand\u00e9 au CFCP de cr\u00e9er \u00e0 son intention un nouveau poste comprenant divers t\u00e2ches ou travaux de bureau. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage du CFCP, il ne lui a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 possible, cependant, de trouver au plaignant des t\u00e2ches ou travaux de bureau d\u2019un quelconque int\u00e9r\u00eat.\nc. Le CFCP a offert au plaignant un poste de contrema\u00eetre de triage en service assign\u00e9, acceptant en outre de modifier les fonctions du poste et de lui donner un adjoint. Les pourparlers touchant cette mesure d\u2019adaptation n\u2019ont pas eu de suite, cependant, le plaignant faisant valoir les difficult\u00e9s excessives que cela entra\u00eenerait pour lui, et le surcro\u00eet de travail que cela occasionnerait \u00e0 l\u2019adjoint. En janvier 2012, le plaignant a fourni des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires indiquant qu\u2019en raison de son genou il ne pourrait pas faire le travail d\u2019un contrema\u00eetre de triage, m\u00eame avec les modifications qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu d\u2019apporter \u00e0 la fonction.\n[37] Le 22 novembre 2011, une deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9union du CRAT s\u2019est tenue en pr\u00e9sence du plaignant, des repr\u00e9sentants de la CFTC et du CFCP. On y \u00e9voqua les mesures d\u2019adaptation dont il est fait \u00e9tat plus haut, mais la situation n\u2019avan\u00e7a gu\u00e8re, car le plaignant souhaitait obtenir d\u2019autres analyses m\u00e9dicales confirmant les restrictions qu\u2019imposait son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, au niveau notamment de la marche.\n[38] En septembre 2011, la CFTC a demand\u00e9 au plaignant de signer, dans le cadre du processus d\u2019adaptation, une d\u00e9charge autorisant le syndicat \u00e0 prendre connaissance des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux du plaignant. D\u2019apr\u00e8s les dossiers internes de la CFTC produits en preuve, le 9 septembre 2011, le CFCP a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la CFTC un courriel indiquant qu\u2019il faudrait, pour les besoins des mesures d\u2019adaptation en faveur du plaignant, d\u00e9placer un employ\u00e9 ayant plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 que lui. La CFTC a convenu, lors de son t\u00e9moignage, que ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u ce courriel qu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9 l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux dossiers m\u00e9dicaux du plaignant.\n[39] Le 14 septembre 2011, des membres de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif de la CFTC \u00e9chang\u00e8rent des courriels contestant les restrictions m\u00e9dicales propos\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du plaignant par le service de SST. Dans le dernier de ces courriels, l\u2019un des dirigeants de la CFTC affirme que [traduction] \u00ab Les troubles subjectifs invoqu\u00e9s par quelqu\u2019un ne nous porteront (pas) \u00e0 passer outre aux r\u00e8gles d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 \u00bb. (Le mot \u00ab pas \u00bb ici mis en italiques ne figure pas dans le courriel, mais la CFTC a convenu, lors de son t\u00e9moignage, qu\u2019elle entendait effectivement faire figurer ce mot dans le courriel.) La CFTC a \u00e9galement reconnu, lors de son t\u00e9moignage, n\u2019avoir dans son \u00e9quipe personne ayant les connaissances m\u00e9dicales n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9valuer les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux du plaignant, et n\u2019avoir pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 un tiers une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale du dossier. Dans la correspondance qu\u2019il a produite en preuve, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019occasion du t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il a livr\u00e9, le plaignant a dit avoir craint d\u2019\u00eatre oblig\u00e9 de livrer \u00e0 son syndicat des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux confidentiels.\n[40] Vers la fin de 2011, la CFTC a re\u00e7u du plaignant une d\u00e9charge sign\u00e9e. Selon le plaignant, il n\u2019a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 ainsi que parce qu\u2019il ne pensait pas pouvoir faire autrement. La CFTC a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux du plaignant. Le 3 janvier 2012, des membres de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif de la CFTC se sont \u00e9chang\u00e9 des courriels contestant les conclusions auxquelles \u00e9taient parvenus tant le MC que le service de SST et la sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil. Voici la teneur d\u2019un ces courriels : [traduction] \u00ab On ne peut pas imaginer de meilleur motif d\u2019adaptation; vous souhaitez obtenir un horaire de travail de jour tranquille? Vous n\u2019avez qu\u2019\u00e0 aller chez le m\u00e9decin et lui dire que vous avez du mal \u00e0 vous endormir. Dommage, mais c\u2019est trop tard, c\u2019est moi qui ai le plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9. IL SUFFIRAIT DONC D\u2019UNE SIMPLE AFFIRMATION \u00bb.\n[41] Peu apr\u00e8s ce courriel du 3 janvier 2012, la CFTC a \u00e9crit \u00e0 l\u2019avocat qui repr\u00e9sentait alors le plaignant : [traduction] \u00ab L\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 que vous nous signalez de votre propre autorit\u00e9 ne nous permet pas, compte tenu de votre anciennet\u00e9, de modifier un des postes de travail \u00e0 la gare de Lethbridge. Nous ne pouvons pas ajuster le degr\u00e9 d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 au vu d\u2019un \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 que vous nous signalez de votre propre autorit\u00e9 \u00bb. Dans la suite de la lettre, la CFTC propose au plaignant de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 Calgary.\n[42] Selon Dave Abel, un des t\u00e9moins cit\u00e9s par la CFTC, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas rare de d\u00e9placer un employ\u00e9 ayant plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 et, en un an, il l\u2019avait lui\u2011m\u00eame fait plus de 17 fois. Vu l\u2019\u00e9change de courriels et les t\u00e9moignages livr\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience, je consid\u00e8re que c\u2019est du moins en partie parce que la CFTC voyait dans la cause principale d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du plaignant une affection davantage psychologique que physiologique, qu\u2019elle a refus\u00e9, dans le cadre du processus d\u2019adaptation, de d\u00e9placer un employ\u00e9 ayant plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9. La CFTC n\u2019a pas agi uniquement par souci de pr\u00e9server le principe d\u2019anciennet\u00e9.\n[43] Je constate que la CFTC a pris pleinement part au processus d\u2019adaptation aux besoins du plaignant et qu\u2019elle a, par exemple, particip\u00e9 \u00e0 deux r\u00e9unions de retour au travail, \u00e0 plusieurs appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques et qu\u2019elle s\u2019est pench\u00e9e activement sur les besoins du plaignant, mais sa participation a \u00e9t\u00e9 born\u00e9e par le parti pris qu\u2019elle \u00e9prouvait \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. Le syndicat estimait en effet que les troubles du rythme circadien dont faisait \u00e9tat le plaignant ne constituaient pas un v\u00e9ritable motif d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 appelant des mesures d\u2019adaptation, dont, notamment, le d\u00e9placement d\u2019un membre de la CFTC ayant davantage d\u2019anciennet\u00e9.\n[44] Apr\u00e8s examen des \u00e9l\u00e9ments concernant les mesures prises par le CFCP et la CFTC en r\u00e9ponse aux besoins invoqu\u00e9s par le plaignant, il convient de relever les lacunes de la participation du plaignant au processus d\u2019adaptation :\na. Vu l\u2019accent qu\u2019il a mis sur ses efforts en vue d\u2019obtenir que les appels au travail ne lui soient transmis qu\u2019entre 5 h et 17 h, le plaignant n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil des renseignements suffisants pour lui permettre de d\u00e9finir les restrictions m\u00e9dicales qui convenaient. En d\u00e9finissant lui\u2011m\u00eame la mesure d\u2019adaptation qu\u2019il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait, et en cherchant directement \u00e0 l\u2019obtenir, il a allong\u00e9 le processus permettant d\u2019aboutir \u00e0 un accommodement;\nb. Ainsi que nous le verrons de mani\u00e8re plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9e ci\u2011dessous, je constate par ailleurs, qu\u2019entre le mois de septembre 2011 et f\u00e9vrier 2012, le plaignant a manqu\u00e9 de mettre \u00e0 jour aussi souvent que possible la fiche de demande qui devait lui permettre d\u2019obtenir cinq quarts de travail par semaine. La CFTC a vers\u00e9 aux d\u00e9bats des preuves d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019\u00e0 cette p\u00e9riode il y avait de nombreux quarts de travail auxquels le plaignant aurait pu pr\u00e9tendre, et qui lui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s s\u2019il en avait fait la demande. Ainsi que je le pr\u00e9cise ci\u2011dessous, le plaignant n\u2019a pas pu fournir d\u2019explication raisonnable du fait qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 qu\u2019on lui accorde ces quarts de travail.\n[45] Se pose \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard la question de savoir si le plaignant a mis \u00e0 jour sa fiche de demande de quarts de travail, comme on lui demandait de le faire, afin de pouvoir obtenir autant de quarts de travail possible dans le cadre des efforts visant \u00e0 prendre en compte ses besoins particuliers. J\u2019\u00e9prouve certains doutes quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve produits par le plaignant pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il avait effectivement rempli une fiche de demande mise \u00e0 jour. Dans une lettre envoy\u00e9e le 24 octobre 2011 \u00e0 l\u2019avocat qui repr\u00e9sentait alors le plaignant, la CFTC a attir\u00e9 son attention sur une semaine enti\u00e8re de travail auquel le plaignant aurait eu droit au cours de la semaine du 17 octobre 2011, mais pour laquelle il n\u2019avait pas fait de demande. La CFTC a rappel\u00e9 l\u2019obligation que le plaignant avait de demander des quarts de travail correspondant \u00e0 ses restrictions m\u00e9dicales s\u2019il souhaitait obtenir, aussi souvent que possible, cinq quarts de travail par semaine.\n[46] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le plaignant a produit une photocopie d\u2019un document pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant sa fiche de demande pour la semaine du 17 octobre 2011. Il affirme avoir bien remis cette fiche, faisant valoir qu\u2019en raison d\u2019une erreur qu\u2019elle contenait, le quart de travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 ayant moins d\u2019anciennet\u00e9. Il n\u2019a pas pu pr\u00e9ciser quelle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019erreur en question, et n\u2019a pu produire aucune feuille de confirmation de t\u00e9l\u00e9copie d\u00e9montrant que la fiche avait effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e, m\u00eame s\u2019il reconna\u00eet que les employ\u00e9s de chemin de fer conservent normalement la feuille de confirmation qui leur est envoy\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019ils transmettent une fiche de demande de quarts de travail.\n[47] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, un des t\u00e9moins cit\u00e9s par la CFTC a produit un r\u00e9capitulatif des autres semaines de travail auquel le plaignant aurait cependant eu droit entre septembre 2011 et f\u00e9vrier 2012, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas obtenues. Ces occasions de travail sont survenues lorsqu\u2019un employ\u00e9, ayant plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 et affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des quarts de travail correspondant aux restrictions applicables au plaignant, \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 annuel, en cong\u00e9 de maladie ou absent pour d\u2019autres raisons. Les quarts de travail de cet employ\u00e9 allaient alors \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 ayant le plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 et ayant transmis une fiche de demande \u00e0 cet effet. Il y a eu, entre septembre 2011 et f\u00e9vrier 2012, de nombreuses semaines au cours desquelles l\u2019employ\u00e9 ayant le plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 \u00e9tait le plaignant qui, pourtant, n\u2019a pas obtenu le travail. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s son envoi, la fiche de demande demeurait en vigueur, et assurait donc que le plaignant obtiendrait effectivement ces quarts de travail suppl\u00e9mentaires, le plaignant n\u2019a pas su expliquer pourquoi il n\u2019avait pas obtenu le travail en question.\n[48] Je m\u2019interroge quant \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 et l\u2019authenticit\u00e9 de la fiche de demande produite en preuve par le plaignant. Il est contraire \u00e0 toute logique que, pour une raison ou une autre, l\u2019on n\u2019ait pas, \u00e0 plus de six reprises et sans explication, tenu compte de la fiche de demande en question. Ajoutons qu\u2019aucun des t\u00e9moins cit\u00e9s par la CFTC, pas plus que le plaignant lui\u2011m\u00eame, n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable bien qu\u2019ils soient parfaitement au courant du syst\u00e8me de fiches de demande, de dire quelle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019erreur qui, dit\u2011on, aurait entach\u00e9 la fiche. Le plaignant n\u2019a pas su expliquer pourquoi il n\u2019avait pas corrig\u00e9 l\u2019erreur qui, selon lui, se trouvait dans cette fiche de demande lorsqu\u2019en octobre 2011 on lui signala le fait qu\u2019il avait perdu toute une semaine de travail.\n[49] J\u2019estime, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que le plaignant n\u2019a pas assur\u00e9 la mise \u00e0 jour de sa fiche de demande alors que cela lui aurait assur\u00e9 un maximum de quarts de travail en service assign\u00e9. Au lieu de cela, le plaignant a effectu\u00e9, chaque semaine, les trois quarts de travail auxquels il avait droit, continuant, jusqu\u2019en f\u00e9vrier 2012, \u00e0 demander au CFCP et \u00e0 la CFTC qu\u2019on l\u2019affecte, par mesure d\u2019accommodement, \u00e0 des quarts en service non assign\u00e9.\n[50] Le plaignant a fait \u00e9tat des pertes qu\u2019il a subies en raison, dit\u2011il, de la discrimination dont il a fait l\u2019objet. Il affirme que des employ\u00e9s du CFCP travaillant en tant que ML en service non assign\u00e9 lui auraient dit qu\u2019ils avaient un revenu beaucoup plus important que celui qu\u2019il touchait, lui, en service assign\u00e9. Il n\u2019a appel\u00e9 personne \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner sur ce point, et n\u2019a fourni aucune documentation au sujet des revenus auxquels il comparait le sien.\n[51] Le CFCP a cit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins et produit des documents \u00e0 l\u2019appui. Au dire d\u2019un de ces t\u00e9moins, membre du service des pensions de retraite, en 2011 le revenu du plaignant est demeur\u00e9 stable et a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 augmenter alors que le plaignant \u00e9tait en service assign\u00e9, et cela jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite en f\u00e9vrier 2016. Au cours des mois correspondant au processus d\u2019adaptation, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire entre juin 2011 et f\u00e9vrier 2012, le plaignant affirme avoir perdu 30 % de son revenu, et risqu\u00e9 de perdre sa maison. En fait, les dossiers du CFCP d\u00e9montrent que son revenu mensuel a \u00e9t\u00e9 soit sup\u00e9rieur aux mois correspondants des ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, soit inf\u00e9rieur de 1 \u00e0 5 %. Bien que le Tribunal lui ait accord\u00e9 l\u2019occasion de le faire, le plaignant n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 l\u2019exactitude de ces chiffres, ou le t\u00e9moignage livr\u00e9 \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard.\n[52] Je constate que tout au long du processus d\u2019adaptation, en 2011 et au d\u00e9but de 2012, le revenu du plaignant s\u2019est maintenu. Voici quelques exemples de cela :\na. au cours d\u2019une des p\u00e9riodes de paye d\u2019octobre 2010, le plaignant a touch\u00e9 4 638,44 $. Au cours de la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode d\u2019octobre, mais en 2011, il a touch\u00e9 5 186,40 $;\nb. au cours d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de paye du mois de mars 2010, le plaignant a en fait touch\u00e9 900 $ de plus que ce qu\u2019il a touch\u00e9 au cours de la p\u00e9riode de paye correspondante de mars 2012. Cela dit, au cours d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de paye d\u2019avril 2012, le plaignant a en fait gagn\u00e9 2 900 $ de plus qu\u2019au cours de la p\u00e9riode correspondante d\u2019avril 2010;\nc. en 2010, le moins que le plaignant ait touch\u00e9 dans une p\u00e9riode de paye \u00e9tait 4 190,48 $, et le plus qu\u2019il ait touch\u00e9 \u00e9tait 6 378,68 $. En 2011, le moins que le plaignant ait touch\u00e9 au cours d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de paye \u00e9tait 4 218,10 $, et le plus 6 706,64 $. Au cours de la p\u00e9riode correspondant au processus d\u2019adaptation, la somme la plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e, et la somme la plus faible ont toutes deux augment\u00e9;\nd. ajoutons qu\u2019apr\u00e8s le processus d\u2019adaptation, et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite, dans l\u2019ensemble, le revenu annuel du plaignant a soit augment\u00e9, soit est rest\u00e9 stable.\nJe constate par ailleurs que c\u2019est en 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 et 2015 que les gains ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension du plaignant ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire dans les ann\u00e9es correspondant au processus d\u2019adaptation et la p\u00e9riode suivante.\n[53] Le t\u00e9moin cit\u00e9 par le CFCP en mati\u00e8re de pension de retraite a pu dire que tout impact sur les gains ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension du plaignant au cours de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019adaptation ne pouvait \u00eatre d\u00fb qu\u2019\u00e0 la d\u00e9cision qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise de consid\u00e9rer certains des quarts de travail que n\u2019a pas effectu\u00e9s le plaignant comme \u00e9tant dus \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab des raisons propres \u00e0 l\u2019entreprise \u00bb plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 une \u00ab inaptitude m\u00e9dicale \u00bb. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der ainsi parce que le superviseur du plaignant pensait, \u00e0 tort, que cela prot\u00e9gerait les gains ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension du plaignant. En fait, cela a occasionn\u00e9 une diff\u00e9rence d\u2019environ 7,03 $ par mois dans le montant des cotisations au r\u00e9gime de pension de retraite, ce qui a eu pour effet de faire passer la pension de retraite vers\u00e9e au plaignant de 3 719,97 $ par mois \u00e0 3 712,94 $.\n[54] Cette baisse du montant de sa pension de retraite aura cependant \u00e9t\u00e9 compens\u00e9e par une augmentation cons\u00e9cutive de ses gains ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension, ceux-ci passant de 71 333,71 $ en 2010, \u00e0 86 229,90 $ en 2014 et \u00e0 82 617,59 $ en 2015. Entre 2011 et l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2015 comprise, les gains ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension du plaignant se sont \u00e9lev\u00e9s en moyenne \u00e0 80 226,55 $. Or, au cours des cinq ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, ces gains ne s\u2019\u00e9taient \u00e9lev\u00e9s, en moyenne, qu\u2019\u00e0 67 373,88 $. L\u2019impact que le processus d\u2019accommodement et le passage du plaignant \u00e0 un poste en service assign\u00e9 ont pu avoir sur ses gains ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension a \u00e9t\u00e9 tout au plus minime.\nA. Motif ayant trait \u00e0 la situation de famille\n[55] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant est pass\u00e9 rapidement sur les obligations qu\u2019il avait envers ses parents \u00e0 Lethbridge. Il n\u2019a notamment pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 les soins aux a\u00een\u00e9s qu\u2019il leur procure \u00e9ventuellement. D\u2019apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage, son p\u00e8re, atteint d\u2019Alzheimer, vit dans un \u00e9tablissement de sant\u00e9, sa m\u00e8re ayant une existence ind\u00e9pendante. Les deux vivent \u00e0 Lethbridge. D\u2019apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage, il \u00e9tait retourn\u00e9 vivre \u00e0 Lethbridge afin d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e8s de ses parents. Je rel\u00e8ve que, dans le cadre de ses derni\u00e8res observations, le plaignant a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que s\u2019il d\u00e9m\u00e9nageait \u00e0 Calgary, sa m\u00e8re serait oblig\u00e9e de vendre sa maison. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, il n\u2019a produit \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve et je ne peux donc pas retenir cet argument.\nV. Questions pr\u00e9liminaires\nA. La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins\n[56] Il est arriv\u00e9 que le plaignant et les intim\u00e9s ne s\u2019accordent pas sur les faits de cette affaire. Certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments du t\u00e9moignage du plaignant ont port\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019interroger sur la fiabilit\u00e9 de ses dires. J\u2019estime que le plaignant s\u2019\u00e9vertuait \u00e0 dire la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, mais qu\u2019il a eu tendance \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter les faits de la mani\u00e8re qui lui \u00e9tait la plus favorable :\na) Lors de l\u2019interrogatoire principal, le Tribunal lui a demand\u00e9 s\u2019il avait des enregistrements de conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas encore produits. Il l\u2019a ni\u00e9, mais a reconnu, en contre\u2011interrogatoire, qu\u2019il avait beaucoup d\u2019autres enregistrements, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas produit ceux qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas \u00ab utiles \u00bb.\nb) Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9, \u00e0 de multiples reprises, qu\u2019en raison de la baisse de revenu qu\u2019il avait subie, il risquait de perdre sa maison. Or, le CFCP a pu d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019en 2011, lors du processus d\u2019adaptation, le revenu du plaignant est demeur\u00e9 stable, et que ce revenu a augment\u00e9 en 2012 et 2013. Le plaignant n\u2019a pas pu expliquer cet \u00e9cart entre les deux t\u00e9moignages.\nc) Au cours de l\u2019interrogatoire principal, le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 avoir d\u00fb, lors de la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union du CRAT, rester \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re de la salle, alors qu\u2019en contre\u2011interrogatoire, il a reconnu que l\u2019agencement des si\u00e8ges avait \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 afin qu\u2019il puisse s\u2019asseoir \u00e0 l\u2019avant et prendre part \u00e0 la r\u00e9union.\nd) \u00c0 plusieurs reprises au cours du contre\u2011interrogatoire, il a \u00e9vit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre aux questions touchant des faits qui ne servaient pas sa cause.\ne) Le t\u00e9moignage que le plaignant a livr\u00e9 au sujet de la fiche de demande de travail qu\u2019il affirmait avoir remise, ne cadrait pas avec les faits non contest\u00e9s touchant le fonctionnement de ce syst\u00e8me de fiches.\n[57] J\u2019estime par ailleurs que les quatre t\u00e9moins cit\u00e9s par le CFCP intim\u00e9 ont fait preuve de franchise et que leurs t\u00e9moignages cadraient avec la documentation qu\u2019ils ont pu produire. De mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, lorsque le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un plaignant s\u2019\u00e9carte de ce qu\u2019affirment les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019employeur, je suis port\u00e9 \u00e0 retenir le t\u00e9moignage des t\u00e9moins cit\u00e9s par l\u2019employeur.\n[58] J\u2019estime que les t\u00e9moins de la CFTC ont, dans l\u2019ensemble, livr\u00e9 des t\u00e9moignages v\u00e9ridiques. Comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, j\u2019ai constat\u00e9, chez la CFTC, un certain parti pris \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la d\u00e9ficience invoqu\u00e9e par le plaignant, le syndicat estimant qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une affection essentiellement psychologique. Les t\u00e9moins cit\u00e9s par la CFTC n\u2019ont cependant pas tent\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9luder la question, lorsqu\u2019elle leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Bien qu\u2019ils n\u2019aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019accord sur le sens qu\u2019il convient d\u2019attribuer aux observations que les membres de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif du syndicat ont faites dans les courriels qu\u2019ils se sont \u00e9chang\u00e9s, leur t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9tait empreint de franchise. J\u2019ai jug\u00e9 cr\u00e9dibles dans leur ensemble les t\u00e9moins de la CFTC et si, sur certains points, leur t\u00e9moignage s\u2019\u00e9carte de celui du plaignant, c\u2019est le leur que je retiens.\nB. Le retrait, par le plaignant, de sa reconnaissance qu\u2019en f\u00e9vrier 2012 il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de mesures d\u2019accommodement, et sa volont\u00e9 d\u2019ajouter de nouveaux motifs de r\u00e9clamation touchant la p\u00e9riode post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 f\u00e9vrier ou mars 2012\n[59] L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par le plaignant le 31 octobre 2014 comprend la reconnaissance qu\u2019en f\u00e9vrier 2012 il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de mesures d\u2019adaptation de mani\u00e8re satisfaisante. Avant les dates initialement fix\u00e9es pour l\u2019audition de cette affaire, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire les 15 et 16 novembre 2015 (\u00ab les dates d\u2019audience initiales \u00bb) le plaignant, par le truchement de son avocat, a tent\u00e9 de faire valoir des revendications qui ne figuraient pas dans l\u2019 expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions touchant les mesures discriminatoires dont il aurait fait l\u2019objet entre le mois de f\u00e9vrier 2012 et la fin de 2015.\n[60] Aux dates d\u2019audiences initiales, l\u2019avocat du plaignant a fait savoir qu\u2019il souhaitait que l\u2019audience porte sur les revendications du plaignant touchant la p\u00e9riode allant du mois de f\u00e9vrier 2012 \u00e0 la fin de 2015. Les intim\u00e9s s\u2019y sont oppos\u00e9s. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, le plaignant, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de son avocat, a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 l\u2019autorisation de modifier son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions afin d\u2019y ajouter sa situation de famille comme motif de discrimination,\n[61] Pour diverses autres raisons, les dates d\u2019audience initiales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9es. Lors d\u2019une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas (TCGC), le Tribunal demanda au plaignant de d\u00e9poser une demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019apporter \u00e0 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions les modifications qu\u2019il jugeait n\u00e9cessaires compte tenu des questions r\u00e9cemment soulev\u00e9es. Le plaignant d\u00e9posa donc une demande de modification de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions afin d\u2019y ajouter sa situation de famille comme motif de discrimination. Cette autorisation lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e (voir Waddle c. Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique et Conf\u00e9rence ferroviaire de Teamsters Canada 2016 TCDP 8, \u00ab la D\u00e9cision de 2016 \u00bb). Il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019autres demandes de modification.\n[62] L\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire a repris le 17 mars 2016 (\u00ab Date de reprise des audiences \u00bb), sur la base de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9. Aux dates de reprise des audiences, le plaignant a souhait\u00e9, lors de l\u2019interrogatoire principal, produire des documents \u00e0 l\u2019appui d\u2019une all\u00e9gation de discrimination en rapport avec des \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus apr\u00e8s f\u00e9vrier 2012.\n[63] Cette nouvelle demande aurait sensiblement modifi\u00e9 le montant des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats qu\u2019il sollicitait au titre de sa perte de revenu, portant \u00e0 presque 1 000 000 $ les 12 000 $ initialement r\u00e9clam\u00e9s dans le cadre de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Le plaignant a par ailleurs affirm\u00e9 vouloir revenir sur une affirmation consign\u00e9e dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, selon laquelle il reconnaissait qu\u2019en f\u00e9vrier 2012 il \u00e9tait pleinement satisfait des mesures d\u2019accommodement prises \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. Les intim\u00e9s ont fait valoir, et j\u2019\u00e9tais d\u2019accord avec eux sur ce point, que cela les aurait oblig\u00e9s de citer de nouveaux t\u00e9moins, d\u2019assurer aux t\u00e9moins d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vus une pr\u00e9paration suppl\u00e9mentaire et d\u2019obtenir du plaignant un compl\u00e9ment d\u2019information, tout cela alors que l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9.\n[64] Dans leurs observations livr\u00e9es de vive voix \u00e0 la reprise des audiences, les intim\u00e9s se sont oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 la demande du plaignant qui souhaitait apporter de nouvelles modifications \u00e0 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Voici, en r\u00e9sum\u00e9, les arguments qu\u2019ils ont fait valoir :\na. Toute all\u00e9gation de discrimination concernant la p\u00e9riode post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 f\u00e9vrier 2012 \u00e9chappe \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal, car le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9 figurant dans le renvoi de l\u2019affaire au Tribunal circonscrit la plainte \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode s\u2019achevant en mars 2012. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de ces arguments, les intim\u00e9s invoquaient la D\u00e9cision de 2016;\nb. Une telle modification leur causerait pr\u00e9judice, car elle est incompatible avec l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions en fonction duquel les intim\u00e9s ont pr\u00e9par\u00e9 leur d\u00e9fense;\nc. Une telle modification leur causerait pr\u00e9judice, car il avait avant cela \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 au plaignant de solliciter l\u2019autorisation d\u2019apporter \u00e0 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions toutes les modifications n\u00e9cessaires. Or, il n\u2019avait pas profit\u00e9 de cette occasion pour demander l\u2019allongement de la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle aurait eu lieu la discrimination qu\u2019il all\u00e9guait.\n[65] La plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne limite pas la dur\u00e9e de la p\u00e9riode de discrimination. La CCDP a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal par lettre en date du 30 juillet 2014. Le formulaire de plainte, joint \u00e0 la lettre de renvoi, ne limite pas la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle aurait eu lieu la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e. La lettre de renvoi \u00e9tait \u00e9galement accompagn\u00e9e du formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9, dat\u00e9 du 22 ao\u00fbt 2013. Le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9 donne comme date de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e la p\u00e9riode allant du mois de juin 2011 \u00e0 mars 2012. L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le 31 octobre 2014 par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de son avocat, indique que l\u2019absence de mesures d\u2019accommodement n\u2019a dur\u00e9 que jusqu\u2019au 7 f\u00e9vrier 2012, et qu\u2019apr\u00e8s cela le plaignant a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de mesures d\u2019accommodement enti\u00e8rement satisfaisantes.\n[66] Ayant entendu les observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es oralement par le plaignant et par chacun des intim\u00e9s, et apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau la D\u00e9cision de 2016, j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 que tout \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 avant cela au sujet d\u2019un acte discriminatoire intervenu entre mars 2012 et d\u00e9cembre 2015, ne serait recevable que dans la mesure o\u00f9 il pourrait influer sur l\u2019\u00e9tendue du pr\u00e9judice subi au cours des p\u00e9riodes de discrimination dont il \u00e9tait fait \u00e9tat dans l\u2019 expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions ou dans le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire la p\u00e9riode allant de juin 2011 \u00e0 mars 2012. Les nouveaux documents, dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00e9tat pour la premi\u00e8re fois \u00e0 l\u2019audience, n\u2019\u00e9taient autrement pas recevables. Aux termes des articles 9(3)a) et c) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (\u00ab R\u00e8gles \u00bb), j\u2019ai refus\u00e9 l\u2019autorisation de soulever de nouvelles questions litigieuses et de produire de nouveaux documents. J\u2019ai \u00e9galement refus\u00e9 l\u2019autorisation de modifier l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions afin d\u2019y ajouter des all\u00e9gations de discrimination touchant la p\u00e9riode post\u00e9rieure au mois de f\u00e9vrier 2012. On trouvera ci\u2011dessous les motifs de ma d\u00e9cision sur ce point.\n(i) La comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal\n[67] La comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal est d\u00e9finie par la demande d\u2019instruction transmise par la CCDP. En ce qui concerne les faits pr\u00e9cis de l\u2019affaire, tels qu\u2019expos\u00e9s dans la D\u00e9cision de 2016, la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal est d\u00e9limit\u00e9e \u00e0 la fois par le formulaire de plainte et par le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9. Je n\u2019entends pas reprendre ici les motifs m\u2019ayant port\u00e9, dans la D\u00e9cision de 2016, \u00e0 d\u00e9cider que le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9 est un des documents qui en l\u2019occurrence conf\u00e8rent au Tribunal la comp\u00e9tence de trancher cette affaire, mais je tiens \u00e0 relever la pertinence de cet extrait se trouvant au paragraphe 31 de la d\u00e9cision en question :\nCompte tenu de l\u2019usage particulier que la CCDP a fait du formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il fait effectivement partie des plaintes et peut aider \u00e0 d\u00e9finir la port\u00e9e de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal.\n[68] J\u2019ai pris le soin de pr\u00e9ciser dans la D\u00e9cision de 2016 que je n\u2019entendais pas en cela trancher la question de savoir si le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9 contribuerait dans tous les cas \u00e0 d\u00e9finir la port\u00e9e de la comp\u00e9tence conf\u00e9r\u00e9e au Tribunal. C\u2019est, cependant, effectivement le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, compte tenu de la mani\u00e8re dont la CCDP a modifi\u00e9 ce formulaire, y a renvoy\u00e9 et s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur lui. En outre, c\u2019est uniquement sur ce formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9 que le plaignant s\u2019est fond\u00e9 pour faire valoir qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal englobe une all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille.\n[69] Le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9 limite en l\u2019occurrence la dur\u00e9e de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode allant de juillet 2011 \u00e0 mars 2012. Cela dit, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire en mars 2012, la plainte affirmait que la discrimination en cause continuait. Il ressort d\u2019une lecture conjointe de la plainte et du formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9 que la comp\u00e9tence conf\u00e9r\u00e9e au Tribunal en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce englobe une all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience, qui se serait poursuivie au\u2011del\u00e0 de mars 2012.\n[70] Cela dit, pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci\u2011apr\u00e8s et conform\u00e9ment aux alin\u00e9as 9(3)a) et c) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, j\u2019ai refus\u00e9 l\u2019autorisation de modifier l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions afin d\u2019y faire figurer des incidents post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 mars 2012, et j\u2019ai \u00e9galement refus\u00e9 l\u2019autorisation de produire de nouveaux documents touchant de tels incidents.\n(ii) L\u2019autorisation pr\u00e9vue aux paragraphes 9(3)a) et c)\n[71] Les intim\u00e9s ont plaid\u00e9 l\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 des documents touchant d\u2019\u00e9ventuels actes discriminatoires post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 f\u00e9vrier ou mars 2012, estimant que ces documents sont incompatibles avec l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions tel que d\u00e9pos\u00e9. Cet argument doit, selon moi, \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9. Aux termes des paragraphes 9(3)a) et c) des R\u00e8gles, il peut \u00eatre demand\u00e9 au Tribunal que soient soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience d\u2019autres questions que celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, et de produire des documents qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s auparavant. La question est de savoir si cette autorisation devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[72] L\u2019autorisation de soulever de nouvelles questions et de produire de nouveaux documents doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9e si une telle autorisation r\u00e9pond \u00e0 l\u2019objet des R\u00e8gles du TCDP telles qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 1(1) :\n1(1) Les pr\u00e9sentes R\u00e8gles ont pour objet de permettre\na) que toutes les parties \u00e0 une instruction aient la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de se faire entendre;\nb) que l\u2019argumentation et la preuve soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en temps opportun et de fa\u00e7on efficace; et\nc) que toutes les affaires dont le Tribunal est saisi soient instruites de la fa\u00e7on la moins formaliste et la plus rapide possible.\n[73] Les actes discriminatoires qui se seraient, selon le plaignant, poursuivis apr\u00e8s f\u00e9vrier 2012 sont express\u00e9ment exclus de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. J\u2019ajoute que lorsque ces questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es avant les dates d\u2019audience initiales, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 ces dates, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 au plaignant de solliciter la modification de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Cette instruction a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9e lors de la TCGC, et \u00e9voqu\u00e9e dans la correspondance \u00e9chang\u00e9e apr\u00e8s cette TCGC. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, le plaignant \u00e9tait encore repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par son avocat.\n[74] Le plaignant n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 l\u2019autorisation de modifier son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, bien qu\u2019il ait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate sollicitant la modification d\u2019un autre point de ce document. Aux dates de reprise de l\u2019audience, il n\u2019a pas pu justifier le fait de ne pas avoir sollicit\u00e9 la modification de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, se contentant de dire qu\u2019il avait eu, au cours de la vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence de gestion du cas, un moment d\u2019inattention.\n[75] Les intim\u00e9s pouvaient donc \u00e0 juste titre supposer qu\u2019ils n\u2019auraient pas, aux dates de reprise de l\u2019audience, \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre d\u2019une plainte en discrimination portant sur la p\u00e9riode post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 f\u00e9vrier ou mars 2012, et ils ont fait savoir qu\u2019ils ne s\u2019y \u00e9taient effectivement pas pr\u00e9par\u00e9s. Il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident que pour r\u00e9pondre d\u2019une telle plainte, les intim\u00e9s auraient eu \u00e0 citer des t\u00e9moins suppl\u00e9mentaires. Il leur aurait fallu en outre demander au plaignant de fournir des renseignements compl\u00e9mentaires, y compris des rapports m\u00e9dicaux et des documents financiers. Les intim\u00e9s auraient vraisemblablement \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9s de demander le report des dates de reprise de l\u2019audience, ce qui aurait entra\u00een\u00e9 un troisi\u00e8me report, qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 par le plaignant ou qu\u2019il ait r\u00e9sult\u00e9 du fait que celui-ci n\u2019avait pas modifi\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Les intim\u00e9s ont manifest\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau la volont\u00e9 de ne pas voir l\u2019audience \u00e0 nouveau report\u00e9e. Cela les aurait en effet plac\u00e9s dans une situation \u00e0 la fois difficile et injuste.\n[76] La question est essentiellement de savoir si le fait d\u2019invoquer des actes de discrimination qui se seraient produits apr\u00e8s f\u00e9vrier 2012, et la communication de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments que cela exigerait, seraient conformes aux paragraphes 1(1) et 9(3) des R\u00e8gles. Le Tribunal a eu \u00e0 se pencher sur la question dans Whyte c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2009 TCDP 33. Dans cette affaire, le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 que si l\u2019intim\u00e9e souhaitait \u00ab pr\u00e9senter des questions et des pr\u00e9cisions compl\u00e8tement nouvelles \u00bb, il lui fallait pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 9(3). Le Tribunal s\u2019est prononc\u00e9 en ces termes au paragraphe 12 de sa d\u00e9cision :\nLe TCDP voudrait rappeler aux parties souhaitant soulever de nouvelles questions, questions qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont abord\u00e9es [sic] ni dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions ni dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9, qu\u2019elles doivent en demander l\u2019autorisation au TCDP conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles. Toute partie demandant une telle autorisation devra d\u00e9montrer que sa demande ne porte pas pr\u00e9judice aux autres parties ou \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure du TCDP. Elle devra \u00e9galement d\u00e9montrer valablement que sa requ\u00eate tardive est justifi\u00e9e.\n[77] Les dates de reprise de l\u2019audience avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9es apr\u00e8s deux ajournements de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, plus de quatre ans apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t initial de la plainte, et plus de quatre ans apr\u00e8s la plupart des \u00e9v\u00e9nements en cause. Le plaignant avait eu largement le temps d\u2019aligner son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments dont il entendait faire \u00e9tat sur la mani\u00e8re dont il envisageait d\u00e9sormais sa plainte. Or, il ne l\u2019a pas fait. Le Tribunal a r\u00e9cemment eu l\u2019occasion de se prononcer sur la question au paragraphe 57 de la d\u00e9cision Carpenter c. La Ligue navale du Canada, 2015 TCDP 8, d\u00e9cision dans laquelle le Tribunal a refus\u00e9 l\u2019autorisation de modifier un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions au titre du paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles :\nC\u2019est faire fi de l\u2019objet du paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal que de donner \u00e0 entendre que l\u2019audience reste le bon endroit pour \u00e9voquer une modification ou autre affaire nouvelle quand la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la modification ou l\u2019existence de l\u2019affaire nouvelle est connue de la partie requ\u00e9rante bien avant l\u2019audience, comme c\u2019est le cas ici. Le paragraphe 9(3) a pour objet d\u2019emp\u00eacher ce que l\u2019on appelle un \u00ab proc\u00e8s\u2011embuscade \u00bb et ce qu\u2019il en r\u00e9sulte comme temps perdu, ressources perdues et frais accrus pour tous ceux qui participent \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u2013 les parties, les avocats, les t\u00e9moins \u2013 et le Tribunal.\n[78] Si ces nouvelles all\u00e9gations et divulgations avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rajout\u00e9es au dossier, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 extr\u00eamement difficile de respecter le calendrier des audiences, et leur report aurait risqu\u00e9 d\u2019affecter la m\u00e9moire des t\u00e9moins et de causer un pr\u00e9judice aux intim\u00e9s. Ajoutons que le droit \u00e0 une audition exp\u00e9ditive de sa cause, \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 48.9 de la LCDP, vaut aussi pour les intim\u00e9s, qui, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ont toujours manifest\u00e9 la volont\u00e9 de poursuivre cette affaire.\n[79] Pour que la modification en question soit accord\u00e9e, il faut essentiellement \u00ab [\u2026.] qu\u2019elle serve les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice \u00bb. Canderel Lt\u00e9e c. Canada 1993 CanLII 2990 (CAF), cit\u00e9 dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Parent, 2006 CF 1313, au paragraphe 30. Or, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le fait de permettre que soient soulev\u00e9es de nouvelles questions litigieuses et que soient produits de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments ne serait pas conforme \u00e0 l\u2019objet au paragraphe 1(1) des R\u00e8gles, et ne servirait pas les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice.\n[80] Outre le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de permettre que soient soulev\u00e9es de nouvelles questions litigieuses, pouvoir que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles, le Tribunal est \u00e0 m\u00eame, sur requ\u00eate, d\u2019autoriser la modification d\u2019un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Cette autorisation de modifier un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e m\u00eame en cours d\u2019audience. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, cependant, le fait que le plaignant ait continuellement manqu\u00e9 de divulguer en temps utile les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qu\u2019il entendait invoquer, et le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019ait pas suivi les instructions du Tribunal concernant la modification de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, tout cela fait que ce ne serait pas servir les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice que de lui permettre d\u2019apporter les modifications en question.\nVI. La d\u00e9cision sur le fond\nC. La discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille\n[81] Le plaignant invoque une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite aux termes de l\u2019article 2 de la LCDP. En ce qui concerne l\u2019employeur, le plaignant fait \u00e9tat d\u2019une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille, aux termes de l\u2019article 7, et aux termes de l\u2019article 10 en ce qui concerne son syndicat :\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\n[\u2026]\n10. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et s\u2019il est susceptible d\u2019annihiler les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement d\u2019un individu ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019individus, le fait, pour l\u2019employeur, l\u2019association patronale ou l\u2019organisation syndicale :\na) de fixer ou d\u2019appliquer les lignes de conduite;\nb) de conclure des ententes touchant le recrutement, les mises en rapport, l\u2019engagement, les promotions, la formation, l\u2019apprentissage, les mutations ou tout autre aspect d\u2019un emploi pr\u00e9sent ou \u00e9ventuel.\n[82] Cette all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, formul\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019encontre \u00e0 la fois de son employeur et de son syndicat, a sa source dans le processus d\u2019accommodement, notamment dans le fait que la CFTC n\u2019a pas au d\u00e9part fait \u00e9tat, dans le plan de retour au travail, des obligations que le plaignant tenait de sa situation de famille, et, de plus, qu\u2019en janvier 2012, la CFTC a propos\u00e9 au plaignant qu\u2019il s\u2019installe \u00e0 Calgary, bien qu\u2019il ait avant cela fait \u00e9tat des obligations qu\u2019il avait envers ses parents \u00e0 Lethbridge.\n[83] Dans le t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il a livr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience, le plaignant impute \u00e0 des actes ou omissions de la CFTC intim\u00e9e ces deux faits ayant trait \u00e0 sa situation de famille. Il n\u2019a, \u00e0 l\u2019audience, produit que de minces \u00e9l\u00e9ments permettant de relier ces all\u00e9gations au CFCP intim\u00e9. La seule all\u00e9gation qu\u2019il ait pu attester concernait le fait qu\u2019un membre de la direction du CFCP a contribu\u00e9, lors de la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union du CRAT, \u00e0 remplir le formulaire de retour au travail initial. J\u2019en conclus que le plaignant a rapport\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du CFCP une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille.\n[84] La plainte pour discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du syndicat, la CFTC, invoque le crit\u00e8re d\u00e9gag\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Johnstone 2014 CAF 110 (Johnstone), au paragraphe 93 touchant la preuve de prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur ce motif :\n[\u2026] [P]our \u00e9tablir la preuve de prime abord de discrimination en milieu de travail fond\u00e9e sur un motif illicite, en l\u2019occurrence la situation de famille en raison des obligations li\u00e9es \u00e0 la garde des enfants, la personne qui soutient \u00eatre victime de discrimination doit d\u00e9montrer (i) qu\u2019elle assume l\u2019entretien et la surveillance d\u2019un enfant; (ii) que l\u2019obligation en cause relative \u00e0 la garde des enfants fait jouer sa responsabilit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale envers cet enfant et qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas simplement d\u2019un choix personnel; (iii) que la personne en question a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 les efforts raisonnables pour s\u2019acquitter de ses obligations en mati\u00e8re de garde d\u2019enfants en explorant des solutions de rechange raisonnables et qu\u2019aucune de ces solutions n\u2019est raisonnablement r\u00e9alisable; et (iv) que les r\u00e8gles attaqu\u00e9es r\u00e9gissant le milieu de travail entravent d\u2019une mani\u00e8re plus que n\u00e9gligeable ou insignifiante sa capacit\u00e9 de s\u2019acquitter de ses obligations li\u00e9es \u00e0 la garde des enfants.\n[85] Bien qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce aucune des parties n\u2019ait invoqu\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Hicks c. Ressources humaines et D\u00e9veloppement social Canada, 2013 TCDP 20 (Hicks\u2011TCDP), ou le jugement rendu par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019issue de son contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision Hicks\u2011TCDP (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Hicks, 2015 CF 599 (Hicks\u2011CF)), les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal sont peut-\u00eatre plus instructives quant \u00e0 la norme applicable aux plaintes de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille lorsque celle\u2011ci implique une obligation envers les parents.\n[86] Dans Hicks\u2011TCDP, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019avantage de pouvoir consulter l\u2019arr\u00eat Johnstone pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, et ne s\u2019est donc pas fond\u00e9 sur le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 quatre volets d\u00e9gag\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Le membre instructeur a n\u00e9anmoins pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que les obligations d\u2019un enfant envers un parent \u00e2g\u00e9 peuvent elles aussi \u00eatre prises en compte dans le cadre d\u2019une plainte invoquant la situation de famille (Hicks\u2011TCDP, au paragraphe 44). La conclusion du Tribunal sur ce point a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur contr\u00f4le judiciaire (Hicks\u2011CF, au paragraphe 66). Dans l\u2019affaire Hicks\u2011CF, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, ayant l\u2019avantage de pouvoir consulter l\u2019arr\u00eat Johnstone, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, a conclu que la r\u00e8gle voulant que, pour qu\u2019elles engagent la responsabilit\u00e9 juridique, les obligations en mati\u00e8re de soins ne doivent pas relever d\u2019un choix purement personnel, s\u2019applique en mati\u00e8re de plainte fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille lorsque les soins en cause sont prodigu\u00e9s \u00e0 des personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es. Voici en quels termes la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019est exprim\u00e9e sur ce point aux paragraphes 69 et 70 de son jugement :\nLa Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, au paragraphe 41 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Seeley CAF, a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Johnstone \u00e0 savoir pourquoi le motif de distinction illicite fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille englobe les obligations en mati\u00e8re de garde d\u2019enfants :\nAinsi que la Cour en a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de l\u2019affaire Johnstone, le motif de distinction illicite que constitue la situation de famille englobe les obligations parentales dont le non\u2011respect engage la responsabilit\u00e9 juridique du parent envers l\u2019enfant. En mati\u00e8re de garde d\u2019enfants, les obligations qu\u2019englobe le concept de situation de famille sont donc celles qui rev\u00eatent un caract\u00e8re immuable ou qui sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme immuables telles que celles qui font partie int\u00e9grante de la relation juridique qui existe entre le parent et son enfant. Par cons\u00e9quent, les obligations en mati\u00e8re de garde d\u2019enfants en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont celles que le parent ne saurait n\u00e9gliger sans engager sa responsabilit\u00e9 juridique. Cette fa\u00e7on d\u2019aborder la question permet d\u2019\u00e9viter la banalisation des droits de la personne qu\u2019entra\u00eenerait le fait d\u2019accorder \u00e0 de simples choix personnels la protection des droits de la personne.\nJe juge qu\u2019une justification similaire peut s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019analyse des obligations inh\u00e9rentes aux soins prodigu\u00e9s aux personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es.\n[87] Dans Hicks\u2011TCDP, le plaignant all\u00e9guait une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille, invoquant pour cela les frais qu\u2019entra\u00eenait pour lui et pour sa femme l\u2019entretien de deux domiciles, car s\u2019il avait d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, sa femme, elle, \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e \u00e0 Sydney (Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse) pour s\u2019occuper de sa m\u00e8re. Selon le t\u00e9moignage livr\u00e9 par le plaignant et accueilli par le Tribunal, sa belle\u2011m\u00e8re \u00e9tait malade et vivait dans un appartement pour personnes non autonomes. \u00c9voquant l\u2019obligation qu\u2019avait sa femme de s\u2019occuper de sa m\u00e8re, il a fait valoir que l\u2019on ne pouvait compter sur une tierce personne pour apporter \u00e0 sa belle\u2011m\u00e8re tout le soutien dont elle avait besoin, que sa belle\u2011m\u00e8re avait de la peine \u00e0 communiquer sans l\u2019aide de sa fille, que sa fille \u00e9tait en contact avec elle plusieurs fois par jour, allait lui chercher ses provisions, organisait les soins \u00e0 domicile, lui faisait la cuisine ou s\u2019organisait pour lui faire livrer des repas, l\u2019accompagnait lors de ses visites chez le m\u00e9decin, s\u2019entretenait fr\u00e9quemment avec le personnel de la maison de sant\u00e9 et \u00e9tait en fait son unique compagnie. C\u2019est dire que dans Hicks\u2011TCDP, la femme du plaignant avait, avec sa m\u00e8re, belle\u2011m\u00e8re du plaignant, une interaction tr\u00e8s fournie, et il ressort de la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019elle jouait un r\u00f4le essentiel dans les soins prodigu\u00e9s \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re.\n[88] Or, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant n\u2019a produit que de minces preuves de la nature ou de l\u2019\u00e9tendue des maux dont souffrent ses parents, ou des besoins m\u00e9dicaux ou sociaux qu\u2019ils peuvent \u00e9prouver, ou de leurs autres besoins en mati\u00e8re notamment de soins \u00e0 domicile. Selon lui, son p\u00e8re est atteint de la maladie d\u2019Alzheimer et vit dans un \u00e9tablissement de sant\u00e9, mais il n\u2019a donn\u00e9 aucun d\u00e9tail quant \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de sa maladie. Il n\u2019a produit aucun t\u00e9moignage touchant l\u2019\u00e9tendue des besoins m\u00e9dicaux ou sociaux de sa m\u00e8re, ou de ses autres besoins, notamment en mati\u00e8re de soins \u00e0 domicile. Au vu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments vers\u00e9s au dossier en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019aux \u00e9poques en cause il avait, en mati\u00e8re de soins, une obligation envers ses parents comparable \u00e0 l\u2019obligation juridique qui incombait au plaignant de l\u2019affaire Johnstone, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e. J\u2019ajoute que dans la mesure o\u00f9 il n\u2019a produit aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve quant \u00e0 la nature des soins qu\u2019il assurait \u00e0 ses parents, le plaignant n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019obligation qui lui incombait en cela engageait sa responsabilit\u00e9 juridique.\n[89] Le plaignant n\u2019a pas non plus d\u00e9montr\u00e9 les efforts qu\u2019il aurait faits pour assurer par d\u2019autres moyens les soins dont avaient besoin ses parents, que ce soit en s\u2019adressant \u00e0 d\u2019autres membres de la famille ou \u00e0 des tiers. C\u2019est un aspect important de la question, car dans Hicks\u2011TCDP, le Tribunal a relev\u00e9 l\u2019insuffisance des soins pouvant \u00eatre prodigu\u00e9s par des tiers compte tenu des besoins d\u00e9coulant de la maladie de la m\u00e8re. En outre, dans Hicks\u2011TCDP, le Tribunal a cit\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal ontarien des droits de la personne dans l\u2019affaire Devaney c. ZRV Holdings Limited 2012 HRTO 1590, dans laquelle le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario a tranch\u00e9 une plainte en discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille d\u00e9coulant des obligations envers des personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es, constatant qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait, autre que le plaignant, aucun membre de la famille en mesure de procurer les soins n\u00e9cessaires.\n[90] En l\u2019absence d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve touchant une situation analogue \u00e0 celles qui viennent d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9crites, le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il lui incombait, en mati\u00e8re de soins \u00e0 des personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es, une obligation engageant sa responsabilit\u00e9 juridique. Cette conclusion s\u2019impose, que le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 quatre volets d\u00e9gag\u00e9s dans Johnstone, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 soit strictement appliqu\u00e9, ou que l\u2019on applique la norme d\u00e9coulant des crit\u00e8res d\u00e9gag\u00e9s dans Hicks\u2011TCDP et Hicks\u2011CF.\n[91] Le plaignant n\u2019a donc pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s qu\u2019aux termes de l\u2019article 10 la CFTC intim\u00e9e s\u2019est livr\u00e9e envers lui \u00e0 une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille.\nD. La discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience\n(i) La preuve prima facie\n[92] Une preuve prima facie de discrimination est une preuve qui \u00ab [\u2026] porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 \u00bb. (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons\u2011Sears Ltd. [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, \u00e0 la p. 558). Pour \u00e9tablir la discrimination prima facie, le plaignant est tenu de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il poss\u00e8de une caract\u00e9ristique que la LCDP prot\u00e8ge contre la discrimination, qu\u2019il a subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable dans le cadre de son emploi et que la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de cet effet pr\u00e9judiciable (Moore c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (\u00c9ducation) 2012 CSC 61, au paragraphe 33). Ajoutons que l\u2019emploi de l\u2019expression \u00ab discrimination prima facie \u00bb ne doit pas \u00eatre assimil\u00e9e \u00e0 un all\u00e8gement de l\u2019obligation qu\u2019a le demandeur de convaincre le Tribunal selon la norme de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, laquelle continue toujours de lui incomber (Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Bombardier Inc., 2015 CSC 39, au paragraphe 65).\n[93] La plainte reproche au CFCP, au titre de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP, une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience, la plainte \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du syndicat invoquant, tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 plus haut, l\u2019article 10 de la LCDP. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 toutes les \u00e9poques en cause, le plaignant a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre employ\u00e9 par le CFCP, seul s\u2019applique en l\u2019occurrence l\u2019article 7b). Pour ce qui est des all\u00e9gations visant la CFTC, il lui est reproch\u00e9 d\u2019avoir manqu\u00e9 aux obligations lui incombant en tant que partie au processus d\u2019accommodation, et c\u2019est donc l\u2019article 10a) qui s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[94] Dans ses observations \u00e9crites, le CFCP reconna\u00eet que le plaignant a produit une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience. Ajoutons que, selon des preuves et t\u00e9moignages non contest\u00e9s, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9, en raison de restrictions d\u00e9coulant de son incapacit\u00e9 m\u00e9dicale, emp\u00each\u00e9 de travailler en tant que ML en service non assign\u00e9. Le CFCP n\u2019a pas, dans les arguments qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, d\u00e9crit de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9taill\u00e9e la pratique discriminatoire \u00e0 laquelle il reconna\u00eet s\u2019\u00eatre livr\u00e9, mais a reconnu dans ses observations finales que le plaignant avait effectivement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience. Puisque c\u2019est en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce l\u2019article 7b) qui s\u2019applique, j\u2019estime que cet aveu concerne, de la part de l\u2019employeur, une distinction qui a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 le plaignant en cours d\u2019emploi.\n[95] Dans cette affaire de discrimination, la responsabilit\u00e9 de la CFTC est engag\u00e9e en raison du r\u00f4le qu\u2019elle a jou\u00e9 dans le processus d\u2019adaptation. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Central Okanagan School District No. 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970, 16 C.H.R.R. D\/425, la Cour supr\u00eame a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il y a deux fa\u00e7ons dont un syndicat peut devenir partie \u00e0 une discrimination. La seconde mani\u00e8re, celle qui est pertinente en l\u2019occurrence, est qu\u2019un syndicat peut devenir partie \u00e0 une discrimination si, comme il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019il l\u2019a fait, il g\u00eane les efforts raisonnables que l\u2019employeur d\u00e9ploie pour s\u2019entendre avec l\u2019employ\u00e9 :\nSi une entente raisonnable n\u2019est possible qu\u2019avec la collaboration du syndicat et que celui\u2011ci bloque les efforts de l\u2019employeur pour supprimer ou att\u00e9nuer l\u2019effet discriminatoire, le syndicat devient partie \u00e0 la discrimination. Dans ces circonstances, le syndicat qui n\u2019est pas initialement partie \u00e0 la conduite discriminatoire et qui n\u2019a, au d\u00e9part, aucune obligation d\u2019accommodement est toutefois tenu de ne pas contribuer \u00e0 la continuation de la discrimination.\n[96] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il appartient aux deux intim\u00e9s, le CFCP et la CFTC, de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019ils ont satisfait \u00e0 l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019employ\u00e9 tant que cela ne leur impose pas une contrainte excessive. Le CFCP intim\u00e9 a reconnu qu\u2019il avait effectivement, aux termes de l\u2019article 7b) de la LCDP, op\u00e9r\u00e9 une discrimination prima facie. Je consid\u00e8re par ailleurs que la CFTC intim\u00e9e a, elle aussi, op\u00e9r\u00e9 une discrimination prima facie aux termes de l\u2019article 7b) de la LCDP, en refusant, dans le cadre de sa participation au processus d\u2019adaptation, d\u2019envisager comme elle aurait d\u00fb le faire une solution qui aurait eu une incidence sur l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 d\u2019un autre employ\u00e9, ayant insuffisamment pris en compte la nature de la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant. Comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 ci\u2011dessus, le comportement de la CFTC a r\u00e9sult\u00e9 d\u2019une conception biais\u00e9e des troubles du sommeil dont \u00e9tait atteint le plaignant, conception qui a port\u00e9 le syndicat \u00e0 juger qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience appelant des mesures d\u2019adaptation qui auraient exig\u00e9 le d\u00e9placement d\u2019un employ\u00e9 ayant plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9. \u00c0 moins de pouvoir, en invoquant une expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, justifier la conduite qui leur est reproch\u00e9e, les intim\u00e9s doivent tous deux accorder r\u00e9paration au plaignant.\n(ii) L\u2019EPJ\n[97] L\u2019employeur ayant reconnu avoir op\u00e9r\u00e9 une discrimination prima facie fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience, et le Tribunal ayant conclu que cela a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 vrai en ce qui concerne la CFTC, la question est, en l\u2019occurrence, de savoir si cette discrimination peut \u00eatre excus\u00e9e au nom d\u2019une EPJ (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 RCS 202, 1982 CanLII 15 (CSC) \u00e0 la page 208,; Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204, au paragraphe 18. Aux termes des articles 15(1)a) et 15(2) de la LCDP, un traitement d\u00e9favorable ne constitue pas un acte discriminatoire si l\u2019employeur d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il d\u00e9coule d\u2019une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. L\u2019employeur doit notamment d\u00e9montrer que les mesures d\u2019adaptation aux besoins des individus concern\u00e9s lui imposeraient une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[98] Le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 trois volets permettant de d\u00e9cider si un acte discriminatoire d\u00e9coule effectivement d\u2019EPJ a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9gag\u00e9 par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans son arr\u00eat Colombie\u2011Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 RCS 3. Au paragraphe 54 de son arr\u00eat, la Cour pr\u00e9cise que l\u2019employeur peut justifier la norme contest\u00e9e en \u00e9tablissant selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s :\n1. qu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause;\n2. qu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail;\n3. que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail. Pour prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, il faut d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est impossible de composer avec les employ\u00e9s qui ont les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que le demandeur sans que l\u2019employeur subisse une contrainte excessive.\n[99] Les fonctions de ML sont essentielles \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Selon un t\u00e9moignage livr\u00e9 par le CFCP et accueilli par le Tribunal, pour assurer les fonctions de ML en service non assign\u00e9, avec des quarts de travail soumis \u00e0 des horaires irr\u00e9guliers, le plaignant devait maintenir un niveau de vigilance et un rendement cognitif qui n\u2019allaient pas de pair avec les troubles du rythme circadien qu\u2019il \u00e9prouvait alors. Insistons sur le fait que selon l\u2019avis de son propre m\u00e9decin et t\u00e9moin expert, le plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas, m\u00e9dicalement, en mesure d\u2019assurer, de nuit, la conduite d\u2019un train. J\u2019estime que la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019a prise l\u2019employeur d\u2019interdire au plaignant de travailler, sans restrictions, en tant que ML en service non assign\u00e9, a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans un but qui est rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019exercice des fonctions de ML, fonctions qui sont essentielles \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, et que, par ailleurs, l\u2019employeur croyait sinc\u00e8rement que cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire au maintien de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et conforme aux restrictions m\u00e9dicales indiqu\u00e9es par le m\u00e9decin du plaignant.\n[100] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019employeur n\u2019a pas refus\u00e9 de chercher \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins du plaignant. Il s\u2019agit donc de savoir si les efforts faits en vue de trouver au plaignant un travail correspondant \u00e0 son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 constituent effectivement des mesures d\u2019adaptation raisonnables. Lorsque l\u2019employeur propose un accommodement raisonnable, le plaignant ne peut pas insister sur l\u2019accommodement subsidiaire qu\u2019il pr\u00e9f\u00e8re (voir Croteau c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2014 TCDP 16, au paragraphe 44(2)).\n[101] Le diff\u00e9rend sur la question de savoir si le plaignant a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de mesures d\u2019adaptation correspondant \u00e0 ses besoins soul\u00e8ve essentiellement cinq questions :\n1. Le processus d\u2019accommodement et les travaux confi\u00e9s au plaignant entre le mois de juillet 2011 et le mois de f\u00e9vrier 2012 constituent\u2011ils des mesures d\u2019adaptation raisonnables? Sinon,\n2. Le CFCP a\u2011t\u2011il manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation raisonnables lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9cart\u00e9 la solution consistant \u00e0 offrir au plaignant de travailler en service non assign\u00e9 avec, pour les appels au travail, une plage horaire allant de 5 h \u00e0 17 h?\n3. Le CFCP a\u2011t\u2011il manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation raisonnables en n\u2019offrant pas au plaignant deux quarts de travail par semaine dans un bureau, ou en ne lui proposant pas un ensemble de t\u00e2ches diverses qu\u2019il aurait pu accomplir?\n4. La CFTC a\u2011t\u2011elle manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation de coop\u00e9rer aux efforts d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du plaignant en ne d\u00e9pla\u00e7ant pas un employ\u00e9 ayant davantage d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 afin d\u2019assurer chaque semaine au plaignant, \u00e0 la gare de Lethbridge, cinq quarts de travail adapt\u00e9s aux restrictions m\u00e9dicales qu\u2019imposait son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9?\ni. La CFTC a\u2011t\u2011elle envisag\u00e9, honn\u00eatement et de bonne foi, d\u2019adapter les r\u00e8gles de l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 afin de satisfaire les besoins d\u2019accommodement du plaignant?\nii. \u00c9tait\u2011il, de la part de la CFTC, raisonnable de demander \u00e0 examiner les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux du plaignant, ou cela a\u2011t\u2011il nui \u00e0 la bonne foi des efforts d\u2019accommodement?\n5. Au regard de ce que la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Renaud, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, le plaignant a\u2011t\u2011il manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019obligation qu\u2019il avait de faciliter le processus d\u2019adaptation, dans la mesure, notamment, o\u00f9 il a :\ni. manqu\u00e9 de fournir au m\u00e9decin et aux infirmiers certaines pr\u00e9cisions concernant son travail, ou manqu\u00e9 de fournir aux conseillers m\u00e9dicaux de l\u2019employeur des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux courants?\nii. manqu\u00e9 d\u2019envisager certaines mesures d\u2019accommodement raisonnables, y compris une mutation \u00e0 Calgary, ou un poste de contrema\u00eetre de triage?\niii. manqu\u00e9 de faire le n\u00e9cessaire pour mettre \u00e0 jour sa fiche de demande de travail, ce qui lui aurait permis (compte tenu de son anciennet\u00e9) d\u2019obtenir tous les quarts de travail en service assign\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en mesure d\u2019effectuer?\nQuestion litigieuse no 1 : Le travail auquel le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 entre juillet 2011 et f\u00e9vrier 2012 constitue\u2011t\u2011il un accommodement raisonnable?\n[102] J\u2019estime, en ce qui concerne les deux intim\u00e9s, que le poste offert au plaignant en tant que ML en service assign\u00e9 \u00e0 Lethbridge, soit trois quarts de travail par semaine, constituait une mesure d\u2019adaptation raisonnable. Pour qu\u2019une mesure d\u2019adaptation soit tenue pour raisonnable, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la solution retenue soit parfaite. Le plaignant ne pouvait en effet pas s\u2019attendre \u00e0 une solution parfaite (Renaud, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 44). Dans certains cas, un travail \u00e0 temps partiel peut satisfaire \u00e0 cette exigence (Renaud, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 43). Il en est particuli\u00e8rement ainsi en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce puisqu\u2019en 2011 le plaignant n\u2019a subi aucune perte de revenu bien qu\u2019on ne lui ait confi\u00e9 chaque semaine que trois quarts de travail en service assign\u00e9. Ajoutons que le plaignant a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 pouvoir travailler en tant que ML, \u00e0 rester, comme il le souhaitait, \u00e0 Lethbridge, et \u00e0 effectuer un travail correspondant aux restrictions m\u00e9dicales qu\u2019imposait son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Il a pu, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite, effectuer suffisamment de quarts pour s\u2019assurer chaque ann\u00e9e un revenu \u00e9quivalent, qui n\u2019a cess\u00e9 d\u2019augmenter.\n[103] J\u2019estime par ailleurs que dans la mesure o\u00f9 le plaignant n\u2019a pas pu rapporter la preuve prima facie d\u2019une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille, les intim\u00e9s, ou l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre d\u2019entre eux, auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 en droit d\u2019exiger du plaignant qu\u2019il accepte d\u2019\u00eatre mut\u00e9 dans le cadre des mesures d\u2019adaptation. Je consid\u00e8re que la mutation \u00e0 Calgary, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9e au plaignant, et qu\u2019il aurait pu accepter \u00e0 toute \u00e9poque, constituait, elle aussi, un accommodement raisonnable. L\u2019employeur et le syndicat ont continu\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre part au processus d\u2019adaptation afin de proposer un accommodement plus satisfaisant aux yeux du plaignant, et en lui proposant une mutation, ils se sont acquitt\u00e9s de l\u2019obligation juridique qui leur incombait.\n[104] \u00c0 toutes les \u00e9poques en cause, au cours du processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 m\u00e9dicale du plaignant, jusqu\u2019en f\u00e9vrier 2012, et m\u00eame jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite au d\u00e9but de 2016, le plaignant a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 pleinement de mesures d\u2019adaptation mise en place par l\u2019employeur. Il effectuait au moins trois quarts de travail par semaine en service assign\u00e9, pouvant travailler \u00e0 temps plein entre le mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2011 et le mois de f\u00e9vrier 2012, date \u00e0 laquelle il reconna\u00eet avoir vu ses besoins enti\u00e8rement pris en compte, et il a pu, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite, travailler \u00e0 temps plein en service assign\u00e9.\n[105] Le plaignant a fait \u00e9tat de trois autres mesures d\u2019adaptation qui, selon lui, auraient r\u00e9pondu pleinement \u00e0 ses besoins d\u2019accommodement. Ces solutions ont, cependant, \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es soit par le CFCP soit par la CFTC. Selon le plaignant, l\u2019une de ces solutions aurait pu \u00eatre retenue et, dans la mesure o\u00f9 aucune d\u2019entre elles ne l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9, ses besoins d\u2019accommodement n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pleinement satisfaits. Bien que j\u2019aie conclu ci\u2011dessus que les besoins d\u2019accommodement du plaignant avaient en fait \u00e9t\u00e9 pleinement satisfaits, je vais n\u00e9anmoins examiner chacune des trois autres solutions qui viennent d\u2019\u00eatre mentionn\u00e9es.\nQuestion litigieuse no 2 : Le CFCP aurait\u2011il d\u00fb r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019accommodement du plaignant en l\u2019affectant \u00e0 des fonctions en service non assign\u00e9 assorties d\u2019une plage horaire pr\u00e9cise pour les appels au travail?\n[106] Son travail de ML en service non assign\u00e9 \u00e9tant essentiel \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, le plaignant ne pouvait pas, compte tenu de son invalidit\u00e9 m\u00e9dicale, continuer \u00e0 travailler en tant que ML en service non assign\u00e9 \u00e0 la gare de Lethbridge. C\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0 non seulement l\u2019opinion de l\u2019expert m\u00e9dical qu\u2019il avait consult\u00e9, mais \u00e9galement celle du MC.\n[107] La modification qu\u2019il demandait que l\u2019on apporte \u00e0 son travail de ML en service non assign\u00e9, en limitant les appels au travail \u00e0 une plage horaire allant de 5 h \u00e0 17 h, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas compatible avec les restrictions m\u00e9dicales que lui avait impos\u00e9es sa sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il lui eut transmis les renseignements dont elle avait besoin pour \u00e9valuer les \u00e9ventuelles mesures d\u2019adaptation.\n[108] Le plaignant souhaitait en effet ne recevoir d\u2019appels au travail qu\u2019entre 5 h et 17 h. Or, une telle solution n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 praticable.\nQuestion litigieuse no 3 : Le CFCP aurait\u2011il d\u00fb chercher \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019accommodement du plaignant en l\u2019affectant \u00e0 des travaux de bureau ou en lui trouvant un bouquet d\u2019autres t\u00e2ches \u00e0 accomplir?\n[109] L\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement n\u2019oblige aucunement l\u2019employeur \u00e0 offrir un travail improductif de valeur nulle. (Croteau, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 44(4)). Dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela n\u2019aurait pas offert au plaignant un travail utile, l\u2019employeur n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce tenu de lui offrir un travail de bureau ou de constituer \u00e0 son intention un bouquet de t\u00e2ches diverses afin de lui assurer chaque semaine deux quarts de travail suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[110] Apr\u00e8s examen, j\u2019ai rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument avanc\u00e9 par la CFTC et selon lequel l\u2019employeur \u00e9tait tenu d\u2019assurer au plaignant un travail de bureau ou de l\u2019affecter \u00e0 un bouquet de t\u00e2ches diverses, ainsi qu\u2019il le faisait pour les employ\u00e9s touchant des indemnit\u00e9s d\u2019accident du travail. En pareil cas, et dans un contexte qui est enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rent, les employ\u00e9s accident\u00e9s du travail re\u00e7oivent des affectations \u00e0 court terme, l\u2019employeur \u00e9tant tenu de les indemniser, mais c\u2019est l\u00e0 en vertu d\u2019une loi autre que la LCDP. Le fait que cela se fasse pour les accident\u00e9s du travail ne permet pas d\u2019affirmer le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de telles mesures dans le contexte de l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement aux termes de la LCDP.\nQuestion litigieuse no 4 : La CFTC aurait\u2011elle d\u00fb, pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019accommodement du plaignant, d\u00e9placer un employ\u00e9 ayant plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9?\n[111] Les efforts que l\u2019employeur a faits en l\u2019occurrence pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019accommodement du plaignant donnent pleinement suite aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination formul\u00e9es par celui\u2011ci. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 toutes les \u00e9poques en cause le plaignant a, en vertu des efforts de son employeur, pleinement b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de mesures d\u2019accommodement, la coop\u00e9ration du syndicat n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en cela n\u00e9cessaire et, selon Renaud, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paragraphes 37 et 40, le syndicat n\u2019a encouru aucune obligation.\n[112] Le Tribunal \u00e9tant tenu cependant, aux termes de la loi, d\u2019\u00ab instruire la plainte \u00bb, je tiens \u00e0 dire que le comportement, au cours du processus d\u2019adaptation, de certains dirigeants de la CFTC, s\u2019il n\u2019engage pas la responsabilit\u00e9 du syndicat pour des faits de discrimination, appelle tout de m\u00eame des commentaires.\n[113] La CFTC fait valoir que si elle a refus\u00e9 de d\u00e9placer un employ\u00e9 ayant plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, c\u2019\u00e9tait par souci de prot\u00e9ger la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019anciennet\u00e9, mais les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits d\u00e9montrent le contraire :\n1. Lorsqu\u2019elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas d\u00e9placer, afin de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019accommodement du plaignant, un employ\u00e9 ayant plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, la CFTC a manifestement r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi \u00e0 la nature de la d\u00e9ficience invoqu\u00e9e par le plaignant. Les responsables syndicaux ont estim\u00e9 que le plaignant ne m\u00e9ritait pas que, par mesure d\u2019accommodement, on d\u00e9place un autre employ\u00e9, car ils n\u2019accordaient gu\u00e8re de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 au diagnostic dont il avait fait l\u2019objet puisque ce diagnostic reposait sur des sympt\u00f4mes que le plaignant avait lui\u2011m\u00eame relev\u00e9s.\n2. La CFTC a insist\u00e9 pour que le plaignant lui communique ses dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, et le syndicat a refus\u00e9 de participer au processus d\u2019adaptation tant que le plaignant ne l\u2019aurait pas fait. Selon un t\u00e9moin cit\u00e9 par le syndicat, il s\u2019agit de quelque chose que le syndicat demandait souvent \u00e0 ses adh\u00e9rents de faire. Pourtant, \u00e0 l\u2019audience, le syndicat a reconnu ne pas avoir les connaissances sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9valuer ces dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, et que, s\u2019il lui arrivait de faire appel \u00e0 des m\u00e9decins sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s pour examiner les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux de ses adh\u00e9rents, il ne l\u2019avait pas fait en l\u2019occurrence.\n3. Dans les courriels qu\u2019ils se sont \u00e9chang\u00e9s, les dirigeants du syndicat ont fait, au sujet de la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant, des commentaires d\u00e9sobligeants, et ils ont reconnu que c\u2019est pour cela que la CFTC n\u2019a pas envisag\u00e9 de d\u00e9placer un autre employ\u00e9.\n[114] Alors que ces actes n\u2019engagent pas la responsabilit\u00e9 du syndicat en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, et que ce n\u2019est pas dans cette optique qu\u2019ils sont examin\u00e9s en l\u2019occurrence, on ne peut gu\u00e8re les consid\u00e9rer comme \u00e9tant en harmonie avec les obligations incombant au syndicat aux termes de la LCDP.\nQuestion litigieuse no 5 : Le plaignant a\u2011t\u2011il manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation de faciliter l\u2019accommodement?\n[115] Si les mesures d\u2019accommodement prises par l\u2019employeur r\u00e9pondent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pleinement \u00e0 la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant pour discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience, le fait que le plaignant n\u2019ait pas facilit\u00e9 le processus d\u2019adaptation exclut toute r\u00e9clamation \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019employeur. Le fait que le plaignant n\u2019ait pas facilit\u00e9 le processus d\u2019accommodement l\u2019emp\u00eache aussi de d\u00e9poser une r\u00e9clamation contre la CFTC, ainsi qu\u2019il en a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire Siddoo c. Syndicat international des d\u00e9bardeurs et magasiniers, Section locale 502, 2015 TCDP 21, (Siddoo), au paragraphe 42, m\u00eame s\u2019il convient de pr\u00e9ciser que la d\u00e9cision Siddoo, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire actuellement en instance : T\u20111742\u201115.\n[116] C\u2019est d\u2019un triple point de vue que le plaignant a manqu\u00e9 de faciliter le processus d\u2019accommodement : d\u2019abord, il a h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 transmettre \u00e0 sa sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil des renseignements complets. Au lieu de lui fournir, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part, tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments dont elle avait besoin pour se faire une id\u00e9e pr\u00e9cise de son travail, et des solutions qui pourraient \u00eatre envisag\u00e9es, il ne lui a fourni, \u00e0 chaque \u00e9tape du processus, que les renseignements qui lui permettraient d\u2019obtenir la mesure d\u2019adaptation qui lui semblait, \u00e0 lui, la plus souhaitable. Il est manifeste qu\u2019en ne remettant pas \u00e0 la sp\u00e9cialiste du sommeil des renseignements complets sur la nature du travail qu\u2019il effectuait, il a nui \u00e0 l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 des recommandations qu\u2019elle allait formuler.\n[117] Le plaignant a \u00e9galement manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de fournir au CFCP des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 jour afin de faciliter les efforts en vue de le remettre au travail. Il a eu tendance \u00e0 faire mettre \u00e0 jour son dossier m\u00e9dical seulement lorsqu\u2019on lui proposait en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi des solutions qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas compatibles avec les restrictions m\u00e9dicales qu\u2019appelait son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Cela \u00e9tant, les intim\u00e9s, et notamment l\u2019employeur, ont toujours eu un temps de retard dans le processus d\u2019accommodement, ce qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 une forte d\u00e9perdition d\u2019effort lorsqu\u2019on a envisag\u00e9 d\u2019adapter les fonctions de contrema\u00eetre aux besoins particuliers du plaignant.\n[118] Et enfin, le plaignant n\u2019a pas, comme il aurait d\u00fb le faire, assur\u00e9 la mise \u00e0 jour de sa fiche de demande, ce qui l\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9 de recevoir tous les quarts de travail auxquels il pouvait pr\u00e9tendre. Au lieu de cela, il a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer les mesures d\u2019accommodement qu\u2019il jugeait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rables.\nVII. Indemnisation\n[119] Dans ses observations finales et lors de son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 les formes d\u2019indemnisation auxquelles il pr\u00e9tendait:\na. l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 maximum pr\u00e9vue aux articles 53(2)e) et 53(3) de la LCDP, soit la somme de 20 000 $ au titre de chacune de ces dispositions;\nb. le recouvrement, au titre de l\u2019article 53(2)c), de ses pertes de salaire, soit la diff\u00e9rence entre ce que le plaignant aurait, selon lui, gagn\u00e9 en travaillant \u00e0 plein temps en service non assign\u00e9, et le salaire qu\u2019il a effectivement touch\u00e9 en service assign\u00e9;\nc. le recouvrement des montants dont ont \u00e9t\u00e9 amput\u00e9s ses gains ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension du fait qu\u2019il a travaill\u00e9 en service assign\u00e9 plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en service non assign\u00e9.\n[120] Compte tenu des conclusions du Tribunal sur la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019est pas strictement n\u00e9cessaire de se prononcer sur la question du redressement. Au cas o\u00f9 les conclusions auxquelles le Tribunal est parvenu sur la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 ne seraient pas celles qui conviennent, il pourrait \u00eatre utile cependant de consigner un certain nombre de conclusions concernant un \u00e9ventuel redressement. En ce qui concerne l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire au titre de l\u2019article 53(2)c), le plaignant n\u2019a pas pu d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il avait effectivement \u00e9prouv\u00e9 une perte de revenu, une baisse de ses gains ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension ou une r\u00e9duction de ses prestations de pension. Il ressort clairement des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve livr\u00e9s par le CFCP, que le plaignant n\u2019a d\u2019ailleurs pas contest\u00e9s, qu\u2019il n\u2019a subi aucune perte de revenu, mais qu\u2019au contraire ses gains se sont maintenus et qu\u2019ils ont m\u00eame augment\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite. Cela est vraisemblablement d\u00fb au fait qu\u2019en service assign\u00e9 il a pu se pr\u00e9senter r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement au travail, alors qu\u2019en service non assign\u00e9, il avait d\u00fb, en raison d\u2019une incapacit\u00e9 m\u00e9dicale, manquer de nombreux quarts.\n[121] Pour calculer sa perte de revenu, le plaignant s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle il aurait continu\u00e9, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite, \u00e0 travailler en service non assign\u00e9 ailleurs qu\u2019\u00e0 sa gare d\u2019attache. Or, ainsi que nous l\u2019avons relev\u00e9 plus haut, et au dire de son propre t\u00e9moin, le plaignant \u00e9tait m\u00e9dicalement incapable d\u2019effectuer ce travail. Pourtant, il a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9valuer sa perte de salaire en comparant ce qu\u2019il avait gagn\u00e9 entre 2011 et 2015 \u00e0 ce que lui avaient dit gagner les autres ML travaillant \u00e0 Lethbridge en service non assign\u00e9.\n[122] L\u2019argument qu\u2019il avance sur ce point soul\u00e8ve un certain nombre de questions. La premi\u00e8re est que, \u00e0 supposer que les autres employ\u00e9s aient \u00e9t\u00e9 exacts et v\u00e9ridiques dans ce qu\u2019ils disaient au plaignant au sujet de leurs gains, rien ne permet de savoir le nombre d\u2019heures de travail assur\u00e9es par ces employ\u00e9s, ou la longueur des trajets effectu\u00e9s. Le plaignant n\u2019a fourni aucune preuve documentaire pour \u00e9tayer ses dires, et n\u2019a appel\u00e9 aucun coll\u00e8gue \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Le nombre d\u2019heures de travail effectu\u00e9es et la longueur des trajets auraient en effet une incidence sensible sur le montant des gains. La seconde question qui se pose \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est que, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 la gare de Lethbridge il n\u2019y a pas, pour les appels au travail, de plage horaire comprise entre de 5 h \u00e0 17 h, aucun de ces ML n\u2019effectuait de quarts de travail auxquels ils n\u2019auraient pu \u00eatre affect\u00e9s qu\u2019\u00e0 ces heures pr\u00e9cises. Il n\u2019est donc pas possible d\u2019\u00e9valuer l\u2019incidence qu\u2019aurait pu avoir sur leurs gains le fait de ne r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des appels au travail qu\u2019entre 5 h et 17 h. Le plaignant n\u2019a lui\u2011m\u00eame jamais contest\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait dans l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de travailler en service non assign\u00e9 sans cette limite impos\u00e9e aux heures auxquelles il pouvait r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un appel au travail. Il est par cons\u00e9quent impossible de comparer son revenu \u00e0 celui des autres ML \u00e0 qui la compagnie pouvait faire appel \u00e0 toute heure. Troisi\u00e8mement, m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019\u00e0 la gare de Lethbridge le plaignant travaillait en service non assign\u00e9 sans restriction d\u2019horaire, son revenu annuel \u00e9tait de beaucoup inf\u00e9rieur aux salaires que touchaient selon lui les autres ML. C\u2019est ainsi, par exemple, qu\u2019en 2009, avant d\u2019\u00e9prouver des troubles du rythme circadien, le plaignant n\u2019a touch\u00e9 que 67 060,83 $ en travaillant en service non assign\u00e9 sans aucune restriction m\u00e9dicale. Il a malgr\u00e9 tout fait valoir que sa perte de revenu devrait \u00eatre calcul\u00e9e sur la base d\u2019un montant de 120 000 $ ou 110 000 $ par an. Ces deux montants d\u00e9passent de beaucoup ce qu\u2019il pouvait gagner en tant que ML travaillant, sans restriction, en service non assign\u00e9. Sa r\u00e9clamation fond\u00e9e sur cette comparaison salariale n\u2019est, par cons\u00e9quent, pas fond\u00e9e.\n[123] Le plaignant a \u00e9galement fait valoir une perte des gains ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension due \u00e0 la baisse de revenu qu\u2019il aurait subie entre 2011 et 2015. Cette r\u00e9clamation n\u2019est, elle non plus, pas fond\u00e9e et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve fournis \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard par le CFCP, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re claire et succincte, d\u00e9montrent que la perte \u00e9ventuelle de gains ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension d\u00e9coulant du processus d\u2019accommodement a \u00e9t\u00e9 faible, voire n\u00e9gligeable, puisqu\u2019elle n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 que de quelques dollars par mois. De telles pertes auront par ailleurs \u00e9t\u00e9 compens\u00e9es par une augmentation des gains ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension r\u00e9sultant du salaire sup\u00e9rieur qu\u2019il a touch\u00e9 dans le cadre du poste adapt\u00e9 qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9. J\u2019estime par ailleurs que compte tenu du caract\u00e8re variable du revenu du plaignant, revenu qui, en effet, avait tendance \u00e0 fluctuer d\u2019un mois \u00e0 l\u2019autre et d\u2019une ann\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019autre, avant comme apr\u00e8s le processus d\u2019accommodement, l\u2019impact que cela a pu avoir sur le montant de ses gains ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension se situe dans la fourchette du revenu que le plaignant avait toujours touch\u00e9 et toucherait toujours en tant que ML travaillant pour le CFCP. Cela \u00e9tant, il est impossible de dire si des mesures d\u2019accommodement diff\u00e9rentes auraient assur\u00e9 au plaignant de plus gros gains ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension, et une plus forte pension de retraite.\nVIII. Conclusion\n[124] Le plaignant n\u2019a pas pu produire de preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille. Son t\u00e9moignage et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019il a produits ne d\u00e9montrent pas que ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en restant \u00e0 Lethbridge qu\u2019il pouvait satisfaire \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de s\u2019occuper de ses parents. Ajoutons que si la CFTC n'a, dans le cadre du plan de retour au travail, rien dit de la situation de famille du plaignant, et si le syndicat a fini par lui proposer une mutation, le plaignant n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager, mais, au contraire, ses besoins d\u2019accommodement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaits \u00e0 Lethbridge \u00e0 toutes les \u00e9poques en cause.\n[125] Le CFCP intim\u00e9 a reconnu que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience. Mais, m\u00eame sans cet aveu de la part du CFCP, le plaignant a rapport\u00e9 la preuve prima facie de discrimination en d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019on l\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9, en raison d\u2019une incapacit\u00e9 m\u00e9dicale, de travailler en tant que ML sans restrictions. Ainsi que je l\u2019ai pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 plus haut, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le CFCP a pleinement r\u00e9pondu aux besoins particuliers du plaignant, l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement incombant \u00e0 la CFTC n\u2019a pas jou\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. De plus, en raison des circonstances de cette affaire, la CFTC n\u2019a elle\u2011m\u00eame pas eu \u00e0 prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation ou \u00e0 envisager de d\u00e9placer un autre employ\u00e9.\n[126] La restriction, discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, impos\u00e9e par le CFCP constitue, cependant, une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e visant \u00e0 assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, tant celle du plaignant que celle du public, puisque les fonctions exerc\u00e9es par le plaignant \u00e9taient essentielles \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Ajoutons qu\u2019en adoptant cette restriction, l\u2019employeur croyait sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. \u00c0 toutes les \u00e9poques en cause, les besoins d\u2019accommodement du plaignant ont d\u2019ailleurs \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaits tant qu\u2019il n\u2019en a pas r\u00e9sult\u00e9 une contrainte excessive pour l\u2019employeur. L\u2019employeur lui a offert un accommodement raisonnable en proposant une mutation, trois quarts de travail par semaine en service assign\u00e9 avec la possibilit\u00e9 de postuler des quarts suppl\u00e9mentaires, puis, \u00e0 partir de f\u00e9vrier 2012, l\u2019affectation \u00e0 cinq quarts de travail par semaine en service assign\u00e9. Et enfin, compte tenu des efforts de l\u2019employeur, le fait que le plaignant n\u2019ait pas facilit\u00e9 le processus d\u2019accommodement r\u00e8gle enti\u00e8rement la question de sa r\u00e9clamation.\n[127] Dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 les conclusions auxquelles le Tribunal est parvenu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille ou sur une d\u00e9ficience \u2014 y compris au sujet de l\u2019EPJ \u2014 seraient jug\u00e9es erron\u00e9es, je consid\u00e8re que le plaignant n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait subi une perte de salaire ou de pension de retraite en raison des restrictions que le CFCP a impos\u00e9es sur son travail.\n[128] Les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des intim\u00e9s, le CFCP et la CFTC, sont rejet\u00e9es.\nSign\u00e9 par\nRicki T.

Contexte\n[1] La plaignante dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier, Mme Nicole Grace Valenti, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (Commission) le 15 avril 2013, qui a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e le 27 ao\u00fbt 2014.\n[2] La plaignante all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination en violation de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP).\n[3] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle pr\u00e9tend que son employeur a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard au motif d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience et l\u2019a trait\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rentielle d\u00e9favorable, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un accident de voiture li\u00e9 au travail, survenu le 28 septembre 2012.\n[4] Le 22 d\u00e9cembre 2015, en vertu de l\u2019article 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H\u20116 (la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb), la Commission a demand\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) d\u2019instruire la plainte.\n[5] Le 27 juin 2016, le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal m\u2019a confi\u00e9 l\u2019instruction de la plainte, et le processus de divulgation a commenc\u00e9.\nII. Requ\u00eate en divulgation de documents suppl\u00e9mentaires\n[6] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions (EDP) d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le 7 octobre 2016, la plaignante a divulgu\u00e9 environ 109 documents, et demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e la divulgation de 95 cat\u00e9gories de documents.\n[7] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a divulgu\u00e9 41 documents non privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s de son EDP d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le 18 novembre 2016. Le 15 d\u00e9cembre 2016, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a divulgu\u00e9 466 documents additionnels.\n[8] Une requ\u00eate en divulgation de documents suppl\u00e9mentaires a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la plaignante le 21 janvier 2017.\n[9] Le 10 f\u00e9vrier 2017, afin de r\u00e9duire consid\u00e9rablement le nombre de documents en litige soulev\u00e9s dans la requ\u00eate de la plaignante, j\u2019ai envoy\u00e9 des directives \u00e9crites aux parties.\n[10] Afin de faciliter le processus visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le rapport de chaque document produit avec une cat\u00e9gorie de documents demand\u00e9s, j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de transmettre \u00e0 la plaignante une table de concordance.\n[11] Apr\u00e8s de nombreux \u00e9changes de courriels entre les parties pendant les mois de mars \u00e0 juin, ainsi que la divulgation de nouveaux documents, une table de concordance finale a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite, accompagn\u00e9e de quelque trente demandes de documents toujours en litige. La table contenait des observations des deux parties relativement \u00e0 chacun des documents en litige.\n[12] En vue de trancher la question de la requ\u00eate en divulgation de documents suppl\u00e9mentaires, j\u2019ai convoqu\u00e9 les parties \u00e0 une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance (CTGI), qui a eu lieu le 29 juin 2017. \u00c0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, 21 demandes de documents \u00e9taient toujours en litige et chaque partie a eu l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter ses arguments de vive voix relativement \u00e0 chacune de ces demandes.\n[13] Bien que la Commission ne compte pas participer \u00e0 l\u2019audience, elle a pris part \u00e0 la CTGI, faisant valoir sa position \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de certains documents.\n[14] La CTGI a d\u00e9bouch\u00e9 sur une entente des parties sur cinq (5) des demandes de documents, suivie de la divulgation compl\u00e8te de ces documents.\n[15] Pour ce qui est des seize (16) autres demandes de documents, j\u2019ai inform\u00e9 les parties que je trancherais chacune des demandes et que je rendrais ma d\u00e9cision par \u00e9crit.\nIII. R\u00e8gles du Tribunal et jurisprudence\n[16] L\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure (R\u00e8gles) du Tribunal traite de l\u2019EDP, de la divulgation et de la production de documents.\n[17] L\u2019article 6(1)d) est particuli\u00e8rement pertinent et il \u00e9nonce ce qui suit :\nChaque partie doit signifier et d\u00e9poser dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le membre instructeur un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions indiquant :\n[\u2026]\nd) les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u2013 pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 \u2013 et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle;\n[18] L\u2019article 6(5) des R\u00e8gles rend obligatoire la divulgation continue dans les circonstances d\u00e9crites.\n[19] La jurisprudence \u00e9tablit clairement que la norme applicable \u00e0 la divulgation de documents conform\u00e9ment aux articles 6(1)d) et 6(5) des R\u00e8gles est celle de la \u00ab pertinence probable \u00bb.\n[20] La \u00ab pertinence probable \u00bb s\u2019entend du fait qu\u2019un document dont on demande la divulgation doit avoir un lien ou un lien rationnel avec un fait, une question ou un redressement recherch\u00e9 ou identifi\u00e9 par une partie (Guay c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2004 TCDP 34 (\u00ab Guay \u00bb), au paragraphe 42; Seeley c. La compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2013 TCDP 18 (\u00ab Seeley \u00bb), au paragraphe 6).\n[21] Une demande de divulgation ne doit pas \u00eatre \u00ab sp\u00e9culative ou \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une \" partie de p\u00eache \" \u00bb (Guay, au paragraphe 43).\n[22] J\u2019ajouterais qu\u2019une partie doit d\u00e9montrer \u2014 non pas que la preuve est pertinente au sens traditionnel du mot \u2014 mais que la divulgation d\u2019un tel document sera utile, est appropri\u00e9e, est susceptible de faire progresser le d\u00e9bat et repose sur un objectif acceptable qu\u2019elle cherche \u00e0 atteindre dans le dossier, et que le document se rapporte au litige (S.C.C.E.P. c. Bell Canada, 2005 TCDP 34, au paragraphe 11).\n[23] Plus important encore, il faut \u00e9tablir le lien entre les questions \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer et les documents demand\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire dont est saisi le Tribunal \u2014 et non dans un autre dossier devant un autre tribunal ou une autre cour (Warman c. Bahr, 2006 TCDP 18, (\u00ab Warman \u00bb) aux paragraphes 6, 7 et 9).\n[24] La question en litige est celle de savoir si un document admis en preuve au cours d\u2019une audience peut avoir une incidence sur la conclusion du Tribunal eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un fait, un point de droit en litige, ou la justification d\u2019un redressement demand\u00e9? Dans l\u2019affirmative, le document est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir une pertinence probable et il devrait \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9. Il ne suffit pas que le nom de l\u2019une des parties apparaisse sur le document pour que celui-ci prenne une pertinence probable.\n[25] Enfin, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il existe une raison de croire qu\u2019une partie ne respecte pas l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles de bonne foi ou avec diligence raisonnable, il est d\u2019usage au Tribunal, une fois qu\u2019une telle liste est compl\u00e9t\u00e9e par une partie et que toutes les demandes de divulgation pr\u00e9cises ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es, d\u2019accepter la divulgation faite comme \u00e9tant une divulgation compl\u00e8te de cette partie, \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0. Les parties ont des obligations permanentes conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 6(5) des R\u00e8gles, mais ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de suffit habituellement pour confirmer que telle ou telle partie n\u2019a pas en sa possession d\u2019autres documents ayant une pertinence probable.\nIV. D\u00e9cision\n[26] Gardant \u00e0 l\u2019esprit ce cadre juridique, ma d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chaque document demand\u00e9 se pr\u00e9sente dans les termes qui suivent. Dans le tableau ci\u2011dessous, le num\u00e9ro de chaque document demand\u00e9 est identique \u00e0 celui qui figure dans la derni\u00e8re table de concordance produite par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e durant la CTGI. Seules les seize (16) demandes de documents faisant encore l\u2019objet d\u2019un litige sont mentionn\u00e9es dans le tableau.\nDocuments en litige\nD\u00e9cision du Tribunal\nC110\nC111\nC113\nC114\nC116\nC117\nCompte tenu de la d\u00e9claration de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle elle a divulgu\u00e9 tous les documents pertinents trouv\u00e9s et, en l\u2019absence de tout \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve portant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e pourrait agir de mauvaise foi, ou que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne coop\u00e8re pas, le Tribunal ne peut pas demander que davantage de renseignements soient divulgu\u00e9s relativement \u00e0 ces demandes. Le Tribunal souscrit \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle le CFCP ne poss\u00e8de pas le document demand\u00e9 par la plaignante.\nC119\nLes documents demand\u00e9s par la plaignante aux fins de la divulgation satisfont au crit\u00e8re de la pertinence probable et les renseignements demand\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s. Il existe un lien rationnel entre l\u2019entente de l\u2019\u00e9quipe responsable des prestations du CP avec Manuvie et la politique et la proc\u00e9dure en mati\u00e8re de prestations non syndiqu\u00e9es demand\u00e9es et le redressement sollicit\u00e9 par la plaignante. Je renvoie ici particuli\u00e8rement aux paragraphes 35, 149 et 150 et 161(ix) de l\u2019EDP de la plaignante. La demande de la plaignante en vue de la divulgation de ces documents sp\u00e9cifiques ne peut pas \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e de partie de p\u00eache. J\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de divulguer ces documents aux parties d\u2019ici le 18 ao\u00fbt 2017.\nC153\nLa plaignante ne peut pas simplement demander la divulgation de tous les documents concernant certains individus parce qu\u2019elle cro\u00eet qu\u2019ils pourraient \u00eatre utiles. Cela \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 une partie de p\u00eache (voir Guay, au paragraphe 43). Je souscris \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 son explication selon laquelle elle a divulgu\u00e9 tous les documents pertinents relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente demande, et je note l\u2019engagement pris par l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 lors de la CTGI portant que le CFCP respectera son obligation de produire des renseignements de fa\u00e7on continue si d\u2019autres documents sont trouv\u00e9s.\nC165\nLe Tribunal souscrit \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la divulgation de ce document et prend acte de l\u2019engagement pris par l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e lors de la CTGI portant que le CFCP respectera son obligation de produire des renseignements de fa\u00e7on continue si d\u2019autres documents sont trouv\u00e9s.\nC179\nPour cette demande en particulier, la plaignante fait une analogie avec la politique en mati\u00e8re de \u00ab consentement \u00e0 la divulgation de renseignements \u00bb de CFCP. Je comprends la raison pour laquelle la plaignante fait cette comparaison, mais celle\u2011ci n\u2019est pas utile ni applicable dans le contexte des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles, le crit\u00e8re en mati\u00e8re de divulgation est la pertinence probable des documents demand\u00e9s. La pertinence probable signifie que les documents demand\u00e9s doivent avoir un lien ou un lien rationnel avec un fait, une question ou un redressement recherch\u00e9 ou identifi\u00e9 par une partie (Seeley, au paragraphe 6; Guay, au paragraphe 42). Pour cette demande sp\u00e9cifique, il est \u00e9vident que la plaignante n\u2019est pas suffisamment pr\u00e9cise quant \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle cherche exactement et sa demande constitue donc une partie de p\u00eache. Le Tribunal partage l\u2019avis de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et souscrit \u00e0 sa d\u00e9claration selon laquelle les documents pertinents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s et que le CFCP n\u2019a en sa possession aucun autre document pertinent ayant trait \u00e0 cette demande.\nC178\nC188\nC191\nLa plaignante ne peut pas simplement demander tous les documents ayant trait \u00e0 certains individus parce qu\u2019elle croit qu\u2019ils seraient utiles. Cela constituerait une partie de p\u00eache (voir Guay, au paragraphe 43). Compte tenu de la d\u00e9claration de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle elle a divulgu\u00e9 tous les documents pertinents trouv\u00e9s, et en l\u2019absence de tout \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve portant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e pourrait agir de mauvaise foi, ou que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne coop\u00e8re pas, le Tribunal ne peut demander une divulgation accrue relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente demande. Le Tribunal accepte la d\u00e9claration de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nC204\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 n\u2019avoir aucun document en sa possession ayant trait \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente demande. La plaignante a cit\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal Ledoux c. Premi\u00e8re nation de Gambler, 2017 TCDP 13, (\u00ab Ledoux \u00bb) comme exemple d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 une partie de produire des documents qui \u00e9taient en possession d\u2019un tiers. L\u2019obligation de production m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019un document se trouve entre les mains d\u2019un tiers a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue par le Tribunal dans une autre d\u00e9cision, l\u2019affaire Rai c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2013 TCDP 6, aux paragraphes 33-35.\n\u00c0 titre de client d\u2019un fournisseur de t\u00e9l\u00e9phonie mobile, le CFCP est effectivement en mesure d\u2019obtenir de tels documents ainsi que des renseignements tels que les relev\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire de son fournisseur. S\u2019opposer \u00e0 la production d\u2019un ou de plusieurs documents en possession d\u2019un tiers mais \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels celui\u2011ci a un droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s contrevient \u00e0 l\u2019esprit de l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles. Je souscris \u00e0 cet argument soulev\u00e9 par la plaignante. Cependant, cela ne suffit pas pour ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de produire de tels documents. En effet, de tels documents doivent \u00eatre pertinents. De plus, il faut examiner la pertinence probable dans le contexte d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 l\u2019ordonnance de divulgation est sollicit\u00e9e (voir Warman, paragraphes 6-7, 9). Il semble que les documents demand\u00e9s ont trait \u00e0 la cause de la CSPAAT et la pertinence des documents demand\u00e9s au titre de l\u2019appel de la plaignante \u00e0 la CSPAAT n\u2019est pas un examen appropri\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce dans la cause instruite par le Tribunal. Le Tribunal souligne que les faits que tente d\u2019\u00e9tablir la plaignante au moyen de ces documents \u2013 son \u00e9tat d\u2019esprit \u2013 peuvent \u00eatre mieux examin\u00e9s au moyen du t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante lors de l\u2019audience, ainsi que gr\u00e2ce aux rapports m\u00e9dicaux, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019au moyen des relev\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire qui ne permettraient d\u2019\u00e9tablir que l\u2019heure et le lieu des appels.\nC206\nLa plaignante n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 comment les dossiers de v\u00e9hicule demand\u00e9s sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 un fait en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, comme le pr\u00e9cise les EDPs. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ne conteste pas le fait que la plaignante \u00e9tait impliqu\u00e9e dans un accident de voiture. Ainsi, le Tribunal ne croit pas que les documents demand\u00e9s ont une pertinence probable.\nC207\nCompte tenu de la d\u00e9claration de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle elle avait divulgu\u00e9 tous les documents pertinents trouv\u00e9s et en l\u2019absence de tout \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve selon lequel l\u2019intim\u00e9e pourrait agir de mauvaise foi, ou que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne coop\u00e8re pas, le Tribunal ne peut pas demander la divulgation de documents suppl\u00e9mentaires relativement \u00e0 cette demande. Le Tribunal souscrit \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. En outre, le Tribunal souligne que les faits que la plaignante tente d\u2019\u00e9tablir au moyen de la pr\u00e9sente demande de document peuvent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s lors du t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAnie Perrault\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nLe\n18 juillet 2017\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal :\nT2126\/4215\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nNicole Grace Valenti c.

Contexte\n[1] Le 16 d\u00e9cembre 2013, le Tribunal a rendu la d\u00e9cision 2013 TCDP 34 (l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9), dans laquelle il a ordonn\u00e9 que certains documents \u2013 \u00e0 savoir les manuels des \u00e9valuateurs du programme de formation des recrues pour les points d\u2019entr\u00e9e (FORPE) et les r\u00e9sultats obtenus par plusieurs des camarades de classe du plaignant \u00e0 l\u2019examen administr\u00e9 dans le contexte du programme FORPE \u2013 soient prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 52 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (la Loi). Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement assujetti l\u2019utilisation des documents \u00e0 certaines modalit\u00e9s, \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9.\nII. Requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en vue du traitement confidentiel de certains autres documents\n[2] Le plaignant a r\u00e9cemment demand\u00e9 la divulgation d\u2019autres documents, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019ensemble des simulations effectu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de d\u00e9termination II (D-II) dans le contexte desquelles le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9, notamment la simulation correcte \u00e9valu\u00e9e par Kevin Phillips, ainsi que tous les rapports d\u2019\u00e9valuation concernant les autres candidats du groupe du plaignant r\u00e9dig\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de d\u00e9termination I (D-I).\n[3] L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 devrait \u00e9galement s\u2019appliquer aux autres pages du mat\u00e9riel d\u2019examen du programme FORPE, parce que les sc\u00e9narios de simulation sont du m\u00eame type que ceux qui sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 et que les documents en question sont de nature d\u00e9licate et confidentielle. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que les motifs et l\u2019analyse pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par le Tribunal dans l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 s\u2019appliquent aussi \u00e0 ces documents.\n[4] L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande \u00e9galement au Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance pour \u00e9tendre l\u2019application du paragraphe 30 de l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 \u00e0 ces documents.\nIII. Position du plaignant\n[5] Le plaignant a consenti \u00e0 ce que l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 s\u2019applique aux documents mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe 2 ci-dessus.\nIV. Conclusions tir\u00e9es de l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9\n[6] Dans l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9, le Tribunal a conclu ce qui suit :\n[22] C\u2019est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du Canada et de ses r\u00e9sidents que les ASF soient correctement form\u00e9s, s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s et qualifi\u00e9s pour accomplir cet important travail. C\u2019est ce \u00e0 quoi aspire le programme FORPE. Le programme FORPE fonctionne aussi selon les exigences de la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique, qui pr\u00e9voit que les nominations au sein de la fonction publique doivent \u00eatre ax\u00e9es sur le m\u00e9rite et qu\u2019elles doivent \u00eatre non partisanes, et, en outre, que ces valeurs doivent \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9es. \u00c0 cette fin, l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 des documents relatifs au programme FORPE \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb doit \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9e; autrement, il existe un risque r\u00e9el que le mat\u00e9riel d\u2019examen de formation ainsi que les sc\u00e9narios d\u2019\u00e9valuation du programme FORPE soient divulgu\u00e9s, que ce soit intentionnellement ou par inadvertance, et des candidats non m\u00e9ritants pourraient r\u00e9ussir ces examens. Cela n\u2019aurait pas seulement pour effet de compromettre le principe de m\u00e9rite et de faire peser sur l\u2019intim\u00e9e une contrainte excessive, mais cela compromettrait \u00e9galement la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public.\n[23] [...] si les documents de l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb \u00e9taient rendus publics au cours de l\u2019instruction, ou du fait que cette instruction est publique, il y aurait un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions touchant la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et de questions personnelles ou autre pour les personnes concern\u00e9es, notamment l\u2019intim\u00e9e, de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher leur divulgation, pour d\u2019autres raisons que celles qui sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans l\u2019ordonnance ci-dessous, l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique.\nV.

R\u00e9sum\u00e9\n[1] Vu la nature g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et syst\u00e9mique de la plainte, et le crit\u00e8re relativement peu exigeant applicable \u00e0 la production de documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la divulgation, je suis arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la conclusion que le Rapport Nance est potentiellement pertinent quant aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte. Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-dessous, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 Air Canada de produire le Rapport Nance, ainsi que tous les autres documents qui sont en sa possession, sous son autorit\u00e9 ou sous sa garde, et qui refl\u00e8tent la contribution d\u2019Air Canada ou de ses employ\u00e9s \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration ou \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre du Rapport Nance, dans la mesure o\u00f9 de tels documents existent et qu\u2019ils ne sont pas confidentiels.\n[2] La Commission a aussi demand\u00e9 la production de documents se rapportant au syst\u00e8me de soumission des pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences utilis\u00e9 pour \u00e9tablir les horaires des pilotes. Air Canada a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas d\u2019autres documents susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s en l\u2019occurrence.\n[3] \u00c0 la demande de la pilote XY, qui fait l\u2019objet du Rapport Nance, j\u2019ai aussi rendu une s\u00e9rie d\u2019ordonnances visant \u00e0 assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de son identit\u00e9 lors de la divulgation du Rapport Nance et de toute utilisation ult\u00e9rieure du rapport, et ce, pour toute la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019instruction de la plainte par le Tribunal.\nII. Contexte\n[4] En mai 2012, Jane Clegg (Mme Clegg ou la plaignante) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de son ancien employeur, Air Canada. Selon ladite plainte (la plainte), elle aurait subi, dans le cadre de son emploi \u00e0 titre de pilote, un traitement d\u00e9favorable en raison de son sexe.\n[5] La Commission a enqu\u00eat\u00e9 sur la plainte et a publi\u00e9 un rapport recommandant que la plainte soit instruite par le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le TCDP ou le Tribunal). Le 15 juin 2016, le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi de la plainte.\n[6] En avril 2017, les parties ont inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que le processus de divulgation \u00e9tait termin\u00e9, et une date d\u2019audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e au mois d\u2019octobre 2017.\n[7] Le 25 avril 2017, l\u2019avocate d\u2019Air Canada a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal qu\u2019un rapport r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par le commandant de bord John Nance en juin 2014 dans le cadre d\u2019une autre proc\u00e9dure (le Rapport Nance) \u2014 qui n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9 \u2014 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 produit par inadvertance pendant l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission. Air Canada a en d\u00e9finitive soutenu que le document n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pertinent au regard de la plainte et qu\u2019il contenait des renseignements personnels concernant une tierce partie.\n[8] La Commission et la plaignante ont fait valoir que le document \u00e9tait effectivement pertinent quant \u00e0 la plainte et qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ad\u00e9quatement produit. Elles ont indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elles avaient l\u2019intention de s\u2019appuyer sur le Rapport Nance \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[9] Les parties ont convenu qu\u2019Air Canada retirerait le document et que la Commission pr\u00e9senterait une requ\u00eate sollicitant l\u2019autorisation de le produire, ce qu\u2019elle a fait depuis.\n[10] Comme des questions de confidentialit\u00e9 avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es en ce qui concerne la personne vis\u00e9e par le Rapport Nance (que j\u2019appellerai \u00ab la pilote XY \u00bb), la pilote XY a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de la requ\u00eate de la Commission et s\u2019est vu offrir la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter au Tribunal des observations \u00e0 propos de la confidentialit\u00e9, ce qu\u2019elle a fait.\nA. La plainte\n[11] Mme Clegg soutient avoir subi un traitement d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9 sur le sexe relativement \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie d\u2019incidents pr\u00e9cis survenus entre juillet 2009 et avril 2013 et \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse d\u2019Air Canada \u00e0 ces incidents.\n[12] La plaignante et la Commission d\u00e9posent \u00e9galement une plainte de discrimination syst\u00e9mique de port\u00e9e plus large au sujet du harc\u00e8lement sexiste dont sont victimes les femmes pilotes d\u2019Air Canada. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, dans le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de sa plainte, Mme Clegg soutient que le harc\u00e8lement sexiste constitue un probl\u00e8me fr\u00e9quemment v\u00e9cu par les femmes pilotes d\u2019Air Canada et qu\u2019[traduction] \u00ab Air Canada fait syst\u00e9matiquement preuve d\u2019ambivalence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du harc\u00e8lement \u00bb. De plus, au paragraphe 20f) (sic) de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, Mme Clegg r\u00e9clame une mesure de redressement g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et syst\u00e9mique, soit la [traduction] \u00ab modification, en consultation avec la Commission, des politiques et des proc\u00e9dures de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en ce qui concerne le harc\u00e8lement sexiste \u00bb.\n[13] La CCDP soutient que le syst\u00e8me de soumission des pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences utilis\u00e9 pour \u00e9tablir les horaires est source de discrimination syst\u00e9mique dans son application aux femmes pilotes qui estiment avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes de harc\u00e8lement ou de discrimination.\n[14] Sur la base de ces all\u00e9gations, et aux fins de l\u2019analyse qui suit, j\u2019estime que la plainte porte sur la discrimination syst\u00e9mique dont sont victimes les femmes pilotes d\u2019Air Canada en raison de leur sexe.\nB. Le Rapport Nance\n[15] Le Rapport Nance a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par le commandant de bord John Nance en juin 2014. L\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada (APAC) avait retenu les services du commandant Nance pour qu\u2019il produise un rapport portant sur un grief d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par l\u2019APAC, au nom de la pilote XY, contre Air Canada. La pilote XY et l\u2019APAC ne sont pas actuellement parties \u00e0 la plainte.\n[16] En examinant la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, j\u2019ai d\u2019abord tent\u00e9 de rendre ma d\u00e9cision sans lire le Rapport Nance. Cependant, vu le litige factuel qui oppose les parties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate sur l\u2019objet du Rapport Nance, et compte tenu du fait qu\u2019aucune partie ne s\u2019est oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 ce que je le consulte, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable d\u2019en prendre connaissance pour savoir s\u2019il contient des renseignements potentiellement pertinents quant \u00e0 la plainte.\n[17] C\u2019est donc ce que j\u2019ai fait. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de cet examen du rapport et des observations des parties et aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente analyse, j\u2019arrive (notamment) \u00e0 la conclusion que les sujets suivants sont abord\u00e9s dans le Rapport Nance :\nun aper\u00e7u g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des d\u00e9veloppements en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 a\u00e9rienne survenus \u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 1970, avec une attention particuli\u00e8re aux cons\u00e9quences de l\u2019erreur humaine sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des vols;\nles effets d\u2019une distraction des membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipage sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des vols, notamment les effets de la pornographie \u00e0 titre de distraction, et plus particuli\u00e8rement, ses effets sur les femmes pilotes dans un secteur domin\u00e9 par les hommes;\ndans une perspective de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 a\u00e9rienne, l\u2019attention et le soutien particuliers qui doivent \u00eatre apport\u00e9s aux pilotes susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre distraits;\nles effets des propos per\u00e7us comme racistes sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des vols;\nles obligations de l\u2019\u00e9quipage en ce qui concerne le mat\u00e9riel sexuellement explicite (y compris la pornographie);\nune \u00e9valuation de la r\u00e9ponse d\u2019Air Canada en ce qui concerne :\nle mat\u00e9riel sexuellement explicite trouv\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on syst\u00e9matique dans les postes de pilotage d\u2019Air Canada;\nles commentaires sexuels et\/ou racistes explicites \u00e9chang\u00e9s dans les postes de pilotage d\u2019Air Canada;\nl\u2019existence d\u2019un environnement de travail hostile ou malsain attribuable \u00e0 des incidents r\u00e9p\u00e9titifs ou propres \u00e0 la culture du milieu de travail en lien avec les points (1) ou (2) ci-dessus.\n[18] Je conviens avec Air Canada que le Rapport a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit dans le cadre d\u2019un grief portant sur la pornographie dans les postes de pilotage des avions d\u2019Air Canada pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par une tierce partie (APAC) au nom d\u2019une autre tierce partie (pilote XY). Je conviens \u00e9galement avec Air Canada que le commandant Nance poss\u00e8de de l\u2019expertise principalement en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 a\u00e9rienne et en ce qui concerne les effets de la distraction des pilotes sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des vols. Cependant, je ne souscris pas \u00e0 la th\u00e8se d\u2019Air Canada selon laquelle le rapport porte seulement sur [traduction] \u00ab la pornographie pr\u00e9sente dans les postes de pilotage et les effets de cette pornographie sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des vols \u00bb.\n[19] Il ressort de mon examen du Rapport Nance que l\u2019auteur proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation plus large de la culture d\u2019Air Canada en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement sexuel et de discrimination (dont peut faire partie l\u2019affichage de pornographie dans les postes de pilotage), \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode durant laquelle la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\nC. Questions en litige\nLe Rapport Nance a-t-il une pertinence pour les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte?\nDevrait-il \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9?\nLes autres documents relatifs au Rapport Nance et qui se trouvent en la possession ou sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 d\u2019Air Canada devraient-ils \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s?\nLes autres documents portant sur le syst\u00e8me de soumission des pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences devraient-ils \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s?\nSi le Rapport Nance fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une ordonnance de divulgation, quelles mesures de confidentialit\u00e9 devraient \u00eatre mises en place pour prot\u00e9ger les renseignements personnels confidentiels de la pilote XY?\nIII. QUESTION EN LITIGE 1 : Divulgation\nA. Le droit applicable\n[20] Le pouvoir qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019ordonner la production d\u2019un document d\u00e9coule de l\u2019article 50(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi), dont voici un extrait :\n\u00ab Le membre instructeur [\u2026] instruit la plainte pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9; il donne \u00e0 [toutes les parties ayant re\u00e7u l\u2019avis] la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations. \u00bb\net de l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, lequel pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\n\u00ab (1) Chaque partie doit signifier et d\u00e9poser dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le membre instructeur un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions indiquant :\nd) les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u2014 pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 \u2014 et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les faits et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle;\n(5) Une partie doit divulguer et produire les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires n\u00e9cessaires\nb) si elle constate qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9e correctement ou compl\u00e8tement aux alin\u00e9as 6(1)d) [\u2026]. \u00bb\n[21] Il est bien \u00e9tabli par la jurisprudence, et ce n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, que la norme applicable \u00e0 la divulgation de documents, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) et du paragraphe (5) des R\u00e8gles, est que les documents doivent \u00eatre en rapport avec un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e, y compris les faits, les questions ou les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties. Pour qu\u2019un document soit potentiellement pertinent, il doit y avoir un lien rationnel entre le document dont on demande la divulgation et une question ou un fait soulev\u00e9, ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e, par un tiers (Seeley c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2013 TCDP 18 (Seeley), au paragraphe 6).\n[22] Une demande de divulgation \u00ab ne doit pas \u00eatre sp\u00e9culative ou \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une \u201cpartie de p\u00eache\u201d \u00bb (Guay c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2004 TCDP 34 (Guay), au paragraphe 43), mais le crit\u00e8re est peu exigeant en ce qui concerne la production de documents potentiellement pertinents et actuellement on tend \u00e0 favoriser la divulgation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la production (Warman c. Bahr, 2006 TCDP 18, aux paragraphes 6 et 7; voir aussi Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 42, au paragraphe 11).\n[23] Dans Association des employ\u00e9(e)s de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication du Manitoba Inc. c. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 TCDP 28 (AETM), le Tribunal a conclu ce qui suit au paragraphe 4 :\nLa production de documents est assujettie au crit\u00e8re de la pertinence potentielle, qui n\u2019est pas un crit\u00e8re tr\u00e8s exigeant. Il doit y avoir une certaine pertinence entre le document ou les renseignements demand\u00e9s et la question en litige. Il ne fait aucun doute qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de veiller \u00e0 ce que tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents soient disponibles dans le cadre d\u2019une affaire comme celle en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Une partie a le droit d\u2019obtenir les renseignements ou les documents qui sont pertinents quant \u00e0 l\u2019affaire ou qui pourraient l\u2019\u00eatre. Cela ne veut pas dire que ces documents ou renseignements seront admis en preuve ou qu\u2019on leur accordera une importance significative.\n[24] Il convient par ailleurs de signaler que la divulgation de renseignements potentiellement pertinents ne veut pas dire que ces derniers seront admis en preuve au stade de l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire ou qu\u2019on leur accordera un poids important lors de la prise de d\u00e9cision (voir Yaffa c. Air Canada, 2014 TCDP 22, au paragraphe 5; voir aussi AETM, au paragraphe 4).\nB. Les positions des parties\n(i) La position de la Commission\n[25] La Commission soutient que le Rapport et tous les autres documents qui sont en la possession, sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 ou sous la garde d\u2019Air Canada et qui se rapportent \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration ou \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre du Rapport Nance (les \u00ab documents connexes \u00bb) sont pertinents quant \u00e0 la plainte, y compris quant aux mesures de redressement demand\u00e9es. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la Commission affirme que l\u2019analyse qui y est faite de l\u2019importance du soutien (ou du manque de soutien) offert par la compagnie a\u00e9rienne \u00e0 ses femmes pilotes \u2014 surtout celles qui affirment avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes de harc\u00e8lement ou de discrimination \u2014 cette analyse est pertinente en ce qui concerne la plainte. La Commission donne l\u2019utilisation par Air Canada du syst\u00e8me de soumission des pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences comme exemple du fait qu\u2019Air Canada n\u2019aurait pas offert de soutien aux femmes pilotes.\n[26] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la Commission demande la production des documents se rapportant au syst\u00e8me de soumission des pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences utilis\u00e9 par Air Canada pour \u00e9tablir les horaires des pilotes et des membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipage, y compris toute analyse comparative entre les sexes ou toute autre analyse qu\u2019aurait faite Air Canada du syst\u00e8me et de la fa\u00e7on dont il est utilis\u00e9.\n[27] Enfin, la Commission soutient que le Rapport et les documents connexes seraient pertinents quant aux mesures de redressement syst\u00e9miques qu\u2019elle demande puisqu\u2019ils aideraient le Tribunal \u00e0 comprendre les mesures d\u00e9j\u00e0 prises par Air Canada pour r\u00e9pondre aux pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte.\n(ii) La position de la plaignante\n[28] La plaignante a repris les observations de la Commission et a conclu que le Rapport Nance n\u2019est pas seulement pertinent, mais essentiel pour les besoins de la plainte puisqu\u2019il fournit un avis d\u2019expert et la preuve des cons\u00e9quences du harc\u00e8lement sexiste sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des vols. Mme Clegg ajoute que le Rapport pr\u00e9sente des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve se rapportant au pr\u00e9judice professionnel in\u00e9vitable caus\u00e9 aux femmes pilotes qui signalent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes de harc\u00e8lement et qui ne re\u00e7oivent pas un soutien appropri\u00e9 de leur compagnie.\n(iii) La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[29] Air Canada affirme que la port\u00e9e du Rapport est limit\u00e9e \u00e0 la question de la pornographie pr\u00e9sente dans les postes de pilotage des avions d\u2019Air Canada et que, par cons\u00e9quent, le Rapport ne pr\u00e9sente aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat pour l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la plainte de Mme Clegg, le syst\u00e8me de soumission des pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences et l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des horaires en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Air Canada soutient en outre que le Rapport porte sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des vols, ce qui n\u2019est pas (\u00e0 son avis) une question importante dans le contexte de la plainte.\n[30] Air Canada estime en outre que le Rapport et les documents connexes ne peuvent pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s puisqu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas de rapport avec la plainte ou (dans la mesure o\u00f9 de tels documents existent et peuvent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s) qu\u2019ils ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 produits.\n[31] S\u2019agissant de la demande de documents se rapportant au syst\u00e8me de soumission des pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences, Air Canada soutient que, dans la mesure o\u00f9 de tels documents existent et ne sont pas confidentiels, tous les documents ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s.\nC. Analyse\n[32] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, j\u2019estime que la plainte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal comprend une all\u00e9gation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de discrimination syst\u00e9mique contre les femmes pilotes d\u2019Air Canada. En outre, la plaignante et la Commission sollicitent des mesures de redressement syst\u00e9miques contre Air Canada dans le but, notamment, de modifier les politiques et les proc\u00e9dures relatives au harc\u00e8lement sexiste.\n(i) Le Rapport Nance et les documents connexes\n[33] Compte tenu de la nature g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la plainte, j\u2019estime que plusieurs aspects du Rapport Nance sont potentiellement pertinents quant aux questions soumises au Tribunal. Sans vouloir anticiper ou limiter les arguments que les parties pourraient pr\u00e9senter sur ce point \u00e0 l\u2019audience, des questions de la nature de celles qui sont d\u00e9crites ci-dessous pourraient \u00eatre pertinentes quant aux all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans la plainte et aux mesures de redressement sollicit\u00e9es.\nL\u2019attention et le soutien particuliers qui doivent \u00eatre apport\u00e9s aux pilotes qui pourraient avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes de harc\u00e8lement;\nLes diverses obligations de l\u2019\u00e9quipage en ce qui concerne les blagues, les commentaires ou les documents sexistes;\nUne \u00e9valuation des mesures prises par Air Canada en ce qui concerne :\nle mat\u00e9riel sexuellement explicite trouv\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on syst\u00e9matique dans les postes de pilotage d\u2019Air Canada;\nles commentaires sexuels explicites \u00e9chang\u00e9s dans les postes de pilotage d\u2019Air Canada;\nl\u2019existence d\u2019un environnement de travail hostile ou malsain attribuable \u00e0 des incidents \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel.\n[34] La requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 obtenir la divulgation du Rapport Nance et des documents connexes remplit le crit\u00e8re de la pertinence et les renseignements demand\u00e9s devraient \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s. Il existe un lien rationnel entre les renseignements demand\u00e9s et les faits, les questions soulev\u00e9es et les mesures de redressement sollicit\u00e9es dans la plainte. On ne peut qualifier la requ\u00eate de \u00ab partie de p\u00eache \u00bb puisque les renseignements qui seront divulgu\u00e9s offriront aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leurs arguments.\n[35] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Rapport Nance et les documents connexes \u2013 dans la mesure o\u00f9 de tels documents existent et qu\u2019ils ne sont pas confidentiels \u2013 devraient, s\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 produits, \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s par Air Canada, sous r\u00e9serve des modalit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues dans les ordonnances qui figurent plus loin.\n[36] Il convient de souligner que la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance se rapporte \u00e0 la production des documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la divulgation et elle ne constitue pas une d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 l\u2019admission en preuve du Rapport Nance ou au poids qu\u2019on lui accordera \u00e0 l\u2019audience s\u2019il est admis, surtout s\u2019il est admis en l\u2019absence d\u2019un t\u00e9moignage de vive voix du commandant Nance ou sans contre-interrogatoire par Air Canada.\n(ii) Les documents se rapportant au syst\u00e8me de soumission des pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences\n[37] La Commission a demand\u00e9 les documents comportant une analyse ou une enqu\u00eate sur la raison pour laquelle des copilotes souhaitent modifier leurs horaires, ou soumettre des pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences, pour voler avec certains commandants de bord, y compris toute donn\u00e9e ou analyse de donn\u00e9e en fonction des sexes, quant au nombre de copilotes qui proc\u00e8dent de cette fa\u00e7on.\n[38] En ce qui concerne les documents demand\u00e9s par la Commission relativement au syst\u00e8me de soumission des pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019ils satisferaient facilement au crit\u00e8re de divulgation. Tous ces documents auraient d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00fb \u00eatre produits ou (aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal) devraient figurer sur la liste des documents pertinents pour lesquels Air Canada invoque un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation.\nIV. QUESTION EN LITIGE 2 : Confidentialit\u00e9 de la pilote XY\nA. Le droit applicable\n[39] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir de rendre une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 dans les circonstances appropri\u00e9es.\n[40] Selon l\u2019article 52(1)c) de la Loi, le Tribunal peut prendre toute mesure ou rendre toute ordonnance pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction s\u2019il est convaincu qu\u2019il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions personnelles ou autres et que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher cette divulgation dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des personnes concern\u00e9es l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique.\nB. Les positions des parties\n(i) La position de la pilote XY\n[41] La pilote XY soutient que la divulgation du Rapport Nance soul\u00e8ve des inqui\u00e9tudes s\u00e9rieuses quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9servation de la confidentialit\u00e9 de ses renseignements personnels (renseignements d\u2019identification) et pourrait lui causer un pr\u00e9judice injustifi\u00e9.\n[42] Bien que le Rapport Nance ait \u00e9t\u00e9 produit dans le contexte d\u2019un grief d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par l\u2019APAC au nom de la pilote XY, ce probl\u00e8me a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solu entre les parties et il semble que le rapport n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu public.\n[43] La pilote XY travaille toujours pour Air Canada et craint que la divulgation de ses renseignements d\u2019identification lui cause un pr\u00e9judice injustifi\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, la pilote XY a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de prendre diverses mesures pour prot\u00e9ger la confidentialit\u00e9 de ses renseignements, y compris :\nle caviardage du Rapport Nance de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 faire dispara\u00eetre les renseignements d\u2019identification;\nla destruction des copies non caviard\u00e9es du Rapport Nance;\nl\u2019anonymisation continue de la pilote XY;\nla non-divulgation du Rapport Nance et des renseignements d\u2019identification par le Tribunal;\nl\u2019imposition de limites \u00e0 la divulgation du Rapport Nance;\nen ce qui concerne la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019agir dans toute requ\u00eate ou proc\u00e9dure future portant sur le Rapport Nance.\n(ii) La position de la Commission\n[44] La Commission appuie les mesures qui auraient pour effet de prot\u00e9ger les renseignements d\u2019identification de la pilote XY.\n[45] Aucune autre partie n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019observations quant aux mesures de protection de la confidentialit\u00e9 demand\u00e9es par la pilote XY. Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande de la pilote XY n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9e.\nC. Analyse\n[46] La pilote XY n\u2019est pas une partie \u00e0 la plainte et (sauf peut-\u00eatre dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle est une femme pilote d\u2019Air Canada) ses renseignements d\u2019identification n\u2019ont aucun rapport avec la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. En outre, ses demandes de mesures de protection de la confidentialit\u00e9 sont raisonnables et incontest\u00e9es.\n[47] Le Tribunal a le pouvoir de prendre toute mesure n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre un \u00e9quilibre appropri\u00e9 entre la confidentialit\u00e9 et l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique.\n[48] Je suis convaincue que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de prot\u00e9ger la confidentialit\u00e9 des renseignements de la pilote XY l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que tout cet aspect du processus d\u2019audience soit divulgu\u00e9 et j\u2019estime qu\u2019une ordonnance visant \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la confidentialit\u00e9 de la pilote XY est justifi\u00e9e dans ces circonstances.\nV. Ordonnances\nA. Divulgation\n[49] En vertu du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que me conf\u00e8rent les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, je rends les ordonnances suivantes :\nAir Canada doit produire le Rapport Nance, ainsi que tous les autres documents qui sont en sa possession, sous son autorit\u00e9 ou sous sa garde, et qui refl\u00e8tent la contribution d\u2019Air Canada ou de ses employ\u00e9s \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration ou \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre du Rapport Nance, dans la mesure o\u00f9 de tels documents existent et qu\u2019ils ne sont pas confidentiels, sous r\u00e9serve des ordonnances de confidentialit\u00e9 ci\u2011dessous.\nAir Canada doit fournir ces renseignements aux parties dans les trois (3) semaines suivant la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nB. Confidentialit\u00e9\n[50] En vertu du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que me conf\u00e8rent les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, je rends les ordonnances suivantes :\nLa partie qui fait l\u2019objet du Rapport Nance doit \u00eatre appel\u00e9e \u00ab la pilote XY \u00bb dans toutes les observations, discussions, d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate et d\u00e9cisions qui seront pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es ou rendues dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente instance.\nAir Canada doit divulguer une copie du Rapport Nance dans laquelle tous les renseignements d\u2019identification (\u00e0 l\u2019exception du sexe de la pilote XY) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caviard\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment aux observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par la pilote XY.\nLa Commission et la plaignante doivent d\u00e9truire toutes les copies non caviard\u00e9es du Rapport Nance qu\u2019elles ont en leur possession, sous leur autorit\u00e9 ou sous leur garde.\nLe greffe du Tribunal doit garder une copie non caviard\u00e9e du Rapport Nance, laquelle est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e sous scell\u00e9e et ne peut \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9e.\nToute autre requ\u00eate relative au Rapport Nance doit \u00eatre signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 la pilote XY. Cette derni\u00e8re aura qualit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9senter des observations au Tribunal en ce qui concerne la protection continue de ses renseignements confidentiels.\nSign\u00e9 par\nKirsten Mercer\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\n11 ao\u00fbt 2017\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du Tribunal :\nT257\/3116\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nJane Clegg c.

Plainte et requ\u00eates en divulgation\n[1] La caporale Kayreen Brickner (plaignante ou cap. Brickner) est un membre de sexe f\u00e9minin de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (GRC), l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente instance. Elle est mari\u00e9e \u00e0 un autre membre de la GRC et ils ont quatre enfants mineurs. La plaignante et son mari, le caporal Marinis (cap. Marinis), avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s ensemble \u00e0 la Division E (Colombie\u2011Britannique) \u00e0 Squamish (C.\u2011B.) En avril 2012, le cap. Marinis s\u2019est port\u00e9 candidat \u00e0 un poste de la GRC \u00e0 Whitehorse au Yukon, mais cela n\u00e9cessitait qu\u2019il d\u00e9m\u00e9nage son \u00e9pouse et ses enfants de la Colombie\u2011Britannique au Yukon.\n[2] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, la plaignante soutient que la GRC a accept\u00e9 de faire de son mieux pour lui trouver un nouveau poste \u00e0 Whitehorse. Or, elle n\u2019a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 Whitehorse que deux ans plus tard, en janvier 2015. Dans cet intervalle de temps, la plaignante avance que la GRC au Yukon (Division M) lui a offert un poste qui ne tenait pas compte de ses responsabilit\u00e9s parentales. La plaignante ajoute qu\u2019\u00e0 la suite de son refus de cette offre d\u2019emploi, la Division M a omis de l\u2019informer des autres possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi offertes et s\u2019est \u00e9cart\u00e9e des pratiques de la GRC en dotant des postes avec d\u2019autres candidats au lieu de faire appel \u00e0 la plaignante. Selon elle, cela constituait de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et la situation de famille. Elle affirme, d\u2019autre part, avoir fait l\u2019objet de deux actes de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[3] Dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9paration de l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la cap. Brickner a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en divulgation de documents qu\u2019elle consid\u00e8re comme potentiellement pertinents.\nII. Principes applicables en mati\u00e8re de divulgation\n[4] Selon l\u2019article 50(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (Loi), les parties qui se pr\u00e9sentent devant le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (Tribunal) doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de faire valoir leurs arguments. Pour avoir cette possibilit\u00e9, les parties doivent obtenir, entre autres choses, la divulgation de renseignements potentiellement pertinents et qui sont en la possession ou sous les soins de la partie adverse avant l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire. Outre les faits et les questions en litige pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les parties, la divulgation de renseignements permet \u00e0 chaque partie de savoir ce qui lui est reproch\u00e9 et, par cons\u00e9quent, de se pr\u00e9parer ad\u00e9quatement pour l\u2019audition.\n[5] Pour d\u00e9cider de la divulgation des renseignements, le Tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer la pertinence des \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019information en cause (voir Warman c. Bahr, 2006 TCDP 18, au paragraphe 6). Cette norme vise \u00e0 \u00ab emp\u00eacher qu\u2019on se lance dans des demandes de production \u201cqui reposent sur la conjecture et qui sont fantaisistes, perturbatrices, mal fond\u00e9es, obstructionnistes et dilatoires\u201d \u00bb (voir Day c. Minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale et Hortie, d\u00e9cision no 3, 2002\/12\/06). Cela garantit \u00e9galement le caract\u00e8re probant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[6] Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une norme particuli\u00e8rement \u00e9lev\u00e9e \u00e0 satisfaire pour la partie requ\u00e9rante. S\u2019il existe un lien rationnel entre un document et les faits, les questions ou les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par les parties en cause, les renseignements devraient \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment aux articles 6(1)d) et 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (03-05-04) (R\u00e8gles) (voir Guay c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada), 2004 TCDP 34, au paragraphe 42 (Guay); Rai c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2013 TCDP 6, au paragraphe 28; et Seeley c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2013 TCDP 18, au paragraphe 6 (Seeley)).\n[7] Toutefois, la demande de divulgation ne doit pas \u00eatre sp\u00e9culative ou \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une \u00ab partie de p\u00eache \u00bb (voir Guay, au paragraphe 43). Les documents demand\u00e9s devraient \u00eatre d\u00e9crits de mani\u00e8re suffisamment pr\u00e9cise. Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que dans la recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, et malgr\u00e9 la pertinence probable des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, le Tribunal peut exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de rejeter une demande de divulgation, dans la mesure o\u00f9 les exigences de la justice naturelle et les R\u00e8gles sont respect\u00e9es, afin d\u2019assurer l\u2019instruction informelle et exp\u00e9ditive de la plainte (voir Gil c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), 1999 CanLII 8407 (CF), au paragraphe 13; voir \u00e9galement l\u2019article 48.9(1) de la Loi).\n[8] Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 reconnu dans ses d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures qu\u2019il peut refuser d\u2019ordonner la divulgation d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve lorsque la valeur probante de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ne l\u2019emporte pas sur leur effet pr\u00e9judiciable sur l\u2019instance. Le Tribunal doit notamment faire preuve de prudence avant d\u2019ordonner une perquisition lorsque cela obligerait une partie ou une personne \u00e9trang\u00e8re au litige \u00e0 se soumettre \u00e0 une recherche on\u00e9reuse et fort \u00e9tendue de documentation, surtout lorsque le fait d\u2019ordonner la divulgation risquerait d\u2019entra\u00eener un retard important dans l\u2019instruction de la plainte ou lorsque les documents ne se rapportent qu\u2019\u00e0 une question secondaire plut\u00f4t qu\u2019aux principales questions en litige (voir Yaffa c. Air Canada, 2014 TCDP 22, au paragraphe 4; Seeley, au paragraphe 7; voir aussi R. c. Seaboyer [1991] 2 R.C.S. 577, aux pages 609 \u00e0 611).\n[9] Il convient \u00e9galement de souligner que la divulgation de renseignements potentiellement pertinents ne veut pas dire que ces renseignements seront admis en preuve lors de l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire ou qu\u2019on leur accordera une importance significative au cours du processus d\u00e9cisionnel (voir Association des employ\u00e9(e)s de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication du Manitoba inc. c. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 TCDP 28, au paragraphe 4).\n[10] De plus, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019obligation de divulgation d\u2019une partie se limite aux documents \u00ab qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u00bb selon l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles, le Tribunal ne peut ordonner \u00e0 une partie de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer ou de cr\u00e9er de nouveaux documents aux fins de la divulgation (voir Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 42, au paragraphe 17).\nIII. Requ\u00eate en divulgation de la plaignante\n[11] Le processus de divulgation entre les parties a d\u00e9but\u00e9 il y a plus d\u2019un an. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a fourni plusieurs documents \u2013 plus de 1 100 au total \u2013 \u00e0 la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2016. Cependant, la cap. Brickner croyait qu\u2019il restait d\u2019autres documents pertinents, et elle a donc pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande \u00e9crite \u00e0 la GRC en janvier 2017, dans laquelle elle d\u00e9crivait les diff\u00e9rents documents qu\u2019elle voulait se voir divulguer. La cap. Brickner n\u2019\u00e9tait pas satisfaite de la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 sa demande, qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7ue en avril 2017. La cap. Brickner a donc pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en divulgation au Tribunal le 17 mai 2017.\n[12] Une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance (CTGI) a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue le 24 mai 2017, date \u00e0 laquelle j\u2019ai attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention sur le fait que le temps n\u00e9cessaire pour entendre cette requ\u00eate complexe, statuer sur celle\u2011ci et se conformer \u00e0 toute ordonnance la concernant pourrait entra\u00eener la non-disponibilit\u00e9 des parties \u00e0 l\u2019ouverture de l\u2019audience pr\u00e9vue en septembre 2017. Deux jours plus tard, la cap. Brickner a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu\u2019elle allait modifier sa requ\u00eate afin de r\u00e9duire la liste de demandes. La nouvelle requ\u00eate, qui fait l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue par le Tribunal le 29 mai 2017. Les observations relatives \u00e0 la requ\u00eate ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ues de la Commission et de la GRC, et la plaignante et la Commission ont \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des observations en r\u00e9plique.\n[13] Au total, la requ\u00eate \u00e9num\u00e8re 23 documents ou groupes de documents distincts que la cap. Brickner voudrait se voir divulguer par la GRC. La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision traitera de chacune de ces 23 demandes s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal concernant chaque demande figurant sous chacune des 23 rubriques suivantes.\nIV. Documentation demand\u00e9e par la plaignante\n1. Tous les documents se rapportant \u00e0 l\u2019issue de la question pos\u00e9e en 2013 par la RDRF de la Division K Michelle BOUTIN au commissaire PAULSON concernant les mesures d\u2019adaptation en milieu de travail.\nNote : Le commissaire PAULSON est cens\u00e9 prendre sa retraite \u00e0 la fin du moins de juin 2017. Si cette divulgation en particulier re\u00e7oit l\u2019aval du Tribunal, alors je demande qu\u2019un d\u00e9lai ferme soit aussi impos\u00e9 \u00e0 la GRC pour se pr\u00e9munir contre l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 potentielle de divulguer du commissaire PAULSON compte tenu de la date annonc\u00e9e de son d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite.\n(i) Observations de la plaignante\n[14] La cap. Brickner croit que ces documents sont potentiellement pertinents parce qu\u2019ils d\u00e9montreraient que les cadres sup\u00e9rieurs de la GRC avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s en 2013 qu\u2019il y avait, dans toute l\u2019organisation, des manquements \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9pondre aux demandes d\u2019accommodement pour raisons familiales. \u00c0 son avis, cela prouverait l\u2019existence d\u2019un probl\u00e8me syst\u00e9mique au sein de la GRC.\n(ii) Observations de la Commission\n[15] La Commission estime que ces renseignements seraient utiles \u00e0 la cap. Brickner et que la r\u00e9ponse du commissaire Paulson aux questions des agents de sexe f\u00e9minin concernant les mesures d\u2019adaptation en milieu de travail pourrait servir \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une comparaison avec la fa\u00e7on dont la cap. Brickner a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e.\n(iii) Observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[16] La GRC soutient que cette demande est trop vague et trop g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et que les renseignements demand\u00e9s sont tout au plus d\u2019une utilit\u00e9 discutable. Il n\u2019y a pas de renseignements suffisants dans la demande pour d\u00e9signer pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l\u2019\u00e9change de courriels ou pour comprendre de quels documents elle demande la production. Elle soutient \u00e9galement qu\u2019une r\u00e9ponse donn\u00e9e il y a quatre ans pourrait ne pas constituer le reflet exact des politiques et pratiques actuelles de la GRC.\n[17] Nonobstant ses objections, la GRC a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ferait des efforts raisonnables pour chercher et produire le courriel du commissaire Paulson ou toute autre r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite de celui\u2011ci \u00e0 la question de la RDRF Michelle Boutin de 2013 sur les mesures d\u2019adaptation en milieu de travail.\n(iv) D\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[18] Il est ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la GRC de faire des efforts raisonnables pour chercher et produire le courriel du commissaire Paulson ou toute autre r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite de celui\u2011ci \u00e0 la question de la RDRF Michelle Boutin de 2013 sur les mesures d\u2019adaptation en milieu de travail. Le Tribunal impose en l\u2019occurrence le d\u00e9lai du 15 septembre 2017. Toutefois, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e est en mesure de se conformer plus t\u00f4t, la production anticip\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e pour permettre \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire de progresser vers l\u2019audition en temps utile. S\u2019il est impossible de trouver cette documentation \u00e0 la suite d\u2019efforts raisonnables, la GRC informera les autres parties et le Tribunal des mesures qu\u2019elle a prises pour accomplir ses efforts au plus tard le 15 septembre 2017.\n2. Toutes les demandes faites au sein de la Division M (Yukon) et tous les documents se rapportant au nombre de demandes d\u2019accommodement pour raisons familiales re\u00e7ues au moyen du formulaire 6346 (cr\u00e9\u00e9 n\/b 2012-05) en 2012, 2013, 2014 et 2015. Ces documents peuvent \u00eatre caviard\u00e9s pour prot\u00e9ger l\u2019identit\u00e9 du candidat.\n(i) Observations de la plaignante\n[19] La plaignante affirme que ce formulaire est exig\u00e9 par la GRC pour toute demande d\u2019accommodement pour raisons familiales. Or, elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de cette exigence et veut donc voir s\u2019il existait une directive ou politique officielle exigeant que ce formulaire soit rempli \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque pertinente.\n(ii) Observations de la Commission\n[20] La Commission appuie la demande \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la GRC a affirm\u00e9 dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions que la cap. Brickner n\u2019a pas fait de demande d\u2019accommodement ni rempli le formulaire 6346. Elle ajoute que la GRC devrait divulguer le nombre de demandes d\u2019accommodement pour raisons familiales effectu\u00e9es de 2012 \u00e0 2015 dans la Division M sans soumettre le formulaire 6346.\n(iii) Observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[21] La GRC qualifie cette demande de recherche on\u00e9reuse et fort \u00e9tendue de documentation. Elle explique qu\u2019il y a plus de 200 employ\u00e9s au sein de la seule Division M et que les demandes officielles de mesures d\u2019adaptation en milieu de travail li\u00e9es \u00e0 la famille ne sont pas conserv\u00e9es dans une base de donn\u00e9es centrale. Par cons\u00e9quent, pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande, la GRC devrait passer en revue manuellement les dossiers de service papier de chaque membre de la GRC affect\u00e9 \u00e0 la Division M au cours de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e. De plus, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les copies papier de ces formulaires ne se trouveraient que dans le dossier de chaque employ\u00e9, dans les cas de mutation d\u2019employ\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u2019autres divisions de la GRC, il faudrait que la Division M demande l\u2019aide d\u2019autres divisions de la GRC pour obtenir les formulaires en litige, s\u2019il en existe. Dans les cas o\u00f9 le formulaire n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 au dossier, une demande informelle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite au superviseur de l\u2019employ\u00e9, et la GRC soutient que, dans de tels cas, il faudrait entrer en communication avec chaque superviseur ayant travaill\u00e9 durant cette p\u00e9riode pour recueillir leur souvenir des demandes informelles. La GRC a \u00e9galement fourni d\u2019autres motifs expliquant pourquoi elle s\u2019oppose \u00e0 cette demande.\n(iv) D\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[22] Le Tribunal reconna\u00eet que la production des documents demand\u00e9s par la cap. Brickner pourrait contribuer \u00e0 r\u00e9futer l\u2019all\u00e9gation de la GRC selon laquelle elle aurait d\u00fb remplir le formulaire 6346 pour obtenir des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour raisons familiales. Cependant, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la collecte de ces renseignements exigerait beaucoup de temps de la part de la GRC et que la documentation demand\u00e9e semble \u00eatre d\u2019une utilit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e pour la plaignante, le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que cette demande de divulgation doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[23] \u00c0 l\u2019audition, et peut\u2011\u00eatre lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire des t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la cap. Brickner aura la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019explorer la question de savoir s\u2019il y avait des exceptions \u00e0 l\u2019exigence de remplir le formulaire 6346 pour obtenir des mesures d\u2019adaptation en milieu de travail. Le Tribunal estime qu\u2019en proc\u00e9dant ainsi, on \u00e9vite d\u2019occasionner d\u2019autres retards dans l\u2019instance tout en pr\u00e9servant le droit de la plaignante de savoir ce qu\u2019elle doit prouver.\n[24] Quant \u00e0 la suggestion de la Commission selon laquelle la GRC devrait divulguer le nombre de demandes d\u2019accommodement pour raisons familiales effectu\u00e9es de 2012 \u00e0 2015 dans la Division M sans soumettre le formulaire 6346, le Tribunal estime que la Commission demande au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un document ou d\u2019une liste. Selon l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles, l\u2019obligation de divulgation d\u2019une partie se limite aux documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, le Tribunal ne peut ordonner \u00e0 une partie de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer ou de cr\u00e9er de nouveaux documents aux fins de la divulgation. Pour ces motifs, la demande de la Commission est rejet\u00e9e.\n3. Tous les documents se rapportant au dossier 2013-3588, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 et conserv\u00e9 par la s.\u00e9.\u2011m. Diane DOYLE. La s.\u00e9.\u2011m DOYLE \u00e9tait une d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9e respectueuse en milieu de travail pour la Division E qui supervisait la Division M.\n(i) D\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[25] La GRC a accept\u00e9 de divulguer et de produire tous les documents contenus dans le dossier susmentionn\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019exception des documents prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par un privil\u00e8ge que reconna\u00eet le droit de la preuve. S\u2019il y a des documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation est invoqu\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e indiquera aux autres parties de quels documents et de quel privil\u00e8ge il s\u2019agit. Le Tribunal ordonne la production de ces documents et impose en l\u2019occurrence le d\u00e9lai du 15 septembre 2017. Toutefois, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e est en mesure de se conformer plus t\u00f4t, la production anticip\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e pour permettre \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire de progresser vers l\u2019audition en temps utile.\n4. Tous les documents se rapportant aux dossiers \u00ab jaunes \u00bb \u00e9tiquet\u00e9s BRICKNER et\/ou MARINIS conserv\u00e9s par l\u2019agente des ressources humaines des Divisions E et M, la comm. adj. Sharon WOODBURN.\n(i) D\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[26] La GRC a accept\u00e9 de divulguer et de produire une copie des \u00ab dossiers jaunes \u00bb de la cap. Brickner et du cap. Marinis (dossiers de service). Dans ses observations, la GRC soutient que la plus grande partie du dossier de la cap. Brickner, et peut\u2011\u00eatre la totalit\u00e9 du dossier du cap. Marinis, n\u2019est pas pertinente. Toutefois, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la GRC a acquiesc\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande de divulgation, mais \u00e0 condition de recevoir au pr\u00e9alable les consentements \u00e9crits de la cap. Brickner et du cap. Marinis. La raison d\u2019\u00eatre de cette condition n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e dans les observations de la GRC, mais cela semble constituer une demande raisonnable, surtout en ce qui concerne le cap. Marinis, qui n\u2019est pas partie \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[27] Le Tribunal ne rend donc aucune ordonnance concernant cette demande et laisse \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 son mari le soin de se pr\u00e9valoir ou non de l\u2019offre de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n5. Tous les documents se rapportant au fait que la serg. Cindy RATTRAY du groupe des promotions de la Division E a donn\u00e9 des directives ou re\u00e7u des demandes d\u2019aide du s.\u00e9.\u2011m. Tony PARK, y compris toutes les notes, directives ou communications ayant trait \u00e0 la Division M et aux placements dans le GCG et\/ou \u00e0 la cap. Kayreen BRICKNER.\n(i) D\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[28] Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas \u00e0 ordonner de divulgation relativement \u00e0 cette demande puisque la GRC indique qu\u2019elle croit avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9 tous les documents pertinents de ce type qu\u2019elle a en sa possession. Cependant, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de fournir \u00e0 la cap. Brickner une liste de tous les documents qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fournis et qui, selon elle, correspondent \u00e0 cette demande au plus tard le 15 septembre 2017. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a en outre accept\u00e9 de confirmer aupr\u00e8s de la serg. Rattray que tous les documents potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, y compris les notes de juillet \u00e0 ao\u00fbt 2012, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits. Si de nouveaux documents sont d\u00e9couverts, le Tribunal en ordonne la divulgation, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019exception visant les documents prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par un privil\u00e8ge que reconna\u00eet le droit de la preuve. S\u2019il y a des documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation est invoqu\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e indiquera aux autres parties de quels documents et de quel privil\u00e8ge il s\u2019agit. Le Tribunal impose en l\u2019occurrence le d\u00e9lai du 15 septembre 2017. Toutefois, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e est en mesure de se conformer plus t\u00f4t, la production anticip\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e pour permettre \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire de progresser vers l\u2019audition en temps utile. Si de nouveaux documents de ce type sont d\u00e9couverts \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure, ils seront divulgu\u00e9s et produits comme l\u2019exige l\u2019article 6(5)b) des R\u00e8gles.\n6. Tous les documents se rapportant aux conversations, communications ou directives qu\u2019Elizabeth MACDONALD a donn\u00e9es concernant la dotation, les griefs ou les plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne int\u00e9ressant la cap. Kayreen BRICKNER et\/ou Phil GOULET et tout membre de la Division M ayant trait aux mesures de promotion ou de dotation, plus particuli\u00e8rement les deux processus relatifs au poste au sein du GCG (2014\u20112017) et au poste de r\u00e9viseur de la PC (promotion) en 2015. Il pourrait notamment s\u2019agir des notes, dossiers et conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques concernant la cap. Kayreen BRICKNER, y compris les conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques suivantes :\n\u00b7 la(les) conversation(s) t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique(s) d\u2019avril 2015 avec l\u2019insp. Phil GOULET concernant la promotion au poste de r\u00e9viseur de la PC au sein de la Division M, le grief et la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne;\n\u00b7 la conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 12 f\u00e9vrier 2016 avec le s.\u00e9.\u2011m. Jason FLYNN concernant la conversation et les directives donn\u00e9es relativement au poste lat\u00e9ral au sein du GCG.\n(i) D\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[29] Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas \u00e0 ordonner de divulgation relativement \u00e0 cette demande puisque la GRC indique qu\u2019elle croit avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9 tous les documents pertinents de ce type qu\u2019elle a en sa possession. Cependant, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de fournir \u00e0 la cap. Brickner une liste de tous les documents qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fournis et qui, selon elle, correspondent \u00e0 cette demande au plus tard le 15 septembre 2017. Si de nouveaux documents pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette demande sont d\u00e9couverts, l\u2019intim\u00e9e devra les divulguer conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 6(5)b) des R\u00e8gles, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019exception visant les documents prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par un privil\u00e8ge que reconna\u00eet le droit de la preuve. S\u2019il y a des documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation est invoqu\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e indiquera aux autres parties de quels documents et de quel privil\u00e8ge il s\u2019agit.\n7. Tous les documents provenant de l\u2019inspecteur Phil GOULET du groupe des promotions de la Division E se rapportant \u00e0 la cap. Kayreen BRICKNER et au poste de r\u00e9viseur de la PC (promotion en 2015), y compris les notes, documents et communications concernant les conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques, le dossier de dotation et le grief.\n(i) D\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[30] Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas \u00e0 ordonner de divulgation relativement \u00e0 cette demande puisque la GRC indique qu\u2019elle croit avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9 tous les documents pertinents de ce type qu\u2019elle a en sa possession. Cependant, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de fournir \u00e0 la cap. Brickner une liste de tous les documents qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fournis et qui, selon elle, correspondent \u00e0 cette demande au plus tard le 15 septembre 2017. Si de nouveaux documents pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette demande sont d\u00e9couverts, l\u2019intim\u00e9e devra les divulguer conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 6(5)b) des R\u00e8gles, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019exception visant les documents prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par un privil\u00e8ge que reconna\u00eet le droit de la preuve. S\u2019il y a des documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation est invoqu\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e indiquera aux autres parties de quels documents et de quel privil\u00e8ge il s\u2019agit.\n8. Tous les documents se rapportant aux mesures de dotation (d\u00e9personnalis\u00e9es) pour la Division M, y compris les bulletins, les postes exc\u00e9dentaires et les placements dans la division, les postes nouvellement cr\u00e9\u00e9s, les mesures de dotation officielles (postes affich\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale\/promotions) et une liste des postes qui sont demeur\u00e9s vacants \u00e0 tout moment au cours des ann\u00e9es 2012 \u00e0 2014, en les divisant ainsi :\n\u00b7 tous les formulaires 2285 pour les postes de s.\u2011off. aux services g\u00e9n\u00e9raux d\u00e9pos\u00e9s d\u2019avril 2012 \u00e0 la fin de 2014;\n\u00b7 tous les formulaires A22a remis pour les postes de s.\u2011off. cap. au sein de la Division M pourvus d\u2019une mani\u00e8re lat\u00e9rale ou ayant fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une promotion entre avril 2012 et la fin de 2014;\n\u00b7 l\u2019horaire des services g\u00e9n\u00e9raux (horaire de travail), y compris les restructurations, les d\u00e9tachements et les postes vacants pour 2012, 2013 et 2014;\n\u00b7 l\u2019horaire (de travail) du GCG de la Division M qui montre les restructurations, les d\u00e9tachements et les postes vacants tout au long des ann\u00e9es 2012, 2013 et 2014;\n\u00b7 l\u2019organigramme \u2013 comprenant les ann\u00e9es 2012, 2013 et 2014 \u2013 montrant les ETP et la dur\u00e9e dans chaque poste qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas cess\u00e9 d\u2019occuper aux services g\u00e9n\u00e9raux jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sa mutation en f\u00e9vr. 2013.\n(i) Observations de la plaignante\n[31] La cap. Brickner soutient que ces documents fourniront un compte rendu exact de la fa\u00e7on dont la Division M g\u00e8re ses ressources et ses postes vacants. Elle laisse entendre qu\u2019il y avait d\u2019autres postes disponibles qui ne lui ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts et que, par cons\u00e9quent, ces documents appuient ses all\u00e9gations de discrimination et de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[32] Dans ses observations en r\u00e9plique, la cap. Brickner n\u2019apporte aucune pr\u00e9cision. Elle r\u00e9it\u00e8re ses demandes relatives \u00e0 deux documents que la GRC a accept\u00e9 de fournir, et demande des renseignements dans deux cas, mais qui ne se rattachent pas \u00e0 des documents pr\u00e9cis. Elle se sert \u00e9galement de sa r\u00e9plique pour pr\u00e9senter des arguments \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses all\u00e9gations.\n(ii) Observations de la Commission\n[33] La Commission convient de la pertinence potentielle de ces documents parce qu\u2019ils permettront aux parties et au Tribunal d\u2019examiner la d\u00e9fense de la GRC dans le contexte de son argument selon lequel elle ne pouvait pas offrir certains postes \u00e0 la cap. Brickner.\n(iii) Observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[34] La GRC affirme que certains des renseignements susmentionn\u00e9s ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s, et accepte de divulguer d\u2019autres documents demand\u00e9s et qu\u2019elle a en sa possession. Toutefois, l\u2019intim\u00e9e refuse de divulguer certains documents, comme ceux ayant trait aux postes se trouvant \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de Whitehorse ou \u00e0 d\u2019autres niveaux que celui de caporal, car elle soutient que certains d\u2019entre eux ne sont pas pertinents et que pour d\u2019autres, les demandes sont trop on\u00e9reuses et \u00e9tendues.\n(iv) D\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[35] La demande de la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tout \u00e0 fait claire pour le Tribunal, d\u2019autant plus que la cap. Brickner emploie des abr\u00e9viations et une terminologie qu\u2019il ne conna\u00eet pas bien. Elle fait \u00e9galement mention d\u2019une personne en particulier dans la derni\u00e8re partie de sa demande (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. \u00ab \u2026qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas cess\u00e9 d\u2019occuper \u00bb), mais ne donne pas suffisamment de d\u00e9tails sur l\u2019identit\u00e9 de cette personne. De plus, on ne savait pas exactement ce que la Division M signifiait g\u00e9ographiquement pour la plaignante. Une demande de pr\u00e9cisions a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 la cap. Brickner, et les autres parties se sont vu offrir la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pliquer \u00e0 ses pr\u00e9cisions. La Commission a choisi de ne pas r\u00e9pliquer aux pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9 et ajout\u00e9 certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments aux pr\u00e9cisions. Elle a \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9 quels documents elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9s dans le cadre de cette demande. Les pr\u00e9cisions ont aid\u00e9 le Tribunal \u00e0 prendre la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, bien que l\u2019id\u00e9e que la plaignante se fait de la Division M diff\u00e8re de celle de la GRC, la r\u00e9ponse de la plaignante confirme qu\u2019elle ne cherche qu\u2019\u00e0 obtenir des renseignements sur les postes se trouvant physiquement \u00e0 Whitehorse. La plaignante a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que la personne \u00e0 laquelle elle fait allusion dans la demande est le cap. Hutchings, mais elle n\u2019a pas fourni de motifs pour expliquer la pertinence probable de cette demande en particulier.\n[36] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, toute documentation demand\u00e9e doit avoir une pertinence probable, et doit donc avoir un certain lien avec les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es par une partie au litige. Il appert que cette demande se rapporte aux all\u00e9gations que la cap. Brickner a formul\u00e9es aux paragraphes 62 \u00e0 73 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, o\u00f9 elle affirme qu\u2019entre juin 2012 et d\u00e9cembre 2014, il y a eu 11 postes vacants dont elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e ou pour lesquels elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9e. Cette demande vise \u00e0 mettre au jour d\u2019autres postes disponibles au cours de cette p\u00e9riode et dont la cap. Brickner n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e ou pour lesquels sa candidature n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en consid\u00e9ration. Je ne suis pas convaincu que cette documentation suppl\u00e9mentaire renforcera de fa\u00e7on appr\u00e9ciable la preuve de la cap. Brickner. Le Tribunal estime que le fait d\u2019accueillir cette demande pourrait retarder ind\u00fbment l\u2019instruction de la plainte sans apporter d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments ayant une grande valeur probante puisque la plaignante semble d\u00e9j\u00e0 avoir en sa possession des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve susceptibles d\u2019appuyer son all\u00e9gation selon laquelle sa candidature n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en consid\u00e9ration pour plusieurs emplois dans la Division M. Le Tribunal en profite pour rappeler aux parties que la plaignante doit seulement \u00e9tablir qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9e d\u2019un poste pour un motif de distinction illicite pour que le Tribunal conclue \u00e0 la discrimination.\n[37] De plus, si elle le souhaite, la cap. Brickner aura l\u2019occasion de contre\u2011interroger les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e au sujet du roulement de personnel g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et de la disponibilit\u00e9 des postes au cours de cette p\u00e9riode. Cependant, pour faire en sorte que l\u2019instruction de la plainte reste ax\u00e9e sur les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le Tribunal n\u2019ordonnera pas la production d\u2019autres documents relativement \u00e0 cette demande.\n[38] L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 produit, \u00e0 l\u2019exception du document ci\u2011apr\u00e8s mentionn\u00e9, tous les documents pertinents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession concernant les mesures de dotation au niveau de caporal prises de 2012 \u00e0 2014 \u00e0 Whitehorse. Cependant, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de fournir \u00e0 la cap. Brickner une liste de tous les documents qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fournis et qui, selon elle, correspondent \u00e0 cette demande au plus tard le 15 septembre 2017. Si de nouveaux documents pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette demande sont d\u00e9couverts, l\u2019intim\u00e9e devra les divulguer sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019exception visant les documents prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par un privil\u00e8ge que reconna\u00eet le droit de la preuve. S\u2019il y a des documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation est invoqu\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e indiquera aux autres parties de quels documents et de quel privil\u00e8ge il s\u2019agit.\n[39] L\u2019exception aux documents fournis se rapporte au poste de chef de veille aux services g\u00e9n\u00e9raux offert \u00e0 la cap. Brickner en 2012. La GRC s\u2019est engag\u00e9e \u00e0 divulguer la documentation relative \u00e0 ce poste. Le Tribunal ordonne donc la production de ces documents et impose en l\u2019occurrence le d\u00e9lai du 15 septembre 2017. Toutefois, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e est en mesure de se conformer plus t\u00f4t, la production anticip\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e pour permettre \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire de progresser vers l\u2019audition en temps utile. Si de nouveaux documents de ce type sont d\u00e9couverts \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure, ils seront divulgu\u00e9s et produits comme l\u2019exige l\u2019article 6(5)b) des R\u00e8gles.\n[40] La cap. Brickner demande \u00e9galement l\u2019horaire des services g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, l\u2019horaire du GCG (Groupe des crimes graves) et l\u2019organigramme pour les ann\u00e9es 2012 \u00e0 2014. La GRC a accept\u00e9 de produire ces documents, mais elle fait observer que certains des renseignements que la cap. Brickner a mentionn\u00e9s dans sa demande, \u00e0 savoir les renseignements concernant \u00ab les restructurations, les d\u00e9tachements et les postes vacants \u00bb pourraient ne pas figurer dans ces documents. Le Tribunal ordonne donc \u00e0 la GRC de produire les horaires des services g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, les horaires du GCG et les organigrammes pour les ann\u00e9es 2012 \u00e0 2014 tels qu\u2019ils existent au plus tard le 15 septembre 2017. Le Tribunal souligne \u00e9galement que la plaignante aura l\u2019occasion de poser des questions pr\u00e9cises sur le cap. Hutchings ainsi que sur les restructurations, les d\u00e9tachements et les postes vacants survenus dans la Division M lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire des t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n9. Tous les documents se rapportant au dossier de dotation du GCG (2014) pour le poste de caporal qui est demeur\u00e9 vacant encore \u00e0 ce jour, y compris les notes, r\u00e9unions, courriels et directives concernant l\u2019arr\u00eat et la mise en marche (examens) de ce processus de dotation.\n\u00b7 Toutes les notes et tous les dossiers, documents et courriels ayant trait au processus de s\u00e9lection au sein du GCG en date du 2014\u201103\u201108.

Puis, le 2014\u201104\u201108, [traduction] \u00ab le processus de dotation de ce poste est actuellement examin\u00e9 par une source externe. Toutes les personnes qui ont particip\u00e9 \u00e0 ce processus et au SIGRH sont candidats.\n\u00b7 Toutes les notes et tous les dossiers, documents et courriels \u00e9chang\u00e9s entre le s.\u00e9.\u2011m.

S\u2019ils se sont rencontr\u00e9s, ont proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 des examens ou ont eu des discussions relativement \u00e0 des demandes ou \u00e0 des documents (2014\u201110\u201114).\n\u00b7 Toutes les notes et tous les dossiers, documents et courriels ayant trait aux processus et aux efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par la Division M pour trouver des candidats pour ce poste tout au long des ann\u00e9es 2014, 2015, 2016 et 2017.\n(i) Observations de la plaignante\n[41] La plaignante soutient que ces documents sont potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa deuxi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles. Elle croit qu\u2019ils feront partie de la preuve qui d\u00e9montre que sa candidature n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en consid\u00e9ration pour ce poste vacant parce qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n(ii) Observations de la Commission\n[42] La Commission appuie la demande de la cap. Brickner parce qu\u2019elle estime que les documents sont potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles et pourraient d\u00e9montrer pourquoi la candidature de la cap. Brickner n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en consid\u00e9ration pour ce poste.\n(iii) Observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[43] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9 tous les documents pertinents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession relativement \u00e0 ce processus de dotation. La GRC affirme que les seuls documents pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plainte de la cap. Brickner sont les documents ayant trait aux mesures de dotation mises en \u0153uvre jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de la d\u00e9cision de ne pas lui offrir ce poste. Malheureusement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019indique pas \u00e0 quel moment cela s\u2019est produit. Selon l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e que sa candidature n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue \u00e0 deux reprises, soit en novembre 2014 (voir l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, au paragraphe 88) et en avril 2016 (voir l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, au paragraphe 95.)\n(iv) D\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[44] Le Tribunal estime que les documents demand\u00e9s sont potentiellement pertinents dans le contexte de la plainte de repr\u00e9sailles. Il est ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la GRC de divulguer tous les documents li\u00e9s au dossier de dotation du poste vacant au sein du GCG et ant\u00e9rieurs au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2016 au plus tard le 15 septembre 2017. La pr\u00e9sente ordonnance de divulgation se limite aux documents ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 cette date parce que le Tribunal estime que les documents post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 cette date ne sont pas pertinents. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la GRC n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 la date exacte \u00e0 laquelle la cap. Brickner a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de la d\u00e9cision de ne pas lui offrir le poste, la date du 31 d\u00e9cembre 2016 a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue pour permettre une divulgation raisonnable \u00e0 la plaignante sans soumettre l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 une demande d\u00e9raisonnable et fort \u00e9tendue de documents non pertinents. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9 certains de ces documents, il lui est ordonn\u00e9 de fournir \u00e0 la plaignante une liste de ces documents d\u00e9j\u00e0 fournis dans le cadre de cette demande au plus tard le 15 septembre 2017. Toutefois, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e est en mesure de se conformer plus t\u00f4t, la production anticip\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e pour permettre \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire de progresser vers l\u2019audition en temps utile.\n10. Une copie du CV de la cap. Calista MCLEOD, maintenant serg., qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour le poste au sein des FFADA en 2013.\n(i) Observations de la plaignante\n[45] La cap. Brickner conteste les d\u00e9clarations de la GRC selon lesquelles sa candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en consid\u00e9ration pour chaque poste vacant pendant la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle elle sollicitait une mutation \u00e0 la Division M. Elle croit qu\u2019en comparant ses qualifications au curriculum vit\u00e6 de la sgt. McLeod, elle pourra d\u00e9montrer que ses qualifications \u00e9taient sup\u00e9rieures. La cap. Brickner croit que ce document est potentiellement pertinent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de son all\u00e9gation selon laquelle la GRC n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de lui offrir un poste en raison de sa demande d\u2019accommodement pour raisons familiales.\n(ii) Observations de la Commission\n[46] La Commission appuie \u00e9galement cette demande pour les m\u00eames motifs que ceux que la cap. Brickner a fournis.\n(iii) Observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[47] L\u2019intim\u00e9e refuse de divulguer ce document au motif qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas pertinent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des all\u00e9gations de la cap. Brickner et parce qu\u2019il contient des renseignements personnels concernant un tiers non mis en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La GRC affirme que la cap. Brickner s\u2019est renseign\u00e9e sur ce poste et a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e \u00e0 manifester son int\u00e9r\u00eat pour celui\u2011ci. Or, la cap. Brickner n\u2019a manifest\u00e9 aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat. Elle a plus tard r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait soumise \u00e0 une restriction de travail en raison de sa grossesse. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a reconnu ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de manifester son int\u00e9r\u00eat pour des postes temporaires apr\u00e8s le mois de mai 2013, y compris le poste au sein des FFADA, la GRC soutient que la cap. Brickner ne s\u2019est jamais trouv\u00e9e en concurrence avec la cap. McLeod pour ce poste.\n(iv) D\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[48] Cette demande est rejet\u00e9e. Il ne sert \u00e0 rien de comparer les qualifications de la cap. Brickner avec celles de personnes dont la candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de postes temporaires pour lesquels la cap. Brickner reconna\u00eet n\u2019avoir manifest\u00e9 aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat.\n11. Une copie du CV de la cap. Calista MCLEOD, maintenant serg., qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 pour son placement\/d\u00e9tachement au sein du GCG en 2013 (2013\u20112015).\n(i) Observations de la plaignante\n[49] L\u2019argument de la cap. Brickner concernant cette demande est semblable \u00e0 celui relatif \u00e0 la demande pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Elle conteste les d\u00e9clarations de la GRC selon lesquelles sa candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en consid\u00e9ration pour chaque poste vacant pendant la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle elle sollicitait une mutation \u00e0 la Division M. Elle croit qu\u2019en comparant ses qualifications au curriculum vit\u00e6 de la sgt. McLeod au moment o\u00f9 celle\u2011ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tach\u00e9e au sein du GCG, elle pourra d\u00e9montrer que ses qualifications \u00e9taient sup\u00e9rieures. La cap. Brickner croit que ce document est potentiellement pertinent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de son all\u00e9gation selon laquelle la GRC n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de lui offrir un poste en raison de sa demande d\u2019accommodement pour raisons familiales.\n(ii) Observations de la Commission\n[50] En plus de souscrire aux motifs de la cap. Brickner, la Commission soutient que ce document est particuli\u00e8rement pertinent \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la cap. Brickner est arriv\u00e9e deuxi\u00e8me pour le poste au sein du GCG offert en 2012.\n(iii) Observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[51] Les motifs que l\u2019intim\u00e9e invoque pour refuser de divulguer ce document sont semblables \u00e0 ceux invoqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la demande pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Le d\u00e9tachement au sein du GCG constituait un autre poste temporaire pour lequel la cap. Brickner n\u2019a pas manifest\u00e9 son int\u00e9r\u00eat. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a reconnu ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de manifester son int\u00e9r\u00eat pour des postes temporaires apr\u00e8s le mois de mai 2013, y compris pour ce d\u00e9tachement, la GRC soutient que la cap. Brickner ne s\u2019est jamais trouv\u00e9e en concurrence avec la cap. McLeod pour ce poste. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas de questions de fait ou de droit qui puissent justifier la divulgation des renseignements priv\u00e9s et personnels d\u2019un tiers non mis en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n(iv) D\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[52] Cette demande est rejet\u00e9e parce que ce document n\u2019est pas pertinent. Le d\u00e9tachement d\u00e9coulait du poste temporaire au sein des FFADA dont la cap. Brickner a eu connaissance, mais pour lequel elle a choisi de ne pas manifester d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat. Il ne m\u2019appara\u00eet pas probant de comparer les qualifications de la cap. Brickner \u00e0 celles d\u2019une personne dont la candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un poste temporaire qui d\u00e9coulait des fonctions li\u00e9es \u00e0 un autre poste auquel la cap. Brickner ne s\u2019est pas port\u00e9e candidate. En ce qui concerne la vacance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du poste au sein du GCG, la cap. Brickner aura la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 ce sujet, hormis le CV de la serg. McLeod utilis\u00e9 pour son placement\/d\u00e9tachement au sein du GCG en 2013.\n12. Une copie des comp\u00e9tences et du r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de pr\u00e9sentation de la cap.

McLeod qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s pour postuler pour la promotion relative au poste de r\u00e9viseur de la PC en janvier 2015. Le Tribunal ordonne la production de ces documents et impose en l\u2019occurrence le d\u00e9lai du 15 septembre 2017. Toutefois, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e est en mesure de se conformer plus t\u00f4t, la production anticip\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e pour permettre \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire de progresser vers l\u2019audition en temps utile. S\u2019il y a des documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation est invoqu\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e indiquera aux autres parties de quels documents et de quel privil\u00e8ge il s\u2019agit. S\u2019il est impossible de trouver cette documentation \u00e0 la suite d\u2019efforts raisonnables, la GRC informera les autres parties et le Tribunal des mesures qu\u2019elle a prises pour accomplir ses efforts au plus tard le 15 septembre 2017.\n13.

MCCONNELL.\n(i) D\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[54] Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas \u00e0 ordonner de divulgation relativement \u00e0 cette demande puisque la GRC indique qu\u2019elle croit avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9 tous les documents pertinents de ce type qu\u2019elle a en sa possession. Cependant, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de fournir \u00e0 la cap.

S\u2019il y a des documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation est invoqu\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e indiquera aux autres parties de quels documents et de quel privil\u00e8ge il s\u2019agit.\n17. Une liste de tous les caporaux au sein de la division et les dates auxquelles chaque caporal a re\u00e7u ses \u00e9valuations depuis 2013.\n(i) Observations de la plaignante\n[58] La plaignante soutient que ce document montrera qu\u2019elle et son mari ont fait l\u2019objet de repr\u00e9sailles se pr\u00e9sentant sous la forme d\u2019une absence d\u2019\u00e9valuations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res. Elle croit que cela d\u00e9montrera qu\u2019elle et son mari ne re\u00e7oivent aucun soutien ni aucune aide au perfectionnement de la part de la direction en raison de leur participation \u00e0 la plainte.\n(ii) Observations de la Commission\n[59] La Commission appuie la demande et soutient que l\u2019absence d\u2019\u00e9valuations est particuli\u00e8re. Dans ses observations en r\u00e9plique, la Commission affirme que l\u2019essentiel de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions porte sur le fait que la GRC a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 la cap. Brickner. Cette demande de document ne devrait donc pas se limiter \u00e0 la question des repr\u00e9sailles. De plus, la Commission attire l\u2019attention sur le paragraphe 35 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions o\u00f9 elle indique que la cap. Brickner a \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab mise \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart par des membres et d\u2019autres superviseurs, y compris des cadres interm\u00e9diaires et sup\u00e9rieurs \u00bb. La Commission ajoute que cela a eu une incidence n\u00e9gative sur ses possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019avancement de carri\u00e8re.\n(iii) Observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[60] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que cette documentation n\u2019est pas pertinente parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun lien avec les questions en litige. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, la GRC soutient que la demande constitue essentiellement une nouvelle all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante ou dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions en r\u00e9plique. Par cons\u00e9quent, aucune ordonnance ne devrait \u00eatre rendue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette demande.\n(iv) D\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[61] Je souligne que la demande de la plaignante semble constituer une demande de renseignements plut\u00f4t qu\u2019une demande de documents pr\u00e9cis dont l\u2019existence n\u2019est pas confirm\u00e9e. Le Tribunal ne peut ordonner la divulgation d\u2019un document qui n\u2019existe pas.\n[62] La principale objection de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, cependant, est que l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles, fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle ni la plaignante ni son mari n\u2019ont re\u00e7u d\u2019\u00e9valuations depuis qu\u2019ils ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 la Division M, constitue une nouvelle all\u00e9gation qui ne figurait pas dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante. Je dois souscrire \u00e0 la position de la GRC sur ce point. Les documents demand\u00e9s doivent avoir un lien avec les all\u00e9gations contenues dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions d\u2019une partie. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, la cap. Brickner n\u2019avance pas qu\u2019elle a fait l\u2019objet de repr\u00e9sailles se pr\u00e9sentant sous la forme d\u2019une absence d\u2019\u00e9valuations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res.\n[63] De plus, l\u2019argument de la Commission selon lequel l\u2019essentiel de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions porte sur le traitement diff\u00e9rentiel d\u00e9favorable qu\u2019a subi la cap. Brickner est trop vague pour maintenant comprendre une all\u00e9gation tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cise qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e dans un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Cette demande de document fait allusion \u00e0 un acte de repr\u00e9sailles tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cis et il serait pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019autoriser ce qui constituerait une nouvelle all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles sans avoir donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la GRC la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 celle\u2011ci dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[64] Il est toujours loisible aux parties devant le Tribunal de pr\u00e9senter une demande de modification de leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions afin d\u2019ajouter une autre all\u00e9gation. Cependant, je rappelle \u00e0 toutes les parties qu\u2019une nouvelle requ\u00eate interlocutoire prendra du temps et pourrait retarder davantage le d\u00e9but d\u2019une audience d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vue.\n18. Une liste des caporaux et\/ou gendarmes de la Division M ayant exerc\u00e9 un r\u00f4le int\u00e9rimaire (sergent et\/ou sergent d\u2019\u00e9tat\u2011major) depuis 2013.\n(i) Observations de la plaignante\n[65] D\u2019une fa\u00e7on semblable \u00e0 la demande de document pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, la plaignante soutient que ce document montrera qu\u2019elle et son mari ont fait l\u2019objet de repr\u00e9sailles en ne s\u2019\u00e9tant pas vu offrir la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019exercer des [traduction] \u00ab r\u00f4les int\u00e9rimaires \u00bb qui pourraient les aider \u00e0 faire progresser leur carri\u00e8re. Elle aimerait comparer les possibilit\u00e9s offertes \u00e0 d\u2019autres caporaux afin de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle et son mari sont mis \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart.\n(ii) Observations de la Commission\n[66] La Commission appuie la demande et soul\u00e8ve le m\u00eame argument qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la demande de document pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Dans ses observations en r\u00e9plique, la Commission affirme que l\u2019essentiel de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions porte sur le fait que la GRC a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 la cap. Brickner. Cette demande de document ne devrait donc pas se limiter \u00e0 la question des repr\u00e9sailles. De plus, la Commission attire l\u2019attention sur le paragraphe 35 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions o\u00f9 elle indique que la cap. Brickner a \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab mise \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart par des membres et d\u2019autres superviseurs, y compris des cadres interm\u00e9diaires et sup\u00e9rieurs \u00bb. La Commission ajoute que cela a eu une incidence n\u00e9gative sur ses possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019avancement de carri\u00e8re.\n(iii) Observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[67] D\u2019une fa\u00e7on semblable \u00e0 ses observations concernant la demande pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que cette documentation n\u2019est pas pertinente parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun lien avec les questions en litige. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, la GRC soutient que la demande constitue essentiellement une nouvelle all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante ou dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions en r\u00e9plique. Il serait contraire au principe de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale de demander \u00e0 la GRC de se d\u00e9fendre contre ces all\u00e9gations de fait sans qu\u2019elle ait eu la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre d\u2019abord dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Par cons\u00e9quent, aucune ordonnance ne devrait \u00eatre rendue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette demande.\n(iv) D\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[68] Encore une fois, je souligne que la demande de la plaignante semble constituer davantage une demande de renseignements qu\u2019une demande de documents pr\u00e9cis dont l\u2019existence n\u2019est pas confirm\u00e9e. Le Tribunal ne peut ordonner la divulgation d\u2019un document qui n\u2019existe pas.\n[69] De plus, comme dans la demande pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, la principale objection de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est que cette all\u00e9gation, selon laquelle ni la plaignante ni son mari n\u2019ont re\u00e7u d\u2019affectations int\u00e9rimaires depuis leur mutation, constitue une nouvelle all\u00e9gation qui ne figurait pas dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante. Je dois encore une fois souscrire \u00e0 la position de la GRC sur ce point. Les documents demand\u00e9s doivent avoir un lien avec les all\u00e9gations contenues dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions d\u2019une partie. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, la cap. Brickner n\u2019affirme pas qu\u2019elle a fait l\u2019objet de repr\u00e9sailles se pr\u00e9sentant sous la forme d\u2019une absence de possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019exercer des r\u00f4les int\u00e9rimaires.\n[70] Comme dans la demande pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, l\u2019argument de la Commission \u2013 selon lequel l\u2019essentiel de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions porte sur le traitement diff\u00e9rentiel d\u00e9favorable qu\u2019a subi la cap. Brickner \u2013 est encore une fois trop vague pour maintenant comprendre une all\u00e9gation de fait tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cise qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions d\u2019une partie. Cette demande de document fait allusion \u00e0 un acte de traitement diff\u00e9rentiel d\u00e9favorable ou de repr\u00e9sailles tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cis et il serait pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019autoriser ce qui constituerait une nouvelle all\u00e9gation de discrimination ou de repr\u00e9sailles sans avoir donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la GRC la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 celle\u2011ci dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[71] Il est toujours loisible aux parties devant le Tribunal de pr\u00e9senter une demande de modification de leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions afin d\u2019ajouter une autre all\u00e9gation.

En juin ou juillet 2012, Carla DECOCK s\u2019est port\u00e9e candidate \u00e0 un poste de r\u00e9partiteur au sein de la Division M. D\u00e8s les premi\u00e8res \u00e9tapes du processus de dotation, l\u2019agente de dotation Barb ARMSTRONG a communiqu\u00e9 avec le s.\u00e9.\u2011m. Tony PARK et l\u2019a inform\u00e9 que DECOCK s\u2019\u00e9tait port\u00e9e candidate \u00e0 un poste ou une mutation \u00e0 Whitehorse et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait la conjointe de fait du cap. Mark CASWELL. ARMSTRONG a envoy\u00e9 un courriel [traduction] \u00ab pour voir s\u2019il y aurait quelque chose pour lui \u00e0 Whitehorse \u00bb s\u2019il pouvait \u00eatre lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et a soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait actuellement \u00e0 la SEG. Compte tenu de ce processus secondaire qui a commenc\u00e9 apr\u00e8s que j\u2019ai soumis une demande d\u2019accommodement pour raisons familiales, et des efforts qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s pour s\u00e9lectionner le cap. Mark CASWELL et r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses besoins d\u2019accommodement avant que le poste au sein du GCG soit annonc\u00e9, je demande que tous les renseignements se rapportant \u00e0 Carla DECOCK et aux discussions concernant sa mutation \u00e0 Whitehorse soient divulgu\u00e9s.\n\u00b7 Une copie du dossier de dotation de Barb ARMSTRONG pour les r\u00e9partiteurs de la Division M parmi lesquels figurait Carla DECOCK (emploi affich\u00e9 en juin\/juillet 2012), y compris les copies des dossiers de la Division M et de la Division E.\n\u00b7 Je demande une copie de toutes les notes et de tous les courriels du s.\u00e9.\u2011m. PARK, de Barb ARMSTRONG et du personnel de dotation de la Division G se rapportant \u00e0 cette mesure de dotation.\n\u00b7 Tous les documents se rapportant \u00e0 toute discussion relative \u00e0 une mutation \u00e0 la Division M concernant le cap. Mark CASWELL et\/ou Carla DECOCK et les bureaux de dotation des Division E, Division M et Division G.\n\u00b7 Une copie du courriel de r\u00e9ponse du s.\u00e9.\u2011m. PARK au courriel de Barb ARMSTRONG dat\u00e9 du 18 juillet 2012, y compris toutes les notes concernant toute conversation entre le s.\u00e9.\u2011m. PARK et Barb ARMSTRONG. Le s.\u00e9.\u2011m. Park a re\u00e7u un courriel de Barb ARMSTRONG lui demandant s\u2019il pouvait s\u2019occuper de la logistique d\u2019accommodement du cap. Mark CASWELL. DECOCK a re\u00e7u un avis de mutation (1272), sans avoir particip\u00e9 \u00e0 une entrevue d\u2019embauche, quelques semaines apr\u00e8s cette communication avec le s.\u00e9.\u2011m. PARK.\n\u00b7 Pri\u00e8re de me fournir tous les documents concernant le s.\u00e9.\u2011m. PARK et le cap. CASWELL ayant trait \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat exprim\u00e9 par le cap. CASEWELL et \u00e0 son placement au sein de la Division M, y compris toute offre lui ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du poste vacant aux services g\u00e9n\u00e9raux ou toute suggestion que le cap.

BELAND, notes ayant trait \u00e0 la mutation du cap. CASWELL \u00e0 la Division M, y compris les conversations et les courriels entre Barb ARMSTRONG, le s.\u00e9.\u2011m. Tony PARK, le cap. CASWELL et Carla DECOCK.\n(i) Observations de la plaignante\n[72] La plaignante soutient que ces documents sont potentiellement pertinents parce qu\u2019ils repr\u00e9sentent une mutation lat\u00e9rale semblable, effectu\u00e9e \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 la m\u00eame \u00e9poque en 2012, qui concernait un \u00e9poux ou conjoint de fait accompagnateur. La cap. Brickner affirme que le cap. Caswell a re\u00e7u un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel en raison de son sexe et parce qu\u2019il constituait la moiti\u00e9 d\u2019un couple de membres de la GRC qui n\u2019avait pas d\u2019enfants.\n(ii) Observations de la Commission\n[73] La Commission appuie la demande et laisse entendre que les documents contiennent des renseignements essentiels pour l\u2019examen par le Tribunal du traitement diff\u00e9rentiel re\u00e7u par ces deux couples membres de la GRC.\n(iii) Observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[74] L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que les documents ayant trait \u00e0 l\u2019affectation du cap. Caswell au poste au sein du GCG ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s. La GRC accepte \u00e9galement de faire des efforts raisonnables pour trouver et produire les notes du s.\u00e9.\u2011m. Beland ayant trait \u00e0 la mutation du cap. Caswell.\n[75] Cependant, la GRC refuse de divulguer les autres documents au motif que la mesure de dotation ayant trait \u00e0 la mutation de Carla Decock \u00e0 la Division M n\u2019est pas pertinente \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions en litige devant le Tribunal. Cette demande concerne une mesure de dotation distincte pour un poste totalement diff\u00e9rent. De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la divulgation de documents contenant des renseignements priv\u00e9s de tiers non mis en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n(iv) D\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[76] Le Tribunal prend acte de l\u2019engagement de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de faire des efforts raisonnables pour trouver et produire les notes du s.\u00e9.\u2011m. Beland ayant trait \u00e0 la mutation du cap. Caswell. S\u2019il est impossible de trouver ces notes \u00e0 la suite d\u2019efforts raisonnables, la GRC informera les autres parties et le Tribunal des mesures qu\u2019elle a prises pour accomplir ses efforts. Le Tribunal ordonne la production de ces documents et impose en l\u2019occurrence le d\u00e9lai du 15 septembre 2017. Toutefois, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e est en mesure de se conformer plus t\u00f4t, la production anticip\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e pour permettre \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire de progresser vers l\u2019audition en temps utile. S\u2019il est impossible de trouver cette documentation \u00e0 la suite d\u2019efforts raisonnables, la GRC informera les autres parties et le Tribunal des mesures qu\u2019elle a prises pour accomplir ses efforts au plus tard le 15 septembre 2017.\n[77] En ce qui concerne les documents ayant trait \u00e0 la mesure de dotation pour le poste de caporal au sein du GCG prise en 2012, la GRC indique qu\u2019elle croit avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9 tous les documents pertinents de ce type qu\u2019elle a en sa possession. Le Tribunal n\u2019a donc pas \u00e0 rendre d\u2019ordonnance relativement \u00e0 ces documents. Cependant, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de fournir \u00e0 la cap. Brickner une liste de tous les documents qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fournis et qui, selon elle, correspondent \u00e0 cette partie de la demande au plus tard le 15 septembre 2017. Si de nouveaux documents pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette demande sont d\u00e9couverts, l\u2019intim\u00e9e devra les divulguer conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 6(5)b) des R\u00e8gles, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019exception visant les documents prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par un privil\u00e8ge que reconna\u00eet le droit de la preuve. S\u2019il y a des documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation est invoqu\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e indiquera aux autres parties de quels documents et de quel privil\u00e8ge il s\u2019agit.\n[78] En ce qui concerne les autres documents, le Tribunal estime que certains d\u2019entre eux sont potentiellement pertinents dans la mesure o\u00f9 les documents ayant trait au placement de Mme Decock sont li\u00e9s au placement de son conjoint de fait, le cap. Caswell. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 la GRC de communiquer tous les documents susmentionn\u00e9s ayant trait \u00e0 l\u2019affectation de Mme Decock et qui font \u00e9galement mention du cap. Caswell, sous r\u00e9serve du caviardage effectu\u00e9 pour \u00e9liminer les renseignements personnels de Mme Decock, au plus tard le 15 septembre 2017. Les autres documents ayant trait \u00e0 l\u2019affectation de celle\u2011ci \u00e0 la Division M et qui ne font pas mention du cap. Caswell ne sont pas pertinents.\n20.

Paul McCONNELL et le commissaire adjoint Peter CLARK, y compris la fa\u00e7on dont elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es, l\u2019issue de ces plaintes, et toute mesure de redressement subs\u00e9quente.\n(i) Observations de la plaignante\n[79] La plaignante soutient que ces documents sont potentiellement pertinents, car la GRC a omis d\u2019agir, d\u2019enqu\u00eater ou de reconna\u00eetre les actes de repr\u00e9sailles signal\u00e9s apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Elle affirme que les cadres sup\u00e9rieurs n\u2019ont pas suivi la politique et ont refus\u00e9 de mener une enqu\u00eate.\n(ii) Observations de la Commission\n[80] La Commission fait \u00e9tat de l\u2019omission de la GRC d\u2019\u00e9liminer le harc\u00e8lement et de respecter le Plan d\u2019action pour l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre les sexes selon la conclusion du Rapport sur le harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail \u00e0 la GRC et indique que les documents demand\u00e9s aideraient le Tribunal \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier la d\u00e9fense de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle elle remplissait avec comp\u00e9tence ses obligations relatives \u00e0 la dotation et aux droits de la personne.\n(iii) Observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[81] L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que la demande est en grande partie non pertinente \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des faits en cause, est inappropri\u00e9e et qu\u2019il est peu probable qu\u2019elle contribue \u00e0 faire avancer le d\u00e9bat et soul\u00e8verait des pr\u00e9occupations en mati\u00e8re de protection de la vie priv\u00e9e (\u00e0 la fois pour les agents nomm\u00e9s et pour les personnes ayant d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes). L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient \u00e9galement que la demande est trop g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et que la production des documents demand\u00e9s constituerait une lourde t\u00e2che.\n[82] De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que si la comp\u00e9tence de la Division M est mise en doute comme le laisse entendre la Commission, alors les plaintes provenant de l\u2019ensemble de la division devraient \u00eatre en cause, pas seulement celles d\u2019agents en particulier.\n[83] En outre, la GRC affirme qu\u2019il serait on\u00e9reux de recueillir les donn\u00e9es concernant les plaintes pour harc\u00e8lement et les griefs avant novembre 2014, date \u00e0 laquelle ces plaintes ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre consign\u00e9es au Bureau de la coordination des griefs et des appels de la GRC. La GRC soutient \u00e9galement que les griefs ont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement trait \u00e0 des questions autres que celles se rapportant aux motifs de discrimination en vertu de la Loi.\n[84] Enfin, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette demande, la GRC accepte de fournir une liste [traduction] \u00ab indiquant le nombre total de (i) plaintes pour harc\u00e8lement dans la Division M \u00e0 partir de novembre 2014 \u00e0 ce jour, et de (ii) plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne ayant trait \u00e0 la situation de famille ou au sexe dans la Division M \u00e0 partir de 2009 \u00e0 ce jour, ainsi que l\u2019issue de ces plaintes \u00bb.\n(iv) D\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[85] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que la demande de \u00ab divulgation compl\u00e8te \u00bb de la plaignante n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s utile lorsque la divulgation vise \u00e0 trouver et \u00e0 produire des documents pr\u00e9cis. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, c\u2019est utile si les parties peuvent pr\u00e9ciser le type de documents qu\u2019elles demandent. De plus, un d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9cis aiderait le Tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la documentation demand\u00e9e satisfait au crit\u00e8re de la pertinence probable.\n[86] La demande de divulgation doit avoir un lien avec les questions en litige. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la demande devrait se limiter aux plaintes semblables, soit celles relatives \u00e0 une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille ou le sexe (voir Yaffa, au paragraphe 60).\n[87] Le Tribunal remarque qu\u2019aucun des agents nomm\u00e9s dans cette demande n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 personnellement dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte. De plus, la plaignante n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli de lien rationnel entre une all\u00e9gation dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et les personnes nomm\u00e9es dans les documents \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa requ\u00eate. En outre, je suis pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le fait que ces cinq personnes seulement soient vis\u00e9es particuli\u00e8rement sans qu\u2019aucun motif ne soit fourni au Tribunal dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions ou dans les documents \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate, vu le risque de conclure \u00e0 une faute de leur part ou de le supposer. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e qu\u2019un examen de toutes les plaintes relatives \u00e0 la situation de famille et au sexe dans la Division M serait plus appropri\u00e9. Je tiens \u00e9galement \u00e0 souligner qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019exception du commissaire adjoint Clark, il est pr\u00e9vu que toutes les personnes nomm\u00e9es ci-dessus seront appel\u00e9es \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l\u2019audition. La cap. Brickner aura donc l\u2019occasion au cours du contre-interrogatoire de poser des questions concernant leur participation ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne ayant trait \u00e0 la situation de famille et au sexe.\n[88] De plus, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la plaignante a demand\u00e9 une \u00ab divulgation compl\u00e8te \u00bb, le Tribunal en d\u00e9duit qu\u2019elle aimerait obtenir tous les d\u00e9tails de chaque plainte. Cependant, le Tribunal est pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le fait que les d\u00e9tails de chaque plainte pourraient ne pas \u00eatre pertinents. En effet, la plaignante n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi les d\u00e9tails seraient pertinents dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. De plus, les personnes qui prennent l\u2019initiative de d\u00e9poser des plaintes pour harc\u00e8lement ou discrimination ne devraient pas \u00eatre dissuad\u00e9es de le faire par crainte que leur histoire soit rendue publique, \u00e0 l\u2019avenir, dans le cadre d\u2019une instance non reli\u00e9e devant le Tribunal. La divulgation de documents de nature d\u00e9licate ne devrait \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9e que dans des circonstances exceptionnelles o\u00f9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 et la pertinence probable sont clairement d\u00e9montr\u00e9es. La GRC a soulev\u00e9 un autre point selon lequel le d\u00e9tachement de Whitehorse est un petit bureau et ces questions sont particuli\u00e8rement d\u00e9licates. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que m\u00eame lorsque le Tribunal rend une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 l\u2019instruction d\u2019une plainte, la divulgation pourrait quand m\u00eame semer l\u2019inqui\u00e9tude parmi les coll\u00e8gues de travail qui ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes dans le pass\u00e9.\n[89] Je souscris \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019observation de la GRC selon laquelle la proc\u00e9dure de grief ne se rapporte g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas \u00e0 des plaintes de discrimination en vertu de la Loi. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne suis pas convaincu que la divulgation de tous les griefs d\u00e9pos\u00e9s contre ces personnes soit pertinente.\n[90] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, cette demande est rejet\u00e9e. Cependant, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019offre de la GRC, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de produire une liste indiquant le nombre total de (i) plaintes pour harc\u00e8lement dans la Division M \u00e0 partir de novembre 2014 \u00e0 ce jour, et de (ii) plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne ayant trait \u00e0 la situation de famille ou au sexe dans la Division M \u00e0 partir de 2009 \u00e0 ce jour, ainsi que l\u2019issue de ces plaintes. M\u00eame si cela n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape de la proc\u00e9dure, l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut rendre la liste anonyme pour pr\u00e9server l\u2019identit\u00e9 des tiers.\n21. Une divulgation compl\u00e8te concernant tous les griefs ou plaintes survenus sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de l\u2019insp. Phil GOULET, l\u2019officier responsable du groupe de la dotation et des promotions o\u00f9 les candidats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9s du bassin de candidats valid\u00e9s lorsqu\u2019il y a eu une objection \u00e9tay\u00e9e de la part d\u2019un membre du comit\u00e9 de validation, y compris la mani\u00e8re dont ceux-ci ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9s et l\u2019issue de ces plaintes.\n(i) Observations de la plaignante\n[91] La cap. Brickner soutient que ces documents sont potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa plainte pour repr\u00e9sailles. Pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle croit que cette divulgation d\u00e9montrera qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e diff\u00e9remment des autres par suite d\u2019une d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 la politique officielle.\n[92] Prenant acte des objections formul\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans ses observations en r\u00e9plique, la cap. Brickner a modifi\u00e9 cette demande pour demander trois exemples de processus de promotion comparables, o\u00f9 l\u2019objection du candidat \u00e9tait appuy\u00e9e et o\u00f9, plut\u00f4t que de suivre la politique et de retirer le membre du comit\u00e9 de validation, le candidat a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 du bassin de candidats.\n(ii) Observations de la Commission\n[93] La Commission appuie cette demande puisqu\u2019elle peut d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence de repr\u00e9sailles et d\u2019un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel. La Commission reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il y aurait des pr\u00e9occupations en mati\u00e8re de protection de la vie priv\u00e9e.\n(iii) Observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[94] L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la demande au motif qu\u2019elle est trop g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et trop on\u00e9reuse. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9 dans la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la demande no 7 ci\u2011dessus, la GRC s\u2019engage \u00e0 continuer \u00e0 faire des efforts raisonnables pour fournir tous les documents pertinents en rapport avec le processus de promotion relatif au r\u00e9viseur de la PC. Cependant, la GRC soutient que le processus pour se conformer \u00e0 cette demande serait tr\u00e8s on\u00e9reux et prendrait du temps, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle devrait manuellement passer en revue des milliers de mesures de dotation pour trouver les renseignements demand\u00e9s.\n(iv) D\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[95] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que la demande initiale est trop g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et prendrait trop de temps par rapport \u00e0 la valeur probante indiqu\u00e9e par la cap. Brickner. La demande r\u00e9vis\u00e9e, dans les observations en r\u00e9plique de la cap. Brickner, n\u2019a pas de valeur probante en l\u2019absence d\u2019un contexte suffisant, et ne constitue pas, en fait, le type de divulgation vis\u00e9 par la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. La cap. Brickner cherche \u00e0 produire devant le Tribunal des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9tablissant qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e diff\u00e9remment. En l\u2019absence de documents pr\u00e9cis pouvant d\u00e9crire le traitement diff\u00e9rentiel d\u00e9favorable pr\u00e9cis dont elle a fait l\u2019objet, elle cherche \u00e0 fournir au Tribunal trois exemples al\u00e9atoires qui, selon elle, appuient ses all\u00e9gations. La meilleure fa\u00e7on, pour la cap. Brickner, de produire devant le Tribunal les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019elle cherche \u00e0 produire est dans le cadre du contre\u2011interrogatoire des t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a inscrit l\u2019insp. Phil Goulet sur la liste de t\u00e9moins qu\u2019elle entend faire t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l\u2019audition. Cette demande est donc rejet\u00e9e.\n22. Des copies des curriculums vitae (CV) des t\u00e9moins et\/ou personnes mentionn\u00e9s comme experts en la mati\u00e8re suivants :\n\u00b7 s.\u00e9.-m. Tony PARK\n\u00b7 s.\u00e9.-m. Chuck LAN\n\u00b7 s.\u00e9.-m Doug COOPER\n\u00b7 insp. Keith BRAMHILL\n\u00b7 insp. Phil GOULET\n\u00b7 s.\u00e9.-m. Jason FLYNN\n\u00b7 insp. Stacey TABLOT\n\u00b7 Cyndi DESHARNAIS\n\u00b7 s.\u00e9.-m. Diane DOYLE\n(i) Observations de la plaignante\n[96] La plaignante ne donne aucun motif pour cette demande dans sa requ\u00eate. Dans ses observations en r\u00e9plique, elle indique qu\u2019elle aimerait obtenir les CV pour d\u00e9terminer les connaissances, les comp\u00e9tences et les capacit\u00e9s de ceux qui ont particip\u00e9 directement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Les observations en r\u00e9plique comprennent un certain nombre de d\u00e9clarations qui ne sont pas des arguments, mais des affirmations non \u00e9tay\u00e9es concernant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n(ii) Observations de la Commission\n[97] La Commission fait \u00e9tat du Rapport sur le harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail \u00e0 la GRC et \u00e0 sa conclusion voulant que souvent les personnes nomm\u00e9es aux postes administratifs cl\u00e9s de niveau sup\u00e9rieur ne poss\u00e8dent pas les comp\u00e9tences sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es. Cela donne \u00e0 entendre que ces CV sont pertinents parce qu\u2019ils d\u00e9montreraient que les personnes qui ont particip\u00e9 au traitement de ses demandes d\u2019accommodement ne comprenaient pas les obligations de la GRC en vertu de la Loi.\n(iii) Observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[98] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que les CV ne sont pas pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Aucune des personnes mentionn\u00e9es dans cette demande ne comparaissent devant le Tribunal \u00e0 titre de t\u00e9moin expert, dans le cas o\u00f9 la demande de CV serait justifi\u00e9e. En fait, deux des personnes mentionn\u00e9es, la s.\u00e9.\u2011m. Doyle et l\u2019insp. Talbot, n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9es comme t\u00e9moins par aucune des parties.\n(iv) D\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[99] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que les renseignements que la cap. Brickner vise \u00e0 obtenir dans ces CV, notamment savoir si chaque personne \u00e9tait form\u00e9e ou non en ce qui concerne ses obligations en vertu de la Loi, peuvent ne pas figurer dans ces documents. La meilleure m\u00e9thode pour produire ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve devant le Tribunal consiste, pour la cap. Brickner, \u00e0 faire la lumi\u00e8re sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dans le cadre d\u2019un contre-interrogatoire. Par cons\u00e9quent, cette demande est rejet\u00e9e.\n23. Des copies de toutes les notes des personnes suivantes ayant trait \u00e0 moi-m\u00eame, mon mari (lorsque je suis mentionn\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant son \u00e9pouse dans les documents) et mes plaintes (grief\/plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne) qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sum\u00e9es et simplifi\u00e9es au sein de la GRC comme \u00e9tant une mutation lat\u00e9rale, y compris ma plainte de harc\u00e8lement (repr\u00e9sailles).\n\u00b7 Maureen LEVY\n\u00b7 Stacey TALBOT\n\u00b7 Jerry SCOTT\n\u00b7 Ken TURNER\n\u00b7 Dan DUBEAU\n\u00b7 Cindy RATTRAY\n\u00b7 Elizabeth MACDONALD\n\u00b7 Garry JAY\n\u00b7 John BREWER\n\u00b7 Brian JONES\n\u00b7 Allan LUCIER\n\u00b7 Karen BYRNE\n\u00b7 Patrice DESJARDINS\n\u00b7 Phil GOULET\n\u00b7 Jasmin BRETON\n\u00b7 Peter CLARK\n\u00b7 Sharon WOODBURN\n\u00b7 Doug HARRIS\n\u00b7 Mark LONDON\n\u00b7 Jason FLYNN\n\u00b7 Archie THOMPSON\n\u00b7 Ken FOSTER\n\u00b7 Dan AUSTIN\n\u00b7 Tony PARK\n\u00b7 Gerry ELL\n\u00b7 Neil CROSS\n\u00b7 Scott SHEPPARD\n\u00b7 Pat Mulhall\n(i) Observations de la plaignante\n[100] La cap. Brickner soutient que ces cadres sup\u00e9rieurs de la GRC ont particip\u00e9 aux processus qui ont eu des r\u00e9percussions sur sa situation de famille, y compris la demande initiale d\u2019accommodement, les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s sexistes, le traitement in\u00e9quitable, les s\u00e9parations familiales, le harc\u00e8lement et les actes de repr\u00e9sailles en cours. Elle soutient que les notes d\u00e9montreront les processus de la GRC et le r\u00f4le des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs de la GRC relativement aux questions comme le harc\u00e8lement, les plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et les actes de discrimination et de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[101] Dans ses observations en r\u00e9plique, la cap. Brickner d\u00e9crit plus en d\u00e9tail les r\u00f4les du surintendant principal Sheppard, du surintendant Jones et de l\u2019inspecteur Austin et la pertinence possible de leurs notes. Elle indique que le surintendant principal Sheppard avait eu des communications par courriel et par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone avec le surintendant principal Peter Clark en ce qui concerne sa situation et sa mutation au Yukon. Le surintendant Jones est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la Division M en janvier 2016. La cap. Brickner indique qu\u2019il a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement des griefs qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en mai 2016 et qui demeure en suspens en attendant l\u2019issue de la pr\u00e9sente audition. L\u2019inspecteur Dan Austin est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la Division M en septembre 2015 et la cap. Brickner affirme qu\u2019il ne l\u2019a pas salu\u00e9e et l\u2019a ignor\u00e9e durant les six premi\u00e8res semaines apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 install\u00e9e pr\u00e8s de son bureau.\n(ii) Observations de la Commission\n[102] La Commission soutient que la production de ces notes est essentielle pour l\u2019examen ad\u00e9quat des questions soulev\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Les notes sont essentielles pour l\u2019examen complet des communications, de l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019esprit et du raisonnement des membres de la GRC qui ont particip\u00e9 aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la plainte de la cap. Brickner.\n(iii) Observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[103] L\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9clare qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9 toutes les notes pertinentes des personnes suivantes qu\u2019elle a en sa possession : Phil Goulet, Doug Harris, Mark London, Tony Park et Elizabeth Macdonald.\n[104] L\u2019intim\u00e9e accepte de faire des efforts raisonnables pour trouver et produire lesdites notes des personnes suivantes : Stacey Talbot, Dan Dubeau, Cindy Ratrray, Peter Clark, Sharon Woodburn et Archie Thompson.\n[105] La GRC fournit des d\u00e9tails concernant messieurs Sheppard, Jones et Austin, et soutient qu\u2019ils n\u2019occupaient pas de postes pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de la discrimination et des repr\u00e9sailles all\u00e9gu\u00e9es.\n[106] L\u2019intim\u00e9e refuse de produire les notes des autres personnes, car elles ne sont pas pertinentes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des all\u00e9gations pr\u00e9cises faites dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la cap. Brickner et dans sa r\u00e9plique \u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n(iv) D\u00e9cision du Tribunal\n[107] Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas \u00e0 ordonner de divulgation relativement \u00e0 la demande concernant les notes de Phil Goulet, Doug Harris, Mark London, Tony Park et Elizabeth Macdonald, car la GRC indique qu\u2019elle croit avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9 tous les documents pertinents de ce type qu\u2019elle a en sa possession. Cependant, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de fournir \u00e0 la cap. Brickner une liste de tous les documents qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fournis et qui, selon elle, correspondent \u00e0 cette demande au plus tard le 15 septembre 2017. Si de nouveaux documents pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette demande sont d\u00e9couverts, l\u2019intim\u00e9e devra les divulguer conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 6(5)b) des R\u00e8gles, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019exception visant les documents prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par un privil\u00e8ge que reconna\u00eet le droit de la preuve. S\u2019il y a des documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation est invoqu\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e indiquera aux autres parties de quels documents et de quel privil\u00e8ge il s\u2019agit.\n[108] La GRC a convenu de divulguer et de produire les notes de Stacey Talbot, Dan Dubeau, Cindy Ratrray, Peter Clark, Sharon Woodburn et Archie Thompson. Le Tribunal ordonne la production des notes de ces personnes, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, se rapportant \u00e0 la cap. Brickner et\/ou au cap. Marinis, mais seulement en ce qui concerne la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et qui fait l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente instance. Le Tribunal impose le d\u00e9lai du 15 septembre 2017 pour se conformer \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance. Il est entendu que l\u2019ordonnance de divulgation comprend les notes relatives au(x) poste(s) au sein du GCG et au poste de r\u00e9viseur de la PC, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les all\u00e9gations de discrimination et de repr\u00e9sailles de la plaignante semblent reposer essentiellement sur ces mesures de dotation. Toutefois, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e est en mesure de se conformer plus t\u00f4t, la production anticip\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e pour permettre \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire de progresser vers l\u2019audition en temps utile. S\u2019il y a des documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation est invoqu\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e indiquera aux autres parties de quels documents et de quel privil\u00e8ge il s\u2019agit.\n[109] Ayant tenu compte des observations en r\u00e9plique de la cap. Brickner, le Tribunal conclut que les notes personnelles du surintendant principal Sheppard sont potentiellement pertinentes. M\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 commandant pour le Yukon avant novembre 2016, il semble avoir particip\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la mutation de la cap. Brickner au Yukon. Le Tribunal ordonne la production des notes du surintendant principal Sheppard, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, se rapportant \u00e0 la cap. Brickner et\/ou au cap. Marinis, en ce qui concerne le grief et\/ou la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et qui fait l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente instance et impose le d\u00e9lai du 15 septembre 2017 pour se conformer \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance. Il est entendu que l\u2019ordonnance de divulgation comprend les notes relatives au(x) poste(s) au sein du GCG et au poste de r\u00e9viseur de la PC, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les all\u00e9gations de discrimination et de repr\u00e9sailles de la plaignante semblent reposer essentiellement sur ces mesures de dotation. Toutefois, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e est en mesure de se conformer plus t\u00f4t, la production anticip\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e pour permettre \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire de progresser vers l\u2019audition en temps utile. S\u2019il y a des documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation est invoqu\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e indiquera aux autres parties de quels documents et de quel privil\u00e8ge il s\u2019agit.\n[110] En ce qui concerne la demande de la plaignante visant les notes du surintendant Jones, le Tribunal remarque que le grief de harc\u00e8lement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 contre le surintendant Jones et d\u00e9taill\u00e9 par la cap. Brickner dans ses observations en r\u00e9plique n\u2019est pas une question dont est saisi le Tribunal. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que cette question d\u00e9borde le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente instruction, aucune ordonnance n\u2019est rendue relativement aux notes se rapportant \u00e0 ce grief. Cependant, le Tribunal ordonne la production des notes du surintendant Jones, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, se rapportant \u00e0 la cap. Brickner et\/ou au cap. Marinis, en ce qui concerne la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et qui fait l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente instance, et impose le d\u00e9lai du 15 septembre 2017 pour se conformer \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance. Il est entendu que l\u2019ordonnance de divulgation comprend les notes relatives au(x) poste(s) au sein du GCG et au poste de r\u00e9viseur de la PC, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les all\u00e9gations de discrimination et de repr\u00e9sailles de la plaignante semblent reposer essentiellement sur ces mesures de dotation. Toutefois, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e est en mesure de se conformer plus t\u00f4t, la production anticip\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e pour permettre \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire de progresser vers l\u2019audition en temps utile. S\u2019il y a des documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation est invoqu\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e indiquera aux autres parties de quels documents et de quel privil\u00e8ge il s\u2019agit.\n[111] La plaignante ne m\u2019a pas convaincu que les notes de l\u2019inspecteur Austin sont potentiellement pertinentes. Son all\u00e9gation selon laquelle il ne l\u2019a pas salu\u00e9e et ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 install\u00e9e pr\u00e8s de son bureau n\u2019a aucun lien avec les all\u00e9gations de discrimination d\u00e9taill\u00e9es dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la cap. Brickner. De plus, j\u2019estime que le comportement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 n\u2019appuie pas l\u2019all\u00e9gation de la Commission voulant que la cap. Brickner ait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart d\u2019une mani\u00e8re susceptible de nuire \u00e0 ses possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019avancement futures. M\u00eame si la cap. Brickner affirme que l\u2019inspecteur Austin a \u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, son superviseur int\u00e9rimaire, elle n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 les dates et n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que le comportement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 s\u2019est produit durant cette p\u00e9riode.\n[112] En ce qui concerne les notes personnelles de Jason Flynn et Neil Cross, elles sont mentionn\u00e9es dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante et l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions en r\u00e9plique respectivement par nom et, \u00e0 ce titre, j\u2019accepterai l\u2019argument selon lequel leurs notes sont potentiellement pertinentes. Le Tribunal ordonne la production des notes de messieurs Flynn et Cross, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, se rapportant \u00e0 la cap. Brickner et\/ou au cap. Marinis, en ce qui concerne sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et impose le d\u00e9lai du 15 septembre 2017 pour se conformer \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance. Il est entendu que l\u2019ordonnance de divulgation comprend les notes relatives au(x) poste(s) au sein du GCG et au poste de r\u00e9viseur de la PC, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les all\u00e9gations de discrimination et de repr\u00e9sailles de la plaignante semblent reposer essentiellement sur ces mesures de dotation. Toutefois, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e est en mesure de se conformer plus t\u00f4t, la production anticip\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e pour permettre \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire de progresser vers l\u2019audition en temps utile. S\u2019il y a des documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation est invoqu\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e indiquera aux autres parties de quels documents et de quel privil\u00e8ge il s\u2019agit.\n[113] Les noms de Maureen Levy, Jerry Scott, Ken Turner, Garry Jay, John Brewer, Allan Lucier, Karen Byrne, Patrice Desjardins, Jasmin Breton, Ken Foster, Gerry Ell et Pat Mulhall ne figurent nulle part dans les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions des parties. Bien que certains de ces noms ne figurent que dans la liste des documents divulgu\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le Tribunal ne conna\u00eet pas le r\u00f4le que peuvent avoir jou\u00e9 ces personnes dans les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli de lien entre ces personnes et les faits, les questions ou les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par les parties au pr\u00e9sent diff\u00e9rend. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plaignante n\u2019a pas convaincu le Tribunal que ces notes sont potentiellement pertinentes, si elles existent.

La plainte et la requ\u00eate\n[1] Il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire de l\u2019intim\u00e9e demandant au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner au plaignant de se soumettre \u00e0 une expertise m\u00e9dicale par un expert retenu par l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[2] Je ne mentionnerai pas dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision tous les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans le litige principal; essentiellement, le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment et qu\u2019il s\u2019est vu injustement d\u00e9cerner des points de p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 dans son dossier disciplinaire, le tout ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement le 5 octobre 2012. Le motif de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans ce dossier et retenu par le Tribunal est la d\u00e9ficience.\n[3] Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 rendu d\u00e9cision le 30 mars 2017 sur une requ\u00eate en radiation d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et le 11 mai 2017 sur une requ\u00eate en amendement du plaignant. Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement \u00e9mis des directives claires aux parties le 16 juin 2017 quant aux requ\u00eates en divulgation soumises par le plaignant et par l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[4] Le Tribunal \u00e9tudie maintenant la requ\u00eate en expertise m\u00e9dicale de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et a re\u00e7u les soumissions \u00e9crites du plaignant et de la Commission en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate. Aucune r\u00e9plique de l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\nII. Les questions en litige\n[5] Le Tribunal rel\u00e8ve les questions suivantes suite au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la requ\u00eate en expertise m\u00e9dicale de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et des soumissions \u00e9crites des parties :\na) La comp\u00e9tence et les pouvoirs du Tribunal et la question d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale soulev\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e ; et\nb) Les droits du plaignant.\nIII. Analyse\nA. Le Tribunal a-t-il le pouvoir et les comp\u00e9tences pour ordonner que le plaignant se soumette \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical ind\u00e9pendant?\n[6] Il est important tout d\u2019abord de signaler que la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019est pas grandement \u00e9tay\u00e9e. Malgr\u00e9 les r\u00e9ponses claires soumises par le plaignant et la Commission, qui s\u2019objectent \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate, aucune r\u00e9plique de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise au Tribunal afin de me permettre de mieux comprendre les raisons pour lesquelles cette derni\u00e8re requiert une telle expertise m\u00e9dicale. En fait, l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne donne aucune raison juridique et ne soul\u00e8ve aucun point l\u00e9gal dans sa requ\u00eate, autre que la question d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale sur laquelle je me prononcerai un peu plus loin. Sa requ\u00eate est tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[7] La Commission, dans sa r\u00e9ponse, soul\u00e8ve la question des pouvoirs du Tribunal pour s\u2019objecter \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, la Commission fait valoir qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune r\u00e8gle de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal qui lui permettrait d\u2019\u00e9mettre une telle ordonnance.\n[8] Selon moi, il n'y a aucune disposition dans la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne (LCDP) ou dans les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal qui pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment l\u2019\u00e9mission d\u2019une telle ordonnance. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les tribunaux administratifs sont ma\u00eetres de leur proc\u00e9dure, il est moins souvent question de savoir ce que le l\u00e9gislateur a permis, mais plut\u00f4t de comment interpr\u00e9ter les pouvoirs qui leurs sont octroy\u00e9s. Par ailleurs, les tribunaux administratifs sont souvent appel\u00e9s \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter le silence du l\u00e9gislateur \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif en vigueur. Par cons\u00e9quent, il faut se demander si le Tribunal jouit du pouvoir accessoire ou implicite de le faire.\n[9] Sans \u00e9tayer son argument, l\u2019intim\u00e9e r\u00e9f\u00e8re dans son avis de requ\u00eate au principe d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 une audience juste et \u00e9quitable pour justifier sa requ\u00eate en expertise m\u00e9dicale.\n[10] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je citerai Day c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale), 2002 CanLII 45923 (TCDP) (\u00ab Day \u00bb) aux paragrs. 22-24 :\n[22] \u2026 Par cons\u00e9quent, d'o\u00f9 le Tribunal tient-il son pouvoir provisoire de trancher de telles questions? \u00c0 mon avis, la r\u00e9ponse r\u00e9side dans la comp\u00e9tence accessoire ou subsidiaire du Tribunal, sans laquelle un organisme officieux ne peut s'acquitter de son mandat.\n[23] Employ\u00e9 dans ce contexte, le terme comp\u00e9tence accessoire signifie simplement qu'un organisme dot\u00e9 d'un mandat officieux a le pouvoir de faire ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer une audience \u00e9quitable conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la Loi. Ce pouvoir est inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure relevant de la Loi plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 la nature du Tribunal, ce qui n'est pas le cas des cours, qui tirent leurs pouvoirs de leur comp\u00e9tence inh\u00e9rente. Le r\u00f4le fondamental que la Loi conf\u00e8re au Tribunal est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 50(1), qui exige que le Tribunal donne aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leur preuve. Cet article d\u00e9limite la port\u00e9e naturelle de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal. Il faut s'interroger sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure observ\u00e9e par le Tribunal pour d\u00e9terminer si celui-ci est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 rendre une ordonnance qui, \u00e0 proprement parler, d\u00e9borde le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure. Il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un crit\u00e8re pragmatique qui ne se limite pas \u00e0 l'application de r\u00e8gles rigides.\n[24] Il faut se garder de pousser trop loin tous ces arguments. La comp\u00e9tence accessoire du Tribunal comporte de nombreuses limites et ne conf\u00e8re pas \u00e0 ce dernier les pouvoirs plus g\u00e9n\u00e9raux dont jouissent les cours. Toutefois, il est \u00e9vident que le l\u00e9gislateur n'a pas voulu priver le Tribunal des pouvoirs essentiels dont il a besoin pour s'acquitter de son mandat et appliquer la Loi. Cette opinion est conforme \u00e0 la nature quasi constitutionnelle de la Loi, qui doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on large et lib\u00e9rale. \u00c0 mon avis, la question que je dois me poser est la suivante : ces pouvoirs s'\u00e9tendent-ils \u00e0 l'ordonnance demand\u00e9e. Afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, il est n\u00e9cessaire selon moi d'examiner la nature des int\u00e9r\u00eats qui seraient compromis par une telle ordonnance.\n[11] Je suis d\u2019accord avec les propos de mon coll\u00e8gue le membre Groarke dans cette d\u00e9cision. Je consid\u00e8re que le Tribunal, par le biais de ses comp\u00e9tences accessoires ou implicites, pourrait \u00e9mettre de telles ordonnances dans des circonstances bien pr\u00e9cises et appropri\u00e9es. Cependant, tout comme dans la d\u00e9cision Day, je suis inqui\u00e8te du fait que le Tribunal puisse jouir de tels pouvoirs d\u2019intrusion dans la vie priv\u00e9e et je crois que le Tribunal se doit de proc\u00e9der avec beaucoup de prudence dans ces cas-l\u00e0.\n[12] Je ne me prononcerai pas davantage sur la question de la comp\u00e9tence car de toute fa\u00e7on je ne suis pas pr\u00eate \u00e0 donner carte blanche \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e et d\u2019acquiescer \u00e0 sa requ\u00eate. Voici pourquoi.\nB. Les droits du plaignant\n[13] Le fondement m\u00eame de la protection des droits de la personne \u00e9tant bas\u00e9 sur la dignit\u00e9 de la personne, le Tribunal doit \u00ab faire preuve de circonspection avant d'obliger un plaignant r\u00e9calcitrant \u00e0 se soumettre \u00e0 un examen administr\u00e9 par des personnes dont l'intim\u00e9 aura retenu les services. \u00bb (Rogers c. Deckx Ltd., 2002 CanLII 61838 (TCDP), au paragr. 9).\n[14] La LCDP est fond\u00e9e sur la dignit\u00e9 et la valeur de la personne. Les tribunaux des droits de la personne doivent donc respecter les valeurs fondamentales que sont l'autonomie de l'individu et la protection de la dignit\u00e9 de la personne, ce qui implique une certaine protection de la vie priv\u00e9e. Un tribunal qui est confront\u00e9 \u00e0 une requ\u00eate d'une des parties en vue d'une ordonnance, tel qu\u2019une requ\u00eate en expertise m\u00e9dicale, devrait donc se demander si celle-ci aura un impact sur ces valeurs et si cet impact est justifiable.\n[15] Chaque cas est donc un cas d\u2019esp\u00e8ce et doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9 en cons\u00e9quence.\n[16] Le fait d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 une partie de se soumettre \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical est en soi un acte coercitif. Je dois \u00eatre tr\u00e8s vigilante avant d\u2019acquiescer \u00e0 une telle demande qui touche \u00e0 un aspect essentiel de la personne. L\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 physique et psychologique d\u2019un individu sont \u00e0 la base m\u00eame des droits de la personne et pourraient faire intervenir l\u2019article 7 de la charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s dans la mesure o\u00f9 celle-ci prot\u00e8ge la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne (Day, supra, paragr. 28; Blencoe c. Colombie-Britannique (Human Rights Commission), 2000 CSC 44, paragrs. 55-57).\n[17] Le fondement d'une plainte concernant les droits de la personne est la discrimination ; les questions d'ordre m\u00e9dical sont subordonn\u00e9es \u00e0 la question principale qui fait l'objet de l'instruction de la plainte. Dans ce cas-ci, la question principale fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans le dossier qui remontent, au plus tard, \u00e0 2012.\n[18] Dans le cas qui nous pr\u00e9occupe plus particuli\u00e8rement ici, le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment et qu\u2019il s\u2019est vu injustement d\u00e9cerner des points de p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 dans son dossier disciplinaire, le tout ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement le 5 octobre 2012. Le motif de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9 est la d\u00e9ficience.\n[19] Le plaignant comprend que ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents psychologiques seront examin\u00e9s lors de l\u2019audition de la plainte, en lien avec les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s et le moment o\u00f9 ces faits se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s. Ce qui le pr\u00e9occupe c\u2019est le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e cherche \u00e0 obtenir par le biais de cette requ\u00eate en expertise m\u00e9dicale des renseignements sur son \u00e9tat m\u00e9dical actuel qui n\u2019ont rien \u00e0 voir avec le litige. Je partage ses pr\u00e9occupations.\n[20] Nous sommes maintenant en 2017, plus de cinq ans apr\u00e8s les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. Le Tribunal ne croit pas qu\u2019une expertise m\u00e9dicale \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape-ci du processus permettra d\u2019\u00e9clairer le Tribunal sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments en litige et qui remontent \u00e0 2012 et avant. L\u2019expertise m\u00e9dicale requise par l\u2019intim\u00e9e est donc non-pertinente.\n[21] Le fait que le plaignant ne se soumette pas \u00e0 une expertise m\u00e9dicale ind\u00e9pendante comme le souhaite l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019emp\u00eachera aucunement l\u2019intim\u00e9e de faire sa contre-preuve lors de l\u2019audition de la plainte. Ainsi, l\u2019intim\u00e9e, par le biais de ses avocats, aura, entre autres, tout le loisir de contre-interroger le plaignant ou les experts du plaignant qui viendront t\u00e9moigner quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat de d\u00e9ficience du plaignant au moment des faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s.\n[22] Finalement, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment le plus important est que je suis d\u2019accord avec les soumissions de la Commission dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 l\u2019effet que le fardeau de la preuve repose sur le plaignant de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il existe une cause prima facie de discrimination. Pour ce faire, le plaignant devra satisfaire aux trois crit\u00e8res, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il devra d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il poss\u00e9dait, au moment pertinent, une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par la LCDP contre la discrimination, qu\u2019il a subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable et que la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable.

Mise en contexte\n[1] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) re\u00e7oit, le 4 f\u00e9vrier 2015, une plainte de Mme Sandra Temple (la plaignante) \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la compagnie Horizon International Distributors (la compagnie, l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou Horizon) affirmant avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur son sexe ainsi que sa d\u00e9ficience. Ce basant sur ces deux motifs, elle all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e au cours de son emploi et que la compagnie a refus\u00e9 de continuer de l\u2019employer, en violation de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne (LCDP ou la Loi).\n[2] Le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2016, la Commission a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) afin que celui-ci instruise la plainte en vertu de l\u2019article 44(3)(a) de la LCDP.\n[3] Le 22 d\u00e9cembre 2016, le vice-pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal, Susheel Gupta, a rendu une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate quant au lieu de l\u2019audition. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019audition aurait lieu \u00e0 deux endroits diff\u00e9rents soit \u00e0 Calgary (du 23 au 25 mai 2017), pour les t\u00e9moins appel\u00e9s par la plaignante et \u00e0 Winnipeg (du 6 au 9 juin 2017) pour les t\u00e9moins appel\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Lors des trois premiers jours d\u2019audition \u00e0 Calgary, la plaignante \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente et accompagn\u00e9e de son fils, Jonathan Temple. \u00c9taient aussi pr\u00e9sents l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Me Terra Welsh, et un repr\u00e9sentant de la compagnie, Luc Dub\u00e9. Deux autres repr\u00e9sentants de la compagnie, Gilbert Dub\u00e9 et sa conjointe, ont assist\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience par visioconf\u00e9rence de Winnipeg. Lors des quatre jours d\u2019audition suivants \u00e0 Winnipeg, les repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9taient tous pr\u00e9sents et assist\u00e9s de leur avocate. Mme Temple a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audition via visioconf\u00e9rence, de Calgary, toujours accompagn\u00e9e de son fils.\n[4] Consid\u00e9rant l\u2019utilisation continue de la visioconf\u00e9rence lors de cette audition de sept jours incluant certains t\u00e9moignages, le Tribunal a fait preuve d\u2019une grande proactivit\u00e9 afin d\u2019encadrer les parties tout au long de l\u2019audition notamment sur la gestion de la documentation et des t\u00e9moignages. Le Tribunal s\u2019est \u00e9galement assur\u00e9 que les parties \u00e9taient en mesure de bien suivre et comprendre le d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019audition, m\u00eame si celles-ci \u00e9taient \u00e0 distance. Le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 aux parties et a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9, \u00e0 de tr\u00e8s nombreuses reprises, de l\u2019informer notamment s\u2019il y avait quelconques difficult\u00e9s technologiques. Les parties n\u2019ont pas h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 informer le Tribunal dans ces situations et des mesures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises afin de corriger la situation.\n[5] \u00c0 Calgary, Mme Temple a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re. Elle a ensuite appel\u00e9 trois t\u00e9moins : M. Paul Murray, camionneur et ami, M. Yves Carriere, camionneur de la compagnie et ancien coll\u00e8gue de travail, ainsi que Jonathan Temple, son fils. \u00c0 Winnipeg, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a appel\u00e9 six t\u00e9moins : Gilbert Dub\u00e9, pr\u00e9sident de la compagnie, Luc Dub\u00e9, directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la compagnie, Sheldon Savage, superviseur de la maintenance, Terry Matthews et Verne Wyatt, r\u00e9partiteurs, ainsi que David Yach, ancien camionneur de la compagnie.\n[6] Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les diff\u00e9rents t\u00e9moignages et sauf \u00e0 quelques exceptions pr\u00e8s qui seront trait\u00e9es ult\u00e9rieurement dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, rien ne m\u2019indique que les t\u00e9moins n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 francs et cr\u00e9dibles dans leur t\u00e9moignage. De plus, le Tribunal reconnait la pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance de Mme Temple et son respect envers le processus quasi judiciaire. Le Tribunal reconnait \u00e9galement le bon travail de Me Welsh. Les parties ont bien collabor\u00e9 et un sentiment de coll\u00e9gialit\u00e9 \u00e9tait palpable tout au long de l\u2019audition.\n[7] Ceci \u00e9tant dit, je dois rendre une d\u00e9cision bas\u00e9e sur la preuve qui m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Pour les raisons qui suivent, je conclus que la plainte de Mme Temple n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e. Mme Temple n\u2019a pas rencontr\u00e9 le fardeau de preuve d\u2019un cas prima facie de discrimination plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment que la ou les caract\u00e9ristique(s) prot\u00e9g\u00e9e(s) par la LCDP a (ou ont) constitu\u00e9 un (ou des) facteur(s) dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable.\nII. Les dispositions pertinentes de la Loi\n[8] Dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier, les dispositions suivantes de la Loi sont pertinentes : 2 et 3(1), 7(a) et (b), 15(1)(a), 15(2), 53(1), 53(2), 53(3) et 53(4).\n[9] Ces dispositions de la Loi \u00e9noncent ce qui suit :\n2 La pr\u00e9sente loi a pour objet de compl\u00e9ter la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet, dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada, au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, les caract\u00e9ristiques g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques, la d\u00e9ficience ou l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\n3 (1) Pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, les caract\u00e9ristiques g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques, l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n7 Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\n15 (1) Ne constituent pas des actes discriminatoires :\na) les refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de l\u2019employeur qui d\u00e9montre qu\u2019ils d\u00e9coulent d\u2019exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es;\n[\u2026]\n15 (2) Les faits pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)a) sont des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es ou un motif justifiable, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)g), s\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019une personne ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n53 (1) \u00c0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction, le membre instructeur rejette la plainte qu\u2019il juge non fond\u00e9e.\n53(2) \u00c0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 54, ordonner, selon les circonstances, \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire :\na) de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019acte et de prendre, en consultation avec la Commission relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables, notamment :\ni) d\u2019adopter un programme, un plan ou un arrangement vis\u00e9s au paragraphe 16(1);\nii) de pr\u00e9senter une demande d\u2019approbation et de mettre en \u0153uvre un programme pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 17;\nb) d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la victime, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les droits, chances ou avantages dont l\u2019acte l\u2019a priv\u00e9e;\nc) d\u2019indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte;\nd) d\u2019indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des frais suppl\u00e9mentaires occasionn\u00e9s par le recours \u00e0 d\u2019autres biens, services, installations ou moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement, et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte;\ne) d\u2019indemniser jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ la victime qui a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral.\n53 (3) Outre les pouvoirs que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe (2), le membre instructeur peut ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019auteur d\u2019un acte discriminatoire de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $, s\u2019il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9.\n53 (4) Sous r\u00e9serve des r\u00e8gles vis\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 48.9, le membre instructeur peut accorder des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 au taux et pour la p\u00e9riode qu\u2019il estime justifi\u00e9s.\nIII. Contexte factuel\n[10] Dans un souci de concision et d\u2019une bonne compr\u00e9hension du dossier, le Tribunal en r\u00e9sume les aspects g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et ce, en se basant sur la documentation soumise par les parties ainsi que sur les diff\u00e9rents t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Le Tribunal estime qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9tablir ces faits afin de saisir l\u2019essence du dossier et de l\u2019industrie du camionnage.\nA. Horizon International Distributors et le domaine du camionnage\n[11] Horizon est une compagnie manitobaine de camionnage fond\u00e9e en 1988 par M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 dont le si\u00e8ge social est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Winnipeg (Manitoba). Les activit\u00e9s de la compagnie s\u2019\u00e9tendent \u00e0 travers tout le territoire canadien et se concentrent davantage dans le transport de denr\u00e9es p\u00e9rissables et des aliments r\u00e9frig\u00e9r\u00e9s. Aux dates d\u2019audition, les op\u00e9rations de la compagnie sont administr\u00e9es par un peu plus d\u2019une dizaine d\u2019employ\u00e9s. Elle d\u00e9tient \u00e9galement une flotte d\u2019environ 32 camions et un entrep\u00f4t dans la r\u00e9gion de Montr\u00e9al (Qu\u00e9bec). Horizon engage deux types d\u2019op\u00e9rateurs de camion afin de livrer ses frets : (1) des op\u00e9rateurs de camion, employ\u00e9s, conduisant les camions appartenant \u00e0 la compagnie (\u00ab employ\u00e9s-op\u00e9rateurs \u00bb de camion) et (2) des op\u00e9rateurs de camion, employ\u00e9s contractuels, qui sont propri\u00e9taires de leur propre poids lourd (\u00ab propri\u00e9taire-op\u00e9rateur \u00bb de camion). Fait important, \u00e0 la date de la plainte, Mme Temple \u00e9tait la seule femme propri\u00e9taire-op\u00e9ratrice de camion chez Horizon.\n[12] Les propri\u00e9taires-op\u00e9rateurs sont pay\u00e9s au kilom\u00e9trage effectu\u00e9 : plus ils effectuent de kilom\u00e8tres, plus la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration est grande. De plus, il gagne un montant fixe minimal pour chaque livraison effectu\u00e9e. Les camions d\u00e9tenus par la compagnie sont administr\u00e9s et entretenus par la compagnie elle-m\u00eame tandis que les propri\u00e9taires-op\u00e9rateurs sont responsables de leur propre poids lourd et des d\u00e9penses qui y sont li\u00e9es. Horizon est le type de compagnie de camionnage qui ne fournit pas d\u2019horaire sp\u00e9cifique de ramassage de frets. Elle ne garantit \u00e9galement pas une zone ou un trajet particulier aux op\u00e9rateurs de camions. Cependant, les conducteurs de camion lui fournissent leurs disponibilit\u00e9s et leurs pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de zones ou trajets et la compagnie r\u00e9partit les livraisons aux op\u00e9rateurs disponibles. Horizon tente d\u2019accommoder les camionneurs selon leurs pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences, si possible. Il faut pr\u00e9ciser que les chargements des op\u00e9rateurs de camion ne vont pas n\u00e9cessairement tous chez le m\u00eame client. Ainsi, un op\u00e9rateur peut retrouver, dans sa remorque, plusieurs frets \u00e0 livrer et ce, chez diff\u00e9rents clients.\n[13] Horizon permet aux propri\u00e9taires-op\u00e9rateurs de facturer leurs d\u00e9penses notamment les r\u00e9parations, essence, assurances, licences et autres, sur ses comptes. Elle peut \u00e9galement avancer aux propri\u00e9taires-op\u00e9rateurs une somme au milieu du mois afin de leur permettre de subvenir \u00e0 leurs besoins courants. Finalement, la compagnie \u00e9met un relev\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin du mois comptabilisant les revenus et les d\u00e9penses des propri\u00e9taires-op\u00e9rateurs. Leur revenu peut \u00eatre r\u00e9sum\u00e9 comme suit : la somme attribu\u00e9e pour le kilom\u00e9trage effectu\u00e9 et les livraisons, moins les frais d\u2019essence, moins les avances, moins les r\u00e9parations et les frais d\u2019entretien, moins les assurances, licences et les autres d\u00e9penses.\n[14] Sans entrer dans tous les d\u00e9tails du fonctionnement de la compagnie, lorsque des marchandises doivent \u00eatre livr\u00e9es chez des clients, c\u2019est un r\u00e9partiteur qui s\u2019occupe d\u2019organiser la logistique autour de ces livraisons. Sans limiter les t\u00e2ches du r\u00e9partiteur, nous pouvons comprendre qu\u2019il attribue, entre autres, les frets aux op\u00e9rateurs de camion, organise les horaires de livraison avec les clients, travaille en \u00e9troite collaboration avec les op\u00e9rateurs de camion, pr\u00e9voit des solutions de rechanges en cas de probl\u00e8mes, contacte les clients si n\u00e9cessaire, etc. Le r\u00e9partiteur est le lien entre la compagnie, les clients et les op\u00e9rateurs de camion. Chez Horizon, les r\u00e9partiteurs se divisent les t\u00e2ches en deux sections : l\u2019Est et l\u2019Ouest du Canada. Un r\u00e9partiteur est attitr\u00e9 pour chaque section.\n[15] Les op\u00e9rateurs de camion, quant \u00e0 eux, doivent livrer la marchandise telle que pr\u00e9vu. Ils doivent \u00e9videmment suivre les horaires de livraison. Certains clients sont moins flexibles quant aux horaires et il faut parfois modifier et planifier de nouveau les livraisons. Ceci n\u2019est pas peu rare. Les op\u00e9rateurs de camion doivent \u00e9galement respecter des r\u00e9glementations strictes en mati\u00e8re de transport et sont soumis \u00e0 des exigences particuli\u00e8res notamment quant aux heures de service. Encore une fois, sans entrer dans tous les d\u00e9tails de la r\u00e9glementation en mati\u00e8re de transport de poids lourd, le Tribunal retient que les op\u00e9rateurs de camion doivent se soumettre \u00e0 l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des cycles pr\u00e9vus : un cycle de 7 jours ou un cycle de 14 jours. Pour chaque cycle, des restrictions sp\u00e9cifiques s\u2019appliquent. Par exemple, dans le cycle de 7 jours, l\u2019op\u00e9rateur de camion ne peut conduire plus de 70 heures. \u00c0 la suite de cette p\u00e9riode de 70 heures, un cong\u00e9 de 36 heures est obligatoire. Le Tribunal comprend \u00e9galement que les op\u00e9rateurs de camion, sur une p\u00e9riode de 24 heures, ne peuvent conduire plus de 13 heures par jour. Ils ont droit \u00e0 2 heures de pause et 1 heure de service pour notamment inspecter le camion et faire le plein d\u2019essence, \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion de conduire. Finalement, ils ont l\u2019obligation de prendre 8 heures de repos cons\u00e9cutives. Le Tribunal comprend \u00e9galement que les op\u00e9rateurs de camion peuvent permuter d\u2019un cycle \u00e0 l\u2019autre, mais doivent respecter, encore une fois, certaines r\u00e8gles. Le Tribunal n\u2019a certainement pas la pr\u00e9tention de reprendre toutes les exigences r\u00e9glementaires en mati\u00e8re de transport de poids lourd.\n[16] Les op\u00e9rateurs de camion ont \u00e9galement l\u2019obligation de maintenir un carnet de route, commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9 \u00ab log book \u00bb. Le carnet de route permet \u00e0 l\u2019op\u00e9rateur de camion de tenir un registre de ses activit\u00e9s, pour chaque p\u00e9riode de 24 heures. Cette p\u00e9riode de 24 heures est subdivis\u00e9e en plage de 15 minutes. L\u2019op\u00e9rateur doit donc tenir un registre de ses d\u00e9placements et de son temps de conduite, de la dur\u00e9e de ses repos et pauses et de son temps hors service. Lorsque Mme Temple travaillait pour Horizon, son carnet de bord \u00e9tait manuscrit et non \u00e9lectronique.\nB. Mme Sandra Temple\n[17] Sandra Temple est une op\u00e9ratrice de camion depuis une vingtaine d\u2019ann\u00e9e. Elle demeurait dans la ville de Salmon Arm (Colombie-Britannique), mais demeure actuellement dans les environs de Calgary (Alberta). Se retrouvent \u00e9galement \u00e0 Calgary son fils, Jonathan Temple et sa m\u00e8re, dont elle prend soin. Mme Temple a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour la compagnie \u00e0 l\u2019hiver 2011. Elle rempla\u00e7ait un camionneur malade, Peter Cox, et conduisait donc son camion. Ce remplacement aurait normalement d\u00fb \u00eatre de courte dur\u00e9e, mais se prolongea jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2012. \u00c0 la suite de cette p\u00e9riode, une entente intervient entre la compagnie et Mme Temple afin qu\u2019elle devienne propri\u00e9taire-op\u00e9ratrice de camion pour la compagnie. Elle se joint donc officiellement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quipe avec son propre camion en ao\u00fbt 2012. Horizon mettra fin \u00e0 son contrat de travail le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2014. Mme Temple avait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait effectuer des livraisons dans l\u2019ouest du pays. Elle effectuait donc ses livraisons entre les provinces du Manitoba (point de d\u00e9part et d\u2019arriv\u00e9e) et de la Colombie-Britannique.\nC. L\u2019accident du 14 octobre 2014 et la suite des \u00e9v\u00e9nements\n[18] Le 14 octobre 2014, un autre camion entre en collision avec celui de Mme Temple alors qu\u2019elle effectuait le plein de gaz \u00e0 Kelowna (Colombie-Britannique). Mme Temple s\u2019est bless\u00e9e \u00e0 la main, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 son pouce. Cependant, il n\u2019y a pas eu n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de contacter les premiers soins ou les policiers et l\u2019accident a \u00e9t\u00e9 capt\u00e9 par les cam\u00e9ras de la station d\u2019essence. Le camion et sa remorque ont \u00e9t\u00e9 endommag\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re importante, mais le chargement n\u2019est pas touch\u00e9. Mme Temple effectue ses livraisons comme pr\u00e9vu.\n[19] Sans entrer dans les d\u00e9tails et puisque les \u00e9v\u00e9nements seront pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s subs\u00e9quemment, ce genre d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement impliquant un camionneur donne ouverture \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer deux types de r\u00e9clamation parall\u00e8lement : (1) une r\u00e9clamation \u00e0 la WorkSafeBC (WBC) pour perte de salaire et (2), une r\u00e9clamation \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019assurance publique du Manitoba (MPI) pour les dommages sur le v\u00e9hicule. Dans le cas de Mme Temple, les deux r\u00e9clamations sont effectu\u00e9es puisque le poids lourds a \u00e9t\u00e9 endommag\u00e9 et elle a d\u00fb arr\u00eater de travailler pendant une p\u00e9riode donn\u00e9e. Le Tribunal comprend que la r\u00e9clamation de Mme Temple pour la WBC n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9e qu\u2019en d\u00e9cembre 2014. Cette question sera abord\u00e9e ult\u00e9rieurement. Ce faisant, Mme Temple n\u2019aura ses versements de la WBC qu\u2019en mars 2015 et ce, r\u00e9troactivement au moment de son accident et de son arr\u00eat de travail. Quant \u00e0 la MPI, la r\u00e9clamation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite et le d\u00e9ductible n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9 qu\u2019en juillet 2016.\n[20] La plaignante cesse de travailler entre le 14 octobre 2014, date de son accident, et le d\u00e9but du mois de d\u00e9cembre 2014. Le camion est endommag\u00e9 et doit \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9. Certaines communications ont lieu entre Mme Temple et la compagnie notamment sur la r\u00e9clamation \u00e0 la MPI. Au d\u00e9but d\u00e9cembre 2014, des discussions sont entam\u00e9es pour un \u00e9ventuel retour au travail. Le camion est pr\u00eat \u00e0 reprendre la route et Mme Temple, qui est toujours en Colombie-Britannique, revient \u00e0 Winnipeg pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer des chargements. Elle effectue ses livraisons telles que pr\u00e9vu. Rappelons que la plaignante n\u2019a pas travaill\u00e9 depuis pr\u00e8s de deux mois. Horizon r\u00e9ussit donc \u00e0 lui trouver des chargements tout juste avant le temps des f\u00eates, p\u00e9riode tranquille de l\u2019ann\u00e9e dans l\u2019industrie du camionnage. Mme Temple prend donc la route jusqu\u2019en Colombie-Britannique et doit revenir \u00e0 Winnipeg pour le dimanche, 14 d\u00e9cembre 2014. Le m\u00eame jour, elle informe la compagnie qu\u2019elle a un rendez-vous \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital de Chilliwack (Colombie-Britannique) pour un CT scan le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2014. Le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2014, Horizon informe la plaignante qu\u2019elle a un chargement \u00e0 prendre le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2014, \u00e0 Richmond (Colombie-Britannique). Mme Temple lui rappelle qu\u2019elle \u00e0 un CT scan le m\u00eame jour, entre midi et 18h00, et doit aussi faire v\u00e9rifier son camion pour un voyant lumineux indiquant un probl\u00e8me avec le moteur. Le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2014, Mme Temple ne peut prendre le chargement tel que demand\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e puisqu\u2019elle doit se rendre \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital pour son rendez-vous et les probl\u00e8mes avec son camion sont plus importants qu\u2019envisag\u00e9s : le camion ne peut prendre la route sans r\u00e9parations. Horizon tente de trouver une alternative, mais \u00e0 ce moment de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, trouver un camion est difficile. La compagnie n\u2019est pas en mesure de remplir son engagement envers le client. Le jour m\u00eame, Horizon met fin au contrat de travail de Mme Temple.\nIV. Le cadre juridique applicable \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire\n[21] Je rappelle que l\u2019objet de la Loi est pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 son article 2 et permet, \u00e0 tous les individus, de jouir du droit, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesure visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins et ce, ind\u00e9pendamment des quelconques consid\u00e9rations et motifs de distinction prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Loi.\n[22] Rappelons tout d\u2019abord que dans l\u2019adjudication des plaintes en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne, la plaignante a le fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir un cas prima facie de discrimination. Comme d\u00e9crit dans la d\u00e9cision Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears, 1985, CanLII 18 (SCC) au paragraphe 28, une preuve prima facie est \u00ab [\u2026] celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 \u00bb.\n[23] Dans le cas particulier de Mme Temple, elle doit donc d\u00e9montrer, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 de la Loi :\n(1) Qu\u2019elle a ou avait un ou des motifs de distinction illicite prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Loi (sexe et d\u00e9ficience, en l\u2019occurrence);\n(2) Qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d\u2019emploi ou que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a refus\u00e9 de continuer de l\u2019employer;\n(3) Qu\u2019il existe un lien entre les motifs de distinction illicite et le traitement d\u00e9favorable en cours d\u2019emploi ou le refus de continuer d\u2019\u00eatre employ\u00e9e.\n[24] Comme il l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment confirm\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse c. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier A\u00e9ronautique Centre de formation), 2015 CSC 39 (Bombardier), la preuve prima facie est soumise au fardeau de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Cons\u00e9quemment, la plaignante doit d\u00e9montrer, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, de l\u2019existence de ces trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments constitutifs d\u2019un acte discriminatoire. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9montrer que le motif de distinction illicite prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par la Loi est le seul et unique facteur ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019acte discriminatoire : le motif ne peut \u00eatre qu\u2019un des multiples facteurs (voir Bombardier, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paragraphes 44 \u00e0 52). Inversement, si le motif de distinction n\u2019a pas influenc\u00e9 les agissements de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la plainte doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[25] De plus, il est important de rappeler que la discrimination n\u2019est habituellement pas exerc\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re directe, ouverte ou intentionnelle. Comme \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Basi c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 1988 CanLII 108 (TCDP) (Basi), une preuve directe de discrimination n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de m\u00eame qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9montrer une intention de discriminer (Voir \u00e9galement Bombardier, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paragraphes 40 et 41). Le Tribunal doit donc analyser les circonstances de l\u2019affaire afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe de subtiles odeurs de discrimination. Dans le cas de preuve circonstancielle, la discrimination peut \u00eatre inf\u00e9r\u00e9e lorsque la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au soutien des all\u00e9gations de discrimination rend une telle inf\u00e9rence plus probable que les autres inf\u00e9rences ou hypoth\u00e8ses possible (voir Basi, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9. Voir \u00e9galement Chopra c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du bien-\u00eatre social), 2001 CanLII 8492 (TCDP)).\n[26] Si la plaignante s\u2019acquitte de son fardeau de preuve, il appartient \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de pr\u00e9senter ses propres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve afin de r\u00e9futer les all\u00e9gations de discrimination de la plaignante. L\u2019intim\u00e9e peut, s\u2019il y a un cas prima facie de discrimination, faire la preuve que la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e discrimination ne s\u2019est pas d\u00e9roul\u00e9e de la mani\u00e8re all\u00e9gu\u00e9e par la plaignante ou qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de la Loi (voir Maillet c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 TCDP 48, au paragraphe 4). L\u2019intim\u00e9e peut, au surplus, invoquer un moyen de d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vu par la Loi notamment pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 15 de la Loi. Enfin, la plaignante aura le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer que les justifications de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne sont que purs pr\u00e9textes et que les agissements sont effectivement empreints de discrimination (voir notamment arr\u00eats Basi, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, et Israeli c. Canada (Commission canadien des droits de la personne), 1983 CanLII 6 (TCDP)).\n[27] Dans le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Horizon n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 d\u2019exception pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 15 de la Loi afin de justifier les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s actes discriminatoires. Par contre, elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses propres \u00e9l\u00e9ments afin de r\u00e9futer les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante quant \u00e0 l\u2019existence m\u00eame d\u2019actes discriminatoires. Ceci \u00e9tant dit et, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019avoir invoqu\u00e9 un moyen de d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vu par la Loi, le Tribunal se concentrera uniquement sur l\u2019analyse de la preuve testimoniale et documentaire soumise par les parties afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a, ou non, un cas prima facie de discrimination.\nV. Remarques pr\u00e9liminaires\nA. T\u00e9moin David Yach\n[28] Le Tribunal se retrouve dans une situation particuli\u00e8re quant au t\u00e9moignage de cet individu. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, M. Yach aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 par Mme Temple afin d\u2019effectuer de fausses d\u00e9clarations \u00e0 la Commission. Horizon a donc appel\u00e9 M. Yach comme t\u00e9moin afin qu\u2019il vienne expliquer la situation au Tribunal. Mme Temple nie cat\u00e9goriquement ces all\u00e9gations.\n[29] J\u2019aimerais d\u2019abord mentionner que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Yach soul\u00e8ve beaucoup de questions. M. Yach, sous serment, avoue avoir menti et fait de fausses d\u00e9clarations aux enqu\u00eateurs de la Commission. Lorsque le Tribunal \u00e9value son t\u00e9moignage, M. Yach r\u00e9pond succinctement aux questions d\u2019ordre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et ce, m\u00eame en interrogatoire principal. Cependant, lorsque Me Welsh aborde la question des fausses d\u00e9clarations, le t\u00e9moin devient rapidement h\u00e9sitant dans ses r\u00e9ponses et balbutie. M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Yach travaillait pour la compagnie par le pass\u00e9. M. Yach aurait factur\u00e9 des accessoires sophistiqu\u00e9s pour son camion sur les comptes de la compagnie. Le Tribunal comprend que cette pratique n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9e. De plus, le camion de M. Yach \u00e9tait en d\u00e9ficit. Ainsi, une entente est survenue entre Horizon et lui : la compagnie devait r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer son camion afin de couvrir les frais engag\u00e9s. Cependant, il a retir\u00e9 les accessoires sophistiqu\u00e9s avant la remise du camion \u00e0 la compagnie et ce, en contravention de son engagement. Horizon a donc r\u00e9sili\u00e9 son contrat de travail et la relation se termine en mauvais termes.\n[30] Ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements sont survenus il y a de cela plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Malgr\u00e9 tout, le Tribunal se questionne sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Yach. De plus, aucune preuve corroborant le t\u00e9moignage de M. Yach n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audition : il s\u2019agit de sa parole contre celle de Mme Temple qui nie formellement les all\u00e9gations. J\u2019estime \u00e9galement que bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9e tente d\u2019attaquer la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de Mme Temple, cette derni\u00e8re a appuy\u00e9 plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments de son t\u00e9moignage avec de la documentation, des \u00e9changes courriel et des discussions via messagerie texte. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas de raisons de remettre en question la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de Mme Temple \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape-ci. Je me permets \u00e9galement de mentionner qu\u2019outre la question de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, le t\u00e9moignage de M. Yach n\u2019\u00e9tait pas utile et n\u00e9cessaire pour rendre une d\u00e9cision.\n[31] Apr\u00e8s avoir pris ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments en consid\u00e9ration, le Tribunal a donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas tenir compte du t\u00e9moignage de M. Yach.\nB. Objection prise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e\n[32] Au dernier jour de l\u2019audition, Mme Temple a demand\u00e9 la permission au Tribunal afin de d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un document \u00e9manant d\u2019une personne pr\u00e9nomm\u00e9e Avi, travaillant chez Rigmaster Truck & Trailer Repairs Inc. Ce document n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inclus dans les documents transmis \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e ni au Tribunal. Selon Mme Temple, il s\u2019agit d\u2019un autre exemple o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9e de prendre la route alors que son camion \u00e9tait en r\u00e9paration. Elle affirme que le document aurait d\u00fb faire partie de ses documents devant \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au Tribunal. Mme Temple n\u2019est pas \u00e0 l\u2019aise avec la technologie plus particuli\u00e8rement avec les ordinateurs. Elle a donc eu besoin d\u2019assistance tout au long du processus quasi judiciaire notamment dans le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa documentation et de la cr\u00e9ation de ses cartables. Rappelons \u00e9galement que la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et n\u2019a pas pu b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat.\n[33] Me Welsh, quant \u00e0 elle, s\u2019est fortement object\u00e9e au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ce document. D\u2019une part, elle a mentionn\u00e9 au Tribunal que la proc\u00e9dure sur les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts des pi\u00e8ces a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 de maintes reprises \u00e0 la plaignante. Selon elle, les instructions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 claires tout au long du processus. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que le document n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 authentifi\u00e9, qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 dat\u00e9 et que le nom de famille de l\u2019auteur est absent. Finalement, elle a affirm\u00e9 que le pr\u00e9judice d\u2019admettre un tel document \u00e0 ce stade \u00e9tait \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e et que cela ne serait pas \u00e9quitable d\u2019admettre son contenu sans avoir eu l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de faire une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re sur le sujet.\n[34] Comme la demande de Mme Temple a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite le dernier jour de l\u2019audition, tout juste avant les arguments, que la preuve \u00e9tait close et que tous les t\u00e9moins avaient rendu t\u00e9moignage, j\u2019ai donc demand\u00e9 aux parties si elles consentaient \u00e0 ce que je puisse prendre connaissance du document afin de trancher l\u2019objection. Les parties ont acquiesc\u00e9 \u00e0 cette demande. Le Tribunal a pris en note les repr\u00e9sentations des parties et a pris sa d\u00e9cision en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[35] Les r\u00e8gles et l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de la preuve devant le Tribunal sont moins formalistes que celles pr\u00e9vues devant un tribunal judiciaire. Le Tribunal peut donc recevoir des d\u00e9clarations \u00e9crites par tout autre moyen qu\u2019il estime indiqu\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 50(3)(c) de la Loi. La proc\u00e9dure afin de d\u00e9poser des documents au Tribunal est pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 la R\u00e8gle 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (R\u00e8gles). Tel que le pr\u00e9voit la R\u00e8gle 9, \u00e0 la demande d\u2019une partie, le membre instructeur peut autoriser le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de certains documents qui ne respecte pas la proc\u00e9dure de d\u00e9p\u00f4t pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 la R\u00e8gle 6. Cependant, cette autorisation doit respecter les fins qui sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 1(1) des R\u00e8gles et plus particuli\u00e8rement le droit d\u2019\u00eatre entendu pleinement et enti\u00e8rement.\n[36] Le Tribunal a une large discr\u00e9tion dans l\u2019admission de la preuve conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 50(3)(c) de la LCDP. Le ou\u00ef-dire peut \u00eatre admis et l\u2019authentification de documents n\u2019est pas toujours n\u00e9cessaire. Cependant, le Tribunal est \u00e9galement guid\u00e9 par les principes de justice naturelle et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9. Je suis sensible aux arguments de la plaignante. N\u00e9anmoins, je consid\u00e8re que l\u2019admission d\u2019un tel document est hautement pr\u00e9judiciable pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e et compte tenu de son d\u00e9p\u00f4t tr\u00e8s tardif, aucun moyen ne pouvait \u00eatre pris afin d\u2019att\u00e9nuer ce pr\u00e9judice.\n[37] Cons\u00e9quemment, je rejette la demande de la plaignante quant au d\u00e9p\u00f4t du document. Nonobstant cette d\u00e9cision, je tiens \u00e0 souligner que m\u00eame si ce document avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au Tribunal, son contenu n\u2019aurait pas eu d\u2019impact majeur sur ma d\u00e9cision.\nVI. Analyse et position des parties\nA. Motifs de distinction illicite\n[38] Comme mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, les motifs de distinction illicite invoqu\u00e9s par Mme Temple sont le sexe et la d\u00e9ficience. Ces deux motifs n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9s par les parties.\n[39] La d\u00e9finition de \u00ab d\u00e9ficience \u00bb se retrouve \u00e0 l\u2019article 25 de la Loi qui d\u00e9finit \u00ab d\u00e9ficience physique ou mentale, qu\u2019elle soit pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e [\u2026] \u00bb. Cette d\u00e9finition a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e et approfondie par le Tribunal dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Audet c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2005 TCDP 25, au paragraphe 39. Essentiellement, cet arr\u00eat reprend l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la notion de d\u00e9ficience dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Desormeaux c. La Corporation de la Ville d'Ottawa, 2005 CAF 3 (CanLII), 2005 CAF3 11, au paragraphe 15, qui d\u00e9finit la d\u00e9ficience comme \u00ab [\u2026] tout handicap physique ou mental qui occasionne une limitation fonctionnelle ou qui est associ\u00e9 \u00e0 la perception d'un handicap \u00bb.\n[40] Il est clair pour le Tribunal que la blessure de Mme Temple s\u2019inscrit dans cette interpr\u00e9tation de la d\u00e9ficience.\nB. Traitement d\u00e9favorable et refus de continuer d\u2019employer\n[41] Mme Temple a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal plusieurs \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui, selon elle, sont la manifestation d\u2019actes discriminatoires de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Dans son expos\u00e9 des faits, Mme Temple avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait un exercice de concision et a cat\u00e9goris\u00e9 ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements en diff\u00e9rentes cat\u00e9gories. Me Welsh, pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e, avait \u00e9galement effectu\u00e9 le m\u00eame travail. Ainsi, je repasserai en revue ces diff\u00e9rentes cat\u00e9gories et \u00e9l\u00e9ments afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a un cas prima facie de discrimination. J\u2019aborderai, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, la question du lien entre le motif de distinction illicite et l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable dans la section subs\u00e9quente.\n(i) P\u00e9ages\n[42] Tout d\u2019abord, Mme Temple all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d\u2019emploi quant aux frais de p\u00e9age du pont Port Mann (Colombie-Britannique). Elle soutient que les op\u00e9rateurs de camion de sexe masculin ne se font pas facturer les frais de p\u00e9age alors qu\u2019Horizon lui d\u00e9duit ces dits montants de ses revenus. Elle se compare notamment \u00e0 deux op\u00e9rateurs de camion, M. Yves Carriere et M. Pat Nicholas. L\u2019intim\u00e9e, quant \u00e0 elle, affirme que M. Carriere n\u2019emprunte pas ce pont et donc, n\u2019engage pas de frais et que M. Nicholas est un employ\u00e9-op\u00e9rateur de la compagnie et ce faisant, les frais et d\u00e9penses sont assum\u00e9es par la compagnie. De plus, elle soutient que la plaignante s\u2019est vue rembours\u00e9e lesdites sommes. Finalement, elle pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elle a commis une erreur administrative dans la gestion des frais de p\u00e9age, erreur qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 corrig\u00e9e par la suite.\n[43] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le pont Port Mann, dans la r\u00e9gion de Vancouver (Colombie-Britannique) est muni d\u2019un p\u00e9age. Le syst\u00e8me \u00e9lectronique nomm\u00e9 TReO enregistre les informations des v\u00e9hicules empruntant le pont et les conducteurs doivent ensuite acquitter les frais de p\u00e9age. Dans le cas de Mme Temple, les frais sont factur\u00e9s au compte de la compagnie. Entre le 22 d\u00e9cembre 2012 et le 9 octobre 2013, la plaignante encoure des frais de p\u00e9age de 523.90$. Ainsi, la compagnie lui facture le 31 octobre 2013 une portion de la somme soit 300.00$. Elle lui facture \u00e9galement des sommes de 69.80$ et 36.30$ sur son relev\u00e9 du 30 novembre 2013, pour de nouveaux frais de p\u00e9age. Le grand total des frais factur\u00e9s s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 406.00$.\n[44] Mme Temple a discut\u00e9 avec M. Carriere et M. Nicholas afin de v\u00e9rifier s\u2019ils se faisaient \u00e9galement d\u00e9biter leurs frais de p\u00e9age, ce \u00e0 quoi ils r\u00e9pondent par la n\u00e9gative. Cons\u00e9quemment, elle demande une clarification \u00e0 M. Luc Dub\u00e9 des raisons pour lesquelles elle se voit facturer ces sommes. M. Luc Dub\u00e9 doit discuter de la situation avec le pr\u00e9sident d\u2019Horizon, M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9, qui est \u00e0 ce moment hors de la province. Quelques semaines s\u2019\u00e9coulent et la compagnie rembourse finalement la somme de 406.00$ \u00e0 la plaignante, le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2014. M. Luc Dub\u00e9 a indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal que les frais de p\u00e9age TReO de la Colombie-Britannique \u00e9taient une situation relativement nouvelle pour Horizon. M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9, quant \u00e0 lui, ne se souvient pas d\u2019avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7u ce type de frais de cette province auparavant. Ce dernier a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 que les d\u00e9penses encourues par les propri\u00e9taires-op\u00e9rateurs sont habituellement \u00e0 leur frais incluant les p\u00e9ages. Le Tribunal constate que c\u2019est effectivement ce que pr\u00e9voit le contrat de travail. M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 a tout de m\u00eame d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de payer les frais et de les assumer \u00e0 l\u2019avenir. La preuve \u00e9tablit qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une d\u00e9cision d\u2019affaires de la compagnie.\n[45] De plus, M. Carriere, qui effectue les m\u00eames trajets que la plaignante entre le Manitoba et la Colombie-Britannique, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne prend que rarement ce pont. Il utilise plut\u00f4t un itin\u00e9raire alternatif, sans p\u00e9age et sans frais. Quant \u00e0 M. Nicholas, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il est un employ\u00e9-op\u00e9rateur de camion pour Horizon. Cons\u00e9quemment, il n\u2019assume pas ce type de frais. M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 a \u00e9galement inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que si l\u2019un de ses employ\u00e9s-op\u00e9rateurs engageait un frais de p\u00e9age, la compagnie assumerait cette somme tel que pr\u00e9vu.\n[46] Mme Temple a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019Horizon a tenu mordicus au fait qu\u2019aucun autre op\u00e9rateur de camion n\u2019emprunte le pont Port Mann et donc, n\u2019engage pas ce type de frais. Elle s\u2019est donc r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019historique de frais TReO de la compagnie qui, effectivement, montre clairement qu\u2019un autre conducteur a emprunt\u00e9 ce pont entre janvier et mars 2013. Cela s\u2019inscrit dans la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode dans laquelle elle a accumul\u00e9 une somme de 523.90$ en frais de p\u00e9age. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019une erreur administrative est survenue dans la gestion des frais de p\u00e9age. M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 a avou\u00e9 avoir pris pour acquis que les frais de p\u00e9age avaient tous \u00e9t\u00e9 encourues par la plaignante, sans r\u00e9ellement porter attention aux num\u00e9ros de plaque associ\u00e9s au frais. Ainsi, Mme Temple s\u2019est fait d\u00e9biter un montant de 69.80$ alors que la somme n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 encoure par elle. La somme, en plus des autres montants d\u00e9bit\u00e9s, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9s et aucun autre frais de p\u00e9age ne lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 factur\u00e9s dans le futur. Le fait que le remboursement de 406.00$ a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait quatre mois plus tard et que l\u2019autre op\u00e9rateur ne s\u2019est pas vu d\u00e9biter les frais, en raison de l\u2019erreur, ne constitue pas en soi un traitement d\u00e9favorable.\n[47] Donc, quant au p\u00e9age de la Colombie-Britannique, je conclus que la preuve n\u2019est pas pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante et que la plaignante n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e par la compagnie.\n(ii) Travailler plus fort que les op\u00e9rateurs de sexe masculin\n[48] Mme Temple all\u00e8gue qu\u2019elle a d\u00fb travailler plus fort que ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin afin de gagner les m\u00eames revenus. Horizon a respectueusement plaid\u00e9 au Tribunal qu\u2019aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en ce sens. Apr\u00e8s avoir consult\u00e9 la preuve, je conclus effectivement que la plaignante n\u2019a pas rempli son fardeau. Je rappelle, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9 dans le contexte factuel, comment les revenus des propri\u00e9taires-op\u00e9rateurs de camions sont ventil\u00e9s. Plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments interviennent dans ce calcul notamment le nombre de chargements et livraisons effectu\u00e9s, la distance parcourue, les montants des r\u00e9parations et des entretiens, l\u2019essence et son prix, les assurances, licences, etc. Je rappelle \u00e9galement que la compagnie ne peut garantir de trajet, ni de chargements et de livraisons. D\u2019autres aspects devraient \u00e9galement \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration notamment l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 ou m\u00eame les opportunit\u00e9s d\u2019affaires. Sans une preuve pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante \u00e0 cet effet et d\u00e9montrant clairement qu\u2019il est plus probable que Mme Temple devait travailler plus fort pour gagner les m\u00eames revenus que les autres op\u00e9rateurs de sexe masculin, je ne peux tirer une telle conclusion.\n[49] Je consid\u00e8re donc que la plaignante n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d\u2019emploi par la compagnie quant \u00e0 cet aspect.\n(iii) Forc\u00e9e de livrer et prendre la route\n[50] Mme Temple all\u00e8gue que contrairement aux autres op\u00e9rateurs de camion de sexe masculin, la compagnie l\u2019a forc\u00e9e \u00e0 livrer des marchandises alors qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de le faire. Encore une fois, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a tent\u00e9 de r\u00e9futer ces all\u00e9gations. Certains t\u00e9moins ont expliqu\u00e9 au Tribunal leur compr\u00e9hension de l\u2019expression \u00ab forcer \u00e0 livrer \u00bb, dans leurs propres mots. G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, ils s\u2019entendent tous pour dire que \u00ab forcer \u00e0 livrer \u00bb de la marchandise r\u00e9f\u00e8re au fait que la compagnie forcerait un op\u00e9rateur de camion \u00e0 prendre la route alors qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de conduire ou que la compagnie met l\u2019op\u00e9rateur dans une situation o\u00f9 ce dernier sent qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas d\u2019autre choix que de prendre la route. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de conduire, elle peut se manifester de diff\u00e9rente fa\u00e7on par exemple lorsque l\u2019op\u00e9rateur est dans sa p\u00e9riode obligatoire de repos ou de cong\u00e9s ou qu\u2019il est trop fatigu\u00e9 pour conduire. Mme Temple a tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer au Tribunal plusieurs situations o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9e \u00e0 livrer de la marchandise par Horizon. Dans un souci de concision, je ne repasserai pas en revue toutes ces situations. Elle a, de plus, expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle craignait perdre son emploi si elle refusait de prendre la route alors qu\u2019elle ne pouvait le faire.\n[51] Il est clair pour moi que la plaignante acceptait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de prendre la route lorsque la compagnie le lui demandait et ce, m\u00eame si elle \u00e9tait dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de le faire. Mme Temple a effectivement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises sur le sujet et reprend souvent la m\u00eame expression. Dans ses mots, elle ne voulait pas \u00ab cr\u00e9er de vagues \u00bb et prenait la route comme demand\u00e9. M. Luc Dub\u00e9 a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 dans ce sens, en qualifiant la plaignante de personne non contestatrice. Le coll\u00e8gue de la plaignante, M. Carriere, dont le t\u00e9moignage est tout \u00e0 fait cr\u00e9dible, a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 au Tribunal qu\u2019il avait du mal \u00e0 comprendre pourquoi elle acceptait tous les chargements qu\u2019Horizon lui donnait. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 refus\u00e9 des chargements de la compagnie et que le pr\u00e9sident, Gilbert Dub\u00e9, l\u2019a aussi d\u00e9j\u00e0 contact\u00e9 puisqu\u2019il avait refus\u00e9 un chargement. Lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019est fait poser la question quant \u00e0 savoir s\u2019il s\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait menacer de cong\u00e9diement par Horizon s\u2019il n\u2019acceptait pas un chargement ou de prendre la route, M. Carriere r\u00e9pond clairement par la n\u00e9gative. Enfin, M. Carriere a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 du fait qu\u2019il aurait refus\u00e9 plusieurs chargements que Mme Temple, quant \u00e0 elle, acceptait.\n[52] Ceci \u00e9tant dit, deux situations attirent l\u2019attention du Tribunal quant au fait d\u2019\u00eatre forc\u00e9 \u00e0 livrer ou de se sentir contraint de prendre la route. La premi\u00e8re est celle des 21 et 22 juillet 2014. Mme Temple, qui est en Colombie-Britannique, informe son superviseur M. Luc Dub\u00e9, le dimanche 21 juillet 2014, qu\u2019elle a un probl\u00e8me m\u00e9canique avec son camion. D\u2019ores et d\u00e9j\u00e0, elle lui indique qu\u2019elle prendra sa p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9 obligatoire de 36 heures le mardi, 23 juillet 2014, et donc r\u00e9initialisera ses heures d\u2019op\u00e9ration. Le lundi 22 juillet 2014, M. Luc Dub\u00e9 l\u2019informe qu\u2019elle doit prendre la route et r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer trois chargements dont certains chargements pr\u00e9vus pour mercredi le 24 juillet 2014. La plaignante informe M. Luc Dub\u00e9 que cela ne lui permet pas de faire sa r\u00e9initialisation de 36 heures. Elle accepte malgr\u00e9 tout le chargement, mais cela l\u2019oblige \u00e0 transf\u00e9rer du cycle de 70 heures pour celui de 120 heures. L\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que Mme Temple \u00e9tait l\u00e9gale dans ses heures et pouvait transf\u00e9rer de cycle. Je consid\u00e8re que la preuve n\u2019est pas aussi claire que ce que pr\u00e9tend Me Welsh. Il est clair que la plaignante a inform\u00e9 son superviseur par messagerie texte qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale dans ses heures et qu\u2019elle pourrait tenter de s\u2019organiser afin de prendre le chargement tel que demand\u00e9. Rien dans la preuve ne me permet de remettre en question les paroles de la plaignante dans cette situation. Ceci \u00e9tant dit, le chargement est maintenu tant par Mme Temple que la compagnie.\n[53] L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir \u00e0 plusieurs reprises que l\u2019obligation de s\u2019assurer d\u2019\u00eatre l\u00e9gal dans les heures de conduite repose sur les \u00e9paules des op\u00e9rateurs de camion. Le Tribunal comprend cette id\u00e9e qu\u2019un op\u00e9rateur ne devrait pas prendre la route s\u2019il est ill\u00e9gal dans ses heures de service. Par contre, le Tribunal a \u00e9galement de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 comprendre comment la compagnie peut attribuer des chargements \u00e0 un op\u00e9rateur alors que ce dernier l\u2019informe qu\u2019il doit tomber en repos ou en cong\u00e9 et manifeste \u00e0 plus d\u2019une reprise qu\u2019il est ill\u00e9gal dans ses heures. La compagnie \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 au courant, le jour pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, que Mme Temple devait tomber en r\u00e9initialisation de cycle. J\u2019ajoute que Mme Temple a pris le temps d\u2019expliquer \u00e0 son superviseur, M. Luc Dub\u00e9, qu\u2019elle sentait que la compagnie doutait de son travail et de son efficacit\u00e9. Aurait-elle d\u00fb dire non au chargement? Probablement. Avait-elle l\u2019impression de ne pas avoir le choix que de prendre le chargement? Pour plusieurs raisons, il en est fort possible. Lorsque la plaignante explique au Tribunal qu\u2019elle se sentait contrainte de prendre la route, dans les circonstances, cela ne semble pas d\u00e9raisonnable comme propos.\n[54] Dans la m\u00eame veine, l\u2019autre incident survient quelques semaines apr\u00e8s cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement, soit le 26 septembre 2014. Mme Temple doit prendre un chargement \u00e0 Winnipeg et c\u2019est le pr\u00e9sident de la compagnie, M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9, qui doit charger le camion. Une nouvelle livraison doit \u00eatre faite en Alberta, par Mme Temple, sur son trajet vers l\u2019ouest. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la plaignante s\u2019est fait menacer par M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 via messagerie texte d\u2019\u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e si elle ne prenait pas le chargement tel que demand\u00e9. Le Tribunal peut comprendre que pour plusieurs raisons, M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 \u00e9tait irrit\u00e9 par la situation notamment en raison des tensions d\u00e9j\u00e0 existantes entre eux. Ce qui est clair, c\u2019est que Mme Temple a pris le chargement tout en ayant une contrainte de se faire renvoyer si elle en d\u00e9cidait autrement. Dans une vision plus globale de la situation, cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement s\u2019inscrit dans la suite de l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement des 21 et 22 juillet 2014. Mme Temple sentait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait sous la contrainte et devait prendre les chargements sous peine de cons\u00e9quences.\n[55] Le Tribunal comprend qu\u2019Horizon est une petite compagnie familiale et que ses dirigeants ont le souci d\u2019offrir un excellent service \u00e0 ses clients. Cependant, cela ne peut justifier un tel traitement. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a invoqu\u00e9 le fait que Mme Temple ne refusait jamais un chargement. Effectivement, elle a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 quelques reprises qu\u2019elle d\u00e9sirait faire de l\u2019argent et qu\u2019elle ne voulait pas refuser de chargements offerts par la compagnie. Ces arguments ne supplantent pas le fait qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 menac\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e si elle ne prenait pas la route. M\u00eame s\u2019ils existent plusieurs raisons pour lesquelles elle a accept\u00e9 la plupart des chargements offerts, la contrainte demeure l\u2019un des multiples facteurs \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer.\n[56] Horizon a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que Mme Temple n\u2019a jamais fait de plainte \u00e9crite \u00e0 ce sujet. Je trouve que cet argument est sans fondement puisque nulle part dans la preuve il n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 question d\u2019une quelconque obligation de faire une plainte \u00e9crite \u00e0 l\u2019employeur. J\u2019ajouterai qu\u2019il est \u00e9vident que le 22 juillet 2014, Mme Temple a d\u00e9crit \u00e0 son superviseur, M. Luc Dub\u00e9, comment elle se sentait contrainte d\u2019accepter des chargements, qu\u2019elle sentait que la compagnie doutait de son travail et de son efficacit\u00e9. La compagnie est donc bien au fait des sentiments de la plaignante.\n[57] Bien que M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 ait t\u00e9moign\u00e9 sur le fait qu\u2019il surveille tous ses op\u00e9rateurs, de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re, et les supervise au besoin, qu\u2019il peut employer parfois un langage grossier avec eux, rien dans la preuve ne permet de conclure qu\u2019il menace les autres conducteurs de cong\u00e9diement s\u2019ils ne prennent pas de chargements. Au contraire, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que M. Carriere refuse des frets et ne se fait pas menacer de cong\u00e9diement. La crainte de se faire cong\u00e9dier n\u2019est pas plus pr\u00e9sente. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un traitement d\u00e9favorable.\n[58] J\u2019aimerais ajouter qu\u2019il est clair pour moi que la relation entre la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est consid\u00e9rablement d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e avec le temps. Le Tribunal comprend que des frustrations se sont accumul\u00e9es de part et d\u2019autre. De plus, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que Mme Temple demande plus de supervision que certains autres op\u00e9rateurs. N\u00e9anmoins, je r\u00e9it\u00e8re que cela ne justifie pas en soi le fait qu\u2019Horizon l\u2019ait menac\u00e9 de la cong\u00e9dier si elle ne prend pas des frets alors qu\u2019elle ne le fait pas avec les autres op\u00e9rateurs de camion. Il n\u2019est pas suffisant pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019expliquer au Tribunal que la plaignante aurait tout simplement d\u00fb dire \u00ab non \u00bb et refuser les chargements.\n[59] En me basant sur la r\u00e8gle de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve, je conclus la compagnie a trait\u00e9 la plaignante d\u00e9favorablement en cours d\u2019emploi. La question du lien entre le motif de distinction illicite et le traitement d\u00e9favorable sera trait\u00e9e ult\u00e9rieurement.\n(iv) Moins de temps allou\u00e9s\n[60] Mme Temple a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019Horizon lui attribue moins de temps pour effectuer ses trajets que ses coll\u00e8gues op\u00e9rateurs de camion de sexe masculin. L\u2019intim\u00e9e, quant \u00e0 elle, d\u00e9ment ses all\u00e9gations et soutient qu\u2019aucune preuve pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis de l\u2019avant par la plaignante afin d\u2019appuyer ces propos. La seule preuve \u00e0 cet effet est le court t\u00e9moignage de Jonathan Temple ayant affirm\u00e9 que sa m\u00e8re n\u2019avait plus autant de temps pour s\u2019arr\u00eater \u00e0 Calgary dans ses derniers mois de travail. Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment seul ne permet pas de s\u2019acquitter le fardeau de la preuve pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante. Ainsi, la preuve est insuffisante afin de conclure que Mme Temple a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d\u2019emploi par la compagnie quant \u00e0 cet aspect.\n(v) Ajouts de chargements\n[61] La plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e d\u00e9favorablement puisque la compagnie lui donnait de nouveaux chargements et livraisons et ce, pendant qu\u2019elle effectuait son trajet initialement pr\u00e9vu. L\u2019intim\u00e9e confirme qu\u2019Horizon adopte ce genre de pratique dans le but de rendre les voyages efficaces. Elle indique qu\u2019elle ne peut attendre qu\u2019un op\u00e9rateur revienne \u00e0 Winnipeg pour lui donner de nouveaux frets : l\u2019objectif est la rentabilit\u00e9. Mme Temple n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cise quant aux situations sp\u00e9cifiques qu\u2019elle reproche \u00e0 Horizon. Elle a abord\u00e9 ce sujet d\u2019une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale lors de son t\u00e9moignage. Je comprends que l\u2019industrie du camion est constamment en mouvement, que les chargements et livraisons peuvent changer ou s\u2019ajouter rapidement. Le fait que des chargements ou livraisons s\u2019ajoutent \u00e0 ceux d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vus ne constitue pas en soi un acte discriminatoire.\n[62] Il faudrait plut\u00f4t s\u2019attarder aux effets que cr\u00e9ent de tels ajouts pour la plaignante et si cela la d\u00e9favorisait en cours d\u2019emploi. Malheureusement, Mme Temple n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019ajout de chargements en cours de trajet l\u2019avait d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e. Le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que la preuve n\u2019est pas pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante quant \u00e0 cet aspect.\n(vi) Diff\u00e9rence dans les privil\u00e8ges (dettes et location de camion)\n[63] Un autre traitement d\u00e9favorable invoqu\u00e9 par la plaignante est le fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas joui des m\u00eames privil\u00e8ges que les autres op\u00e9rateurs de camions de sexe masculin. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle fait notamment r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la gestion de sa dette financi\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la compagnie, de la location d\u2019un camion de rechange et du financement d\u2019un pr\u00eat personnel. J\u2019aborderai ces trois privil\u00e8ges distinctement.\n[64] D\u2019abord, la compagnie accepte que les propri\u00e9taires-op\u00e9rateurs de camion facturent certaines d\u00e9penses sur les comptes de la compagnie. La compagnie d\u00e9duit ensuite ces sommes des revenus des propri\u00e9taires-op\u00e9rateurs \u00e0 la fin du mois. La preuve d\u00e9montre qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin septembre 2014, la plaignante doit 78.16$ \u00e0 Horizon et, \u00e0 la fin octobre, sa somme due est de 0$. Mme Temple a son accident le 14 octobre 2014 et cesse de travailler jusqu\u2019au d\u00e9but d\u00e9cembre 2014. Cons\u00e9quemment, les sommes engag\u00e9es pour r\u00e9parer le camion commencent \u00e0 s\u2019accumuler sur les comptes de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. \u00c0 la fin novembre 2014, la dette de la plaignante est de 5 835.91$. Elle recommence \u00e0 travailler vers la mi-d\u00e9cembre 2014 et effectue quelques livraisons. Toutefois, le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2014, la plaignante apporte son camion au garage pour effectuer plus de r\u00e9parations. Ces r\u00e9parations sont plus importantes que pr\u00e9vues et de nouvelles sommes devront \u00eatre engag\u00e9es. La compagnie met fin \u00e0 son contrat le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2014. Ainsi, au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2014, la dette de Mme Temple s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 10 264.40$.\n[65] Mme Temple a expliqu\u00e9 au Tribunal que la compagnie l\u2019a cong\u00e9di\u00e9e et d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d\u2019emploi pr\u00e9textant que le montant de sa dette \u00e9tait \u00e9lev\u00e9 et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait dans l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de la rembourser. Elle soutient cependant que les autres propri\u00e9taires-op\u00e9rateurs de camion de sexe masculin incluant M. Carriere ont, eux aussi, engag\u00e9 des dettes avec la compagnie, mais n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pour autant cong\u00e9di\u00e9s ou trait\u00e9s d\u00e9favorablement. D\u2019abord, je rappelle que M. Carriere est dans la m\u00eame situation que la plaignante : il est un propri\u00e9taire-op\u00e9rateur de camion et facture des sommes sur les comptes de la compagnie. Certains de ses relev\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9quipement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve au Tribunal notamment ceux des mois d\u2019octobre, novembre et d\u00e9cembre 2014. M. Carriere a \u00e9galement eu un accident \u00e0 la mi-octobre 2014, tout comme Mme Temple et a cess\u00e9 de travailler jusqu\u2019au 22 novembre 2014. Sa dette envers Horizon, en octobre 2014, s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 7 381.48$. En novembre, elle est de 24 653.26$. Cependant, M. Carriere recommence \u00e0 travailler en fin novembre. En d\u00e9cembre 2014, il r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 diminuer sa dette \u00e0 15 917.55$ et ne prend pas d\u2019avance durant ce mois.\n[66] M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 sur cet aspect \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que lorsque M. Carriere a engag\u00e9 cette somme de plus de 12 000.00$ en novembre 2014, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant que la somme allait \u00eatre aussi importante. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que la compagnie n\u2019a pas assum\u00e9 ces co\u00fbts de r\u00e9paration. M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 aurait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Carriere de contracter un pr\u00eat personnel pour assumer ces frais et lui aurait sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de consulter une connaissance travaillant pour une institution financi\u00e8re. Il y a contradiction dans les t\u00e9moignages. M. Carriere a plut\u00f4t t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019il effectue des r\u00e9parations importantes sur son camion, il demande l\u2019autorisation de la compagnie avant d\u2019engager ces frais. Il a ensuite confirm\u00e9 que la compagnie avait assum\u00e9 cette r\u00e9paration de pr\u00e8s de 13 000.00$. C\u2019est effectivement ce qu\u2019il appert de son relev\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9quipements du 30 novembre 2014. Comme mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, \u00e0 cette date, sa dette s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve donc \u00e0 24 653.26$. En contre-interrogatoire, M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 se ravise et confirme que la compagnie semble avoir effectivement pay\u00e9 ces r\u00e9parations et il tente finalement d\u2019expliquer la situation. Il rench\u00e9rit en mentionnant que M. Carriere avait la capacit\u00e9 de rembourser, qu\u2019il d\u00e9tenait une maison et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de son camion. Or, M. Carriere a confirm\u00e9 au Tribunal que son camion \u00e9tait financ\u00e9 via une institution financi\u00e8re. De plus, lorsque le Tribunal consulte le relev\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9quipements de M. Carriere du mois de d\u00e9cembre 2014, rien n\u2019indique que celui-ci ait rembours\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie un important montant sur sa dette notamment via un pr\u00eat personnel qu\u2019il aurait pu contracter et ce, tel que l\u2019aurait demand\u00e9 M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9. Dans les circonstances, j\u2019estime que la version de M. Carriere est plus coh\u00e9rente au regard de la preuve qui m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[67] Encore une fois, le Tribunal est sensible au fait qu\u2019Horizon est une petite entreprise familiale. Tel que mentionn\u00e9 par M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 et corrobor\u00e9 par M. Luc Dub\u00e9, la compagnie assume plusieurs frais des propri\u00e9taires-op\u00e9rateurs de camion et ne se voit rembourser ces sommes qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de chaque mois et ce, si les revenus des propri\u00e9taires-op\u00e9rateurs sont suffisants. Autrement, elle assume le solde de la dette le temps que ces derniers en remboursent la totalit\u00e9. Par contre, je me demande comment l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut pr\u00e9tendre que la plaignante n\u2019a pas la capacit\u00e9 de rembourser sa dette alors qu\u2019elle travaille chez Horizon depuis plus de deux ans et que la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le clairement qu\u2019elle a toujours rembours\u00e9 ses dettes \u00e0 la compagnie. Au surplus, en date du 31 octobre 2014, sa dette envers la compagnie est tout simplement inexistante.\n[68] En raison de l\u2019accident et des r\u00e9parations sur le camion, il est \u00e9vident que des sommes allaient \u00eatre factur\u00e9es sur les comptes de la compagnie. Lorsque M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 a contact\u00e9 le garage le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2014 afin de voir ce qu\u2019il pouvait \u00eatre fait afin de r\u00e9parer le camion le plus rapidement possible, il apprend que des nouveaux frais suppl\u00e9mentaires de 5 000$ \u00e0 10 000$ devront \u00eatre engag\u00e9s. Il est \u00e9vident que M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 a pris une d\u00e9cision d\u2019affaires en ne laissant pas la situation s\u2019enliser davantage. N\u00e9anmoins, la compagnie a accept\u00e9 de prendre le risque avec M. Carriere, mais pas avec Mme Temple. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ajoute que M. Carriere a refus\u00e9 de prendre des avances de fond de la compagnie en d\u00e9cembre 2014 et qu\u2019il a gagn\u00e9 d\u2019excellents revenus dans le m\u00eame mois afin de rembourser sa dette plus rapidement. En effet, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le effectivement que M. Carriere rembourse pr\u00e8s de 9 000$ sur sa dette en d\u00e9cembre 2014. Ceci \u00e9tant dit, Horizon n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante cette opportunit\u00e9 de rembourser sa dette puisque son contrat de travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sili\u00e9.\n[69] Cons\u00e9quemment, je conclus, par la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve, que la plaignante a subi un traitement d\u00e9favorable par l\u2019intim\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la gestion de sa dette.\n[70] La plaignante soutient que la compagnie a aid\u00e9 et cautionn\u00e9 M. Carriere \u00e0 effectuer une demande de financement personnel afin de rembourser sa dette et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas eu le droit \u00e0 ce type de privil\u00e8ge. L\u2019intim\u00e9e r\u00e9fute ces all\u00e9gations. Il semble y avoir une certaine confusion quant \u00e0 cet aspect. Il n\u2019est pas clair si Mme Temple d\u00e9nonce le fait qu\u2019Horizon aurait sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Carriere de consulter un de ses contacts dans une institution financi\u00e8re ou qu\u2019Horizon aurait cautionn\u00e9 M. Carriere dans sa demande de financement. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas cautionn\u00e9 celui-ci dans sa demande : M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 a propos\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Carriere d\u2019aller rencontrer un agent qu\u2019il connaissait dans une institution financi\u00e8re. De plus, entre octobre 2014 et le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2014 et en v\u00e9rifiant les relev\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9quipements de M. Carriere, le Tribunal ne peut conclure qu\u2019une demande de financement a permis \u00e0 ce dernier de rembourser sa dette envers la compagnie.\n[71] La preuve n\u2019est pas pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante quant \u00e0 cette question et je conclus qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de traitement d\u00e9favorable par la compagnie.\n[72] Enfin, Mme Temple a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la compagnie ne l\u2019a pas soutenue dans la location d\u2019un camion alors qu\u2019elle l\u2019a fait pour M. Carriere. Elle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une situation o\u00f9 M. Luc Dub\u00e9 aurait effectu\u00e9 les d\u00e9marches afin de louer un camion de location pour M. Carriere. La compagnie a tent\u00e9 de r\u00e9futer ces propos et indique qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de traitement d\u00e9favorable. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le 7 ao\u00fbt 2014, le camion de la plaignante brise et, de ce fait, n\u2019est pas en \u00e9tat pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer des frets pr\u00e9vus. M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 repousser l\u2019heure du chargement le temps que le camion se fasse r\u00e9parer. Cependant, le garage ne peut le faire rapidement puisqu\u2019il ne poss\u00e8de pas la pi\u00e8ce n\u00e9cessaire pour la r\u00e9paration. Mme Temple propose donc une solution soit la location d\u2019un camion. Avec ce camion lou\u00e9, elle pourra effectuer les chargements pr\u00e9vus. Cependant, un malentendu survient entre elle et M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 : alors qu\u2019elle croyait qu\u2019il effectuerait la location, celui-ci avait compris l\u2019inverse.\n[73] Mme Temple affirme qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e d\u00e9favorablement puisque M. Luc Dub\u00e9 avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait la location d\u2019un camion pour M. Carriere alors que M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 ne l\u2019a pas fait pour elle. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que M. Luc Dub\u00e9 \u00e9tait au bureau lorsque cette situation est survenue avec M. Carriere. Il a donc pu facilement effectuer les d\u00e9marches. Lors de cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement du 7 ao\u00fbt 2014, il appert que M. Luc Dub\u00e9 \u00e9tait absent du bureau. De plus, M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas physiquement pr\u00e9sent au bureau cette journ\u00e9e-l\u00e0 et le r\u00e9partiteur, M. Savage, \u00e9tait en vacances. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a ainsi indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal que la plaignante se retrouvait dans une meilleure position afin d\u2019effectuer les d\u00e9marches de location elle-m\u00eame. Au final, Mme Temple a effectu\u00e9 elle-m\u00eame sa location et a pay\u00e9 les frais qui y sont aff\u00e9rents. M. Carriere a \u00e9galement assum\u00e9 les frais de sa location. Est-ce que cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement a fait en sorte que Mme Temple a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 en cour d\u2019emploi? Le Tribunal croit qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 d\u2019un simple concours de circonstances.\n[74] Je conclus ainsi que cette situation ne constitue pas un traitement d\u00e9favorable de la part d\u2019Horizon \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plaignante.\n(vii) R\u00e9clamation \u00e0 la MPI\n[75] Mme Temple pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 d\u00e9favorablement par la compagnie dans la gestion de ses r\u00e9clamations de la MPI et de la WBC. Elle soutient que les retards sont dus \u00e0 la compagnie qui n\u2019a pas agi rapidement et qu\u2019elle en a assum\u00e9 les effets n\u00e9gatifs. Elle prend comme exemple les r\u00e9clamations de M. Carriere qui, selon elle, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9r\u00e9es avec c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9 par Horizon. L\u2019intim\u00e9e, quant \u00e0 elle, r\u00e9fute ses all\u00e9gations.\n[76] Dans un premier temps, j\u2019aborderai la r\u00e9clamation \u00e0 la MPI. Comme expliqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, lorsqu\u2019un op\u00e9rateur de camion a un accident, la MPI peut couvrir certains dommages au camion, \u00e0 la remorque et aux frets touch\u00e9s. L\u2019accident survient le 14 octobre 2014. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e sont rapidement en contact afin de discuter de la situation. Mme Temple n\u2019a pas besoin d\u2019ambulance, ni des services de police. Elle se sent capable de compl\u00e9ter ses livraisons, ce qu\u2019elle fait. Le 16 octobre 2014, elle et la compagnie discutent notamment de l\u2019estimation des dommages sur le camion. Elle informe M. Luc Dub\u00e9, par le fait m\u00eame, qu\u2019elle a besoin de consulter un docteur pour son pouce. Ce dernier demande de lui faire un suivi lorsqu\u2019elle en aura un. Le 17 octobre 2014, elle informe M. Luc Dub\u00e9 que le docteur lui demande de passer des rayons X. M. Luc Dub\u00e9 confirme alors que Mme Temple sera en cong\u00e9 pour la fin de semaine. Il l\u2019informe de nouveau qu\u2019il a besoin d\u2019un estim\u00e9 des dommages sur le camion. Lundi, le 20 octobre 2014, M. Luc Dub\u00e9 demande \u00e0 nouveau \u00e0 la plaignante de lui fournir les informations n\u00e9cessaires quant \u00e0 l\u2019accident. Mme Temple lui donne quelques informations et lui indique qu\u2019elle enverra d\u2019autres informations sous peu. Le 22 octobre 2014, M. Luc Dub\u00e9 sollicite la plaignante, encore une fois, puisqu\u2019il est toujours en attente des informations. Elle lui r\u00e9pond qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u la vid\u00e9o de l\u2019accident et qu\u2019elle a donn\u00e9 son adresse courriel au garage qui effectue l\u2019estim\u00e9 des dommages. Le 23 octobre 2014, Mme Temple confirme avec M. Luc Dub\u00e9 que les documents et informations demand\u00e9es ont bien \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7us, ce qu\u2019il r\u00e9pond par l\u2019affirmative. N\u00e9anmoins, le 3 novembre 2014, la demande \u00e0 la MPI n\u2019est toujours pas compl\u00e9t\u00e9e. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que des erreurs de communication sont survenues entre les diff\u00e9rentes personnes impliqu\u00e9es dans la r\u00e9clamation incluant \u00e0 la MPI. Le 4 novembre 2014, la r\u00e9clamation est finalement compl\u00e9t\u00e9e. M. Luc Dub\u00e9 a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il a agi aussi rapidement qu\u2019il l\u2019a pu, d\u00e8s qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u toutes les informations pour compl\u00e9ter la r\u00e9clamation. Le Tribunal ne remet pas en question la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Luc Dub\u00e9. En effet, il y a eu un d\u00e9lai dans le traitement de la r\u00e9clamation de la plaignante. Cependant, ce d\u00e9lai est notamment d\u00fb au temps n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la cueillette de l\u2019information, sa transmission ainsi qu\u2019aux probl\u00e8mes de communication entre les diff\u00e9rents intervenants. Ce d\u00e9lai n\u2019est pas uniquement attribuable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[77] Rien dans la preuve ne permet de conclure que la compagnie a trait\u00e9 la demande de Mme Temple d\u00e9favorablement. Ce faisant, je conclus que la plaignante ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e de son fardeau de preuve quant \u00e0 cette question.\n[78] Mme Temple affirme que l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait d\u00fb demander \u00e0 la MPI le remboursement de certaines autres d\u00e9penses lors de la r\u00e9clamation, ce qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Horizon d\u00e9ment ces all\u00e9gations. Les parties ont expliqu\u00e9 au Tribunal que lorsque l\u2019employeur compl\u00e8te une r\u00e9clamation aupr\u00e8s de la MPI, il y a cr\u00e9ation d\u2019une subrogation : la MPI se subroge \u00e0 l\u2019employeur dans la r\u00e9clamation. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient donc qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait plus les pouvoirs de r\u00e9clamer le remboursement de d\u00e9penses suppl\u00e9mentaires par la MPI puisque cette derni\u00e8re la subrogeait dans ses droits. Le Tribunal a \u00e9cout\u00e9 les parties se lancer dans une interpr\u00e9tation libre de la notion de subrogation. Aucun repr\u00e9sentant de la MPI n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin afin d\u2019expliquer les subtilit\u00e9s du processus. Aucune loi, r\u00e8glement, politiques, proc\u00e9dures ou autres documents encadrant ou r\u00e9gissant la MPI et son fonctionnement n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audition. Il est donc difficile pour le Tribunal de se positionner sur cette notion de subrogation et ce que la compagnie aurait d\u00fb ou pu faire et ce, sans une preuve concr\u00e8te \u00e0 cet effet.\n[79] J\u2019estime que Mme Temple n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve, qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e par la compagnie quant \u00e0 cet aspect.\n(viii) R\u00e9clamation \u00e0 la WBC\n[80] Dans un deuxi\u00e8me temps, la plaignante soutient qu\u2019Horizon l\u2019a trait\u00e9 d\u00e9favorablement en n\u2019effectuant pas sa r\u00e9clamation \u00e0 la WBC avant le mois de d\u00e9cembre 2014. La compagnie fait valoir que Mme Temple ne l\u2019a pas avis\u00e9 de la gravit\u00e9 de sa blessure. Les repr\u00e9sentants de la compagnie croyaient que sa blessure \u00e9tait mineure et ne n\u00e9cessitait donc pas de r\u00e9clamation. Je rappelle que l\u2019accident est survenu le 14 octobre 2014. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la compagnie a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Temple si les services d\u2019urgence \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires, ce qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas. Cependant, la plaignante informe M. Luc Dub\u00e9, le 16 octobre 2014, qu\u2019elle a r\u00e9ellement besoin de consulter un m\u00e9decin et ce, rapidement. M. Luc Dub\u00e9 r\u00e9pond de l\u2019informer des d\u00e9veloppements. Le 17 octobre 2014, elle l\u2019informe que le docteur lui demande de passer des rayons X. M. Luc Dub\u00e9 lui r\u00e9pond qu\u2019elle est donc en cong\u00e9 assur\u00e9ment pour la fin de semaine, ce qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 envisag\u00e9. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la r\u00e9clamation \u00e0 la WBC n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite que le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2014.\n[81] M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 sur la r\u00e9clamation \u00e0 la WBC. Il a indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal qu\u2019il ne savait pas que Mme Temple s\u2019\u00e9tait bless\u00e9e lors de l\u2019accident du 14 octobre 2014 et qu\u2019aucun rapport d\u2019incident pour la WBC ne lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis. De plus, il n\u2019avait pas envisag\u00e9 que la blessure \u00e9tait si importante et n\u00e9cessitait un arr\u00eat de travail. Il a finalement expliqu\u00e9 au Tribunal qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u une lettre de la WBC en d\u00e9cembre 2014 lui demandant un rapport d\u2019incident. C\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment qu\u2019il a contact\u00e9 la plaignante pour avoir plus d\u2019informations. M. Luc Dub\u00e9, quant \u00e0 lui, a mentionn\u00e9 que c\u2019est lui qui g\u00e8re ce genre de r\u00e9clamations dans l\u2019entreprise. Selon lui, c\u2019est l\u2019employ\u00e9 bless\u00e9 qui doit initier la r\u00e9clamation en l\u2019informant (ou M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9) qu\u2019il est bless\u00e9 et qu\u2019il entend demander compensation. Il a ensuite expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas dans sa pratique de demander \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s s\u2019ils r\u00e9clameront compensation pour l\u2019accident. Il justifie cette pratique en invoquant le fait qu\u2019il ne veut pas s\u2019immiscer dans la vie priv\u00e9e de ses employ\u00e9s et si ces derniers ne veulent divulguer leurs blessures, il n\u2019a pas de contr\u00f4le \u00e0 ce sujet. La preuve d\u00e9montre \u00e9galement que le 4 d\u00e9cembre 2014, Mme Temple a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 M. Luc Dub\u00e9 et lui demande son num\u00e9ro de r\u00e9clamation \u00e0 la WBC. Ce dernier a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne savait pas, \u00e0 cette date, qu\u2019une telle r\u00e9clamation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 entam\u00e9e par Mme Temple. Il a indiqu\u00e9 avoir lu rapidement le message et pris pour acquis qu\u2019elle demandait son num\u00e9ro \u00e0 la MPI.\n[82] Ceci \u00e9tant dit, et m\u00eame si j\u2019adh\u00e8re au fait que le pr\u00e9sident de la compagnie, M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant que la plaignante s\u2019\u00e9tait bless\u00e9e durant son accident du 14 octobre 2014, il est \u00e9vident pour moi que son fils, M. Luc Dub\u00e9, directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral chez Horizon, avait connaissance de la blessure. Mme Temple a mentionn\u00e9, \u00e0 quelques reprises, qu\u2019elle devait consulter un m\u00e9decin pour son pouce, qu\u2019il y avait possiblement dislocation et qu\u2019elle devait passer des rayons X. Le Tribunal peut concevoir que Mme Temple n\u2019a peut-\u00eatre pas insist\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment sur le fait que la blessure \u00e9tait majeure ou qu\u2019elle voulait faire une r\u00e9clamation \u00e0 la WBC, mais je consid\u00e8re qu\u2019Horizon n\u2019a pas non plus d\u00e9montr\u00e9e une grande proactivit\u00e9 dans la gestion de cette blessure au travail. M. Luc Dub\u00e9 a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que pour des raisons de vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses employ\u00e9s, il ne pose pas de questions sur leurs blessures. Je me permets de dire que cette pratique est discutable. Mme Temple a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un document \u00e9manant du site internet de la WBC. Il est clairement mentionn\u00e9 que l\u2019employeur a la responsabilit\u00e9, si un de ses employ\u00e9s se blesse au travail ou devient malade, de le transporter \u00e0 un endroit o\u00f9 il recevra des soins m\u00e9dicaux. Ces co\u00fbts doivent \u00eatre assum\u00e9s par l\u2019employeur. De plus, celui-ci doit faire rapport de la blessure dans les trois jours suivants l\u2019incident. De plus, sur le formulaire de la WBC permettant de signaler une blessure au travail par l\u2019employeur, il est clairement inscrit au tout d\u00e9but du formulaire cette m\u00eame obligation de signaler l\u2019incident et ce, qu\u2019il soit ou non en accord avec la blessure. Il y est \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019en transmettant le rapport dans les d\u00e9lais prescrits, l\u2019employeur \u00e9vitera de devoir payer des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s.\n[83] De ce fait, l\u2019employeur a tout int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer la blessure d\u2019un de ses employ\u00e9s le plus rapidement possible, que la blessure soit grande ou petite, qu\u2019il soit d\u2019accord ou non avec la r\u00e9clamation. J\u2019ajoute que le rapport d\u2019incident que l\u2019employeur doit transmettre est tr\u00e8s court. La plupart des questions sont \u00e0 choix multiples et se r\u00e9pondent avec un simple crochet. L\u2019autre partie des questions est d\u2019ordre nominatif et concerne des informations de base. La section permettant de d\u00e9crire la blessure en question et l\u2019incident est petite comparativement au reste des informations. Cons\u00e9quemment, la description ne peut \u00eatre que sommaire. Lorsque je consulte le formulaire rempli par Horizon le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2014, je constate en effet que la description de l\u2019incident fait tout au plus quatre lignes et quelques mots. Horizon peut bien demander des rapports \u00e9crits de la part de ses employ\u00e9s sur leur blessure si elle le d\u00e9sire, mais je ne crois pas que cela soit une obligation afin d\u2019entamer une r\u00e9clamation. Rien dans la preuve ne me permet de tirer une telle conclusion. Au surplus, la description de la blessure qu\u2019a faite Horizon \u00e0 la WBC ne contient pas plus d\u2019informations que ce que M. Luc Dub\u00e9 d\u00e9tenait au mois d\u2019octobre 2014. Il est difficile pour le Tribunal de comprendre comment la compagnie peut pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas assez d\u2019informations sur l\u2019accident et avait besoin d\u2019un rapport \u00e9crit alors qu\u2019elle connaissait d\u00e9j\u00e0 l\u2019essentiel de l\u2019incident.\n[84] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la r\u00e9clamation de M. Carriere a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9e avec c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9 et sans emb\u00fbche. Horizon affirme que ce dernier lui a donn\u00e9 un rapport \u00e9crit de sa blessure rapidement et c\u2019est la raison pour laquelle la r\u00e9clamation a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9e imm\u00e9diatement. La preuve ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le pas si M. Carriere a clairement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie qu\u2019il entendait demander une compensation pour ses blessures. Ceci \u00e9tant dit, le fait est que tout comme Mme Temple, il a eu un accident dans la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode, qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9, que le camion devait \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9 et qu\u2019il ne pouvait travailler. Sa situation, sur tous ces points, est identique \u00e0 celle de la plaignante. Mais la fa\u00e7on dont la r\u00e9clamation a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e est disproportionn\u00e9e.\n[85] Notamment pour ces raisons, je conclus donc que Mme Temple a subi un traitement d\u00e9favorable par la compagnie dans la gestion de sa r\u00e9clamation \u00e0 la WBC.\n(ix) Temps refus\u00e9 afin d\u2019effectuer des r\u00e9parations\n[86] La plaignante a invoqu\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 d\u00e9favorablement puisqu\u2019Horizon ne lui a pas allou\u00e9 le temps n\u00e9cessaire afin d\u2019effectuer les r\u00e9parations sur son camion. Selon elle, les op\u00e9rateurs de camion de sexe masculin ne rencontraient pas ce type de probl\u00e8mes. Horizon a tent\u00e9 de r\u00e9futer ces all\u00e9gations. Selon elle, la responsabilit\u00e9 de s\u2019assurer que les r\u00e9parations sont ad\u00e9quatement effectu\u00e9es sur les camions appartient aux propri\u00e9taires-op\u00e9rateurs et non \u00e0 la compagnie. Ce faisant, elle affirme que la plaignante aurait d\u00fb refuser de prendre les chargements pour faire r\u00e9parer ad\u00e9quatement ses \u00e9quipements. Mme Temple a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une situation lors de laquelle son camion a pris en feu apr\u00e8s avoir manqu\u00e9 d\u2019huile. Des r\u00e9parations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaires. Selon elle, l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait pr\u00e9vu un chargement alors que le diagnostic n\u2019avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sur le camion. Elle indique qu\u2019elle ne voulait pas \u00ab cr\u00e9er de vagues \u00bb et accepta le chargement malgr\u00e9 les r\u00e9parations non compl\u00e9t\u00e9es sur son poids lourd. Cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement serait survenu en f\u00e9vrier ou mars 2014. J\u2019estime que la preuve n\u2019est pas exhaustive \u00e0 ce sujet et il est difficile de conclure que la compagnie a trait\u00e9 Mme Temple d\u00e9favorablement quant \u00e0 cet aspect. Je rappelle que la plaignante doit s\u2019acquitter de son fardeau de la preuve selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s.\n[87] J\u2019ai tent\u00e9 de recenser dans la preuve d\u2019autres \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e0 ce sujet. Un autre \u00e9v\u00e9nement est survenu le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2014 alors que Mme Temple annonce \u00e0 M. Luc Dub\u00e9 qu\u2019elle apporte son camion au garage afin de faire v\u00e9rifier le voyant lumineux du moteur. Le lendemain, 18 d\u00e9cembre 2014, le contrat de Mme Temple a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sili\u00e9. Il est donc impossible pour le Tribunal de conclure que la compagnie ne lui a pas allou\u00e9 le temps n\u00e9cessaire afin d\u2019effectuer les r\u00e9parations sur son poids lourd. De plus, entre l\u2019accident du 14 octobre 2014 et la mi-d\u00e9cembre 2014, rien dans la preuve ne me permet de d\u00e9terminer que la plaignante n\u2019a pas eu le temps n\u00e9cessaire pour ses r\u00e9parations.\n[88] Pour ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements, je consid\u00e8re que Mme Temple n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 d\u00e9favorablement par l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[89] Enfin, le dernier \u00e9v\u00e9nement recens\u00e9 est celui des 21 et 22 juillet 2014 alors que Mme Temple indique \u00e0 M. Luc Dub\u00e9 qu\u2019elle prend son cong\u00e9 de 36 heures et fera r\u00e9parer son camion. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 trait\u00e9 de cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement dans une section pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que Mme Temple s\u2019est sentie contrainte de prendre le chargement et qu\u2019elle a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e d\u00e9favorablement par la compagnie. L\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement est le m\u00eame, mais examin\u00e9 sous un angle diff\u00e9rent soit celui des r\u00e9parations. La compagnie n\u2019a pas directement refus\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019effectuer les r\u00e9parations sur son camion. Cependant, l\u2019effet indirect est que Mme Temple n\u2019a pas pu effectuer lesdites r\u00e9parations. Le traitement est donc d\u00e9favorable.\n[90] Quant \u00e0 cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement en particulier, je consid\u00e8re que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9favorablement trait\u00e9 la plaignante en cours d\u2019emploi.\n(x) Traitement d\u00e9favorable et maltraitance par les r\u00e9partiteurs\n[91] La plaignante a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que certains employ\u00e9s de la compagnie l\u2019ont trait\u00e9 d\u00e9favorablement ou incorrectement. Elle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux deux r\u00e9partiteurs de la compagnie, M. Wyatt et M. Boulanger. Selon elle, ces r\u00e9partiteurs ne transmettaient qu\u2019une portion des informations au pr\u00e9sident de la compagnie. L\u2019intim\u00e9e r\u00e9fute ces all\u00e9gations. Il est incontestable pour le Tribunal que des probl\u00e8mes de communication \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents entre Horizon, Mme Temple et les employ\u00e9s. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00e9galement que l\u2019utilisation de la messagerie texte semble \u00eatre un outil tr\u00e8s utilis\u00e9 entre eux et je constate que cela n\u2019a pas simplifi\u00e9 les \u00e9changes, bien au contraire. Dans plusieurs situations, un simple appel aurait pu effacer toute ambigu\u00eft\u00e9. D\u2019autre part, Mme Temple a soutenu que les r\u00e9partiteurs la maltraitaient. M. Boulanger n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin. Le simple t\u00e9moignage de Mme Temple sur le sujet n\u2019a pas convaincu le Tribunal. Quant \u00e0 M. Wyatt, la seule preuve au dossier \u00e0 ce sujet est un \u00e9change de message du 3 octobre 2014 entre lui et Mme Temple. Il lui transmet les informations pour un nouveau chargement et lui demande si elle peut l\u2019effectuer ou non. Mme Temple prend plus d\u2019une heure \u00e0 confirmer la prise en charge du chargement et M. Wyatt semble perdre patience. Il lui indique d\u2019ores et d\u00e9j\u00e0 qu\u2019il croit qu\u2019elle va, comme toujours, bousiller les plans. Il ajoute que cela ne vaut plus la peine de lui donner des chargements puisque la compagnie a l\u2019air d\u2019une idiote \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des clients en ne remplissant pas ses obligations.\n[92] M. Wyatt et un autre r\u00e9partiteur, M. Matthews, ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Ils ont indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal qu\u2019ils ont pris chacun la d\u00e9cision de ne plus \u00eatre les r\u00e9partiteurs pour Mme Temple consid\u00e9rant qu\u2019elle demandait trop de supervision et \u00e0 cause du camion qui \u00e9tait souvent bris\u00e9. Ils ont ajout\u00e9 que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019ils refusaient de travailler avec des op\u00e9rateurs de camion pour les m\u00eames raisons. C\u2019est la raison pour laquelle M. Luc Dub\u00e9 et surtout, M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9, \u00e9taient impliqu\u00e9s dans la supervision de Mme Temple et de ses trajets. La compr\u00e9hension du Tribunal est que Mme Temple \u00e9tait satisfaite de ne plus faire affaires avec les r\u00e9partiteurs. \u00c0 l\u2019inverse, elle a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 \u00eatre micro-g\u00e9r\u00e9e par M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9. Le Tribunal con\u00e7oit qu\u2019aucune situation n\u2019est parfaite. Cependant, c\u2019est la solution qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en place par la compagnie afin de r\u00e9gler la situation.\n[93] Encore une fois, il est ind\u00e9niable pour le Tribunal que des frustrations sont pr\u00e9sentes chez les membres d\u2019Horizon incluant les r\u00e9partiteurs et qu\u2019en octobre 2014, ces sentiments semblent \u00eatre bien encr\u00e9s. Certains \u00e9changes sont moins cordiaux que d\u2019autres. Est-ce que cela constitue en soi un traitement d\u00e9favorable? Je ne peux conclure en ce sens. Quant \u00e0 la transmission partielle des informations, la preuve n\u2019est pas pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante \u00e0 cet effet. Pour ces raisons, je conclus qu\u2019il n\u2019y a \u00e9galement pas de traitement d\u00e9favorable par la compagnie.\n(xi) Temps refus\u00e9 pour les rendez-vous m\u00e9dicaux\n[94] Finalement, la derni\u00e8re all\u00e9gation de discrimination invoqu\u00e9e par Mme Temple concerne le fait que la compagnie ne lui accordait pas le temps n\u00e9cessaire relativement \u00e0 ses rendez-vous m\u00e9dicaux. Horizon r\u00e9fute ses all\u00e9gations. En \u00e9valuant la preuve, le Tribunal recense deux \u00e9v\u00e9nements sp\u00e9cifiques en lien avec ses rendez-vous m\u00e9dicaux.\n[95] La premi\u00e8re situation est celle des 26 et 27 ao\u00fbt 2014. La plaignante est \u00e0 Langley (Colombie-Britannique). M. Luc Dub\u00e9 l\u2019informe qu\u2019il la contactera le 27 ao\u00fbt 2014 au matin afin de l\u2019informer s\u2019il a un nouveau chargement pour elle ou non. Elle acquiesce et lui indique qu\u2019elle restera \u00e0 Langley. De plus, elle lui demande de l\u2019informer le plus t\u00f4t possible puisqu\u2019autrement, elle prendra la journ\u00e9e de cong\u00e9. M. Luc Dub\u00e9 r\u00e9pond par l\u2019affirmative. Le 27 ao\u00fbt 2014 au matin, la plaignante demande \u00e0 M. Luc Dub\u00e9 s\u2019il a une livraison pour elle. Il r\u00e9pond que ce n\u2019est pas le cas pour le moment. Plus tard, M. Luc Dub\u00e9 l\u2019interpelle puisqu\u2019un chargement doit finalement \u00eatre r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9. Il lui donne alors les informations sur le chargement. Mme Temple lui r\u00e9pond qu\u2019elle est chez le docteur, sur la liste d\u2019attente. Elle mentionne donc au Tribunal que la compagnie ne lui a pas allou\u00e9 le temps pour son rendez-vous m\u00e9dical. Mme Temple et M. Luc Dub\u00e9 ont chacun t\u00e9moign\u00e9 sur le sujet. La plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 que pour elle, il \u00e9tait clair que l\u2019entente \u00e9tait qu\u2019elle prenait un cong\u00e9 si, t\u00f4t le matin, aucun chargement n\u2019\u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu. M. Luc Dub\u00e9 a plut\u00f4t indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal que lorsque Mme Temple lui a \u00e9crit le 27 ao\u00fbt 2014 afin de v\u00e9rifier s\u2019il avait un chargement pour elle, cela d\u00e9montrait qu\u2019elle voulait et demandait un chargement. Il lui a donc donn\u00e9 un chargement lorsque confirm\u00e9 par le client. Encore une fois, il existe un probl\u00e8me de communication et de compr\u00e9hension entre la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e. De plus, le Tribunal se demande pourquoi Mme Temple n\u2019a pas averti M. Dub\u00e9 qu\u2019elle allait chez le docteur d\u00e8s qu\u2019elle a pris la d\u00e9cision de s\u2019y rendre? N\u2019aurait-t-il pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plus simple de clarifier la situation? Encore une fois, la messagerie texte et les probl\u00e8mes de communication sont la base de malentendus. Ceci ne constitue pas en soi un traitement d\u00e9favorable.\n[96] Je conclus donc que Mme Temple n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 d\u00e9favorablement pas la compagnie quant \u00e0 cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement.\n[97] L\u2019autre situation est celle du 18 d\u00e9cembre 2014 alors que Mme Temple se rend \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital de Chilliwack pour son CT scan. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 revu ses faits dans une section pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente et il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de les r\u00e9p\u00e9ter \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape-ci. Cependant, j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que Mme Temple avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 d\u00e9favorablement par la compagnie quant \u00e0 cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement.\nC. Lien entre le motif et l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable\n[98] Je passerai en revue les traitements d\u00e9favorables qu\u2019a subis la plaignante afin de d\u00e9terminer si le sexe ou la d\u00e9ficience ont \u00e9t\u00e9 un des multiples facteurs des actes reproch\u00e9s et de la manifestation de leurs effets pr\u00e9judiciables. Je rappelle qu\u2019un \u00ab lien de causalit\u00e9 \u00bb n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire : le lien entre le motif prohib\u00e9 de discrimination et l\u2019acte reproch\u00e9 n\u2019a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre exclusif (Voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Bombardier, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paragraphes 44 \u00e0 52). La d\u00e9monstration, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, d\u2019un simple \u00ab lien \u00bb ou \u00ab facteur \u00bb suffit. Pour des fins de concisions et afin d\u2019\u00e9viter la redondance, le Tribunal ne reprendra pas tous les faits expos\u00e9s dans la section pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente et se limitera \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la plaignante a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 ce lien entre le motif et l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable.\n[99] Tout d\u2019abord, j\u2019ai d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d\u2019emploi par la compagnie quant au fait d\u2019\u00eatre forc\u00e9 de livrer ou prendre la route. J\u2019ai \u00e9galement conclu qu\u2019elle se sentait sous la contrainte de prendre les chargements sous peine d\u2019\u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9e. Est-ce que la plaignante a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que ce traitement d\u00e9favorable est li\u00e9 \u00e0 son sexe ou sa d\u00e9ficience selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve? Je ne peux conclure que Mme Temple a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 le lien entre l\u2019un de ces motifs et l\u2019acte reproch\u00e9. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la compagnie avait de multiples raisons d\u2019agir ainsi notamment les frustrations accumul\u00e9s, le faible rendement et la fiabilit\u00e9, les probl\u00e8mes de performance et de communication, pour ne nommer que celles-ci. J\u2019ajoute cependant que certaines de ces raisons sont discutables et ne justifient pas les menaces de cong\u00e9diement. Cependant, est-ce que le fait que Mme Temple est une femme ou qu\u2019elle est d\u00e9ficiente a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans le traitement? La preuve ne permet pas de r\u00e9pondre par l\u2019affirmative.\n[100] J\u2019ai \u00e9galement d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que Mme Temple a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 d\u00e9favorablement dans la gestion de sa dette envers la compagnie. Encore une fois, je dois d\u00e9terminer si ce traitement est li\u00e9 aux motifs de distinction illicite. Je consid\u00e8re que la plaignante n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que son sexe ou sa d\u00e9ficience ont \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans l\u2019acte reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie. Il est clair pour le Tribunal qu\u2019en octobre 2014, la relation entre la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est consid\u00e9rablement d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e. Cette relation se rompt le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2014 en raison de plusieurs facteurs. Une partie de ces facteurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. Le sexe et la d\u00e9ficience ne font pas partie de ces facteurs quant \u00e0 la gestion de la dette.\n[101] Je dois maintenant d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a un lien entre le sexe ou la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Temple et la mani\u00e8re dont a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e lors sa r\u00e9clamation \u00e0 la WBC. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 mon avis, Horizon avait suffisamment d\u2019informations afin d\u2019entamer une r\u00e9clamation et que le Tribunal a de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 comprendre pourquoi cela n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait avec c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9. N\u00e9anmoins, ceci n\u2019est pas d\u00e9terminant en mati\u00e8re de discrimination. La question est de savoir si le sexe ou la d\u00e9ficience ont \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans le traitement de la r\u00e9clamation \u00e0 la WBC par la compagnie. La preuve ne me permet pas de d\u00e9terminer que ces facteurs ont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans le traitement de la r\u00e9clamation. Le retard dans le traitement est attribuable \u00e0 plusieurs causes notamment le fait que la compagnie d\u00e9sirait respecter la vie priv\u00e9e de ses employ\u00e9s, l\u2019exigence du d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un rapport \u00e9crit et la perception quant \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de la blessure. Que ces justifications soient bien fond\u00e9es ou non, l\u00e0 n\u2019est pas la question. Il est clair pour le Tribunal que le sexe ou la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Temple n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans l\u2019acte reproch\u00e9 et ce faisant, je conclus donc qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas de lien entre eux.\n[102] Quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement des 21 et 22 juillet 2014 et l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 pour Mme Temple de faire r\u00e9parer son camion, je dois \u00e9galement d\u00e9cider si celle-ci a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que son sexe ou sa d\u00e9ficience ont \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans les agissements de M. Luc Dub\u00e9. Tout comme d\u00e9cid\u00e9 quant au fait que la compagnie aurait forc\u00e9 la plaignante \u00e0 prendre des chargements parce qu\u2019elle est une femme ou qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9ficiente, je ne peux conclure qu\u2019il existe un lien entre les motifs et les actes reproch\u00e9s.\n[103] J\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que Mme Temple a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e d\u00e9favorablement le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2014 par la compagnie alors qu\u2019elle avait un rendez-vous m\u00e9dical pour un CT scan. De plus, Mme Temple a cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre employ\u00e9e par la compagnie le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2014. La question est de savoir si le refus de continuer d\u2019employer la plaignante et le traitement d\u00e9favorable sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 son sexe ou sa d\u00e9ficience?\n[104] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Mme Temple a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2014 par M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 alors qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 son rendez-vous m\u00e9dical. Elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 averti M. Luc Dub\u00e9 de ce rendez-vous plusieurs jours \u00e0 l\u2019avance et \u00e0 quelques reprises. Le Tribunal rappelle \u00e9galement que Mme Temple a d\u00fb amener son camion au garage le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2014, en fin d\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi, afin de faire v\u00e9rifier un voyant lumineux du moteur. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le probl\u00e8me est plus s\u00e9rieux que pr\u00e9vu et que le camion ne peut reprendre la route. Mme Temple prend la d\u00e9cision de ne pas contacter la compagnie le 17 d\u00e9cembre consid\u00e9rant l\u2019heure et le d\u00e9calage horaire. Elle informe la compagnie le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2014, au matin, que son camion est en r\u00e9paration. Le chargement ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 et M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 d\u00e9cide de mettre fin au contrat de travail de Mme Temple. Je dois d\u00e9terminer si, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve, le sexe de Mme Temple ou si sa d\u00e9ficience ont \u00e9t\u00e9 un des multiples facteurs dans le traitement d\u00e9favorable. Je ne peux arriver \u00e0 une telle conclusion. La plaignante n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de d\u00e9montrer le lien entre l\u2019un des motifs et le traitement d\u00e9favorable. J\u2019estime qu\u2019il y a un traitement d\u00e9favorable. La compagnie a certainement mis Mme Temple dans une situation tr\u00e8s d\u00e9licate. Elle prenait le risque, en toute connaissance de cause, que le chargement ne pourrait peut-\u00eatre pas \u00eatre r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9. Mais est-ce qu\u2019Horizon a commis cet acte parce que la plaignante est une femme ou qu\u2019elle a une blessure au pouce? La preuve n\u2019est pas pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante \u00e0 cet effet.\n[105] Quant au cong\u00e9diement, encore une fois, le Tribunal doit se demander si le fait que Mme Temple est une femme ou qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait bless\u00e9e au pouce a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans le refus de continuer de l\u2019employer. Le moment choisi par M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 afin de cong\u00e9dier Mme Temple n\u2019est pas id\u00e9al consid\u00e9rant qu\u2019elle doit se rendre \u00e0 son rendez-vous m\u00e9dical. Et ceci dit, le Tribunal doit analyser la preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a de subtiles odeurs de discrimination dans le cong\u00e9diement. J\u2019aimerais rappeler que le camion de Mme Temple a d\u00fb \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9 le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2014. Ainsi, le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2014, le camion ne pouvait prendre la route et le chargement n\u2019aurait pu \u00eatre r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 avec le camion. Est-ce que M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 Mme Temple parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital ou qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait bless\u00e9e au pouce? Est-ce que M. Gilbert Dub\u00e9 l\u2019a cong\u00e9di\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une femme? La preuve ne me permet pas de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l\u2019affirmative. Le fait que Mme Temple \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital n\u2019a pas eu d\u2019impact quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la compagnie de la cong\u00e9dier. La plaignante aurait pu avoir, par exemple, des fun\u00e9railles, un rendez-vous familial, une activit\u00e9 avec son fils, : le r\u00e9sultat aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le m\u00eame. Le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2014 est le point de rupture et de non-retour dans la relation professionnelle entre les parties. La compagnie a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rompre ce lien pour une multitude de raisons notamment la performance, les retards, le manque de communication, les probl\u00e8mes relationnels, etc. Le sexe et la d\u00e9ficience ne font pas partie de ces facteurs.\nVII. Plainte jug\u00e9e non fond\u00e9e\n[106] Le Tribunal comprend que Mme Temple pouvait ressentir de la pression de la part de la compagnie, qu\u2019elle craignait d\u2019\u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9e, entrainant stress et anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 dans son travail quotidien. Les frustrations accumul\u00e9es, les malentendus et les probl\u00e8mes de communication, n\u2019ont fait qu\u2019aggraver la situation. Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments ont n\u00e9cessairement contribu\u00e9 aux sentiments de la plaignante d\u2019\u00eatre trait\u00e9e d\u00e9favorablement par la compagnie et ses membres. Le Tribunal est \u00e9galement sensible au fait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait la seule femme op\u00e9ratrice de camion chez Horizon au moment des \u00e9v\u00e8nements. Il est vrai que Mme Temple fait carri\u00e8re dans un domaine traditionnellement masculin. La discrimination est rarement directe ou intentionnelle. Le Tribunal doit donc rechercher ces subtiles odeurs de discrimination et \u00e9valuer les circonstances entourant ces actes reproch\u00e9s. Ceci \u00e9tant dit, le Tribunal est \u00e9galement li\u00e9 par la preuve au dossier et la d\u00e9cision doit \u00eatre prise selon la r\u00e8gle de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Je ne crois pas que le sexe ou la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Temple ont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans les actes reproch\u00e9s \u00e0 Horizon.\nVIII.

Les faits\n[1] Le 18 juillet 2017, j\u2019ai rendu une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate (2017 TCDP 25) dans laquelle j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de divulguer aux autres parties l\u2019un des 16 documents demand\u00e9s par la plaignante, soit l\u2019\u00ab entente de l\u2019\u00e9quipe responsable des prestations du CP avec Manuvie et la politique et la proc\u00e9dure en mati\u00e8re de prestations non syndiqu\u00e9es \u00bb (l\u2019entente avec Manuvie).\n[2] \u00c0 la suite de ma d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9, le 24 juillet 2017, le consentement de la plaignante \u00e0 un projet d\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 applicable \u00e0 l\u2019entente avec Manuvie.\n[3] Un \u00e9change de courriels a suivi entre la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e ainsi qu\u2019entre l\u2019intim\u00e9e et l\u2019avocat qui repr\u00e9sente la plaignante dans le cadre d\u2019une autre proc\u00e9dure judiciaire. La plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e sont parties \u00e0 une affaire civile \u00e9troitement li\u00e9e \u00e0 la question dont est saisi le Tribunal.\n[4] La plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne sont pas parvenues \u00e0 s\u2019entendre relativement au projet d\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9, et le 18 ao\u00fbt 2017, soit la date limite que j\u2019avais fix\u00e9e pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9e divulgue l\u2019entente avec Manuvie, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9.\n[5] Le 6 septembre 2017, nous avons tenu une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance (la CTGI) dans le but d\u2019entendre la plaidoirie de chaque partie relativement \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate.\n[6] La Commission, bien qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience, a pris part \u00e0 la CTGI, mais ne s\u2019est pas oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9.\n[7] Pendant la CTGI, Mme Anita Shearer, directrice, R\u00e9mun\u00e9ration globale pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e et, \u00e0 ce titre, responsable de l\u2019application de l\u2019entente avec Manuvie, a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9e par l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur ce document et son contenu. La plaignante et la Commission ont eu l\u2019occasion de poser des questions \u00e0 Mme Shearer.\n[8] Mme Shearer a confirm\u00e9 que l\u2019entente avec Manuvie, l\u2019objet de la requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9, \u00e9tait une entente commerciale entre Manuvie et l\u2019intim\u00e9e, d\u00e9crivant notamment les avantages sociaux des employ\u00e9s admissibles. L\u2019entente contient des renseignements financiers et commerciaux de nature confidentielle et d\u00e9licate qui, s\u2019ils \u00e9taient divulgu\u00e9s au public, causeraient, selon Mme Shearer, un pr\u00e9judice injustifi\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e autant qu\u2019\u00e0 Manuvie.\n[9] Mme Shearer a \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9 que l\u2019entente avec Manuvie contenait une disposition en mati\u00e8re de confidentialit\u00e9 exigeant que les parties pr\u00e9servent la confidentialit\u00e9 de certains renseignements, dont la divulgation publique constituerait une violation de l\u2019entente.\n[10] La plaignante avait quelques questions pour Mme Shearer. \u00c0 la suite de l\u2019une des questions de la plaignante, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a accept\u00e9 de lui remettre une copie de la convention collective, qui \u00e9tablit la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et les avantages sociaux. La Commission n\u2019avait aucune question pour Mme Shearer.\n[11] \u00c0 la suite du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Shearer, j\u2019ai entendu la plaidoirie de l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[12] J\u2019ai \u00e9galement entendu les observations de la plaignante, mais \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que celle\u2011ci devait quitter la CTGI en raison d\u2019un conflit d\u2019horaire, j\u2019ai propos\u00e9 que la plaignante puisse avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des observations \u00e9crites avant le 13 septembre 2017. Toutes les parties \u00e9taient d\u2019accord. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la Commission ne s\u2019opposait pas \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, elle a choisi de ne pas pr\u00e9senter d\u2019argumentation \u00e9crite. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa r\u00e9ponse aux observations de la plaignante le 15 septembre 2017.\nII. Analyse\n[13] En vertu de l\u2019article 52 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP), le Tribunal peut, dans certaines circonstances prescrites, rendre toute ordonnance pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction.\nA. Le moment du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9\n[14] La plaignante soul\u00e8ve la question du moment du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Elle fait valoir que la question de la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019entente avec Manuvie devrait seulement \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience, dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 le document serait invoqu\u00e9 par la plaignante et produit en preuve devant le Tribunal. Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 cet argument.\n[15] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a tent\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir le consentement de la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 propos\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019elle lui a envoy\u00e9 un projet de l\u2019ordonnance. La d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de soumettre la requ\u00eate au Tribunal est intervenue seulement apr\u00e8s n\u2019avoir re\u00e7u aucune r\u00e9ponse de la plaignante et parce que la date du 18 ao\u00fbt 2017\u2014 la date limite que j\u2019avais impos\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 la divulgation de l\u2019entente avec Manuvie \u2014 approchait rapidement.\n[16] Par ailleurs, je souscris \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate que le Tribunal a rendue dans l\u2019affaire Eadie c. MTS Inc., 2013 TCDP 5 (Eadie), dont le paragraphe 12 est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n[12] Je comprends la position de la Commission, selon laquelle le Tribunal est mieux plac\u00e9 pour trancher ces questions de confidentialit\u00e9 au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu\u2019elles se pr\u00e9senteront au cours de l\u2019audience, mais je suis d\u2019avis que le fait de circonscrire dans une ordonnance la fa\u00e7on de d\u00e9signer des documents comme confidentiels contribuera \u00e0 la bonne marche de l\u2019instance. [\u2026]\n[17] Je partage l\u2019avis de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon lequel il serait contraire \u00e0 la logique de d\u00e9clarer un document confidentiel pendant une audience apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9 sans aucune forme de protection durant le processus de divulgation.\n[18] J\u2019ajouterais m\u00eame que je pr\u00e9f\u00e9rerais, au contraire, d\u00e9clarer un document confidentiel durant le processus de divulgation et changer sa d\u00e9signation \u00e0 l\u2019audience, si une objection est formul\u00e9e et qu\u2019un argument convaincant m\u2019est alors pr\u00e9sent\u00e9. Il est possible de renverser une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9, mais il est plus difficile d\u2019annuler la d\u00e9cision d\u2019en autoriser la divulgation.\n[19] Pour ces motifs, j\u2019estime que la requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en temps opportun par l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nB. La d\u00e9signation d\u2019un document comme \u00e9tant confidentiel\n[20] Les arguments que l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir pour que la divulgation de l\u2019entente avec Manuvie soit vis\u00e9e par une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 reposent sur les motifs suivants :\nemp\u00eacher la violation d\u2019un contrat entre l\u2019intim\u00e9e et Manuvie;\n\u00e9viter que l\u2019intim\u00e9e et Manuvie ne subissent un pr\u00e9judice, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le document contient des renseignements financiers qui, s\u2019ils \u00e9taient divulgu\u00e9s, nuiraient \u00e0 leur position concurrentielle; et\nminimiser le risque d\u2019utilisation \u00e0 des fins accessoires.\n[21] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9montr\u00e9, au moyen du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Shearer, que l\u2019entente avec Manuvie contenait des renseignements financiers qui, s\u2019ils \u00e9taient divulgu\u00e9s, pourraient nuire \u00e0 la position concurrentielle de Manuvie. Le t\u00e9moignage a \u00e9galement \u00e9tabli que l\u2019entente avec Manuvie contenait une disposition en mati\u00e8re de confidentialit\u00e9 exigeant que les parties pr\u00e9servent la confidentialit\u00e9 de certains renseignements, dont la divulgation publique constituerait une violation de l\u2019entente.\n[22] Ces caract\u00e9ristiques de l\u2019entente avec Manuvie correspondent aux cat\u00e9gories \u00e9tablies par le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate Eadie, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, concernant les circonstances o\u00f9 un document peut \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme confidentiel par une partie. Je me reporte ici au paragraphe 14 de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate :\n[14] [\u2026] s\u2019ils font partie d\u2019une des cat\u00e9gories suivantes :\ni. Les renseignements qui rel\u00e8vent du secret commercial ;\nii. Les renseignements financiers, commerciaux, scientifiques ou techniques confidentiels qui sont syst\u00e9matiquement trait\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re confidentielle par la personne qui les a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s ;\niii. Les renseignements qui, s\u2019ils \u00e9taient communiqu\u00e9s, pourraient vraisemblablement\n1. \u00eatre source de pertes ou de gains financiers importants pour une personne ;\n2. nuire \u00e0 la position concurrentielle d\u2019une personne ;\n3. influer sur les n\u00e9gociations contractuelles ou de toute autre nature men\u00e9es par une personne.\n[23] Par cons\u00e9quent, les caract\u00e9ristiques de l\u2019entente avec Manuvie sont vis\u00e9es par l\u2019article 52(1)c) de la LCDP, qui conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir de d\u00e9clarer un document confidentiel \u00ab [s\u2019il] y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions personnelles ou autres de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher leur divulgation dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des personnes concern\u00e9es ou dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique \u00bb.\nC. L\u2019engagement implicite de confidentialit\u00e9\n[24] La plaignante fait aussi valoir qu\u2019une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire et que la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019engagement implicite de confidentialit\u00e9, \u00e0 laquelle toutes les parties sont assujetties lorsque des documents sont divulgu\u00e9s, est suffisante pour prot\u00e9ger l\u2019entente avec Manuvie. La plaignante semble \u00e9galement affirmer que l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 l\u2019emp\u00eacherait de faire appel \u00e0 un avocat.\n[25] Je ne partage pas l\u2019avis de la plaignante. J\u2019ai entendu le t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et pris connaissance des observations \u00e9crites de toutes les parties, et j\u2019estime que la \u00ab r\u00e8gle de l\u2019engagement implicite \u00bb ne suffirait pas pour prot\u00e9ger le document contre le risque qu\u2019il soit utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 des fins accessoires dans un autre litige ni contre le risque que les renseignements confidentiels qu\u2019il contient soient divulgu\u00e9s au public. Je rel\u00e8ve les remarques que le Tribunal a faites dans l\u2019affaire Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada (section locale 70396) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Mus\u00e9e canadien des civilisations, 2004 TCDP 38, au paragraphe 12 :\n[12] Les parties conviennent que la \u00ab r\u00e8gle de l\u2019engagement implicite \u00bb s\u2019applique \u00e0 tous les documents ou renseignements divulgu\u00e9s par le Mus\u00e9e. La justification de cette r\u00e8gle est qu\u2019une partie \u00e0 un litige devrait avoir le plein droit \u00e0 une divulgation et \u00e0 un examen des renseignements pertinents, y compris de ceux qui sont confidentiels, comme cela est n\u00e9cessaire pour trancher \u00e9quitablement l\u2019affaire. Cependant, une partie ne peut pas utiliser ce droit \u00e0 la divulgation pour une fin autre que le litige. S\u2019il existe un v\u00e9ritable risque d\u2019une telle utilisation en d\u00e9pit de l\u2019engagement, des restrictions additionnelles peuvent \u00eatre impos\u00e9es quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle les renseignements divulgu\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s. (Voir Zellers Inc. c. Venta Investments Ltd. [1998] O.J. no 2118, (C.J.O.); Reichmann c. Toronto Life Publishing Co. [1990], 44 C.P.C. (2d) 206, aux pages 207 \u00e0 210 (H.C.J.); Alberta (Treasury Branches) c. Leahy [2000] A.J. no 993, aux pages 54 et 55 (B.R.).\n[soulignement ajout\u00e9]\n[26] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e sont parties \u00e0 une autre affaire devant un tribunal civil, il est important que les deux affaires soient instruites en fonction de leurs r\u00e8gles respectives et distinctes en mati\u00e8re de divulgation. Par cons\u00e9quent, si la plaignante d\u00e9sire invoquer l\u2019entente avec Manuvie dans l\u2019autre dossier, elle devrait en faire la demande conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles en mati\u00e8re de divulgation de ce tribunal civil.\n[27] Enfin, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 n\u2019emp\u00eacherait pas la plaignante de faire appel \u00e0 un avocat, tout comme elle n\u2019emp\u00eacherait pas la divulgation des renseignements \u00e0 l\u2019avocat dont la plaignante a retenu les services dans le cadre de l\u2019instruction de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nIII. Conclusion\n[28] Je suis convaincue que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9tabli que la divulgation du document sans aucune forme de protection de la confidentialit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente un risque s\u00e9rieux de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher la divulgation l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019\u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 52(1)c) de la LCDP.\n[29] J\u2019ordonne que l\u2019entente avec Manuvie soit d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme confidentielle au titre de l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP et que les r\u00e8gles suivantes s\u2019appliquent :\nque l\u2019intim\u00e9e divulgue l\u2019entente avec Manuvie \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 la Commission, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 leurs avocats respectifs, au plus tard le 11 octobre 2017;\nque la plaignante et la Commission ne divulguent l\u2019entente avec Manuvie \u00e0 quiconque sans le consentement pr\u00e9alable du Tribunal;\nque l\u2019entente avec Manuvie conserve le statut confidentiel que lui accorde le Tribunal jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que celui\u2011ci en d\u00e9cide autrement, y compris pendant la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019instance devant le Tribunal ou de toute r\u00e9vision judiciaire ou appel connexe, et apr\u00e8s que le jugement d\u00e9finitif aura \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9;\nque toute partie souhaitant utiliser l\u2019entente avec Manuvie pendant l\u2019audience informe le Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019avance et que celui\u2011ci puisse alors d\u00e9cider, \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion et conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP, de proc\u00e9der aux d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations \u00e0 huis clos;\nque la plaignante restitue l\u2019entente avec Manuvie \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e apr\u00e8s que le jugement d\u00e9finitif aura \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu, une fois tous les recours aux m\u00e9canismes de r\u00e9vision judiciaire ou d\u2019appel \u00e9puis\u00e9s;\nque la Commission, en sa qualit\u00e9 d\u2019organisme gouvernemental, prot\u00e8ge la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019entente avec Manuvie, conform\u00e9ment aux politiques et aux directives gouvernementales applicables en mati\u00e8re de conservation et de protection des renseignements exclusifs confidentiels. Subsidiairement, la Commission peut restituer l\u2019entente avec Manuvie \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e aux m\u00eames conditions que celles de la plaignante;\nenfin, que l\u2019entente avec Manuvie et que tout autre document confidentiel en la possession du Tribunal soient mis sous scell\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la pratique du Tribunal et ne soient divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 quiconque.\nIV. La demande de divulgation d\u2019autres documents\n[30] Les objections \u00e9crites de la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 contiennent aussi une demande de divulgation d\u2019autres documents qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment.\n[31] Les trois premiers documents sont des documents auxquels le t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Anita Shearer, a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pendant la CTGI comme des documents distincts de l\u2019entente avec Manuvie (l\u2019entente-cadre), mais qui en font n\u00e9anmoins partie. Mme Shearer a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de r\u00e9gimes de services de gestion seulement et qu\u2019ils portaient sur 1) les droits aux prestations de soins de sant\u00e9 et de soins dentaires pour les employ\u00e9s non syndiqu\u00e9s; 2) les r\u00e9gimes assur\u00e9s; 3) les r\u00e9gimes d\u2019assurance\u2011invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e.\n[32] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Shearer, les autres documents sont deux documents distincts, l\u2019un \u00e9tant intitul\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab Aper\u00e7u des r\u00e9gimes \u00bb, pour les employ\u00e9s syndiqu\u00e9s, et l\u2019autre [traduction] \u00ab Aper\u00e7u des r\u00e9gimes flexibles \u00bb, pour les employ\u00e9s non syndiqu\u00e9s.\n[33] Bien que ces cinq documents auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre demand\u00e9s par la plaignante au moyen d\u2019une demande de divulgation additionnelle distincte, dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat d\u2019une instruction rapide et compte tenu des arguments subsidiaires de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, j\u2019accueille la demande de la plaignante, mais j\u2019ordonne que la divulgation soit assujettie aux m\u00eames conditions que celles susmentionn\u00e9es relativement \u00e0 l\u2019entente avec Manuvie.\nV. Le d\u00e9lai suppl\u00e9mentaire pour permettre \u00e0 la plaignante de pr\u00e9senter sa r\u00e9ponse\n[34] La plaignante demande un d\u00e9lai suppl\u00e9mentaire pour pr\u00e9senter son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions en r\u00e9plique. J\u2019accueille la demande de la plaignante et je lui donne jusqu\u2019au 10 novembre 2017 pour le faire.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAnie Perrault\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nLe\n4 octobre 2017\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal :\nT2126\/4215\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nNicole Grace Valenti c.

La plainte 1\nII. Les faits 2\nIII. Les observations 4\nIV. La d\u00e9cision 7\nI. La plainte\n[1] La plainte est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes (les FAC ou l\u2019intim\u00e9e) au motif que c\u2019est une pratique discriminatoire de la part des FAC que d\u2019appliquer une politique selon laquelle les psychiatres employ\u00e9s par les FAC doivent \u00eatre des sp\u00e9cialistes agr\u00e9\u00e9s par le Coll\u00e8ge royal des m\u00e9decins et chirurgiens du Canada (le CRMCC). S\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6. (la Loi ou la LCDP), le plaignant, le Dr Arthur Keith, a formul\u00e9 une all\u00e9gation selon laquelle il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur son origine nationale.\n[2] Le plaignant, un m\u00e9decin n\u00e9 aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, a re\u00e7u toute sa formation en m\u00e9decine et sa formation sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e en psychiatrie aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique (\u00c9.\u2011U.).\n[3] Le plaignant affirme que cette politique d\u2019embauche des FAC emp\u00eache la candidature de sp\u00e9cialistes pleinement qualifi\u00e9s d\u2019origine \u00e9trang\u00e8re d\u2019\u00eatre prise en consid\u00e9ration et le met en situation de victime d\u2019exclusion discriminatoire de concours ouvrant droit \u00e0 des possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi, situation pr\u00e9judiciable en ce qui le concerne.\n[4] L\u2019intim\u00e9e estime qu\u2019en adoptant la norme du CRMCC, les FAC s\u2019assurent que ses psychiatres r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 une norme de comp\u00e9tence en psychiatrie reconnue dans tout le pays et que cette norme constitue donc une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. Elle nie que cette exigence soit discriminatoire.\n[5] Le plaignant fait valoir que les FAC ont adopt\u00e9 une norme d\u2019embauche (titre d\u2019associ\u00e9 du CRMCC) qui entra\u00eene une discrimination au sens de la LCDP.\n[6] En cas d\u2019absence de preuve prima facie de discrimination directe ou par suite d\u2019un effet pr\u00e9judiciable de la part de l\u2019employeur r\u00e9gi par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, il ne sera pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner l\u2019affaire plus avant [1] .\nII. Les faits\n[7] Le plaignant, le Dr Arthur Keith, est un citoyen am\u00e9ricain ayant re\u00e7u sa formation en m\u00e9decine aux \u00c9.\u2011U., d\u2019abord comme praticien g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et ensuite comme psychiatre qualifi\u00e9 aux \u00c9.\u2011U., apr\u00e8s avoir termin\u00e9 son programme de r\u00e9sidence en 1983 [2] .\n[8] Le Dr Keith, n\u00e9 en 1950, a eu une carri\u00e8re impressionnante dans l\u2019arm\u00e9e am\u00e9ricaine en servant comme membre des U.S. Army Special Forces. Ensuite, il a fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9cole de m\u00e9decine gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la bourse d\u2019\u00e9tudes en m\u00e9decine qu\u2019il a re\u00e7ue de l\u2019U.S. Air Force (l\u2019USAF).\n[9] Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e9decin au sein de l\u2019USAF dans diverses organisations de 1979 \u00e0 1986, apr\u00e8s avoir termin\u00e9 sa r\u00e9sidence en psychiatrie en 1983. Il a obtenu volontairement l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation de sp\u00e9cialiste en psychiatrie en 1987 aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (l\u2019ABPN) [3] .\n[10] Pendant qu\u2019il r\u00e9sidait aux \u00c9.\u2011U., en 1989, le Dr Keith a demand\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre reconnu au Canada comme sp\u00e9cialiste en psychiatrie aupr\u00e8s du CRMCC.\n[11] Au moment de solliciter cette reconnaissance aupr\u00e8s du CRMCC, il s\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore install\u00e9 au Canada, pas plus qu\u2019il n\u2019avait postul\u00e9 un emploi au sein des FAC.\n[12] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les titres de comp\u00e9tence du plaignant et reconnu la majeure partie de sa formation am\u00e9ricaine, le CRMCC a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de reconna\u00eetre sa sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9, pourvu que le Dr Keith r\u00e9ussisse \u00e0 un examen \u00e9crit, suive un programme de r\u00e9sidence de six mois en psychiatrie infantile et r\u00e9ussisse \u00e0 un examen oral en psychiatrie.\n[13] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 que les processus d\u2019accr\u00e9ditation de l\u2019ABPN et du CRMCC \u00e9taient semblables, consistant en un examen \u00e9crit et un examen oral [traduction] \u00ab pratiquement identiques, ne comportant aucune diff\u00e9rence notable \u00bb.\n[14] En 1990, le Dr Keith a pass\u00e9 l\u2019examen \u00e9crit du CRMCC, mais sans succ\u00e8s. Il a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 cet examen par la suite, en 1992. Toutefois, il n\u2019a jamais r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 l\u2019examen oral, qu\u2019il a subi \u00e0 trois reprises, dont la derni\u00e8re remonte \u00e0 1993. Apr\u00e8s la troisi\u00e8me tentative infructueuse, il n\u2019\u00e9tait plus admissible \u00e0 passer l\u2019examen.\n[15] Pour passer l\u2019examen oral une autre fois, le Dr Keith devait pr\u00e9senter une demande aupr\u00e8s du Comit\u00e9 des titres du CRMCC afin d\u2019\u00eatre de nouveau admissible aux examens, ce qu\u2019il a refus\u00e9 de faire.\n[16] Au moment o\u00f9 le Dr Keith a formul\u00e9 sa plainte, tous les m\u00e9decins, quelles que soient leur origine nationale ou leur formation, devaient passer les examens normalis\u00e9s du CRMCC pour obtenir l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation de sp\u00e9cialiste.\n[17] Le Dr Keith, s\u2019\u00e9tant install\u00e9 en Ontario en 2004, a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de reconnaissance \u00e0 l\u2019Ordre des m\u00e9decins et chirurgiens de l\u2019Ontario (l\u2019OMCO), qui d\u00e9livrait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque un certificat attestant la qualit\u00e9 de sp\u00e9cialiste \u00e0 ceux qui \u00e9taient qualifi\u00e9s par l\u2019OMCO, mais qui n\u2019avaient pas re\u00e7u l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du CRMCC. Bien que l\u2019attestation de l\u2019OMCO f\u00fbt reconnue dans bon nombre de provinces, elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas reconnue uniform\u00e9ment au Canada, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du CRMCC. En 2007, l\u2019OMCO a reconnu le Dr Keith comme sp\u00e9cialiste en psychiatrie.\n[18] Le statut de sp\u00e9cialiste aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019OMCO n\u2019\u00e9quivaut pas au titre d\u2019associ\u00e9 du CRMCC. Le registre de l\u2019OMCO fournit des renseignements \u00e0 propos des m\u00e9decins de l\u2019Ontario, notamment si le m\u00e9decin est un sp\u00e9cialiste et l\u2019organisme ayant accr\u00e9dit\u00e9 la sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 du m\u00e9decin.\n[19] Pendant toute la p\u00e9riode pertinente, les services de soins de sant\u00e9 pour les FAC (MDN) \u00e9taient fournis par Calian Ltd., qui, \u00e0 titre de tiers ind\u00e9pendant, faisait de la publicit\u00e9 pour recruter des m\u00e9decins \u00e0 divers postes et \u00e0 divers endroits, comme l\u2019exigeaient les FAC.\n[20] Les normes de comp\u00e9tence des candidats embauch\u00e9s par Calian Ltd. \u00e9taient fix\u00e9es par les FAC.\n[21] Comme l\u2019exigeaient les FAC, Calian Ltd. faisait de la publicit\u00e9 pour attirer des psychiatres aux bases des FAC \u00e0 Cold Lake, en Alberta, et \u00e0 Petawawa, en Ontario. L\u2019entreprise indiquait dans sa publicit\u00e9 que l\u2019exigence obligatoire pour occuper un poste \u00e9tait l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du CRMCC.\n[22] En 2008, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait au courant de l\u2019exigence de l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du CRMCC, le plaignant s\u2019est port\u00e9 candidat aupr\u00e8s de Calian Ltd. aux postes de psychiatre dans ces localit\u00e9s et a postul\u00e9 officiellement au poste de Petawawa.\n[23] Comme Calian Ltd. a \u00e9t\u00e9 par la suite inform\u00e9e par les FAC que l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du CRMCC \u00e9tait une exigence pour l\u2019admission aux postes de psychiatre sur les bases des FAC, la demande du plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e.\n[24] En 2005, l\u2019OMCO a mis en \u0153uvre un processus visant \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre les sp\u00e9cialistes selon une [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9valuation fond\u00e9e sur la pratique \u00bb (la voie d\u2019\u00e9valuation) pour les sp\u00e9cialistes form\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger et qui ont pratiqu\u00e9 leur sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 pendant un certain nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es. Cette m\u00e9thode de reconnaissance des sp\u00e9cialistes en Ontario n\u2019est pas normalis\u00e9e dans toutes les dix provinces du Canada.\n[25] Bien que le CRMCC ait adopt\u00e9 la voie d\u2019\u00e9valuation par la pratique en 2011 comme m\u00e9thode de rechange \u00e0 la voie d\u2019examen, ladite voie d\u2019\u00e9valuation ne d\u00e9bouchait pas sur l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du CRMCC lorsque le Dr Keith a postul\u00e9; il ne restait que la voie d\u2019examen.\nIII. Les observations\n[26] La plainte est fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 7b) de la LCDP, libell\u00e9 comme suit :\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\n[27] L\u2019article 3(1) de la LCDP dispose que l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique constitue un motif de distinction illicite. Comme il est n\u00e9 et a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 aux \u00c9.\u2011U., le plaignant assimile son lieu de formation \u00e0 son origine nationale.\n[28] Le Dr Keith affirme avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination au sens de la LCDP, au motif que les FAC ont refus\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuer sa candidature aux deux postes de psychiatre \u00e0 Petawawa et\/ou \u00e0 Cold Lake, en Alberta, parce qu\u2019elles exigent que les candidats soient accr\u00e9dit\u00e9s par le CRMCC. Cette exigence d\u00e9savantage les m\u00e9decins form\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger o\u00f9 l\u2019\u00e9ducation est souvent consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une extension de l\u2019origine nationale. Bitonti v. College of Physicians & Surgeons of British Columbia [1999] B.C.H.R.T.D. No. 60 (Bitonti).\n[29] Se fondant sur les d\u00e9cisions o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que le lieu d\u2019\u00e9ducation \u00e9quivalait au lieu d\u2019origine ou constituait une extension du lieu d\u2019origine, le Dr Keith affirme qu\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\n[30] L\u2019intim\u00e9e se fonde sur l\u2019article 15(1)a) de la LCDP pour justifier que l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du CRMCC est une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e des FAC; aux termes de l\u2019article 15(2), r\u00e9pondre aux besoins du Dr Keith constitue une contrainte excessive pour les FAC, puisqu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas comp\u00e9tence pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019\u00e9quivalence de l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation de l\u2019OMCO avec celle du CRMCC.\n[31] Le plaignant et l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat de principe Moore c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61 (Moore) pour \u00e9tablir le crit\u00e8re de discrimination prima facie.\n[32] Au paragraphe 33 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, la Cour supr\u00eame a indiqu\u00e9 que, pour \u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de discrimination, les plaignants doivent d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019ils poss\u00e8dent une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par la LCDP et :\n[33] [\u2026] qu\u2019ils ont subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable relativement au service concern\u00e9 et que la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable. Une fois la discrimination \u00e9tablie \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a alors le fardeau de justifier la conduite ou la pratique suivant le r\u00e9gime d\u2019exemptions pr\u00e9vu par les lois sur les droits de la personne. Si la conduite ou pratique ne peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e, le tribunal conclura \u00e0 l\u2019existence de la discrimination.\n[33] Le plaignant affirme que le fait d\u2019\u00eatre n\u00e9 aux \u00c9.\u2011U. et d\u2019avoir obtenu son dipl\u00f4me en m\u00e9decine et sa sp\u00e9cialisation en psychiatrie aux \u00c9.\u2011U. r\u00e9pond au premier volet du crit\u00e8re pour \u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de discrimination, se fondant sur l\u2019affaire Bitonti, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e.\n[34] La th\u00e8se de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle le lieu de formation peut \u00eatre un indicateur du \u00ab lieu d\u2019origine \u00bb peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e uniquement dans des cas o\u00f9 des exigences plus s\u00e9v\u00e8res en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accr\u00e9ditation ou de permis sont impos\u00e9es en raison d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ses n\u00e9gatives sur le lieu d\u2019origine de la personne, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Fazil v. National Dental Examining Board of Canada, 2014 TDPO 1326 (Fazil), aux paragraphes 39 et 40.\n[35] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la d\u00e9cision Bitonti doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e en parall\u00e8le avec l\u2019arr\u00eat Gould c. Yukon Order of Pioneers, [1996] 1 RCS 571 (Gould). L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation selon laquelle le lieu d\u2019origine inclut le lieu de formation est trop lib\u00e9rale. La Cour a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019une telle interpr\u00e9tation large reviendrait \u00e0 r\u00e9\u00e9crire la Loi.\n[36] Le Dr Keith fait valoir que les m\u00e9decins form\u00e9s aux \u00c9.\u2011U. sont d\u00e9savantag\u00e9s dans les examens du CRMCC et que comme les m\u00e9decins form\u00e9s aux \u00c9.\u2011U. sont pour la plupart n\u00e9s aux \u00c9.\u2011U., la discrimination r\u00e9sulte de l\u2019origine nationale.\n[37] L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que [traduction] \u00ab le bon sens veut \u00e9galement que le lieu de formation ne puisse automatiquement \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 l\u2019\u201corigine nationale\u201d \u00bb. L\u2019intim\u00e9e pose une question : si le plaignant avait choisi de suivre ses \u00e9tudes de m\u00e9decine au Canada, son \u00ab origine nationale \u00bb serait\u2011elle devenue \u00ab canadienne \u00bb? Le lieu de formation ne peut automatiquement \u00eatre un indicateur de l\u2019origine nationale.\n[38] Le plaignant fait valoir que ses titres de comp\u00e9tence am\u00e9ricains l\u2019ont d\u00e9savantag\u00e9 et qu\u2019il a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination. Dans le cadre de son contre\u2011interrogatoire par l\u2019avocat du plaignant, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du CRMCC a affirm\u00e9 que fr\u00e9quenter une \u00e9cole de m\u00e9decine canadienne \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019une des meilleures fa\u00e7ons \u00bb de se pr\u00e9parer aux examens du CRMCC. Mais cela ne diminue pas implicitement la valeur de la formation am\u00e9ricaine du plaignant.\n[39] L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que les \u00e9tudes aux \u00c9.\u2011U. du Dr Keith ne l\u2019ont pas d\u00e9savantag\u00e9 par rapport aux m\u00e9decins form\u00e9s au Canada, s\u2019appuyant sur la d\u00e9cision Keith v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario [2013], OHRTD No. 1646 (Keith-OMCO), o\u00f9 le plaignant a contest\u00e9 sans succ\u00e8s la distinction \u00e9tablie par l\u2019OMCO sur son site Web entre un sp\u00e9cialiste de l\u2019OMCO et un sp\u00e9cialiste du CRMCC, au motif qu\u2019elle constituait de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le lieu d\u2019origine, puisque la plupart des sp\u00e9cialistes de l\u2019OMCO sont n\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. Le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario (le TDPO) a conclu que l\u2019on accordait parfois une plus grande valeur aux titres de comp\u00e9tence am\u00e9ricains, sinon une valeur \u00e9gale aux titres canadiens.\n[40] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant que plus de 90 p. 100 des sp\u00e9cialistes en Ontario sont accr\u00e9dit\u00e9s par le CRMCC, m\u00eame s\u2019ils sont n\u00e9s ou form\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger.\nIV. La d\u00e9cision\n[41] Comme l\u2019exige la LCDP, le plaignant doit d\u2019abord \u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur les motifs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la Loi pour d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019exigence des FAC relative \u00e0 l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du CRMCC est une preuve prima facie de discrimination par suite d\u2019un effet pr\u00e9judiciable.\n[42] Le paragraphe 73 de la d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente Mihaly v. The Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta, 2016 ABQB 61 (Mihaly), \u00e9nonce ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nSelon le crit\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, pour \u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de discrimination par suite d\u2019un effet pr\u00e9judiciable, les plaignants doivent d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019ils poss\u00e8dent une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, qu\u2019ils ont subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable et que la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable.\n[43] Comme le Dr Keith est un Am\u00e9ricain n\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Canada, il pourrait invoquer que son lieu d\u2019origine est un motif de distinction illicite. La discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le lieu d\u2019origine est interdite par la LCDP. Le Dr Keith fait valoir que sa formation en m\u00e9decine aux \u00c9.\u2011U. est une extension accept\u00e9e de son \u00ab lieu d\u2019origine \u00bb.\n[44] Je suis d\u2019accord pour dire que le lieu d\u2019origine d\u2019une personne peut bien servir de motif pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence de discrimination envers les travailleurs et envers la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et que cette discrimination est interdite par la LCDP. Toutefois, je ne souscris pas \u00e0 la th\u00e9orie selon laquelle le seul fait d\u2019\u00eatre n\u00e9 et d\u2019avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Canada entra\u00eene une discrimination par suite d\u2019un effet pr\u00e9judiciable et est donc automatiquement prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par la LCDP.\n[45] Bien que l\u2019extension du \u00ab lieu d\u2019origine \u00bb consistant \u00e0 inclure le lieu de formation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger puisse convenir dans certains cas, comme lorsqu\u2019il y a lieu de reconna\u00eetre un dipl\u00f4me provenant d\u2019une universit\u00e9 du tiers monde, je conviens que l\u2019extension automatique de la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab lieu d\u2019origine \u00bb n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u2019intention de la d\u00e9cision Bitonti, et la conclusion exprim\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Fazil est l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019il convient d\u2019adopter. Le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) ne disposait d\u2019aucune preuve indiquant que le processus d\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du CRMCC \u00e9tait plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re simplement parce que le Dr Keith est n\u00e9 et a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 aux \u00c9.\u2011U.\n[46] Je souscris \u00e0 l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Grover v. Alberta (Human Rights Commission), [1996] AJ No. 667 (C.B.R. Alb.), et confirm\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat [1968] AJ No 924 (C.A. Alb.). \u00c0 la question de savoir si le lieu d\u2019\u00e9ducation constitue une extension du \u00ab lieu d\u2019origine \u00bb, la Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aux paragraphes 47 et 48 que [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019expression \u201clieu d\u2019origine\u201d doit recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation juste et lib\u00e9rale, mais fid\u00e8le. Cette expression \u2013 lieu d\u2019origine d\u2019une personne \u2013 ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9largie pour inclure le lieu o\u00f9 la personne a re\u00e7u son doctorat. \u00bb\n[47] Je ne puis convenir que la politique des FAC exigeant l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du CRMCC \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur des suppositions discriminatoires, et le Tribunal ne dispose d\u2019aucune preuve que l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation obtenue par le Dr Keith aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019ABPN \u00e9tait inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle du CRMCC, ce qui aurait par cons\u00e9quent cr\u00e9\u00e9 l\u2019extension du \u00ab lieu d\u2019origine \u00bb pour y inclure le \u00ab lieu de formation \u00bb. Le Dr Keith a affirm\u00e9 que les examens de l\u2019ABPN et du CRMCC \u00e9taient essentiellement similaires.\n[48] En outre, si le lieu de formation peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 comme indicateur du lieu d\u2019origine, il faudrait donc mettre l\u2019accent sur le lieu de formation pour \u00e9largir la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab lieu d\u2019origine \u00bb pour pouvoir y inclure le lieu de formation. Le plaignant n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve pour d\u00e9montrer que les m\u00e9decins form\u00e9s aux \u00c9.\u2011U. sont pour la plupart d\u2019origine am\u00e9ricaine, ce qui signifierait que les m\u00e9decins form\u00e9s aux \u00c9.\u2011U. sont soit d\u2019origine am\u00e9ricaine, soit form\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger.\n[49] J\u2019estime que l\u2019affaire Mihaly est la plus utile en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. M. Mihaly est n\u00e9 et a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 dans l\u2019ancienne Tch\u00e9coslovaquie. Il a obtenu une ma\u00eetrise en science avec sp\u00e9cialisation en technologie des combustibles et de l\u2019\u00e9nergie thermique de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 technique slovaque, \u00e0 Bratislava, ainsi qu\u2019un certificat en g\u00e9nie de la corrosion de l\u2019Institut de technologie chimique \u00e0 Prague, en 1981 (Mihaly, au paragraphe 40).\n[50] Apr\u00e8s \u00eatre venu s\u2019installer au Canada, M. Mihaly a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande pour \u00eatre membre de l\u2019Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta (l\u2019APEGA) et, malgr\u00e9 son degr\u00e9 de scolarit\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 contraint de passer le National Professional Practice Exam (le NPPE). Tout comme le Dr Keith, il a \u00e9chou\u00e9 aux examens \u00e0 trois reprises et a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission des droits de la personne de l\u2019Alberta, au titre de l\u2019Alberta Human Rights Act, RSA 299, c A-35.5, dans laquelle il pr\u00e9tendait que l\u2019APEGA avait fait preuve de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur son lieu d\u2019origine lorsqu\u2019elle lui avait refus\u00e9 le statut d\u2019ing\u00e9nieur professionnel.\n[51] Les FAC ont oblig\u00e9 tous les postulants en m\u00e9decine \u00e0 passer les examens du CRMCC et \u00e0 obtenir l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du CRMCC. Comme dans l\u2019affaire Mihaly, le plaignant n\u2019a fourni aucune preuve convaincante d\u00e9montrant que le d\u00e9savantage qu\u2019il aurait pu avoir dans l\u2019obtention de son accr\u00e9ditation du CRMCC \u00e9tait attribuable \u00e0 son origine nationale.\n[52] Dans la d\u00e9cision Mihaly, la Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit, au paragraphe 106 :\n[traduction]\nLa Cour n\u2019a pas conclu, et rien ne lui permettait de conclure, que l\u2019exigence de passer le NPPE constituait de la discrimination par suite d\u2019un effet pr\u00e9judiciable. Tous les postulants sont tenus de passer le NPPE, peu importe l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 ils ont fait leurs \u00e9tudes. Bien que la preuve indique que M. Mihaly a \u00e9chou\u00e9 \u00e0 cet examen \u00e0 trois reprises, rien ne d\u00e9montre que cet \u00e9chec \u00e9tait d\u2019une quelconque fa\u00e7on li\u00e9e \u00e0 son lieu d\u2019origine. Par exemple, rien n\u2019indique que l\u2019exigence de passer le NPPE emp\u00eache de mani\u00e8re disproportionn\u00e9e les dipl\u00f4m\u00e9s \u00e9trangers en g\u00e9nie d\u2019\u00eatre membres de l\u2019APEGA.\n[53] Les FAC exigent que tous les m\u00e9decins, qu\u2019ils soient n\u00e9s au Canada ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, soient accr\u00e9dit\u00e9s par le CRMCC. \u00c0 mon sens, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a eu raison d\u2019affirmer que rien ne d\u00e9montrait que l\u2019exigence d\u2019obtenir l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du CRMCC \u00e9tait d\u2019une quelconque fa\u00e7on li\u00e9e au lieu d\u2019origine du plaignant. Que ce dernier e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 Canadien, Am\u00e9ricain ou autre, les FAC aurait exig\u00e9 la m\u00eame qualification.\n[54] Je ne dispose d\u2019aucune preuve convaincante indiquant que le Dr Keith a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment de toute autre partie en raison de ses qualifications scolaires et du fait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait Am\u00e9ricain. Je ne crois pas que son lieu d\u2019origine a eu un effet pr\u00e9judiciable sur sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 passer les examens du CRMCC.\n[55] Aucun motif convaincant ne me permet de conclure que l\u2019exigence de passer les examens du CRMCC constituait une discrimination par suite d\u2019un effet pr\u00e9judiciable de la part des FAC. Comme dans l\u2019affaire Mihaly, au paragraphe 106, [traduction] \u00ab [b]ien que la preuve indique que M. Mihaly a \u00e9chou\u00e9 [au NPPE] \u00e0 trois reprises, rien ne d\u00e9montre que cet \u00e9chec \u00e9tait d\u2019une quelconque fa\u00e7on li\u00e9e \u00e0 son lieu d\u2019origine \u00bb.\n[56] Le Dr Jeffrey Reitz, t\u00e9moin expert pour le compte du plaignant, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet du traitement diff\u00e9rentiel que subissent les immigrants et les minorit\u00e9s ethniques. Toutefois, sa recherche \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur les minorit\u00e9s visibles et ne fournissait aucune donn\u00e9e probante quant \u00e0 l\u2019enseignement et au lieu d\u2019origine des m\u00e9decins blancs n\u00e9s et form\u00e9s aux \u00c9.\u2011U. Son t\u00e9moignage selon lequel les immigrants poss\u00e9dant des titres de comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger sont souvent d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s par rapport aux demandeurs form\u00e9s au Canada a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9.\n[57] Selon son propre t\u00e9moignage, le Dr Keith avait un degr\u00e9 scolaire \u00e9lev\u00e9 en m\u00e9decine et \u00e9tait accompli dans ses autres activit\u00e9s. De son propre aveu, il estimait que son accr\u00e9ditation am\u00e9ricaine \u00e9tait \u00e9gale, voire sup\u00e9rieure, aux dipl\u00f4mes canadiens en m\u00e9decine.\n[58] J\u2019estime que le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Reitz n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisamment convaincant pour corroborer l\u2019all\u00e9gation du plaignant selon laquelle il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa naissance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger et, par extension, sur son enseignement. On ne peut pas toujours appliquer automatiquement le principe selon lequel la formation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger est une extension de la naissance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. Ce principe n\u2019est pas absolu; autrement, le lieu de formation constituerait \u00e9galement un motif de distinction illicite \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re au sens de la LCDP. Bien que le Tribunal ait un large pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire quant \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, il est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 limiter ce qui pourrait autrement s\u2019appliquer dans une affaire o\u00f9 les faits sont diff\u00e9rents de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[59] Le plaignant n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que l\u2019exigence des FAC relative \u00e0 l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du CRMCC \u00e9tait discriminatoire envers les m\u00e9decins n\u00e9s et form\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. J\u2019accepte la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9e provenant du Sondage national des m\u00e9decins g\u00e9r\u00e9 par l\u2019Association m\u00e9dicale canadienne, qui indique que la plupart des sp\u00e9cialistes en Ontario sont accr\u00e9dit\u00e9s par le CRMCC, dans la mesure o\u00f9 99,2 p. 100 des sp\u00e9cialistes ontariens qui sont n\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Canada sont accr\u00e9dit\u00e9s par le CRMCC.\n[60] De m\u00eame, je ne saurais convenir que l\u2019exigence des FAC quant \u00e0 l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du CRMCC est discriminatoire, puisqu\u2019elle est \u00e9quivalente aux titres de l\u2019OMCO. J\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Dan Faulkner et du Dr Harris, dans la mesure o\u00f9 le CRMCC et l\u2019OMCO per\u00e7oivent les titres diff\u00e9remment. Le CRMCC est reconnu comme norme nationale partout au Canada.\n[61] L\u2019exigence des FAC relative \u00e0 l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du CRMCC entra\u00eene une norme sur laquelle elles peuvent se fonder partout au Canada. Le plaignant fait valoir que l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation de l\u2019OMCO est \u00e9quivalente. Aucune preuve cr\u00e9dible n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Bien que l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation de l\u2019OMCO soit accept\u00e9e dans certaines provinces canadiennes, mais pas toutes, aucune preuve n\u2019indique qu\u2019elle est accept\u00e9e par la province de l\u2019Alberta. Le Dr Ken Harris, directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du CRMCC, a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation de la sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 est une norme nationale applicable dans toutes les provinces et \u00e9galement accept\u00e9e par tous les coll\u00e8ges provinciaux comme une norme qui r\u00e9pond aux exigences de l\u2019attestation de la sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9.\n[62] Le TDPO a conclu que l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation de l\u2019OMCO et celle du CRMCC n\u2019\u00e9taient pas \u00e9quivalentes, puisque le CRMCC \u00e9laborait des normes nationales et que l\u2019OMCO g\u00e9rait les permis permettant de pratiquer la m\u00e9decine en Ontario : Keith-OMCO, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 46, 49 et 50.\n[63] Je conviens \u00e9galement que l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du CRMCC est une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a renvoy\u00e9 au crit\u00e8re \u00e0 trois volets \u00e9tabli par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Colombie\u2011Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, 1999 CanLII 652 (CSC), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 (Meiorin), au paragraphe 54, pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019une exigence professionnelle est justifi\u00e9e :\n[\u2026]\n(1) [que l\u2019employeur] a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause;\n(2) qu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail;\n(3) que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail. Pour prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, il faut d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est impossible de composer avec les employ\u00e9s qui ont les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que le demandeur sans que l\u2019employeur subisse une contrainte excessive.\n[64] Je conviens que les FAC subiraient une contrainte excessive si elles \u00e9taient tenues de d\u00e9terminer les qualifications de tous ses praticiens en m\u00e9decine. J\u2019accepte l\u2019explication du colonel MacKay lorsqu\u2019il a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nAvant 2009, ce ne sont pas toutes les provinces de ce pays qui reconnaissaient le permis et l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation d\u2019une province \u00e0 une autre. Si toutes les provinces ne peuvent s\u2019entendre sur le processus d\u2019accr\u00e9ditation suivi dans chacune de ces provinces, quel niveau de confiance puis\u2011je avoir dans le processus qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi pour leur accorder l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation dans cette province? L\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du Coll\u00e8ge royal des m\u00e9decins du Canada a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue par chaque province et constitue donc aujourd\u2019hui une norme acceptable pour assurer la qualit\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure des soins offerts par les fournisseurs de soins de sant\u00e9.\n[65] Je conclus que les FAC n\u2019ont pas fait preuve de discrimination envers le Dr Keith au sens de la LCDP, puisqu\u2019elles ont r\u00e9pondu au crit\u00e8re \u00e9tabli par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin, et affirmer le contraire poserait une contrainte excessive aux FAC et compromettrait la sant\u00e9 et les niveaux de ses employ\u00e9s.\n[66] Comme je conclus \u00e9galement que le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination au sens de la LCDP, il m\u2019est inutile d\u2019examiner sa demande d\u2019indemnisation.\n[67] Pour ces motifs, je conclus que la plainte n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nRonald Sydney Williams\nMembre instructeur du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe\n19 octobre 2017\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du Tribunal :\nT1981\/6113\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nArthur Lee Keith c.

Si la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question est affirmative, le Tribunal devrait-il ordonner leur divulgation malgr\u00e9 les pr\u00e9occupations de la plaignante quant \u00e0 sa vie priv\u00e9e? 12\nI. Le contexte\n[1] L\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (intim\u00e9e) a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate aux termes de l\u2019article 3 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03\u201105\u201104) (les R\u00e8gles), afin d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 Mme Pamela Egan (la plaignante) de consentir \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de ses renseignements confidentiels pour les besoins de l\u2019instruction de la plainte par le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal). Les renseignements confidentiels se trouvent dans les dossiers de la Commission de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 professionnelle et de l\u2019assurance contre les accidents du travail (la CSPAAT) et du Tribunal d\u2019appel de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 professionnelle et de l\u2019assurance contre les accidents du travail (le TASPAAT) relatifs \u00e0 la plaignante et se rapportent \u00e0 un accident de travail survenu en 2009, que la plaignante attribue au fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement.\n[2] L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande au Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 la plaignante de produire une liste de tous les professionnels de la sant\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a consult\u00e9s pour les sympt\u00f4mes li\u00e9s \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle, \u00e0 ses douleurs chroniques et \u00e0 son invalidit\u00e9 psychotraumatique (trouble de stress post-traumatique et d\u00e9pression), ou pour leur traitement, ou pour tout autre probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 dont elle impute la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et de remettre aux parties tous les documents m\u00e9dicaux potentiellement pertinents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession ou qu\u2019elle obtiendra au cours de la pr\u00e9sente instruction.\n[3] Pendant une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance (la CTGI) tenue le 6 septembre 2017, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a indiqu\u00e9 que les documents m\u00e9dicaux dont elle demandait la divulgation se rapportaient \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience visuelle de la plaignante et remontaient \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019an 2000. Ils couvrent la p\u00e9riode qui pr\u00e9c\u00e9dait imm\u00e9diatement le retour au travail de la plaignante apr\u00e8s deux ans de cong\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une blessure qu\u2019elle avait subie \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du travail. Cette blessure est \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la plainte qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en mai 2003, selon laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en ne prenant pas de mesures adapt\u00e9es \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle et \u00e0 ses douleurs chroniques.\n[4] Les parties ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 et \u00e9chang\u00e9 des observations relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, y compris la r\u00e9plique de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Pendant la CTGI du 6 septembre 2017, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 aux parties de pr\u00e9ciser leur position sur la question de la confidentialit\u00e9. Ensuite, l\u2019avocat de la plaignante a demand\u00e9 qu\u2019on lui accorde plus de temps pour examiner la question et fournir des observations \u00e9crites au moyen d\u2019une r\u00e9plique, puisqu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas abord\u00e9 cette question dans ses observations. Le Tribunal a fait droit \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate et a permis aux avocates de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de d\u00e9poser leur propre r\u00e9plique aux observations additionnelles de la plaignante.\nII. Les faits\n[5] En juin 1997, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a embauch\u00e9 la plaignante dans le cadre d\u2019une initiative en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en emploi \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9e ayant une d\u00e9ficience visuelle.\n[6] En f\u00e9vrier 1999, la plaignante a subi des blessures au cou et au haut du dos apr\u00e8s \u00eatre tomb\u00e9e d\u2019une \u00e9chelle alors qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait chez elle, en cong\u00e9 non pay\u00e9. En cons\u00e9quence, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 en arr\u00eat de travail pendant deux ans. Elle est retourn\u00e9e progressivement au travail \u00e0 partir du 29 janvier 2001.\n[7] Le 21 mai 2003, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 contre l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada une plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne, selon laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en ne prenant pas de mesures adapt\u00e9es \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle et \u00e0 ses douleurs chroniques, en violation des articles 7 et 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (la Loi).\n[8] La plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un accident survenu en f\u00e9vrier 2009 sur le lieu de travail par suite de l\u2019utilisation d\u2019un \u00e9quipement sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9; elle a ensuite pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s pour accident du travail au titre de la Loi de 1997 sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 professionnelle et l\u2019assurance contre les accidents du travail, L.O. 1997, ch. 16, annexe A (la LSPAAT).\n[9] La CSPAAT a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante le droit aux prestations demand\u00e9es. Elle a re\u00e7u des prestations pour les jours de travail perdus et pour les soins de sant\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7us pour les blessures au coude droit, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9paule droite et au cou qu\u2019elle avait subies par suite de l\u2019accident de travail, et ce, pendant environ 40 mois \u00e0 partir du 14 janvier 2009. Au milieu de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2012, la CSPAAT a cess\u00e9 de verser ces prestations \u00e0 la plaignante.\n[10] La plaignante a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la CSPAAT de lui accorder des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 pour douleur chronique et d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 psychotraumatique (y compris le syndrome de stress post-traumatique et la d\u00e9pression), au motif que ces invalidit\u00e9s \u00e9taient une cons\u00e9quence directe de son emploi, du fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas pris de mesures d\u2019accommodement. La CSPAAT lui a refus\u00e9 le droit \u00e0 ces prestations, au motif qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9dicaux pr\u00e9existants et qu\u2019ils ne donnaient pas droit \u00e0 une indemnisation au titre de la LSPAAT. Cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e en appel devant le TASPAAT.\n[11] Dans le cadre du processus d\u2019appel quant \u00e0 l\u2019accident de travail survenu en 2009, l\u2019intim\u00e9e et la plaignante ont re\u00e7u une copie de l\u2019ensemble du dossier de la plaignante \u00e0 la CSPAAT et au TASPAAT. Le dossier comprend des documents m\u00e9dicaux qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment communiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. La CSPAAT a aussi divulgu\u00e9 des addendas contenant les mises \u00e0 jour des renseignements figurant au dossier de la CSPAAT et du TASPAAT. Le dossier et les addendas portent les mentions [traduction] \u00ab confidentiel \u00bb et \u00ab pour les besoins de l\u2019assurance contre les accidents du travail seulement \u00bb.\n[12] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que ce n\u2019est qu\u2019au cours du processus d\u2019appel devant le TASPAAT qu\u2019elle a appris que la plaignante avait divers probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 et qu\u2019elle lui imputait l\u2019\u00e9volution de ses douleurs chroniques, de son syndrome de stress post-traumatique et de sa d\u00e9pression.\n[13] Dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la plaignante a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal qu\u2019elle souhaitait d\u00e9montrer que le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019ait pris aucune mesure d\u2019accommodement est \u00e0 l\u2019origine de son invalidit\u00e9 pour douleurs chroniques, de son syndrome de stress post\u2011traumatique et de sa d\u00e9pression.\nIII. La position des parties\nA. Le pouvoir d\u2019injonction du Tribunal pour contraindre au consentement\n[14] L\u2019intim\u00e9e reconna\u00eet que la plaignante avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 consenti \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de quelques-uns des documents faisant partie du dossier de la CSPAAT et du TASPAAT. Cependant, la plaignante refuse que les autres documents soient utilis\u00e9s pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente instruction. Dans ses observations en r\u00e9ponse, la plaignante avait consenti \u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e utilise les documents additionnels qu\u2019elle avait demand\u00e9s et qui se trouvaient dans le dossier de la CSPPAT et du TACSPAAT. Dans ses observations en r\u00e9plique, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a retir\u00e9 sa demande \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de plusieurs documents. Cependant, la plaignante soutient que les autres documents contenus dans son dossier ne devraient pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s (documents en litige). Les documents en litige sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9s dans les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant les documents 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 28 et 29 et y sont d\u00e9crits.\n[15] L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande au Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 la plaignante de consentir \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation des documents en litige dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. La plaignante remet en question le pouvoir du Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 une partie de consentir \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de documents confidentiels. En r\u00e9plique, l\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que les articles 48.9(1) et 50 de la Loi conf\u00e8rent de vastes pouvoirs au Tribunal, y compris le pouvoir de rendre une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 la plaignante de consentir \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de renseignements confidentiels. Subsidiairement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient, et la plaignante reconna\u00eet, que le Tribunal a le pouvoir d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 la plaignante de divulguer et de produire les documents en litige en vertu de l\u2019article 50(3)a) de la Loi. L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 la plaignante de divulguer les documents en litige, s\u2019il n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord pour dire qu\u2019il a le pouvoir d\u2019enjoindre \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re de consentir \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation desdits documents.\nB. Les documents en litige\n[16] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que les documents en litige devraient \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s du fait qu\u2019ils sont tr\u00e8s pertinents dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente instruction, puisque la plaignante a invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019accident de travail qu\u2019elle avait subi en 2009. La plaignante affirme notamment que ses douleurs chroniques, son syndrome de stress post-traumatique et sa d\u00e9pression d\u00e9coulent directement du fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019aurait pas pris de mesure d\u2019accommodement. L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait donc valoir qu\u2019il y a un lien entre les documents et les questions en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure.\n[17] L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait \u00e9galement valoir que certains documents en litige sont potentiellement pertinents pour les besoins de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation que doit faire le Tribunal, non seulement de la responsabilit\u00e9, mais aussi des mesures de redressement \u00e0 accorder afin d\u2019\u00e9viter toute indemnisation double, puisque la plaignante a re\u00e7u des prestations de la CSPAAT relativement \u00e0 l\u2019accident du travail de 2009. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ajoute que l\u2019on peut soutenir que quelques\u2011uns des documents en litige sont pertinents, puisqu\u2019elle en a besoin pour d\u00e9montrer que la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pleinement dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 coop\u00e9rer et \u00e0 fournir \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e les renseignements pertinents pour les besoins des mesures d\u2019accommodement. Enfin, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que certains documents permettraient d\u2019exposer les d\u00e9fis qu\u2019elle a rencontr\u00e9s en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, y compris des renseignements relatifs aux blessures et aux maladies non d\u00e9clar\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment et que la plaignante attribue au d\u00e9faut par l\u2019intim\u00e9e de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement.\n[18] La plaignante soutient que les r\u00e8gles de divulgation ne justifient pas la divulgation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019ensemble des dossiers de la CSPAAT et du TASPAAT. Elle pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas suffisamment justifi\u00e9 sa demande de divulgation des documents en litige. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, elle conteste la divulgation de ces documents, au motif qu\u2019ils ne sont pas potentiellement pertinents. Elle ajoute que certains de ces documents ne sont que des formulaires internes de la CSPAAT et du TASPAAT et qu\u2019ils ne contiennent aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de fond, alors que d\u2019autres sont des documents de correspondance entre les parties et la CSPAAT et le TASPAAT, lesquels documents portent uniquement sur des questions de nature administrative ou de proc\u00e9dure et ne contiennent aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de fond se rapportant aux questions de responsabilit\u00e9 ou de mesures de redressement. De plus, la plaignante fait valoir qu\u2019on ne peut soutenir que les addendas sont pertinents, parce qu\u2019ils ne contiennent aucun renseignement m\u00e9dical ni aucun renseignement de fond relatif aux appels. Ils contiennent plut\u00f4t des documents de correspondance se rapportant aux questions de proc\u00e9dure dans l\u2019instance devant le TASPAAT.\n[19] Le Tribunal fait remarquer que la plaignante ne conteste pas l\u2019utilisation des documents en litige pour un motif relatif \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9.\nC. Les documents m\u00e9dicaux\n[20] La plaignante ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00e0 la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e en vue d\u2019obtenir la liste des professionnels de la sant\u00e9 qui l\u2019ont trait\u00e9e pour ses douleurs chroniques, son syndrome de stress post-traumatique et sa d\u00e9pression. D\u2019ailleurs, elle consent aussi \u00e0 produire tous les documents m\u00e9dicaux potentiellement pertinents en sa possession relativement \u00e0 ces probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9.\n[21] Cependant, la plaignante soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune raison de produire une liste des professionnels qu\u2019elle a consult\u00e9s pour sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle ou de produire les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux relatifs \u00e0 cette d\u00e9ficience (les documents m\u00e9dicaux). Elle fait valoir qu\u2019on ne peut soutenir que ces renseignements sont pertinents, parce qu\u2019elle ne pr\u00e9tend pas que sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle est attribuable \u00e0 l\u2019omission de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement. La plaignante soutient essentiellement que sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle n\u2019est pas en cause et que la demande de divulgation \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une [traduction] \u00ab partie de p\u00eache \u00bb.\n[22] En r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que les documents m\u00e9dicaux sont tr\u00e8s pertinents, puisque la d\u00e9ficience visuelle de la plaignante est \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne et de l\u2019instruction. En fait, l\u2019intim\u00e9e estime que la plainte repose sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle elle aurait refus\u00e9 de prendre des mesures adapt\u00e9es \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience visuelle de la plaignante.\nD. Le droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e de la plaignante\n[23] En plus d\u2019avancer l\u2019argument de la pertinence potentielle des documents, la plaignante affirme pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans sa r\u00e9plique que son droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux, surtout ceux qui se rapportent \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle, l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 ce que les documents soient divulgu\u00e9s et que la production de ces documents lui causerait un pr\u00e9judice excessif.\n[24] La plaignante n\u2019explique pas en quoi la divulgation porterait atteinte \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e au point de lui causer un pr\u00e9judice excessif, mais elle affirme que le Tribunal doit tenir compte de ce pr\u00e9judice pour d\u00e9cider si les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux demand\u00e9s devraient \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s, conform\u00e9ment aux cinq crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans une d\u00e9cision d\u2019arbitrage de l\u2019Ontario, soit West Park Hospital v. Ontario Nurses' Assn. (1993), 37 L.A.C. (4th) 160 (West Park Hospital).\n[25] La plaignante soutient \u00e9galement dans sa r\u00e9plique que le Tribunal doit, pour trancher la question qui lui est soumise, tenir compte de la Loi de 2004 sur la protection des renseignements personnels sur la sant\u00e9, L.O. 2004, ch. 3, annexe A (la LPRPS). En fait, la plaignante soutient que ses m\u00e9decins sont li\u00e9s par les dispositions sur la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e de la LPRPS et qu\u2019ils ne pourraient pas, de toute fa\u00e7on, divulguer les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux demand\u00e9s, puisque la demande de divulgation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e outrepasse les limites des dispositions de la LPRPS.\n[26] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient dans sa r\u00e9plique que la divulgation des documents m\u00e9dicaux est n\u00e9cessaire pour que le Tribunal puisse appr\u00e9cier l\u2019ampleur de la d\u00e9ficience visuelle de la plaignante, ses besoins en mati\u00e8re de mesures d\u2019accommodement et la question de savoir si la plaignante a fait part de ses besoins \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour les besoins des mesures d\u2019accommodement. Elle fait valoir que la plaignante a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e quand elle a invoqu\u00e9 sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle.\n[27] En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme dans sa r\u00e9plique que ni la LPRPS ni les cinq crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis dans West Park Hospital ne s\u2019appliquent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En fait, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses propres termes, la LPRPS ne s\u2019applique pas au pouvoir d\u2019un tribunal d\u2019exiger la production de documents. Pour ce qui est de la d\u00e9cision West Park Hospital, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que le Tribunal devrait appliquer le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 trois volets qu\u2019il a \u00e9labor\u00e9 pour les demandes de divulgation.\nIV. Les questions en litige\n[28] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les questions \u00e0 trancher sont les suivantes :\nLe Tribunal a-t-il le pouvoir de rendre une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 la plaignante de consentir \u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e utilise le dossier de la plaignante \u00e0 la CSPAAT et au TASPAAST dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure?\nLes documents en litige sont-ils potentiellement pertinents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce?\nLa liste de tous les professionnels de la sant\u00e9 que la plaignante a consult\u00e9s pour sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle et la production, par celle-ci, des documents m\u00e9dicaux y aff\u00e9rents en sa possession depuis 2000 sont-elles des \u00e9l\u00e9ments potentiellement pertinents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce? Si la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question est affirmative, le Tribunal devrait-il ordonner leur divulgation malgr\u00e9 les pr\u00e9occupations de la plaignante quant \u00e0 sa vie priv\u00e9e?\nV. Les principes de droit applicables\n[29] Le droit \u00e0 une instruction \u00e9quitable exige que \u00ab [\u2026] l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 soit inform\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es contre lui et ait la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre \u00bb (voir Charkaoui c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2007 CSC 9, au paragraphe 53; Leslie Palm c. International Longshore and Warehouse Union et al., 2012 TCDP 11, aux paragraphes 9 \u00e0 11 (Palm)).\n[30] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 50(1) de la Loi, les parties \u00e0 une instance devant le Tribunal doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leur preuve. Ce droit comporte \u00e9galement le droit \u00e0 la divulgation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve potentiellement pertinents (voir Grand Chef Stan Louttit en sa qualit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentant des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Conseil Mushkegowuk et Grand Chef Stan Louttit en sa qualit\u00e9 personnelle c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, 2013 TCDP 3, au paragraphe 10). Outre les faits et les questions en litige pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les parties, la divulgation de documents permet \u00e0 chaque partie de conna\u00eetre la preuve qu\u2019elle doit r\u00e9futer et de se pr\u00e9parer ad\u00e9quatement pour l\u2019audience (voir Guay c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada), 2004 TCDP 34, au paragraphe 40 (Guay); Almalki c. Air Canada, 2016 TCDP 3, au paragraphe 11 (Almalki)).\n[31] S\u2019il existe un lien rationnel entre un document et les faits, les questions ou les formes de redressement demand\u00e9es par les parties dans l\u2019affaire, le document doit \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9 aux termes des articles 6(1)d) et 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal (voir Guay, au paragraphe 42; Rai c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2013 TCDP 6, au paragraphe 28 (Rai); Almalki, au paragraphe 11). Il incombe \u00e0 la partie requ\u00e9rante d\u2019\u00e9tablir le lien rationnel, mais le seuil quant \u00e0 la \u00ab pertinence d\u00e9fendable \u00bb est peu \u00e9lev\u00e9, et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu dans la jurisprudence que la tendance qui se dessinait favorisait une communication de documents plus \u00e9tendue que moins \u00e9tendue (voir Warman c. Bahr, 2006 TCDP 18, au paragraphe 6).\n[32] Cependant, il y a certaines limites \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, aux termes de l\u2019article 50(4) de la Loi, le Tribunal ne peut pas admettre en preuve des renseignements confidentiels. De plus, une demande de divulgation ne doit pas \u00eatre sp\u00e9culative ou \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une \u00ab partie de p\u00eache \u00bb (voir Guay, au paragraphe 43).\n[33] En outre, la divulgation de renseignements potentiellement pertinents ne signifie pas que ces renseignements seront admis en preuve ou qu\u2019on leur accordera une importance significative (voir Association des employ\u00e9(e)s t\u00e9l\u00e9communication du Manitoba Inc. c. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 TCDP 28, au paragraphe 4).\n[34] En ce qui concerne les documents m\u00e9dicaux, le Tribunal a conclu que le droit de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de \u00ab conna\u00eetre les motifs et la port\u00e9e de la plainte dont il fait l\u2019objet \u00bb l\u2019emporte sur les droits \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e (Guay, au paragraphe 45). Comme il est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Guay, \u00ab [l]a justice, dans des proc\u00e9dures en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, exige que l\u2019on permette \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de pr\u00e9senter une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019argumentation de la partie plaignante. Si la plaignante plaide sa cause en se fondant sur son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a le droit d\u2019obtenir les renseignements de sant\u00e9 pertinents qui peuvent avoir trait \u00e0 la r\u00e9clamation \u00bb (voir Guay, au paragraphe 45; voir aussi Palm, au paragraphe 11).\nVI. Analyse et d\u00e9cision\nA. Question en litige i) : Le Tribunal a-t-il le pouvoir de rendre une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 la plaignante de consentir \u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e utilise le dossier de la plaignante \u00e0 CSPAAT et au TASPAAST dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure?\n[35] \u00c0 mon avis, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 rendre une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 la plaignante de consentir \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de son dossier de la CSPAAT et du TASPAAT dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure.\n[36] Le Tribunal est n\u00e9 d\u2019une loi. Par cons\u00e9quent, ses pouvoirs d\u00e9coulent des dispositions de la Loi. Selon moi, aucune disposition de la Loi ne conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir de rendre une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 une personne de consentir \u00e0 quoi que ce soit, y compris \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de documents confidentiels.\n[37] Les articles de la Loi invoqu\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la th\u00e8se selon laquelle le Tribunal peut rendre une telle ordonnance ne conf\u00e8rent pas, selon moi, un tel pouvoir. Aux termes de l\u2019article 48.9(1) de la Loi, l\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive. L\u2019article 50(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit, d\u2019autre part, que l\u2019instruction doit se d\u00e9rouler de mani\u00e8re \u00e9quitable.\n[38] Le Tribunal se rend compte que les parties se fondent sur l\u2019article 50(3) pour ce qui concerne la divulgation et la production des documents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, plut\u00f4t que sur l\u2019article 50(1), puisque les deux parties sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 en possession des documents en litige. L\u2019article 50(3) de la Loi conf\u00e8re aux membres instructeurs certains pouvoirs additionnels pour la tenue des audiences. Ces pouvoirs ne comprennent pas celui d\u2019enjoindre \u00e0 une partie de consentir \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de documents. Cependant, le Tribunal a le pouvoir, en vertu de l\u2019article 50(3)a), d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 la plaignante de divulguer et de produire les documents en litige \u00e0 l\u2019audience, dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils sont potentiellement pertinents dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure.\nB. Question en litige ii) : Les documents en litige sont-ils potentiellement pertinents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce?\n[39] J\u2019estime que les documents en litige, qui se trouvent dans les dossiers de la CSPAAT et du TASPAAT relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019accident de travail de 2009, sont potentiellement pertinents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Par la pr\u00e9sente, le Tribunal ordonne qu\u2019ils soient produits au titre de l\u2019article 50(3)a) de la Loi.\n[40] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la jurisprudence servant \u00e0 statuer sur les demandes de divulgation se fonde habituellement sur les crit\u00e8res suivants :\nAux termes de l\u2019article 50(1) de la Loi, les parties \u00e0 une instance du Tribunal doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leur preuve.\n\u00c0 cette fin, chaque partie a besoin, notamment, que les documents potentiellement pertinents qui se trouvent en la possession ou sous la garde de la partie adverse lui soient divulgu\u00e9s avant l\u2019instruction de l\u2019affaire.\nOutre les faits et les questions en litige pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les parties, la divulgation des documents permet \u00e0 chacune des parties de conna\u00eetre la preuve qu\u2019elle doit r\u00e9futer et, ainsi, de se pr\u00e9parer ad\u00e9quatement pour l\u2019audience.\nPour cette raison, s\u2019il existe un lien rationnel entre un document et les faits, questions ou formes de redressement demand\u00e9es par les parties dans l\u2019affaire, le document doit \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9 aux termes des articles 6(1)d) et 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles.\nLa partie qui sollicite la divulgation doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il existe un lien et qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de documents probants et potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une question soulev\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience, ce qui ne constitue pas une norme particuli\u00e8rement \u00e9lev\u00e9e.\nLa demande de divulgation ne doit pas \u00eatre sp\u00e9culative ou \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une \u00ab partie de p\u00eache \u00bb. Les documents doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9crits de mani\u00e8re suffisamment pr\u00e9cise.\nLa divulgation de documents potentiellement pertinents ne signifie pas qu\u2019ils seront admis en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience ou qu\u2019on leur accordera une importance significative dans le processus d\u00e9cisionnel.\n[41] La plaignante a invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019accident de travail qu\u2019elle avait subi en 2009 dans son all\u00e9gation selon laquelle ledit accident serait la cons\u00e9quence directe de l\u2019omission de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement et qu\u2019il faudrait en tenir compte pour les questions de responsabilit\u00e9 et de mesures de redressement soulev\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La plaignante tente, au moyen du processus de la CSPAAT et du TASPAAT, de faire reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019elle souffre de douleurs chroniques, de d\u00e9pression, d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et du syndrome de stress post\u2011traumatique, du fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas pris de mesures d\u2019accommodement. N\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 le processus de la CSPAAT et du TASPAAT au terme duquel elle a re\u00e7u les dossiers de ces organismes, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 au courant de certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la situation de la plaignante, lesquels sont potentiellement pertinents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, notamment la question de savoir si le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ignorait l\u2019existence de certains probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 a eu pour effet de retarder la prise de mesures d\u2019accommodement.\n[42] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9crit les documents en litige de mani\u00e8re suffisamment d\u00e9taill\u00e9e aux paragraphes 12, 13 et 14 des observations qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en r\u00e9plique afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir le lien n\u00e9cessaire et de s\u2019acquitter du fardeau qui lui incombait de prouver que les documents sont potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions de responsabilit\u00e9 et de mesures de redressement soulev\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale exige l\u2019utilisation des documents en litige afin que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ait une occasion \u00e9quitable de pr\u00e9senter sa preuve.\nC. Question en litige iii) : La liste de tous les professionnels de la sant\u00e9 que la plaignante a consult\u00e9s pour sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle et la production, par celle-ci, des documents m\u00e9dicaux y aff\u00e9rents en sa possession depuis 2000 sont-elles des \u00e9l\u00e9ments potentiellement pertinents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce? Si la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question est affirmative, le Tribunal devrait-il ordonner leur divulgation malgr\u00e9 les pr\u00e9occupations de la plaignante quant \u00e0 sa vie priv\u00e9e?\n[43] Tout d\u2019abord, il convient de souligner qu\u2019aux termes de l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles, l\u2019obligation de divulgation d\u2019une partie se limite aux documents qu\u2019elle a \u00ab en sa possession \u00bb (voir aussi Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 42, au paragraphe 17). Par cons\u00e9quent, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une preuve selon laquelle il existe d\u00e9j\u00e0 une liste des professionnels de la sant\u00e9 qui ont soign\u00e9 la plaignante pour sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle, la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est rejet\u00e9e.\n[44] Ensuite, le Tribunal estime que la mesure dans laquelle la plaignante avait besoin de mesures d\u2019accommodement en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle est directement en cause et est essentielle au r\u00e8glement efficace de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Le Tribunal souligne l\u2019affirmation de la plaignante selon laquelle ses dossiers m\u00e9dicaux s\u2019\u00e9tendent sur des dizaines d\u2019ann\u00e9es. C\u2019est possible, mais l\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 avoir besoin des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9tablis depuis la fin de l\u2019an 2000. Le Tribunal conclut que cette demande de divulgation est potentiellement pertinente en ce qui concerne l\u2019argumentation avanc\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e et selon laquelle la plaignante aurait refus\u00e9 de lui fournir suffisamment de renseignements sur ses limites, de sorte qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas pu offrir \u00e0 la plaignante des mesures d\u2019accommodement au moment opportun. On ne peut donc pas affirmer que la demande \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une \u00ab partie de p\u00eache \u00bb ou qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas suffisamment d\u00e9taill\u00e9e.\n[45] Enfin, le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que le droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e de la plaignante en ce qui a trait aux documents m\u00e9dicaux n\u2019interdit pas la divulgation en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[46] En ce qui concerne les cinq crit\u00e8res de divulgation \u00e9tablis dans West Park Hospital que la plaignante demande au Tribunal d\u2019appliquer, le Tribunal pr\u00e9f\u00e8re se fonder sur les d\u00e9cisions qu\u2019il a rendues en mati\u00e8re de divulgation. Outre le crit\u00e8re portant sur le \u00ab pr\u00e9judice excessif \u00bb, les autres crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans West Park Hospital sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien \u00e9tablis dans la jurisprudence du Tribunal et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en consid\u00e9ration dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. En outre, compte tenu des remarques formul\u00e9es \u00e0 la fin du paragraphe 20 de West Park Hospital, l\u2019arbitre semble penser que le crit\u00e8re du \u00ab pr\u00e9judice excessif \u00bb devrait \u00eatre examin\u00e9 dans le contexte plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qu\u2019offre le test de Wigmore. Le Tribunal h\u00e9site \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre West Park Hospital comme une d\u00e9cision faisant autorit\u00e9 en ce qui concerne le privil\u00e8ge relatif aux communications, compte tenu de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat A.M. v. Ryan, [1997] 1 R.C.S. 157 (Ryan) (voir notamment les paragraphes 24 \u00e0 38). En fait, le test de Wigmore, tel qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Ryan, est d\u00fbment appliqu\u00e9 par le Tribunal (voir par exemple Syndicat canadien des communications, de l\u2019\u00e9nergie et du papier c. Bell Canada, 2003 TCDP 19, au paragraphe 11; McAvinn c. Strait Crossing Bridge Ltd., 2001 CanLII 38296 (TCDP)). Il est question du test de Wigmore dans le prochain paragraphe, mais le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 le \u00ab pr\u00e9judice excessif \u00bb comme un facteur ind\u00e9pendant et il arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que la simple affirmation de la plaignante ne suffit pas pour prouver qu\u2019il y a eu atteinte \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e.\n[47] Il est bien \u00e9tabli en droit que la partie qui s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la divulgation des documents a le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019ils devraient \u00eatre confidentiels (R. c. National Post, 2010 CSC 16, au paragraphe 60, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 477; voir aussi R. c. Gruenke, [1991] 3 RCS 263, \u00e0 la page 293). Apr\u00e8s avoir attentivement examin\u00e9 les observations de la plaignante, le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019elles ne font aucunement mention de la question. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plaignante ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e de son fardeau de preuve. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019en pla\u00e7ant les mesures d\u2019accommodement relatives \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle au c\u0153ur de la plainte, la plaignante a renonc\u00e9 au droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e qu\u2019elle avait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des documents m\u00e9dicaux, puisqu\u2019ils se rapportent au diagnostic, au pronostic et aux mesures d\u2019accommodement qui devraient \u00eatre prises \u00e0 son retour au travail relativement \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience (Guay, au paragraphe 45; Rai, au paragraphe 30; Palm v. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500, Richard Wilkinson and Cliff Willicome, 2013 TCDP 19, aux paragraphes 44-45).\n[48] De plus, le Tribunal rejette les observations de la plaignante selon lesquelles une telle ordonnance de divulgation outrepasse les limites des dispositions de la LPRPS. M\u00eame si le Tribunal devait supposer, sans pour autant conclure, que la LPRPS s\u2019applique aux organismes f\u00e9d\u00e9raux comme lui, cette loi n\u2019entrave pas le pouvoir d\u2019un tribunal administratif d\u2019exiger la production d\u2019un document [voir l\u2019article 9(2)]. Ainsi, il est \u00e9vident que l\u2019ordonnance de divulgation du Tribunal n\u2019outrepasse pas les limites des dispositions de la LPRPS.\n[49] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, le Tribunal ordonne la divulgation des documents m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9tablis \u00e0 partir du 31 d\u00e9cembre 2000. Encore une fois, le Tribunal rappelle aux parties que l\u2019ordonnance de divulgation est assujettie \u00e0 toutes les objections soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience au sujet de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des documents. En fait, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 50(3)c) de la Loi, les documents m\u00e9dicaux ne sont pas vers\u00e9s au dossier de l\u2019audience, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019ils ne soient admis en preuve.\n[50] Malgr\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal est conscient des pr\u00e9occupations de la plaignante quant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e et \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation des documents m\u00e9dicaux, comme elle l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 dans sa r\u00e9plique. Si la plaignante a toujours des pr\u00e9occupations quant au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, elle pourra en discuter avec le Tribunal et ce dernier pourra, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, d\u00e9terminer les modalit\u00e9s appropri\u00e9es pour prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e de la plaignante.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

Contexte\n[1] Le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) est saisi d\u2019une demande effectu\u00e9e par Mme Tracy Polhill (la \u00ab plaignante \u00bb) ayant pour objectif de modifier sa plainte ainsi que son expos\u00e9 des faits initial d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en d\u00e9cembre 2015. Avant d\u2019aborder cette demande, le Tribunal estime qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de faire un court r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du contexte menant \u00e0 ladite demande.\n[2] Le 28 avril 2014, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) au motif que la Premi\u00e8re Nation Keeseekowenin (\u00ab intim\u00e9e \u00bb, \u00ab Nation \u00bb ou \u00ab KFN \u00bb) a commis des actes discriminatoires fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine national ou ethnique en violation de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985), ch. H-6 (\u00ab LCDP \u00bb ou \u00ab la Loi \u00bb).\n[3] Le 24 juin 2015, la Commission a saisi le Tribunal de la plainte en vertu de l\u2019article 44(3)(a) de la LCDP. La Commission participe \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[4] La plaignante et la Commission ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leur documentation respective au mois de d\u00e9cembre 2015 incluant leur expos\u00e9 des faits. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, elle ne s\u2019est manifest\u00e9e \u00e0 aucune des \u00e9tapes des proc\u00e9dures. Entre le 24 janvier 2016 et le 6 avril 2017, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e 22 correspondances avec accus\u00e9-r\u00e9ception. Cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 aucune de ces correspondances.\n[5] Ceci \u00e9tant dit, l\u2019audience a tout de m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e pour une dur\u00e9e de 4 jours, du 25 au 28 avril 2017, \u00e0 Onanole (Manitoba). Sans aviser le Tribunal ni le greffier, l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re journ\u00e9e d\u2019audience, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par avocat. L\u2019avocat a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal un court ajournement afin que les parties puissent discuter d\u2019une possible entente. \u00c0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019entente, il demandera un ajournement de l\u2019audience afin que l\u2019intim\u00e9e puisse d\u00e9poser ses repr\u00e9sentations. Les parties ont inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu\u2019un proc\u00e8s-verbal de r\u00e8glement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9. Ce r\u00e8glement devait par contre \u00eatre ent\u00e9rin\u00e9 par le conseil de bande de la Nation. Consid\u00e9rant les repr\u00e9sentations des parties, le Tribunal a ajourn\u00e9 l\u2019audience.\n[6] Le 9 mai 2017, la Commission a formellement inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que l\u2019entente ne s\u2019est finalement pas conclue. Le Tribunal a ainsi demand\u00e9 aux parties de lui fournir leurs disponibilit\u00e9s dans les prochains mois afin de reprendre l\u2019audience le plus rapidement possible. Le 12 juin 2017, la plaignante envoie aux parties ainsi qu\u2019au Tribunal un courriel indiquant son intention de modifier sa plainte ainsi que son expos\u00e9 des faits de d\u00e9cembre 2015.\n[7] Le 13 juin 2017, une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique eut lieu et la plaignante a formellement inform\u00e9 le Tribunal de son intention de modifier sa plainte et son expos\u00e9 des faits. Le Tribunal a donc convenu avec les parties de la marche \u00e0 suivre. La plaignante devait clairement souligner ou surligner ses modifications ou ajouts dans son expos\u00e9 des faits. De plus, elle devait fournir les raisons pour lesquelles elle demandait de tels changements notamment en d\u00e9posant une simple lettre de pr\u00e9sentation. \u00c9videmment, l\u2019intim\u00e9e et la Commission conservaient leur droit de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces modifications ou ajouts. Le 24 juillet 2017, le Tribunal a re\u00e7u les modifications de la plaignante. L\u2019intim\u00e9e r\u00e9pondit le 10 ao\u00fbt 2017 et la Commission, le 11 ao\u00fbt 2017.\n[8] Ceci \u00e9tant dit, le Tribunal doit trancher sur la demande de modification effectu\u00e9e par la plaignante.\nII. Position des parties\n[9] Par souci de concision et d\u2019efficacit\u00e9, le Tribunal ne reprend pas tous les arguments des parties, mais en r\u00e9sume les principaux de la mani\u00e8re suivante.\nA. La plaignante\n[10] Dans son expos\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 des faits, la plaignante apporte des changements relativement importants \u00e0 sa plainte initiale ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 son expos\u00e9 des faits. Le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que ces modifications sont de quatre ordres.\n\u00b7 Dans un premier temps, la plaignante pr\u00e9sente trois nouvelles all\u00e9gations de violation de la LCDP par l\u2019intim\u00e9e et plus particuli\u00e8rement des articles 6(b), 14 et 14.1 de la LCDP.\no Elle estime que la r\u00e9solution du conseil de bande contre elle l\u2019a priv\u00e9e de sources de revenus et l\u2019a pouss\u00e9e \u00e0 devoir quitter la communaut\u00e9 et la maison de son conjoint. Ainsi, elle s\u2019est vue d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la fourniture de logement au titre de l\u2019article 6(b) de la LCDP.\no Au titre de l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement, la plaignante soutient avoir fait l\u2019objet de harc\u00e8lement de multiples fa\u00e7ons de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, de l\u2019un de ses repr\u00e9sentants ou des membres de la communaut\u00e9 qui lui sont li\u00e9s. Elle attribue la cause de ce harc\u00e8lement aux agissements de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\no La plaignante soutient enfin que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a commis des actes de repr\u00e9sailles contre elle, sa fille et son conjoint (et t\u00e9moin \u00e0 l\u2019audience), M. Wes Bone, au titre de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP. Dans un souci de concision, le Tribunal ne reprendra pas tous les d\u00e9tails fournis par la plaignante, elle soutient notamment ce qui suit :\n\u00a7 L\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait intimid\u00e9 sa fille d\u00e9ficiente et commis des man\u0153uvres afin de nuire \u00e0 sa situation financi\u00e8re;\n\u00a7 L\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019un de ses repr\u00e9sentants ou des membres de la communaut\u00e9 qui lui sont li\u00e9s aurait intimid\u00e9 et commis des actes de repr\u00e9sailles et de diffamation contre son conjoint sur Facebook et par courriel;\n\u00a7 L\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait commis des repr\u00e9sailles contre elle et son partenaire dans la gestion d\u2019une inondation du sous-sol de leur maison et dans la gestion de la coupe des foins autour de leur maison et du \u00ab sweat lodge fire \u00bb;\n\u00a7 L\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait commis des actes de repr\u00e9sailles en intervenant aupr\u00e8s de la Gendarmerie Royale du Canada (GRC) quant \u00e0 la gestion de ses chevaux et ce, dans le but de lui nuire;\n\u00a7 Quelques jours apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience, la GRC s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e chez la plaignante afin de l\u2019informer qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait accus\u00e9e de fraude. Elle soutient que quelqu\u2019un a fait de fausses d\u00e9clarations \u00e0 son sujet et attribue la responsabilit\u00e9 de cette situation \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e et ses agissements.\n\u00b7 Dans un deuxi\u00e8me temps, elle demande de nouveaux redressements en vertu de l\u2019article 53 de la LCDP pour les nouveaux actes discriminatoires notamment 20 000$ pour chaque violation de l\u2019article 14.1 et 20 000$ pour la violation de l\u2019article 6(b) de la LCDP. Elle demande \u00e9galement une somme de 20 000$ en vertu de l\u2019article 3(1) de la LCDP.\n\u00b7 Dans un troisi\u00e8me temps, elle pr\u00e9sente une multitude de faits nouveaux au soutien de sa plainte. La grande majorit\u00e9 de ces faits sont d\u2019ordre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et viennent mettre en contexte les bases de sa plainte. Ces faits sont r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\no Les d\u00e9tails sur la sant\u00e9 et la situation financi\u00e8re de sa fille;\no Les d\u00e9tails de sa relation avec son conjoint, M. Bone, leur mode de vie et leur relation avec la communaut\u00e9;\no Les d\u00e9tails sur l\u2019ex-conjointe de M. Bone, Mme Dianne Blackbird, et ses agissements contre Mme Polhill et les autres ex-partenaires de M. Bone;\no L\u2019adoption de la r\u00e9solution du conseil de bande \u00e0 la demande de Mme Blackbird avec l\u2019aide de Mme Karen Blackbird et leurs tentatives de divulguer \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 le contenu de ladite r\u00e9solution;\no Les remarques discriminatoires contre la plaignante effectu\u00e9es publiquement par Mmes Blackbird.\n\u00b7 Enfin, elle effectue deux autres modifications dans son expos\u00e9 des faits concernant de nouvelles demandes d\u2019assignation et la modification du r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de t\u00e9moignage de M. Wes Bone;\no La plaignante demande au Tribunal d\u2019assigner la compagnie Facebook ou l\u2019un de ses d\u00e9partements afin de d\u00e9voiler la v\u00e9ritable identit\u00e9 de la personne ayant frauduleusement ouvert un compte au nom de son conjoint;\no La plaignante demande au Tribunal d\u2019assigner Google (gmail) ou l\u2019un de ses d\u00e9partements afin de d\u00e9voiler la v\u00e9ritable identit\u00e9 de M. Brian Sharpe, personne envoyant des courriels d\u2019intimidation et de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 son conjoint;\no La plaignante demande au Tribunal de s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir de l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la personne ayant fait, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de sa fille, de fausses d\u00e9clarations en avril 2017 \u00e0 la \u00ab BC Employment and Assistance Office \u00bb \u00e0 Abbotsford (Colombie-Britannique);\no Quant aux modifications apport\u00e9es au t\u00e9moignage de M. Wes Bone, elle ajoute que ce dernier t\u00e9moignera \u00e9galement sur la r\u00e9solution du conseil de bande, sur Mme Dianne Blackbird, leur relation et ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents, sur l\u2019intimidation et les repr\u00e9sailles v\u00e9cues sur Facebook et via courriel, sur la gestion de la coupe des foins autour de leur maison et du \u00ab sweat lodge fire \u00bb, ainsi que sur les m\u00e9thodes traditionnelles utilis\u00e9es afin d\u2019aider et r\u00e9conforter la plaignante.\nB. L\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[11] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019oppose \u00e0 toute modification (ou ajout) demand\u00e9e par la plaignante. Le Tribunal peut r\u00e9sumer ses repr\u00e9sentations de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\n\u00b7 L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plaignante n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 les directives et les exigences du Tribunal notamment en ne surlignant pas toutes les modifications effectu\u00e9es et surtout, en ne justifiant pas leur ajout;\n\u00b7 L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que les propos de la plaignante varient avec le temps;\n\u00b7 L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plaignante n\u2019a pas fourni de liste de documents au soutien de sa demande et n\u2019a pas transmis les documents en sa possession;\n\u00b7 Quant aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles, l\u2019intim\u00e9e estime que l\u2019ajout demand\u00e9 par la plaignante est frivole et ne remplit pas les crit\u00e8res juridiques applicables en la mati\u00e8re;\n\u00b7 L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plaignante n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal de preuves solides et tangibles justifiant la modification de la plainte par l\u2019inclusion d\u2019actes de repr\u00e9sailles;\n\u00b7 L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de lien entre les faits nouveaux et la plainte d\u2019origine;\n\u00b7 L\u2019intim\u00e9e indique que certains faits nouveaux s\u2019inscrivent dans la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode que la plainte d\u2019origine. Cependant, elle fait valoir qu\u2019il faut plus qu\u2019une co\u00efncidence en mati\u00e8re de repr\u00e9sailles;\n\u00b7 Quant \u00e0 l\u2019ajout de l\u2019article 6(b) de la LCDP, l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019y oppose \u00e9galement, affirmant qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas fourni \u00e0 la plaignante de logement et que rien dans sa plainte ne permet de justifier un tel ajout.\nC. La Commission\n[12] J\u2019aimerais tout d\u2019abord mentionner que la Commission a fait un bon travail de concision dans sa r\u00e9ponse au Tribunal. Ceci \u00e9tant dit, la position de la Commission est divis\u00e9e selon l\u2019aspect en question. Sa position peut \u00eatre r\u00e9sum\u00e9e ainsi :\n\u00b7 La Commission pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de modifier l\u2019expos\u00e9 des faits pour demander des assignations ou fournir un nouveau r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de t\u00e9moignage. Elle propose de revisiter ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments ult\u00e9rieurement;\n\u00b7 Quant aux nouvelles violations de la LCDP et redressements recherch\u00e9s, la Commission se dissocie de la demande effectu\u00e9e par la plaignante et ne demande pas que les proc\u00e9dures soient modifi\u00e9es tel que propos\u00e9;\n\u00b7 La Commission a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu\u2019elle se concentrera davantage sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments invoqu\u00e9s dans la plainte initiale et plus particuli\u00e8rement les actes relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP;\n\u00b7 Quant aux faits nouveaux propos\u00e9s par la plainte, la Commission ne prend aucune position quant aux ajouts factuels propos\u00e9s. Elle indique que ces faits sont plut\u00f4t relatifs au contexte factuel du dossier. Ce faisant, et au cas o\u00f9 le Tribunal n\u2019autoriserait pas les modifications dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des faits de la plaignante, le Tribunal pourrait autoriser la plaignante \u00e0 faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ces informations lors de son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l\u2019audience (comme autoris\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Serge Lafreni\u00e8re c. Via Rail Canada Inc., 2017 TCDP 12);\n\u00b7 La Commission a \u00e9galement donn\u00e9 au Tribunal un aper\u00e7u du cadre juridique entourant les modifications d\u2019une plainte, d\u2019un expos\u00e9 des faits et en mati\u00e8re de repr\u00e9sailles;\n\u00b7 La Commission met l\u2019emphase sur le fait qu\u2019\u00e0 ce stade-ci des proc\u00e9dures, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a toujours pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des faits, sa liste de documents et sa liste de t\u00e9moins. Dans ces circonstances, les questions entourant le pr\u00e9judice ou l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 ne se posent pas r\u00e9ellement puisque l\u2019intim\u00e9e aura la pleine et enti\u00e8re possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gations;\n\u00b7 La Commission rappelle au Tribunal que si celui-ci accepte l\u2019ajout des actes discriminatoires en vertu des articles 6(b) et 14.1 de la LCDP, il devrait donner l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de modifier les redressements en cons\u00e9quence;\n\u00b7 La Commission fait valoir \u00e9galement que si l\u2019article 3(1) LCDP \u00e9nonce les motifs illicites de discrimination, il n\u2019autorise pas en soi un redressement.\nIII. Droit applicable\n[13] Il faut se rappeler que la plainte originale ne tient pas lieu de plaidoirie (Casler c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2017 TCDP 6, par. 9 [Casler]; voir aussi Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 1, par. 10 [Gaucher]). De plus, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Casler :\n[8] [\u2026] il faut garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une plainte constitue la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du processus de r\u00e9solution des plaintes en vertu de la Loi. \u2026. Comme l\u2019a affirm\u00e9 le Tribunal au paragraphe 11 de la d\u00e9cision Gaucher, \u00ab [i]l est in\u00e9vitable que de nouveaux faits et de nouvelles circonstances soient souvent r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s au cours de l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Il s\u2019ensuit que les plaintes sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es. \u00bb\n[14] Le Tribunal jouit d\u2019une grande discr\u00e9tion dans l\u2019instruction de la plainte conform\u00e9ment aux articles 48.9(1), 48.9(2), 49 et 50 de la LCDP. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 de multiples reprises que le Tribunal d\u00e9tient les pouvoirs de modifier la plainte d\u2019origine dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi par la Commission (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Parent, 2006 CF 1313 aux paragraphes 30, 41, 43).\n[15] L\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Assoc. canadienne des employ\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, 2002 CFPI 776, vient \u00e9galement \u00e9tablir les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux guidant le Tribunal relativement aux demandes de modification :\nEn r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, une demande d\u2019amendement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 devant le Tribunal devrait \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 tout stade de l'action aux fins de d\u00e9terminer les v\u00e9ritables questions litigieuses entre les parties, pourvu, notamment, que cette autorisation ne cause pas d'injustice \u00e0 l'autre partie que des d\u00e9pens ne pourraient r\u00e9parer, et qu'elle serve les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Assoc. canadienne des employ\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, 2002 CFPI 776 au para. 31, en se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 Canderel Ltd. c. Canada, 1993 CanLII 2990 (CAF), [1994] 1 C.F. 3 (C.A.F.)).\n(voir aussi Attaran c. Immigration, R\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et Citoyennet\u00e9 Canada (anciennement Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration Canada), 2017 TCDP 21, par. 16 [Attaran]; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du mus\u00e9e canadien des civilisations c. Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada (section locale 70396), 2006 CF 704, par. 40, 50 [Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du mus\u00e9e]; Gaucher, par. 10).\n[16] Par ailleurs, les modifications propos\u00e9es ne peuvent constituer en elles-m\u00eames une toute nouvelle plainte qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 initialement d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Commission (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du mus\u00e9e, par. 40, 50. Ces modifications doivent n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre li\u00e9es en fait ou en droit \u00e0 la plainte d\u2019origine : c\u2019est ce qu\u2019on appelle l\u2019existence d\u2019un nexus (voir Blodgett v. GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy Canada Inc., 2013 CHRT 24, par. 16-17; voir \u00e9galement Tran c. l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada, 2010 TCDP 31, par. 17).\n[17] L\u2019ajout d\u2019all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles s\u2019appuie sur les m\u00eames guides pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9nonc\u00e9s tant dans l\u2019ajout de motifs de distinction illicite que d\u2019actes discriminatoires. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprise qu\u2019il \u00ab serait difficile au plan pratique, inefficace et injuste d\u2019exiger que les personnes pr\u00e9sentent des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles seulement dans le cadre d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure distincte \u00bb (voir notamment Kavanagh c. S.C.C. (31 Mai 1999), T505\/2298 (T.C.D.P.); Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (Repr\u00e9sentant le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), 2012 TCDP 24, par. 14). Le Tribunal devrait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement autoriser une modification afin d\u2019y ajouter une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il soit manifeste et \u00e9vident qu\u2019une telle demande ne saurait \u00eatre jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e (voir Virk c. Bell Canada, 2004 TCDP 10, par. 7 [Virk]; voir \u00e9galement Palm c. ILWU Local 500 et al., 2015 TCDP 23, par. 12; Saviye c. Afroglobal Network Inc. et Michael Daramola, 2016 TCDP 18, par. 15 [Saviye]). Le Tribunal doit \u00e9galement veiller \u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ait un pr\u00e9avis suffisant lui permettant de se d\u00e9fendre convenablement et ainsi, \u00e9viter de lui causer pr\u00e9judice (voir notamment Virk, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragrahpe 8 ; voir \u00e9galement Saviye, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 17).\n[18] Enfin, lorsque le Tribunal doit analyser une demande de modification de la plainte, il ne devrait pas s\u2019engager dans une analyse en profondeur du bien-fond\u00e9 de ces modifications (voir Bressette c. Conseil de bande de la premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle et Stony Point, 2004 TCDP 2, par. 6 [Bressette]). C\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019audience que le Tribunal \u00e9value le bien-fond\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations et ce, lorsque toutes les parties ont eu l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de produire leurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve (voir Saviye au paragraphe 19 en se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 Bressette au paragraphe 8). Leur ajout ne constitue pas en soi une violation de la LCDP : encore faut-il que la plaignante s\u2019acquitte du fardeau de la preuve selon la balance des probabilit\u00e9s.\nIV. Analyse\nA. Non-respect des directives du Tribunal\n[19] Les proc\u00e9dures devant le Tribunal se veulent \u00eatre exp\u00e9ditives et le moins formalistes possibles (article 48.9 de la LCDP et r\u00e8gle 1(1)c) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03-05-04) (\u00ab R\u00e8gles \u00bb). Le 23 juillet 2017, la plaignante transmet aux parties et au Tribunal un courriel incluant en pi\u00e8ces jointes sa lettre de pr\u00e9sentation et ses modifications propos\u00e9es. Elle indique dans ce message qu\u2019elle a inclus les raisons expliquant ces modifications. Suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la plaignante transmet le 18 ao\u00fbt 2017 une r\u00e9plique dans laquelle elle r\u00e9it\u00e8re les raisons pour lesquelles elle demande les modifications.\n[20] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plaignante n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 les directives du Tribunal, n\u2019ayant pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 les raisons de la non-inclusion des modifications dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des faits initial. Je rappelle que la plaignante est non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et j\u2019estime que celle-ci a respect\u00e9 au mieux de ses capacit\u00e9s les demandes du Tribunal. Les proc\u00e9dures judiciaires et quasi judicaires peuvent \u00eatre complexes. Les justiciables ne sont que rarement impliqu\u00e9s dans ce type de proc\u00e9dures au courant de leur vie. On ne peut, tout \u00e0 coup, s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que ceux-ci agissent comme des officiers de justice et effectuent un travail de m\u00eame calibre. Le Tribunal saisit l\u2019id\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sous-tendant les modifications sollicit\u00e9es par la plaignante. Je suis satisfait de sa demande et de ses explications. Je ne donnerai donc pas suite \u00e0 l\u2019objection de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en la mati\u00e8re et j\u2019aborderai en d\u00e9tails les aspects des modifications propos\u00e9es.\nB. Pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[21] Dans un premier temps, j\u2019aborderai la notion de pr\u00e9judice contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e puisque je juge que cette question peut \u00eatre trait\u00e9e rapidement. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, les modifications devraient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00eatre permises pourvu qu\u2019elles ne d\u00e9bordent pas le cadre de la plainte initiale et qu\u2019elles ne causent pas un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. S\u2019il y a pr\u00e9judice, comment pouvons-nous le limiter ou le r\u00e9parer?\n[22] Dans le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je souscris \u00e0 l\u2019affirmation de la Commission selon laquelle les modifications sollicit\u00e9es par la plaignante ne portent pas pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. En effet, j\u2019estime que la demande de la plaignante tombe au bon moment : l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas encore d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des faits ni sa liste de documents et de t\u00e9moins. Elle aura donc toutes les opportunit\u00e9s et la latitude pour r\u00e9futer les all\u00e9gations initiales ou modifi\u00e9es avec les moyens de d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vus par la Loi, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant. La Commission aura l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de modifier \u00e9galement son expos\u00e9 des faits initial et la plaignante pourra d\u00e9poser une r\u00e9plique, si elle le d\u00e9sire. Je juge que cela respecte nettement les principes de justice naturelle et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9.\n[23] Comme j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de pr\u00e9judice pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e, j\u2019aborderai plut\u00f4t les modifications sous l\u2019angle du nexus avec la plainte d\u2019origine. Quant aux repr\u00e9sailles, je jugerai \u00e9galement si la demande est d\u00e9fendable ou soutenable selon les indications contenues dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Virk, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9.\nC. Article 6(b) de la LCDP \u2013 Traitement d\u00e9favorable dans la fourniture de logement\n[24] Dans sa plainte d\u2019origine, la plaignante affirme ne pas avoir re\u00e7u les prestations de nourriture et d\u2019abri auxquelles elle avait droit. De plus, elle indique qu\u2019une r\u00e9solution a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par le conseil de bande et d\u00e9clarant qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas le droit de demeurer sur le territoire de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Dans son expos\u00e9 des faits, elle indique \u00e9galement avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 contrainte de quitter le territoire ainsi que la maison qu\u2019elle partage avec son conjoint pour plusieurs raisons attribuables \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e notamment \u00e0 cause de la r\u00e9solution du conseil, des probl\u00e8mes de prestations, du harc\u00e8lement, de la pression, etc.\n[25] \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape-ci, je rappelle le Tribunal ne doit pas s\u2019engager dans une analyse en profondeur du bien-fond\u00e9 des modifications et des faits. Puisque la question du pr\u00e9judice a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e, je dois simplement d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe un lien entre ces modifications et la plainte initiale. J\u2019estime qu\u2019il existe effectivement un nexus. Les probl\u00e8mes avec les prestations d\u2019abri, la r\u00e9solution interdisant \u00e0 la plaignante de demeurer sur la r\u00e9serve, le harc\u00e8lement et la pression, etc., ont pu pousser la plaignante \u00e0 quitter sa r\u00e9sidence. Cons\u00e9quemment, j\u2019autorise l\u2019ajout d\u2019une all\u00e9gation d\u2019acte discriminatoire \u00e0 la plainte, au titre de l\u2019article 6(b) de la LCDP.\n[26] J\u2019attire cependant l\u2019attention sur le fait que la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019article 6(b) de la LCDP du fait de l\u2019ajout d\u2019all\u00e9gation ne constitue pas en soi une violation de la LCDP. Il ne s'agit pas pour moi d\u2019\u00e9valuer la preuve selon la balance des probabilit\u00e9s. Ceci sera fait \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. La plaignante doit encore d\u00e9montrer au Tribunal qu\u2019il y a une violation selon de le fardeau de la balance des probabilit\u00e9s. L\u2019intim\u00e9e aura l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de r\u00e9futer ces all\u00e9gations ou fournir un moyen de d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vu par la Loi.\nD. Article 14 de la LCDP \u2013 Harc\u00e8lement\n[27] La plaignante affirme, depuis le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte originale, avoir fait l\u2019objet d\u2019intimidation et de harc\u00e8lement sur Facebook, dans la communaut\u00e9, dans les bureaux de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, etc., et elle attribue la cause de ces actes \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ses repr\u00e9sentants ou ses affili\u00e9s.\n[28] La notion de harc\u00e8lement n\u2019est pas d\u00e9finie dans la LCDP. La jurisprudence nous \u00e9claire cependant et plus particuli\u00e8rement l\u2019arr\u00eat Siddoo c. Syndicat international des d\u00e9bardeurs et magasiniers, section locale 502, 2015 TCDP 21, par. 45-47. Ce ne sont pas tous les gestes insensibles, inintelligents, impertinents ou grossiers, qui donnent lieu \u00e0 une plainte en vertu de l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP. Le harc\u00e8lement doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 au cas par cas et sous l\u2019angle de la personne raisonnable dans les circonstances. Cette analyse doit se faire \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des faits et de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Cependant, ce n\u2019est pas \u00e0 ce stade-ci que je dois \u00e9valuer le bien-fond\u00e9 des gestes et de la violation.\n[29] Depuis le d\u00e9but du dossier, la plaignante affirme avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 intimid\u00e9e et harcel\u00e9e par le conseil, ses membres ou des gens qui lui sont li\u00e9s. S\u2019agissant de harc\u00e8lement, l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP n\u2019est qu\u2019une suite logique de ces all\u00e9gations. En cons\u00e9quence, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il existe un lien entre l\u2019ajout d\u2019all\u00e9gation au titre de l\u2019article 14 LCDP et la plainte originale.\n[30] Au risque de me r\u00e9p\u00e9ter, la plaignante doit encore s\u2019acquitter du fardeau de la preuve selon la balance des probabilit\u00e9s quant \u00e0 cet aspect et l\u2019intim\u00e9e aura, encore une fois, l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de r\u00e9futer les all\u00e9gations ou de pr\u00e9senter une d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vue par la Loi.\nE. Article 14.1 de la LCDP \u2013 Repr\u00e9sailles\n[31] En mati\u00e8re de repr\u00e9sailles, le Tribunal doit non seulement \u00e9valuer s\u2019il existe un nexus entre les all\u00e9gations et la plainte d\u2019origine, mais \u00e9galement d\u00e9terminer si la demande est d\u00e9fendable ou soutenable. Il faut se rappeler que dans la proc\u00e9dure en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce la plainte est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre la Nation elle-m\u00eame. Donc, la plaignante a le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer un lien entre les actes de repr\u00e9sailles all\u00e9gu\u00e9s et les actions prises par la Nation ou les agents de celle-ci.\n[32] L\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP concerne la victime des repr\u00e9sailles ou celle qui agit en son nom. Le Tribunal a r\u00e9vis\u00e9 la plainte initiale et l\u2019expos\u00e9 des faits de la plaignante et de la Commission. Il est clair pour moi que la victime de la plainte est Mme Polhill personnellement : sa fille ou son conjoint ne sont pas vis\u00e9s comme victimes par la plainte d\u2019origine. Cependant, le Tribunal est d\u2019avis qu\u2019on ne peut pas d\u00e9terminer clairement si l\u2019instruction devrait se terminer ici. De tout temps, le Tribunal a abord\u00e9 la question des repr\u00e9sailles dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles visent directement la personne qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e (voir Warman c. Winnicki, 2006 TCDP 20, par. 113). Sans se prononcer sur le fond de la question dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal estime qu\u2019on peut soutenir qu\u2019un acte commis contre une tierce personne, comme l\u2019\u00e9poux ou la fille de la plaignante, peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme des repr\u00e9sailles contre la plaignante elle-m\u00eame. Sur ce point, le Tribunal voudrait attirer l\u2019attention des parties sur la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019affaire Singh (Re), [1989] 1 C.F. 430, page 442, dans laquelle la Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nLa question est de savoir qui est la \u00ab victime \u00bb de l\u2019acte discriminatoire reproch\u00e9 est presque une question de fait. La l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne ne tient pas tant compte de l\u2019intention \u00e0 l\u2019origine des actes discriminatoires que de leur effet. L\u2019effet n\u2019est d\u2019aucune fa\u00e7on limit\u00e9e \u00e0 la \u00ab cible \u00bb pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e de l\u2019acte discriminatoire et il est tout \u00e0 fait concevable qu\u2019un acte discriminatoire puisse avoir des cons\u00e9quences qui sont suffisamment directes et imm\u00e9diates pour justifier qu\u2019on qualifie de \u00ab victimes \u00bb des personnes qui n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 vis\u00e9es par l\u2019auteur des actes en question.\nCompte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas convaincu que les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles se rapportant \u00e0 des actes commis contre M. Bone ou la fille de la plaignante n\u2019ont aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s sur le fond. Le Tribunal accueille donc les modifications que la plaignante a propos\u00e9 d\u2019apporter \u00e0 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions en ce qui concerne la fausse page Facebook de Wes Bone, les courriels provenant de Brian Sharpe et les prestations perdues par la fille de la plaignante. Le Tribunal attend avec int\u00e9r\u00eat de recevoir les observations des parties sur cette question \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[33] La plaignante aborde \u00e9galement d\u2019autres situations de repr\u00e9sailles pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es qui la touchent personnellement notamment cette situation concernant l\u2019inondation dans le sous-sol, la coupe des foins autour de la maison et l\u2019histoire des chevaux. Quant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re situation, le Tribunal croit comprendre que la plaignante soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas agi correctement ou rapidement, ce qui constitue selon elle des repr\u00e9sailles. Dans la seconde, elle affirme que le chef du conseil est intervenu dans une entente contractuelle qu\u2019elle aurait pu avoir avec une tierce personne quant \u00e0 la coupe des foins. Dans la troisi\u00e8me situation, elle soutient que le chef a tent\u00e9 de lui nuire en l\u2019informant que ces chevaux s\u2019\u00e9taient vraisemblablement enfuis de leur enclos. Ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements se sont produits apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte en avril 2014. Je r\u00e9affirme que je ne peux me prononcer sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de ces all\u00e9gations. Cependant, je dois d\u00e9terminer si ces derni\u00e8res sont d\u00e9fendables. Est-il \u00ab [\u2026] manifeste et \u00e9vident que les all\u00e9gations faisant l\u2019objet de la demande de modification ne sauraient \u00eatre jug\u00e9es fond\u00e9es \u00bb (voir Bressette, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 6)? Sans avoir la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019entendre toute la preuve quant \u00e0 ces all\u00e9gations, il n\u2019est pas aussi manifeste et \u00e9vident que celles-ci sauraient \u00eatre jug\u00e9es non fond\u00e9es. J\u2019autoriserai donc l\u2019ajout de ces modifications. N\u00e9anmoins, encore faut-il que la plaignante puisse faire la preuve de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments selon la balance des probabilit\u00e9s. L\u2019intim\u00e9e aura l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de r\u00e9futer les all\u00e9gations ou pr\u00e9senter sa d\u00e9fense.\n[34] Enfin, la plaignante pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019un autre acte de repr\u00e9sailles a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis r\u00e9cemment. Une personne aurait effectu\u00e9 de fausses d\u00e9clarations \u00e0 la GRC. Un agent se serait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au domicile de la plaignante afin de l\u2019aviser qu\u2019elle est accus\u00e9e de fraude. La plaignante attribue cette situation aux agissements de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, mais ne peut identifier la personne \u00e0 l\u2019origine de ces d\u00e9clarations. Dans le cas des autres all\u00e9gations, la plaignante explique de fa\u00e7on assez claire l\u2019implication de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou de ses repr\u00e9sentants. Dans la situation impliquant la GRC, il est tr\u00e8s difficile pour le Tribunal de faire le lien entre la personne qui aurait fait de fausses d\u00e9clarations et l\u2019intim\u00e9e et ce, malgr\u00e9 analyse sommaire des circonstances et des inf\u00e9rences qui peuvent \u00eatre tir\u00e9es. Dans cette situation, j\u2019estime que les all\u00e9gations ne sont pas soutenables et pour ces raisons, je n\u2019autoriserai pas les modifications quant \u00e0 cet aspect pr\u00e9cis.\n[35] Le Tribunal rappelle aux parties qu\u2019il revient \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019\u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 son encontre. Autrement dit, pour chaque all\u00e9gation, la plaignante doit montrer (i) qu\u2019elle a subi, par suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte, un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou d\u2019une personne agissant en son nom; et (ii) que la plainte a constitu\u00e9 un facteur \u00e0 l\u2019origine du traitement pr\u00e9judiciable (voir Tabor c. La Premi\u00e8re nation Millbrook, 2015 TCDP 18, par. 6).\nF. Autres modifications\n[36] La plaignante effectue \u00e9galement d\u2019autres modifications dans son expos\u00e9 des faits. \u00c0 mon avis, ces modifications rel\u00e8vent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement du contexte factuel d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tabli initialement. La plaignante pr\u00e9cise certaines situations ou corrige certaines erreurs comme l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2014 au lieu de 2013. Comme l\u2019indiquent les arr\u00eats Gaucher et Casler, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s, la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission n\u2019est que sommaire : elle se pr\u00e9cise n\u00e9cessairement en cours de processus. C\u2019est dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des faits que les conditions de l\u2019audience se pr\u00e9cisent. Comme les modifications ne changent pas substantiellement l\u2019essence du dossier et comme j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le pr\u00e9judice pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e est inexistant, j\u2019autoriserai les diverses modifications. La plaignante a le fardeau de prouver ses all\u00e9gations \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\nG. Redressements\n[37] J\u2019ai autoris\u00e9 la plaignante \u00e0 modifier sa plainte d\u2019origine afin d\u2019y ajouter les actes discriminatoires, avec certaines restrictions, en vertu des articles 6(b), 14 et 14.1 de la LCDP. Parall\u00e8lement, la plaignante devrait avoir l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de modifier les redressements en cons\u00e9quence. Comme le pr\u00e9cisent les membres Marchildon et Lustig dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada et al. c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (pour le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), 2016 TCDP 2, par. 469 :\n[469] Il est \u00e9galement important de rappeler que la LCDP consacre des droits qui rev\u00eatent une importance primordiale. Ces droits doivent \u00eatre pleinement reconnus et mis en \u0153uvre par le biais de la Loi. Lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019\u00e9laborer des r\u00e9parations sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP, il convient d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter les pouvoirs qui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s au Tribunal en vertu du paragraphe 53(2) de la fa\u00e7on juste, large et lib\u00e9rale la plus propre \u00e0 assurer la r\u00e9alisation des objets de la Loi. Lorsqu\u2019on applique une m\u00e9thode d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique, les r\u00e9parations pr\u00e9vues par la LCDP devraient promouvoir efficacement le droit \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger et d\u00e9fendre utilement les droits et libert\u00e9s de la victime de l\u2019acte discriminatoire (CN c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), [1987] 1 RCS 1114, p. 1134; et Doucet\u2011Boudreau, par. 25 et 55).\nLorsque le Tribunal d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il y a eu violation de la LCDP et qu\u2019un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis, la Loi pr\u00e9voit les r\u00e9parations qui peuvent \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9es afin de corriger la situation. Sans redressement, l\u2019objet de la Loi ne peut \u00eatre atteint.\n[38] Ceci \u00e9tant dit, il n\u2019est pas clair pour moi quels sont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment les redressements que la plaignante demande. En effet, elle r\u00e9clame 20 000$ pour chacune des violations des articles 3(1), 6(b) et 14.1 de la LCDP. Je rappelle d\u2019abord que l\u2019article 3(1) de la LCDP n\u2019entra\u00eene pas en soi un redressement puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de l\u2019article qui \u00e9nonce les motifs de distinction illicites. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire donnant lieu \u00e0 un redressement en vertu de l\u2019article 53(2) de la LCDP. Cons\u00e9quemment, je n\u2019autoriserai pas cette modification. Quant aux deux autres r\u00e9clamations de 20 000$ au titre des articles 6(b) et 14.1 de la LCDP, la plaignante n\u2019a pas indiqu\u00e9 si elle r\u00e9clamait ces montants en vertu de l\u2019article 53(2)e) de la LCDP pour le pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019elle aurait subi ou en vertu de l\u2019article 53(3) de la LCDP pour un pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[39] Je consid\u00e8re que ces omissions ne sont pas graves \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape du processus, mais il faudra que la plaignante pr\u00e9cise ses intentions et ce, avant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e se lance dans son expos\u00e9 des faits. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a le droit de comprendre clairement les faits qui lui sont reproch\u00e9s et les redressements qui sont demand\u00e9s. Je pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019il y a une diff\u00e9rence entre les dommages pour pr\u00e9judice moral et les dommages pour des actes d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9s ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9s. La preuve que soumettra l\u2019intim\u00e9e sera adapt\u00e9e en cons\u00e9quence. Cette question devra \u00eatre clarifi\u00e9e dans une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique suivant la publication de ce jugement mais avant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9pare son expos\u00e9 des faits.\nH. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de M. Bone\n[40] Le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de t\u00e9moignage que fournissent les parties ne sont qu\u2019une \u00e9bauche sommaire des faits sur lesquels le t\u00e9moin viendra t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l\u2019audience (voir article 6(1)(f) des R\u00e8gles). La plaignante a tout de m\u00eame d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de pr\u00e9ciser le t\u00e9moignage de M. Bone dans son expos\u00e9 des faits modifi\u00e9 et a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de modifier le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de celui-ci. La plaignante fait \u00e9tat de nouveaux faits et de nouveaux actes discriminatoires et elle informe les parties que M. Bone t\u00e9moignera sur le sujet \u00e0 l\u2019audience. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de la plaignante \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape-ci, j\u2019autoriserai cette modification. Comme l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des faits, il lui sera loisible de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 de telles all\u00e9gations, produire ses documents et assigner ses t\u00e9moins en cons\u00e9quence.\nI. Assignations\n[41] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 50(3)a) de la Loi, le membre instructeur a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de d\u00e9livrer une assignation s\u2019il l\u2019estime n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019examen complet de la plainte (Association canadienne des employ\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone c. Bell Canada, 2000 CanLII 20416 [Bell Canada]; voir \u00e9galement Schecter c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2005 TCDP 35, par. 20 [Schecter]). De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, l\u2019assignation vise \u00e0 contraindre une tierce personne \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner sous serment, oralement ou par \u00e9crit ou \u00e0 produire des documents et des pi\u00e8ces en sa possession. Pour rendre sa d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal \u00e9value les facteurs en se demandant notamment, s\u2019il existe un lien rationnel entre les renseignements demand\u00e9s et les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9es dans les observations des parties, si la demande \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une recherche \u00e0 l\u2019aveuglette et si la demande est oppressive, en ce sens qu\u2019elle oblige un individu \u00e9tranger au litige \u00e0 se soumettre \u00e0 une recherche on\u00e9reuse et fort \u00e9tendue de documentation (voir Bell Canada).\n[42] Il est \u00e9vident que l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019auteur de la page Facebook et du compte Gmail engage la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou de l\u2019un de ses agents. Cependant, il n\u2019est pas \u00e9vident au Tribunal que la page Facebook ou le compte Gmail contiennent les renseignements demand\u00e9s par la plaignante. Par exemple, si la personne peut seulement \u00eatre identifi\u00e9e par son adresse IP, la coop\u00e9ration du fournisseur de service Internet sera requise. La plaignante devra peut-\u00eatre demander au fournisseur Internet de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler l\u2019identit\u00e9 ou l\u2019adresse de la personne. D\u2019autres assignations pourraient \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaires.\n[43] Le Tribunal ne sait pas si la plaignante a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait des d\u00e9marches pour communiquer avec ces tierces personnes ni si elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 identifi\u00e9 une personne ou un service en particulier aux fins de la signification des assignations. Le Tribunal ne d\u00e9livrera pas une assignation pour contraindre un t\u00e9moin \u00e0 compara\u00eetre ou \u00e0 produire un document ou des \u00e9l\u00e9ments mat\u00e9riels dans une instance sans d\u2019abord recevoir davantage de pr\u00e9cisions. Vu l\u2019absence de donn\u00e9es pr\u00e9cises, le Tribunal estime qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas en mesure de se prononcer sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019une assignation \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de Facebook ou de Google pour le moment. Cette question pourra \u00eatre discut\u00e9e entre les parties et le Tribunal \u00e0 la prochaine conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance.\n[44] Dans le m\u00eame esprit, le Tribunal a de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de d\u00e9livrer une assignation \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du \u00ab BC Employment and Assistance Office \u00bb pour le moment puisqu\u2019il n\u2019est pas \u00e9vident que le bureau a en sa possession les renseignements demand\u00e9s. Premi\u00e8rement, la plaignante n\u2019a pas identifi\u00e9 l\u2019employ\u00e9e qui a re\u00e7u l\u2019appel anonyme. Deuxi\u00e8mement, il n\u2019est pas \u00e9vident que l\u2019employ\u00e9e devrait se fier seulement \u00e0 sa m\u00e9moire pour identifier la voix de l\u2019auteur de l\u2019appel anonyme ou qu\u2019un enregistrement de la conversation pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e pourrait \u00eatre produit. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas obtenu les pr\u00e9cisions requises pour d\u00e9cider si l\u2019assignation est n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 ce stade, il ne d\u00e9livrera pas d\u2019assignation pour le moment. Encore une fois, cette question pourra \u00eatre discut\u00e9e entre les parties et le Tribunal \u00e0 la prochaine conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance.\n[45] Le Tribunal rappelle aux parties que, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 50(6) de la Loi, \u00ab les t\u00e9moins assign\u00e9s \u00e0 compara\u00eetre en vertu du pr\u00e9sent article peuvent, \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du membre instructeur, recevoir les frais et indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9s aux t\u00e9moins assign\u00e9s devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb (voir Day c. Canada (D\u00e9fense nationale), 2003 TCDP 7 aux paragraphes 2 et 3). Par cons\u00e9quent, en application des R\u00e8gles 41 et 42 et du tarif A des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, DORS\/98-106, chaque t\u00e9moin convoqu\u00e9 pour d\u00e9poser a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 de 20 $ par jour plus les frais de d\u00e9placement raisonnables engag\u00e9s par la partie qui a assign\u00e9 le t\u00e9moin \u00e0 compara\u00eetre.\nJ. Divulgation des documents par la plaignante\n[46] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plaignante n\u2019a pas transmis aux parties la liste des documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession et qui sont potentiellement pertinents au litige. L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande que la plaignante transmette lesdits documents ainsi qu\u2019une liste.\n[47] Effectivement, en examinant le dossier, je constate que la Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa liste de documents le 13 novembre 2015 ainsi qu\u2019une liste de documents suppl\u00e9mentaires en date du 26 octobre 2016. La plaignante n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de telle liste. Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas au fait non plus des divers aspects de la divulgation entre les parties. C\u2019est \u00e0 ce stade-ci qu\u2019une des parties me fait une telle demande.\n[48] Bri\u00e8vement, je rappelle aux parties l\u2019article 50(1) de la LCDP qui \u00e9nonce notamment que les parties ont le droit \u00e0 une audience pleine, enti\u00e8re et peuvent soumettre des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations. Ce droit inclut \u00e9galement la divulgation de la preuve : les parties ont l\u2019obligation de divulguer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019elles ont en leur possession ou sous leur contr\u00f4le (Guay c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale), 2004 TCDP 34, par. 40 [Guay]). C\u2019est \u00e9galement ce que pr\u00e9voient les articles 6(1)d) et 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles. Tous les documents qui sont potentiellement pertinents au litige doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s (Bushey c. Sharma, 2003 TCDP 5, par. 4; Hughes c. Transport Canada, 2012 TCDP 26, par. 20, 25-26; voir subsidiairement Guay au paragraphe 40, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9; Day c. Minist\u00e8re de la d\u00e9fense nationale et Hortie, d\u00e9cision no 3, 2002\/12\/06; Warman c. Bahr, 2006 TCDP 18, par. 7 [Warman]; Seeley c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2013 TCDP 18, par. 6; Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 42, par. 10-11). Je pr\u00e9cise que ce seuil de la pertinence all\u00e9gu\u00e9e est tr\u00e8s peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 (Warman, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par. 6).\n[49] La plaignante doit donc divulguer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e et \u00e0 la Commission tous les documents \u00e0 pertinence all\u00e9gu\u00e9e en sa possession. Elle devra \u00e9galement effectuer une liste de ces documents, accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019une tr\u00e8s courte description des documents. Les documents pour lesquels la plaignante r\u00e9clame un privil\u00e8ge (par exemple le privil\u00e8ge de m\u00e9diation, d\u2019entente ou de litige) devront faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une liste diff\u00e9rente, accompagn\u00e9e elle aussi d\u2019une courte description. Je rappelle que ces documents ne doivent pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s puisqu\u2019un privil\u00e8ge est r\u00e9clam\u00e9. Je renvoie la plaignante aux listes de la Commission dat\u00e9es des 13 novembre 2015 et 26 octobre 2016 \u00e0 titre de bon exemple de listes \u00e0 transmettre aux parties.\n[50] Le d\u00e9lai de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de telles listes et celui de divulgation des documents par la plaignante seront d\u00e9termin\u00e9s lors d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, apr\u00e8s la distribution de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nV. Remarques suppl\u00e9mentaires\n[51] Je me permets de rappeler aux parties que les droits et libert\u00e9s fondamentaux sont intrins\u00e8ques \u00e0 tout individu en tant qu\u2019\u00eatre humain. Garantir ces droits inh\u00e9rents est d\u2019une importance capitale dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9mocratique, \u00e9galitaire et juste. Ces garanties permettent de pr\u00e9server la dignit\u00e9 humaine. Comme la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada l\u2019a d\u00e9crit dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Law c. Canada (Ministre de l'Emploi et de l'Immigration), [1999] 1 RCS 497, 1999 CanLII 675 (CSC) au paragraphe 53 :\n[53] [\u2026] La dignit\u00e9 humaine signifie qu\u2019une personne ou un groupe ressent du respect et de l\u2019estime de soi. Elle rel\u00e8ve de l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 physique et psychologique et de la prise en main personnelle. La dignit\u00e9 humaine est bafou\u00e9e par le traitement injuste fond\u00e9 sur des caract\u00e9ristiques ou la situation personnelles qui n\u2019ont rien \u00e0 voir avec les besoins, les capacit\u00e9s ou les m\u00e9rites de la personne. Elle est rehauss\u00e9e par des lois qui sont sensibles aux besoins, aux capacit\u00e9s et aux m\u00e9rites de diff\u00e9rentes personnes et qui tiennent compte du contexte sous\u2011jacent \u00e0 leurs diff\u00e9rences. La dignit\u00e9 humaine est bafou\u00e9e lorsque des personnes et des groupes sont marginalis\u00e9s, mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 et d\u00e9valoris\u00e9s, et elle est rehauss\u00e9e lorsque les lois reconnaissent le r\u00f4le \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re jou\u00e9 par tous dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne. Au sens de la garantie d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, la dignit\u00e9 humaine n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec le statut ou la position d\u2019une personne dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en soi, mais elle a plut\u00f4t trait \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont il est raisonnable qu\u2019une personne se sente face \u00e0 une loi donn\u00e9e.\n[52] Le Tribunal est l\u2019un des quelques corps permettant aux personnes de faire valoir leur droit \u00ab dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligatoires au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins\u00bb et ce, ind\u00e9pendamment de toutes consid\u00e9rations, caract\u00e9ristiques ou situations personnelles (article 2 de la LCDP). Les sujets abord\u00e9s par les plaignants devant le Tribunal touchent leur dignit\u00e9, leur estime de soi et peuvent \u00eatre profond\u00e9ment sensibles.\n[53] Chaque partie a le droit d\u2019\u00eatre entendue pleinement et enti\u00e8rement par le Tribunal. Ce dernier est guid\u00e9 par des principes de justice naturelle et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9. Les parties en d\u00e9fense ont le droit de ne pas \u00eatre en accord avec les plaignants et peuvent r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gations avanc\u00e9es. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, les sujets abord\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re des droits et libert\u00e9s de la personne sont d\u00e9licats et concernent des individus. En cons\u00e9quence, les soumissions des parties doivent faire preuve de retenues et de d\u00e9licatesse. J\u2019invite donc les parties \u00e0 faire preuve de retenue dans l\u2019utilisation de certaines expressions.\n[54] Enfin, j\u2019ajouterai que je ne souscris pas aux propos de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon lesquels la demande de la plaignante est d\u2019une futilit\u00e9 telle qu\u2019elle confine au gaspillage des ressources du Tribunal. Je rappelle que l\u2019intim\u00e9e, sur une p\u00e9riode de plus d\u2019une ann\u00e9e et demie, n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 au processus quasi judicaire du Tribunal. Ce dernier lui a envoy\u00e9 22 correspondances avec accus\u00e9 de r\u00e9ception en plus de lui signifier l\u2019avis d\u2019audience par huissier de justice. Enfin, le Tribunal, son greffier et la Commission se sont d\u00e9plac\u00e9s au lieu de l\u2019audience afin d\u2019instruire la plainte, mais l\u2019audience en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e. Ce faisant, toutes les ressources du Tribunal ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es afin de garantir les droits des uns et des autres \u2013 qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, de la plaignante, ou de la Commission dont l\u2019objectif est de prot\u00e9ger les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne.\nVI. Ordonnances\n[55] Pour ces motifs, j\u2019autorise les modifications suivantes :\n\u00b7 Dans la section \u00ab Introduction \u00bb :\no Toutes les modifications entre \u00ab I, Tracy M. M.

D\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan\nEn date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, le Canada cessera de s\u2019appuyer sur les d\u00e9finitions du principe de Jordan qui ne se conforment pas aux ordonnances de la formation rendues dans 2016 TCDP 2, 2016 TCDP 10, 2016 TCDP 16 et dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, et cessera de les perp\u00e9tuer.\nEn date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, la d\u00e9finition utilis\u00e9e par le Canada se fondera sur les principes cl\u00e9s suivants afin de d\u00e9finir et d\u2019appliquer le principe de Jordan :\nLe principe de Jordan est un principe qui place l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019enfant en priorit\u00e9 et qui s\u2019applique \u00e9galement \u00e0 tous les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations, qu\u2019ils vivent dans une r\u00e9serve ou non. Il n\u2019est pas limit\u00e9 aux enfants qui sont en situation de d\u00e9ficience ou qui ont, \u00e0 court terme, des affections m\u00e9dicales ou sociales particuli\u00e8res g\u00e9n\u00e9rant des besoins critiques \u00e0 recevoir des services de sant\u00e9 et des services sociaux ou ayant une incidence sur leurs activit\u00e9s de la vie quotidienne.\nLe principe de Jordan r\u00e9pond aux besoins des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations en s\u2019assurant qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de lacunes dans les services gouvernementaux qui sont offerts \u00e0 ces enfants. Il peut notamment r\u00e9pondre aux lacunes dans la prestation des services de sant\u00e9 mentale, d\u2019\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e, de kin\u00e9sith\u00e9rapie, d\u2019orthophonie et de physioth\u00e9rapie, ainsi que dans l\u2019obtention d\u2019\u00e9quipement m\u00e9dical.\nLorsqu\u2019un service gouvernemental, y compris une \u00e9valuation de service, est offert \u00e0 tous les autres enfants, le minist\u00e8re contact\u00e9 en premier doit payer pour les services, sans tenir de conf\u00e9rence de gestion administrative de cas, proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen des politiques, naviguer \u00e0 travers les diff\u00e9rents services, ou toute autre proc\u00e9dure administrative semblable avant que le service recommand\u00e9 soit approuv\u00e9 et qu\u2019un financement soit fourni. Le Canada peut uniquement tenir des conf\u00e9rences de gestion de cas cliniques avec des professionnels poss\u00e9dant des comp\u00e9tences et une formation pertinentes avant l\u2019approbation et le financement du service recommand\u00e9, dans la mesure o\u00f9 de telles consultations sont raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaires pour d\u00e9terminer les besoins cliniques du demandeur. Si des professionnels poss\u00e9dant des comp\u00e9tences et une formation pertinentes sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 assign\u00e9s au dossier d\u2019un enfant d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation, le Canada consulte ces professionnels et ne fait appel \u00e0 d\u2019autres professionnels que si ceux assign\u00e9s au dossier ne sont pas en mesure de fournir l\u2019information clinique n\u00e9cessaire. Le Canada peut \u00e9galement consulter la famille, la collectivit\u00e9 de la Premi\u00e8re Nation ou les fournisseurs de services pour financer les services dans les d\u00e9lais impartis aux sous alin\u00e9as 135(2)(A)(ii) et 135(2)(A)(ii.1) lorsque les services sont disponibles. Le Canada d\u00e9ploiera tous les efforts raisonnables afin de s\u2019assurer que le financement est fourni dans un d\u00e9lai qui correspond autant que possible au d\u00e9lai imparti si le service n\u2019est pas disponible. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019approbation et le financement du service recommand\u00e9, le minist\u00e8re contact\u00e9 en premier pourra se faire rembourser par un autre minist\u00e8re ou gouvernement.\nLorsqu\u2019un service gouvernemental, y compris une \u00e9valuation de service, n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement offert \u00e0 tous les autres enfants ou, s\u2019il exc\u00e8de la norme en mati\u00e8re de soins, le minist\u00e8re contact\u00e9 en premier doit \u00e9valuer les besoins particuliers de l\u2019enfant afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il est opportun de lui offrir le service demand\u00e9 au nom du principe de l`\u00e9galit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle en mati\u00e8re de fourniture de services, par souci de prestation de services adapt\u00e9s aux particularit\u00e9s culturelles et\/ou de protection de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019enfant. Lorsque de tels services sont offerts, le minist\u00e8re contact\u00e9 en premier doit payer pour les services, sans tenir des conf\u00e9rences de gestion de cas administratives, proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen des politiques, naviguer \u00e0 travers les diff\u00e9rents services ou toute autre proc\u00e9dure administrative semblable avant l\u2019approbation et le financement du service recommand\u00e9. Une conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas clinique peut \u00eatre tenue seulement aux fins pr\u00e9vues au sous-alin\u00e9a 135(1)(B)(iii). Le Canada peut \u00e9galement consulter la famille, la collectivit\u00e9 de la Premi\u00e8re Nation ou les fournisseurs de services pour financer les services dans les d\u00e9lais impartis aux sous alin\u00e9as 135(2)(A)(ii) et 135(2)(A)(ii.1) lorsque les services sont disponibles. Le Canada d\u00e9ploiera tous les efforts raisonnables afin de s\u2019assurer que le financement est fourni dans un d\u00e9lai qui correspond autant que possible au d\u00e9lai imparti si le service n\u2019est pas disponible. Une fois que le service recommand\u00e9 aura a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni, le minist\u00e8re contact\u00e9 en premier pourra demander \u00e0 un autre minist\u00e8re ou au gouvernement de le rembourser.\nBien que le principe de Jordan puisse s\u2019appliquer aux conflits de comp\u00e9tence entre les gouvernements (c. \u00e0 d. entre les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, provinciaux ou territoriaux) et aux conflits de comp\u00e9tences entre les minist\u00e8res d\u2019un m\u00eame gouvernement, un tel conflit n\u2019est pas une condition n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019application du principe de Jordan.\nLe Canada n\u2019utilisera pas ni ne diffusera une d\u00e9finition du principe de Jordan qui restreigne d\u2019une mani\u00e8re quelconque les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au point 1B.\nLe Canada r\u00e9examinera les demandes ant\u00e9rieures de financement qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9es soit en application du principe de Jordan ou autrement \u00e0 partir du 1er avril 2009 pour veiller au respect des principes susmentionn\u00e9s.

Alizadeh-Ebadi et qu\u2019\u00e0 ce titre, ils n\u2019avaient pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate de la Commission et ne faisaient donc pas partie du dossier qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 au Tribunal pour instruction. MTS a affirm\u00e9 que le Tribunal n\u2019en \u00e9tait pas ad\u00e9quatement saisi dans le cadre de l\u2019instruction de la plainte demand\u00e9e par la Commission.\n[6] Une suspension de l\u2019audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenue pour permettre aux parties de discuter plus \u00e0 fond de cette question entre elles. Apr\u00e8s la reprise de l\u2019audience plus tard ce matin\u2011l\u00e0, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, avec le consentement de MTS, a demand\u00e9 un ajournement de l\u2019instance pour lui permettre de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 nouveau devant la Commission dans le but de demander \u00e0 celle\u2011ci de se pencher sur une autre plainte fond\u00e9e sur la nouvelle all\u00e9gation figurant dans la modification propos\u00e9e au paragraphe 17, y compris le motif illicite de la d\u00e9ficience. J\u2019ai fait droit \u00e0 la demande d\u2019ajournement sine die de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi.\n[7] L\u2019avocat de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a fait parvenir au Tribunal une lettre dat\u00e9e du 7 novembre 2014, qui portait sur l\u2019\u00e9tat de l\u2019instance. Dans sa lettre, l\u2019avocat indiquait que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi [traduction] \u00ab a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une autre plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la CCDP) concernant notamment des all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles MTS aurait agi de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire envers lui en raison d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience \u00bb. La lettre renvoyait au fait que la Commission examinait l\u2019affaire en lien avec l\u2019application possible de l\u2019article 41(1)e) de la LCDP et que la Commission ferait enqu\u00eate sur l\u2019autre plainte seulement si la question de l\u2019article 41 \u00e9tait r\u00e9gl\u00e9e.\n[8] Par la suite, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas se pencher sur l\u2019autre plainte de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi au motif qu\u2019il y avait prescription en vertu de l\u2019article 41(1)e) de la LCDP. Pour ce motif, l\u2019autre plainte n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate et le Tribunal n\u2019en a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi. La d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas se pencher sur l\u2019autre plainte n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une r\u00e9vision judiciaire. \u00c0 la suite de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de nouveau dans lequel il avait retir\u00e9 du paragraphe 17 modifi\u00e9 le passage qui portait sur la nouvelle all\u00e9gation et les motifs illicites de la race et de la d\u00e9ficience qui y \u00e9taient li\u00e9s. Les trois versions du paragraphe 17, dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions initial de M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi, dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 et dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de nouveau, se pr\u00e9sentent comme suit :\n[traduction]\n1. Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions initial\nEntre 2007 et le d\u00e9but de 2009, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 de maladie prolong\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un grave accident d\u2019automobile qui ne lui \u00e9tait pas imputable. Pendant son absence, Brenda Coutts, sa chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, a enlev\u00e9 son ordinateur sans en sauvegarder le contenu sur un disque compact. Quand le plaignant a fait part de son insatisfaction \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard lors de son retour au travail, Mme Coutts lui a dit ce qui suit : \u00ab ce sont des choses qui arrivent, tant pis \u00bb. Quand il a critiqu\u00e9 cette r\u00e9ponse, Mme Coutts lui a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il \u00ab fr\u00f4lait l\u2019insubordination \u00bb. Elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des excuses par la suite pour ses commentaires.\n2. Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9\nEntre 2007 et le d\u00e9but de 2009, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 de maladie prolong\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un grave accident d\u2019automobile qui ne lui \u00e9tait pas imputable. MTS a exig\u00e9 que le plaignant rentre au travail seulement une fois qu\u2019il serait enti\u00e8rement r\u00e9tabli de l\u2019accident. MTS n\u2019a pas permis un retour graduel au travail ni aucune autre mesure d\u2019adaptation significative. Ce traitement de la part de ses superviseurs, y compris Wayne Horseman et Brenda Coutts, \u00e9tait d\u00e9favorable par rapport \u00e0 celui qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 offert \u00e0 d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient retourn\u00e9s au travail apr\u00e8s un cong\u00e9 autoris\u00e9, ce que le plaignant attribue \u00e0 sa race et \u00e0 ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de d\u00e9ficience. Pendant son absence, Brenda Coutts, sa chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, a enlev\u00e9 son ordinateur sans en sauvegarder le contenu sur un disque compact. Quand le plaignant a fait part de son insatisfaction \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard lors de son retour au travail, Mme Coutts lui a dit ce qui suit : \u00ab ce sont des choses qui arrivent, tant pis \u00bb. Quand il a critiqu\u00e9 cette r\u00e9ponse, Mme Coutts lui a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il \u00ab fr\u00f4lait l\u2019insubordination \u00bb. Elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des excuses par la suite pour ses commentaires.\n3. Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de nouveau\nEntre le 26 avril 2007 et le mois de f\u00e9vrier 2009, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 de maladie prolong\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un grave accident d\u2019automobile qui ne lui \u00e9tait pas imputable. De juin 2007 \u00e0 f\u00e9vrier 2009, il a pris un cong\u00e9 sans solde de MTS. Le plaignant a re\u00e7u une indemnit\u00e9 de remplacement du revenu de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019assurance publique du Manitoba (la SAPM) entre le 3 mai 2007 et le 11 avril 2008. Pendant toute la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019absence du plaignant, le coordonnateur des retours au travail, Des Hathaway, et MTS ont communiqu\u00e9 entre eux au sujet du retour au travail du plaignant. Pendant son absence, Brenda Coutts, sa chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, a enlev\u00e9 son ordinateur sans en sauvegarder le contenu sur un disque compact. Quand le plaignant a fait part de son insatisfaction \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard lors de son retour au travail, Mme Coutts lui a dit ce qui suit : \u00ab ce sont des choses qui arrivent, tant pis \u00bb. Quand il a critiqu\u00e9 cette r\u00e9ponse, Mme Coutts lui a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il \u00ab fr\u00f4lait l\u2019insubordination \u00bb. Elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des excuses par la suite pour ses commentaires.\nDe plus, il convient de signaler que la partie B de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions initial de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e et a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9e comme suit, sans aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au motif illicite fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience :\n[traduction]\nB. Position du plaignant sur les questions juridiques\n1. MTS a\u2011t\u2011elle omis de fournir un milieu de travail sans harc\u00e8lement?\nLe plaignant fait valoir que MTS a omis de fournir un milieu de travail sans harc\u00e8lement.\n2. Le plaignant a\u2011t\u2011il subi un traitement d\u00e9favorable qui a eu des r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives sur sa carri\u00e8re chez MTS?\nLe plaignant fait valoir qu\u2019il a subi un traitement d\u00e9favorable en raison de sa race, de son origine nationale ou ethnique et de sa religion, et que cela a eu des r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives sur sa carri\u00e8re.\n[9] L\u2019audience a repris et s\u2019est tenue \u00e0 Winnipeg au cours des semaines du 2 ao\u00fbt et du 7 novembre 2016, et pendant la semaine du 13 f\u00e9vrier 2017 ainsi que le 19 mai 2017. L\u2019\u00e9tape de la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve s\u2019est termin\u00e9e le 17 f\u00e9vrier 2017. Le 19 mai 2017, les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leurs observations orales apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre entendues pour se transmettre leurs observations \u00e9crites et les d\u00e9poser aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal le 15 mai.\nII. Les faits\n[10] M. Alizadeh-Ebadi se pr\u00e9sente comme un Turc azerba\u00efdjanais (az\u00e9ri). Il est n\u00e9 dans la ville d\u2019Ourmia, dans la province de l\u2019Azerba\u00efdjan occidental, en Iran. Il est de religion musulmane. Lorsqu\u2019ils vivaient en Iran, lui et sa famille \u00e9taient pers\u00e9cut\u00e9s par la majorit\u00e9 persane en raison de leur origine ethnique turque. Il a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 d\u2019Iran en Turquie lorsqu\u2019il avait 19 ans. En 1989, il s\u2019est install\u00e9 au Canada et il est devenu citoyen canadien en 1992.\n[11] M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 par MTS en mars 2000 \u00e0 titre d\u2019\u00e9tudiant inscrit \u00e0 un programme d\u2019alternance travail-\u00e9tudes \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 du Manitoba. \u00c0 l\u2019origine, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 pour pourvoir un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, puis est devenu un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein de MTS, o\u00f9 il travaillait \u00e0 la direction des syst\u00e8mes d\u2019information int\u00e9gr\u00e9s (SII), qui a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e la direction de la gestion des services de technologie de l\u2019information (GSTI). De mars 2000 \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2000, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019administrateur d\u2019un r\u00e9seau local d\u2019entreprise (RLE). De d\u00e9cembre 2000 \u00e0 avril 2001, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sentant du soutien technique. D\u2019avril 2001 \u00e0 juillet 2009, il a travaill\u00e9 comme sp\u00e9cialiste des services d\u2019information, poste qui a plus tard \u00e9t\u00e9 renomm\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialiste du soutien \u00e0 la client\u00e8le (SSC), \u00ab \u00e9chelon 2 \u00bb. Pendant toute la p\u00e9riode pertinente, il \u00e9tait le seul musulman dans la direction de la GSTI, mais celle\u2011ci regroupait alors des employ\u00e9s de races, d\u2019origines ethniques et de religions diverses. Pendant toute la p\u00e9riode pertinente, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u00e9tait membre de l\u2019Association des employ\u00e9s en t\u00e9l\u00e9communications du Manitoba (TEAM).\n[12] Dans son r\u00f4le de SSC \u00ab \u00e9chelon 2 \u00bb, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi fournissait du soutien aux employ\u00e9s de MTS qui \u00e9prouvaient avec leur ordinateur des difficult\u00e9s plus complexes que celles dont pouvaient s\u2019occuper les SCC \u00ab \u00e9chelon 1 \u00bb de premi\u00e8re ligne qui travaillaient au centre de soutien technique.\n[13] M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a eu un accident d\u2019automobile \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du travail en novembre 2001, dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 non responsable \u00e0 100 %. Par suite des blessures qu\u2019il a subies, il s\u2019est absent\u00e9 du travail jusqu\u2019en janvier 2002, puis a suivi un programme de retour graduel au travail dans le cadre duquel il a travaill\u00e9 surtout des demi\u2011journ\u00e9es jusqu\u2019en mai 2003, lorsqu\u2019il a recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler des heures r\u00e9guli\u00e8res.\n[14] En avril 2007, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un autre accident d\u2019automobile \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du travail, dont il a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 non responsable \u00e0 100 %. En raison des blessures qu\u2019il a subies lors de cet accident, il s\u2019est absent\u00e9 du travail jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son retour, le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2009. M. Alizadeh-Ebadi n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 un programme de retour graduel au travail apr\u00e8s cet accident. De juin 2007 \u00e0 f\u00e9vrier 2009, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a pris un cong\u00e9 sans solde de MTS, mais il a re\u00e7u des prestations de remplacement du revenu par l\u2019entremise du R\u00e9gime de protection contre les pr\u00e9judices corporels du Manitoba.\n[15] Apr\u00e8s \u00eatre rentr\u00e9 au travail, il est tomb\u00e9 malade le 23 mars 2009 et, par cons\u00e9quent, il a pris un cong\u00e9 de maladie autoris\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il quitte son emploi chez MTS le 25 juillet 2009.\n[16] MTS a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquise par BCE Inc. en mars 2017, juste avant la derni\u00e8re semaine de l\u2019instruction, et est maintenant connue sous la d\u00e9nomination Bell MTS. Elle est la principale entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications au Manitoba et emploie plusieurs milliers d\u2019employ\u00e9s au Manitoba.\n[17] Une s\u00e9rie d\u2019incidents (les incidents) sont survenus pendant la carri\u00e8re de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi chez MTS \u00e0 compter d\u2019environ 2001 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 2009; des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 propos de ceux\u2011ci au cours de l\u2019instruction, lesquels d\u00e9montrent, de l\u2019avis de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, que MTS s\u2019est livr\u00e9e \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, fond\u00e9s des motifs illicites, comme l\u2019indique sa plainte. \u00c0 ses yeux, ces incidents ont fini par causer chez lui de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, de la nervosit\u00e9 et de la d\u00e9pression, situation qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 sa d\u00e9mission de MTS le 25 juillet 2009.\n[18] Quatorze t\u00e9moins, qui \u00e9taient tous des employ\u00e9s ou d\u2019anciens employ\u00e9s de MTS \u00e0 un moment ou l\u2019autre pendant la carri\u00e8re de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi chez MTS, ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de ces incidents \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Les t\u00e9moins \u00e9taient les suivants : pour M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi, en plus de lui\u2011m\u00eame, Neil Wyrchowny, Ernest Desmarais, Qwin DeBrant et Ryan Bird. Pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e, David Atwell, Stephen Grant, Glen Fryatt, Ryan Workman, Brenda Coutts, Brian Elliott, R\u00e9jean David, Caroline Taylor et Don Rooney ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9.\n[19] Chacun des incidents est d\u00e9crit par les titres ci\u2011dessous et sera pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 plus loin :\nRemarques formul\u00e9es par David Atwell\nRefus de donner un deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur\nRejet des demandes de formation\nEmploi des surnoms \u00ab Crash \u00bb ou \u00ab Kourash \u00bb\nCommentaires \u00e0 propos des voyages en Turquie et de l\u2019\u00e9thique de travail de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi\nRel\u00e9gation au centre de soutien technique\nMilieu de travail\/r\u00e9union de TEAM hostiles\nRefus d\u2019accorder une promotion au poste de sp\u00e9cialiste principal du soutien \u00e0 la client\u00e8le\nAbsence de prise en consid\u00e9ration d\u2019une invalidit\u00e9 par le truchement d\u2019un programme de retour au travail graduel, 2007\u20112009\nTraitement lors du retour au travail en 2009\nEnqu\u00eate interne et rapport de MTS\nPremier incident : Remarques formul\u00e9es par David Atwell\n[20] David Atwell \u00e9tait un superviseur \u00e0 la direction GSTI, dans la division de la distribution du mat\u00e9riel et des logiciels, pendant une partie de la carri\u00e8re de M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi chez MTS. Il n\u2019a pas directement supervis\u00e9 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 de superviser directement les employ\u00e9s qui travaillaient dans la division de la distribution du mat\u00e9riel et des logiciels, laquelle fournissait du soutien mat\u00e9riel aux employ\u00e9s de MTS. M. Alizadeh-Ebadi travaillait dans la division du soutien aux postes de travail (ordinateurs de bureau) du RLE qui, comme nous l\u2019avons indiqu\u00e9, offrait du soutien logiciel aux utilisateurs d\u2019ordinateur et qui relevait de la supervision directe de Neil Wyrchowny jusqu\u2019en 2003, puis de Brenda Coutts (et de Brian Elliott en l\u2019absence de Brenda Coutts), qui \u00e9taient ses superviseurs ou ses \u00ab chefs d\u2019\u00e9quipe \u00bb.\n[21] Quoique s\u00e9par\u00e9es, ces deux divisions relevaient d\u2019un m\u00eame directeur. Au d\u00e9but de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte jusqu\u2019aux alentours de 2003, Ken Barchuck \u00e9tait le directeur. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi \u00e0 ce titre par Rob Pettit jusqu\u2019aux alentours de 2005, puis par Wayne Horseman. Les deux divisions interagissaient de diverses fa\u00e7ons pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des employ\u00e9s de MTS en mati\u00e8re de technologie des syst\u00e8mes d\u2019information. David Atwell interagissait donc avec M. Alizadeh-Ebadi en milieu de travail et ils communiquaient de temps \u00e0 autre pour des raisons li\u00e9es au travail et dans un cadre plus d\u00e9contract\u00e9, comme lors des pauses caf\u00e9 et repas \u00e0 la caf\u00e9t\u00e9ria. MTS avait plusieurs lieux de travail \u00e0 Winnipeg et M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et David Atwell se d\u00e9pla\u00e7aient entre certains de ces lieux de travail pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[22] J\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l\u2019audience de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins, selon lesquels David Atwell a fait des remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes et insultantes \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi ou au sujet de celui\u2011ci, y compris des commentaires \u00e0 la suite des \u00e9v\u00e9nements tragiques caus\u00e9s par les attaques terroristes du 11 septembre, par lesquels il insinuait que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u00e9tait un membre d\u2019Al\u2011Qa\u00efda et un terroriste.\n[23] Les mots exacts qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9s, la fr\u00e9quence \u00e0 laquelle les remarques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es, la dur\u00e9e pendant laquelle ces propos se sont poursuivis et la possibilit\u00e9 que la direction de MTS en ait eu connaissance ont fait l\u2019objet de diverses versions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les diff\u00e9rents t\u00e9moins. Un certain nombre de t\u00e9moins ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sous serment qu\u2019il leur \u00e9tait difficile de se souvenir de certaines choses avec une clart\u00e9 ou une certitude absolue, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9coul\u00e9 beaucoup de temps depuis les incidents.\n[24] \u00c0 partir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve examin\u00e9s, je conclus qu\u2019autour des attentats du 11 septembre et pendant la p\u00e9riode qui a suivi, David Atwell a fait des remarques au travail \u00e0 M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi ou au sujet de celui\u2011ci, notamment les suivantes : [traduction] \u00ab Kouroush, quand vas\u2011tu nous montrer ta carte de membre d\u2019Al\u2011Qa\u00efda? \u00bb (\u00e0 plusieurs reprises); \u00ab nous devrions jeter un coup d\u2019\u0153il sur le lunch de Kouroush pour voir s\u2019il ne contient pas une bombe \u00bb; \u00ab ne mettez pas Kouroush en col\u00e8re, parce qu\u2019il va faire \u00e9craser un avion sur l\u2019\u00e9difice \u00bb; Kouroush \u00e9tait une \u00ab cellule dormante \u00bb; et que tout irait mieux \u00ab si nous bombardions le Moyen\u2011Orient pour qu\u2019il retourne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de la pierre \u00bb. Outre le fait que David Atwell a fait ces remarques directement \u00e0 M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi, certaines d\u2019entre elles ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es devant d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s et de nombreux employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient au courant du fait que David Atwell en \u00e9tait l\u2019auteur.\n[25] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, David Atwell a pr\u00e9tendu qu\u2019il ne se souvenait pas d\u2019avoir fait \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi les remarques d\u00e9crites au paragraphe 24 ci\u2011dessus, \u00e0 cause de ses troubles de m\u00e9moire. Il a admis qu\u2019il avait probablement tenu ces propos, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins qui avaient t\u00e9moign\u00e9 sous serment \u00e0 l\u2019audience, comme Neil Wyrchowny, avaient affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il a fait certaines de ces remarques (les insinuations sur Al\u2011Qa\u00efda en particulier). Il a \u00e9galement admis qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible qu\u2019il ait tenu certains des autres propos mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe 24 ci\u2011dessus. Il a admis qu\u2019il a eu tort de faire ces remarques, il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il comprenait qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient blessantes pour M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et il s\u2019est dit d\u00e9sol\u00e9 de les avoir prononc\u00e9es et d\u2019avoir bless\u00e9 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi. Il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 les excuses ci\u2011dessous \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi au cours de l\u2019audience :\n[traduction] \u00ab M. Ebadi, je sais que les choses que j\u2019ai dites \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque \u00e9taient blessantes et d\u00e9plac\u00e9es. J\u2019aimerais vous pr\u00e9senter mes excuses et vous demander sinc\u00e8rement de me pardonner si vous le pouvez. Si vous ne le pouvez pas, je comprendrai tout \u00e0 fait, mais j\u2019aimerais vous pr\u00e9senter personnellement mes excuses pour cette p\u00e9riode de ma vie et de la v\u00f4tre. \u00bb\nApr\u00e8s avoir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 les excuses ci\u2011dessus en interrogatoire principal \u00e0 l\u2019audience, il a plus tard d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 des questions en contre-interrogatoire :\n[traduction] \u00ab J\u2019ai admis hier que les commentaires que j\u2019ai formul\u00e9s \u00e9taient inappropri\u00e9s, qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient d\u00e9plac\u00e9s et qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient blessants. Je maintiens ces excuses et j\u2019esp\u00e8re que Kouroush pourra les accepter. J\u2019esp\u00e8re qu\u2019il aura la bont\u00e9 de me pardonner \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 dans sa vie, mais par contre, je comprendrai s\u2019il n\u2019y arrive pas. Je ne conteste pas le fait que j\u2019ai mal agi. \u00bb\n[26] Dans ses observations, MTS a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle [traduction] \u00ab ne conteste pas qu\u2019au cours des jours qui ont suivi le 11 septembre et jusqu\u2019en 2003 (la \u00ab p\u00e9riode en cause \u00bb), M. Atwell a fait des commentaires inappropri\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, lesquels \u00e9taient fond\u00e9s sur son origine ethnique. MTS ne conteste pas que des propos de cette nature constituent du harc\u00e8lement au sens de la Loi. \u00bb Elle a \u00e9galement ajout\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab Nous avons conclu \u00e0 l\u2019existence de harc\u00e8lement en raison de cinq ou six commentaires \u00e0 propos d\u2019une carte d\u2019Al\u2011Qa\u00efda et, je crois, un autre pr\u00e9tendant que M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi aurait apport\u00e9 une bombe au travail dans la foul\u00e9e du 11 septembre, un moment tr\u00e8s sensible. Ces cinq ou six commentaires \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 constituaient du harc\u00e8lement, nous le reconnaissons. C\u2019est au Tribunal qu\u2019il incombe de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019ampleur que la situation a prise. Nous n\u2019admettons rien de plus. \u00bb\n[27] J\u2019accepte les t\u00e9moignages entendus \u00e0 l\u2019audience, selon lesquels David Atwell a aussi, pendant une certaine p\u00e9riode, r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement fait des commentaires d\u00e9rogatoires et d\u00e9nigrants, dont certains \u00e9taient racistes, \u00e0 propos d\u2019autres personnes au travail. Il a notamment fait une remarque \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 issu d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation selon laquelle il travaillait selon \u00ab la ponctualit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019indienne \u00bb, laissant entendre qu\u2019il \u00e9tait paresseux. Il a \u00e9galement fait des remarques \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 mennonite insinuant que les enseignements et les pratiques des Mennonites \u00e9taient hypocrites en ce qui concerne la consommation d\u2019alcool.\n[28] Il est inutile de se pencher plus longuement sur les remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes que David Atwell a faites \u00e0 propos d\u2019autres personnes, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la pr\u00e9sente instance concerne M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, mais ces faits sont relat\u00e9s pour des raisons contextuelles. David Atwell lui\u2011m\u00eame et de nombreux autres t\u00e9moins \u00e0 l\u2019audience ont fait \u00e9tat de son comportement d\u00e9plac\u00e9 chez MTS et ont qualifi\u00e9 David Atwell de [traduction] \u00ab cr\u00e9tin de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances \u00bb et de \u00ab brute de cours d\u2019\u00e9cole \u00bb qui tenait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement au travail des propos \u00e0 caract\u00e8re ethnique et d\u2019autres commentaires n\u00e9gatifs qu\u2019il consid\u00e9rait comme des \u00ab blagues \u00bb dans l\u2019ambiance de \u00ab vestiaire \u00bb qui r\u00e9gnait alors chez MTS.\n[29] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de David Atwell lui\u2011m\u00eame et d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins, il \u00e9tait alors bruyant, brutal et vulgaire, il choisissait une cible comme M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et il s\u2019en prenait \u00e0 elle d\u00e8s qu\u2019il en avait l\u2019occasion et il faisait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des \u00ab blagues \u00bb \u00e0 propos des origines ethniques et de la race entre quatre et 12 fois par jour. David Atwell a reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il \u00e9tait alors [traduction] \u00ab parfaitement inconscient de ses actes et de leurs cons\u00e9quences pour ses coll\u00e8gues de travail \u00bb.\n[30] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, David Atwell a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il venait d\u2019un milieu militaire. Il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 membre de la R\u00e9serve de l\u2019arm\u00e9e canadienne pendant 31 ans. Il \u00e9tait lieutenant\u2011colonel lors de sa retraite en 2013. Il \u00e9tait commandant du r\u00e9giment Fort Garry Horse \u00e0 Winnipeg au moment des attentats terroristes du 11 septembre et il avait entra\u00een\u00e9 et supervis\u00e9 bon nombre des soldats de Winnipeg qui avaient servi en Afghanistan. Il a indiqu\u00e9 que son comportement chez MTS au moment des \u00e9v\u00e9nements du 11 septembre et pendant une certaine p\u00e9riode par la suite, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il commence \u00e0 changer gr\u00e2ce au mentorat de Wayne Horseman, s\u2019expliquait en partie par ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de militaire strict et en partie par des probl\u00e8mes personnels avec lesquels il \u00e9tait aux prises \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du travail et \u00e0 la maison.\n[31] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve, y compris du t\u00e9moignage de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, je conclus que les remarques faites par David Atwell et mentionn\u00e9es au paragraphe 24 ci\u2011dessus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es en raison de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de la religion de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient graves, constantes et profond\u00e9ment blessantes pour M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, qui s\u2019en est plaint \u00e0 David Atwell et \u00e0 d\u2019autres.\n[32] Neil Wyrchowny, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin des remarques concernant \u00ab la carte de membre d\u2019Al\u2011Qa\u00efda \u00bb, a dit \u00e0 M. Atwell \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 que ses propos \u00e9taient compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9plac\u00e9s et qu\u2019il devrait s\u2019abstenir de formuler des commentaires de ce genre. M. Atwell a tourn\u00e9 en d\u00e9rision la remontrance de Neil Wyrchowny \u00e0 propos de ses remarques et il a continu\u00e9 de se comporter de fa\u00e7on n\u00e9gative pendant un certain temps, m\u00eame s\u2019il savait que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi s\u2019opposait \u00e0 ses propos.\n[33] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, Neil Wyrchowny n\u2019a pas signal\u00e9 les remarques sur Al\u2011Qa\u00efda \u00e0 son superviseur Ken Barchuck ni \u00e0 un sup\u00e9rieur de celui\u2011ci au sein de la direction de MTS, parce qu\u2019il pensait que cela n\u2019aurait rien chang\u00e9, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que la direction affichait alors une attitude indiff\u00e9rente \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces questions.\n[34] Rien dans la preuve n\u2019indique qu\u2019une plainte \u00e9crite a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 la direction de MTS au sujet des commentaires et du comportement insultants de David Atwell envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi avant la plainte interne de 2009 qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne Taylor men\u00e9e au sein de MTS, dont nous parlerons ult\u00e9rieurement dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, m\u00eame si de nombreux coll\u00e8gues de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u00e9taient au courant des commentaires et savaient que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi ne les appr\u00e9ciait pas. La preuve a \u00e9tabli que la direction avait pris des mesures disciplinaires \u00e0 l\u2019endroit d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s, y compris Neil Wyrchowny, lorsqu\u2019elle a r\u00e9ellement re\u00e7u des plaintes \u00e9crites au sujet de comportements d\u00e9plac\u00e9s d\u2019employ\u00e9s qui avaient contrevenu \u00e0 la politique de MTS, en vigueur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, sur le respect en milieu de travail.\n[35] Cependant, il ressort des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que la direction de MTS \u00e9tait au courant ou aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre au courant du comportement qu\u2019avait David Atwell envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 il lui faisait ces remarques. En fait, David Atwell a admis en contre\u2011interrogatoire que la direction [traduction] \u00ab aurait d\u00fb savoir \u00bb. Stephen Grant, un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible assign\u00e9 par MTS, a affirm\u00e9 sous serment qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab est plus que probable que la direction \u00e9tait au courant \u00bb des gestes d\u00e9plac\u00e9s de David Atwell. De plus, la preuve d\u00e9montre qu\u2019apr\u00e8s le remplacement de Rob Pettit par Wayne Horseman aux alentours de 2005, M. Horseman a agi comme mentor aupr\u00e8s de David Atwell pour l\u2019aider \u00e0 modifier son comportement, ce qui donne \u00e0 penser qu\u2019il savait que la conduite de David Atwell au travail devait changer. J\u2019accepte la preuve des propres t\u00e9moins de MTS, selon laquelle MTS \u00e9tait au courant ou aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre au courant du fait que David Atwell se comportait \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, bien avant l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne men\u00e9e par MTS en 2009, en harceleur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et qu\u2019il avait une attitude intol\u00e9rante envers lui en raison de sa race, de son origine nationale ou ethnique ou de sa religion.\n[36] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve, je conclus qu\u2019il est probable que la fr\u00e9quence et la constance des commentaires et des comportements blessants fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou la religion que David Atwell a eus envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi ne se limitaient pas \u00e0 un, deux ou trois incidents pr\u00e9cis comme les remarques au sujet de la carte de membre d\u2019Al\u2011Qa\u00efda et du terrorisme. Ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plus fr\u00e9quents et constants que cela, en particulier vu le propre t\u00e9moignage de David Atwell \u00e0 propos de la fr\u00e9quence de ses propos ethniques en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, au paragraphe 29 ci\u2011dessus, ainsi que la d\u00e9position sous serment de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins quant \u00e0 la fr\u00e9quence des commentaires qui visaient express\u00e9ment M. Alizadeh-Ebadi.\n[37] Bien que les remarques racistes ou ethniques ouvertes, directes et explicites de David Atwell insinuant notamment que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u00e9tait membre d\u2019Al\u2011Qa\u00efda, comme nous l\u2019avons vu au paragraphe 24 ci\u2011dessus, semblent avoir cess\u00e9 \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 en 2003, je crois que David Atwell a probablement persist\u00e9 dans son mauvais comportement envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi pendant un certain temps, parce qu\u2019\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, David Atwell \u00e9tait intol\u00e9rant face \u00e0 sa race, \u00e0 son origine nationale ou ethnique ou \u00e0 sa religion.\n[38] Je crois que David Atwell, de son propre aveu au sujet de son comportement en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque et du fait qu\u2019il faisait fr\u00e9quemment des \u00ab blagues \u00bb ethniques au travail et vu les excuses qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience, \u00e9tait un raciste \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 et qu\u2019il lui a fallu par la suite un certain temps avant de changer et de mettre fin \u00e0 ses propos et \u00e0 son comportement insultants envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et d\u2019autres.\n[39] La preuve n\u2019indique pas clairement \u00e0 partir de quand exactement ce changement a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019op\u00e9rer. M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a affirm\u00e9 sous serment que le comportement n\u00e9gatif de David Atwell envers lui s\u2019est poursuivi tr\u00e8s longtemps apr\u00e8s les attentats du 11 septembre, mais il a donn\u00e9 peu d\u2019exemples concrets, \u00e0 l\u2019exception des propos racistes mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe 24 ci\u2011dessus, des incidents mettant en cause David Atwell et qui ont men\u00e9 au refus de lui donner un deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur, de la formation dans le cadre du projet Win2K et de l\u2019emploi des surnoms \u00ab Crash \u00bb ou \u00ab Kourash \u00bb dont il est question plus loin dans la d\u00e9cision. Il n\u2019est fait mention d\u2019aucun commentaire raciste de la part de David Atwell dans les proc\u00e8s\u2011verbaux des assembl\u00e9es du syndicat TEAM en 2005, que nous traiterons ult\u00e9rieurement dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, ni dans les observations de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi au sujet du milieu de travail dans les \u00e9valuations de son rendement qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9es en 2004, 2005 et 2006.\n[40] Un changement organisationnel qui s\u2019est produit autour de 2003 a limit\u00e9 les interactions verbales entre David Atwell et M. Alizadeh-Ebadi. Rob Pettit a pris sa retraite au cours de la premi\u00e8re moiti\u00e9 de 2005 et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9 par Wayne Horseman, qui est devenu le mentor de David Atwell afin de l\u2019aider \u00e0 changer son comportement. Selon l\u2019un des t\u00e9moins de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, le comportement harcelant de David Atwell envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi s\u2019est poursuivi jusqu\u2019en 2010, mais cela ne para\u00eet pas possible. De nombreux t\u00e9moins des deux parties ont indiqu\u00e9 que le changement de comportement de David Atwell s\u2019est produit autour de 2004. Je crois qu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 ou peu de temps apr\u00e8s, David Atwell a cess\u00e9 de harceler M. Alizadeh-Ebadi.\n[41] De nombreux t\u00e9moins qui ont relat\u00e9 \u00e0 quel point le comportement de David Atwell \u00e9tait d\u00e9plorable au d\u00e9but de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9sente plainte ont \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 sous serment que David Atwell \u00e9tait une personne transform\u00e9e, qui ne se comportait plus comme avant depuis un certain temps. C\u2019est \u00e9galement ce que David Atwell a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sous serment \u00e0 propos de lui\u2011m\u00eame. Il est \u00e0 souhaiter que les excuses et les regrets qu\u2019il a exprim\u00e9s (voir le paragraphe 25 ci\u2011dessus) pour son comportement pass\u00e9 envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi sont sinc\u00e8res, tout comme son affirmation selon laquelle il est une personne transform\u00e9e, mais qui chemine pour continuer \u00e0 essayer de devenir une meilleure personne.\n[42] La preuve ne d\u00e9montre pas qu\u2019une autre personne quelconque chez MTS a fait des remarques insultantes portant sur la race, l\u2019origine ethnique ou la religion \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi ou \u00e0 son sujet pendant son emploi. Malheureusement, M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi a \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9 par les propos intol\u00e9rants de David Atwell, lesquels \u00e9taient fond\u00e9s sur sa race, son origine nationale ou ethnique ou sa religion. J\u2019accepte les t\u00e9moignages de David Atwell et Stephen Grant, qui \u00e9taient tous deux les propres t\u00e9moins de MTS, selon lesquels MTS \u00e9tait au courant du comportement de David Atwell vis\u00e9 au paragraphe 35 ci\u2011dessus. Ces t\u00e9moignages portaient sur une p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle MTS n\u2019avait pris aucune mesure pour mettre un terme au comportement de David Atwell envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, soit bien avant l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne de MTS au sujet des propos et du comportement de David Atwell en 2009.\nDeuxi\u00e8me incident : Refus de donner un deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur\n[43] Peu de temps apr\u00e8s que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi est devenu un employ\u00e9 permanent en juin 2001, il a demand\u00e9 un deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur pour ex\u00e9cuter diverses t\u00e2ches, notamment afin de faire l\u2019essai de nouveaux syst\u00e8mes logiciels et d\u2019effectuer des recherches pour MTS ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 des fins \u00e9ducatives, afin de pouvoir conserver son important certificat d\u2019ing\u00e9nieur-syst\u00e8me certifi\u00e9 par Microsoft (MCSE). Il \u00e9tait plus efficace pour lui d\u2019effectuer les travaux de mise \u00e0 l\u2019essai et de recherche mentionn\u00e9s ci\u2011dessus \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019un ordinateur distinct de celui dont il se servait pour s\u2019acquitter de ses t\u00e2ches essentielles, qui consistaient \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des demandes de d\u00e9pannage (\u00ab tickets \u00bb) pour tenter de r\u00e9gler les probl\u00e8mes informatiques des employ\u00e9s de MTS. Beaucoup d\u2019autres SSC disposaient d\u2019un deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur pour faire ce travail.\n[44] La demande d\u2019un deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur au nom de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9e par Neil Wyrchowny \u00e0 David Atwell, de qui relevait la distribution du mat\u00e9riel, y compris des deuxi\u00e8mes ordinateurs. La d\u00e9marche \u00e9tait conforme au protocole \u00e9tabli en la mati\u00e8re, comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sous serment David Atwell, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire au moyen d\u2019une demande par le chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe. La demande visait un ordinateur d\u2019occasion ou recycl\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait disponible, pas un ordinateur neuf. MTS vendait ses ordinateurs recycl\u00e9s ou s\u2019en d\u00e9partait, mais elle en conservait toujours un certain nombre en stock avant de les vendre ou d\u2019en disposer.\n[45] David Atwell a rejet\u00e9 la demande de Neil Wyrchowny et les demandes subs\u00e9quentes faites par M. Alizadeh-Ebadi dans le but d\u2019obtenir un deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur. Diverses raisons ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9es pour justifier le rejet de la demande de deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur, y compris l\u2019ordre de la direction de ne pas fournir de deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur en l\u2019absence d\u2019une solide analyse de rentabilisation, et aussi pour donner l\u2019exemple.\n[46] David Atwell a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sous serment qu\u2019aucune analyse de rentabilisation suffisamment d\u00e9taill\u00e9e n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie, m\u00eame si la preuve d\u00e9montrait que Neil Wyrchowny avait fait la demande au nom de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi dans un courriel \u00e0 David Atwell pour ce qui semble \u00eatre des raisons professionnelles l\u00e9gitimes, \u00e0 savoir pour conserver sa pr\u00e9cieuse certification MCSE.\n[47] Au moment de la demande, il y avait en entreposage pas moins de 200 \u00e0 300 ordinateurs recycl\u00e9s disponibles. Selon la preuve, contrairement \u00e0 M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi, bon nombre de ses coll\u00e8gues de travail se contentaient simplement de prendre un deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur dans l\u2019entrep\u00f4t et de l\u2019utiliser sans en faire la demande \u00e0 David Atwell et sans avoir de probl\u00e8me. Un t\u00e9moin a affirm\u00e9 sous serment que David Atwell lui avait dit ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab Tu n\u2019as qu\u2019\u00e0 en prendre un. \u00bb Neil Wyrchowny n\u2019a pu se souvenir d\u2019une autre personne \u00e0 qui on aurait refus\u00e9 un deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur demand\u00e9 par un superviseur.\n[48] \u00c0 mon avis, compte tenu de la preuve, les raisons pour lesquelles David Atwell a refus\u00e9 de remettre le deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 ne sont pas convaincantes. Je crois que le refus de David Atwell, alors que beaucoup d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s dans la m\u00eame situation que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi avaient un deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur recycl\u00e9 pour les m\u00eames raisons que celles qu\u2019il avait invoqu\u00e9es, \u00e9tait au moins partiellement imputable \u00e0 l\u2019attitude intol\u00e9rante qu\u2019avait David Atwell \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u00e0 cause de sa race, de son origine nationale ou ethnique ou de sa religion, comme l\u2019atteste la preuve du comportement de David Atwell \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, lequel est d\u00e9crit sous la rubrique du premier incident ci\u2011dessus.\nTroisi\u00e8me incident : Rejet de demandes de formation\n[49] Cet incident a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9rablement circonscrit \u00e0 l\u2019audience afin de faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au rejet par David Atwell d\u2019une demande transmise au nom de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi par le superviseur de celui\u2011ci, Neil Wyrchowny, afin que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi soit int\u00e9gr\u00e9 au projet \u00ab Win2K \u00bb relatif au nouveau syst\u00e8me d\u2019exploitation de Microsoft \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque.\n[50] David Atwell a admis dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il aurait pu int\u00e9grer M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi \u00e0 ce projet. Cela aurait pu justifier l\u2019octroi d\u2019un deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi. Compte tenu de la preuve, il ne semble pas y avoir eu de justification factuelle, \u00e0 mon avis, pour expliquer le rejet de cette demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au nom de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi par son superviseur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, Neil Wyrchowny.\n[51] \u00c0 mon avis, le fait que David Atwell ait rejet\u00e9 cette demande est \u00e9troitement li\u00e9 \u00e0 son rejet de la demande d\u2019un deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur, qui est expliqu\u00e9 ci\u2011dessus. J\u2019estime que ce refus de la part de David Atwell \u00e9tait au moins partiellement imputable \u00e0 l\u2019attitude et au comportement intol\u00e9rants que celui\u2011ci avait adopt\u00e9s \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi en raison de sa race, de son origine nationale ou ethnique ou de sa religion. Ce refus concorde avec le comportement inappropri\u00e9 que David Atwell a admis dans ses excuses \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, mentionn\u00e9es au paragraphe 25 ci\u2011dessus.\nQuatri\u00e8me incident : Emploi des surnoms \u00ab Crash \u00bb ou \u00ab Kourash \u00bb\n[52] En juin 2001, avant le premier accident d\u2019automobile de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, un de ses coll\u00e8gues de travail a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e9logieux au sujet de son travail dans lequel il le nommait \u00ab Kurash \u00bb. Il a pu s\u2019agir d\u2019une erreur ou d\u2019un jeu de mot sur son nom \u00e0 caract\u00e8re ethnique, mais M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a fait savoir \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues de travail qu\u2019il ne l\u2019avait pas appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 et le nom n\u2019a plus \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 pendant un certain temps.\n[53] Apr\u00e8s le premier accident d\u2019automobile du plaignant, durant la p\u00e9riode de son retour graduel au travail, diverses personnes, dont David Atwell, se mettaient \u00e0 utiliser le nom \u00ab Krash \u00bb ou \u00ab Crash \u00bb ou \u00ab Kourash \u00bb.\n[54] M. Alizadeh-Ebadi n\u2019appr\u00e9ciait pas l\u2019emploi de ces \u00ab surnoms \u00bb et il a dit \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues de travail qu\u2019il n\u2019aimait pas qu\u2019ils se servent de ces noms, mais ils ont continu\u00e9 \u00e0 les utiliser de mani\u00e8re intermittente pendant sa carri\u00e8re chez MTS.\n[55] Le \u00ab surnom \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 la derni\u00e8re fois dans l\u2019objet d\u2019un courriel que Glen Fryatt lui a fait parvenir par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de Brenda Coutts \u00e0 son retour au travail en 2009 et qui concernait la perte de son identifiant d\u2019acc\u00e8s (situation expliqu\u00e9e plus tard).\n[56] M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a affirm\u00e9 sous serment qu\u2019il pensait que l\u2019emploi de ces noms le tournait en ridicule et lui rappelait de mauvais souvenirs des blessures tr\u00e8s graves et douloureuses qu\u2019il avait subies dans des accidents d\u2019automobile dont il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 non responsable.\n[57] Plusieurs t\u00e9moins \u00e0 l\u2019audience, y compris Brenda Coutts, Glen Fryatt et David Atwell, ont affirm\u00e9 sous serment qu\u2019ils avaient compris r\u00e9trospectivement que ces surnoms n\u2019\u00e9taient pas \u00e9logieux, contrairement \u00e0 d\u2019autres \u00ab surnoms \u00bb employ\u00e9s au travail qui pouvaient \u00eatre plaisants ou m\u00eame flatteurs. Ils ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019ils pouvaient comprendre, avec le recul, pourquoi M. Alizadeh-Ebadi ne voulait pas \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par ces noms insens\u00e9s et d\u00e9plac\u00e9s, compte tenu de ses accidents d\u2019automobile et de ses blessures graves.\n[58] Glen Fryatt a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sous serment qu\u2019il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des excuses \u00e0 M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi dans le corridor \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la salle d\u2019audience pour avoir employ\u00e9 les \u00ab surnoms \u00bb. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Brenda Coutts a indiqu\u00e9 que le fait d\u2019avoir transmis le courriel de Glen Fryatt \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi avec le mot \u00ab Kurash \u00bb en objet m\u00e9ritait des excuses. David Atwell a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sous serment qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab a essay\u00e9 d\u2019arr\u00eater \u00bb, mais il est impossible de savoir quand cela se serait produit.\n[59] \u00c0 toutes les \u00e9poques en cause au cours de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par cette plainte, MTS \u00e9tait dot\u00e9e d\u2019une politique sur le respect en milieu de travail. Les \u00ab surnoms \u00bb contrevenaient peut\u2011\u00eatre \u00e0 cette politique, mais aucune plainte officielle au regard de cette politique n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e par M. Alizadeh-Ebadi ou par une autre personne \u00e0 leur sujet, avant la plainte interne re\u00e7ue par MTS en 2009 qui a d\u00e9clench\u00e9 l\u2019enqu\u00eate Taylor dont nous parlerons ult\u00e9rieurement dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[60] J\u2019accepte la d\u00e9posiion des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 l\u2019audience, selon laquelle l\u2019emploi des \u00ab surnoms \u00bb d\u00e9coulait de la conduite automobile de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et de ses accidents et n\u2019\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9 \u00e0 sa race, \u00e0 son origine ethnique ou \u00e0 sa religion. J\u2019accepte aussi le fait qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient blessants et inacceptables pour M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019ils concernaient des accidents d\u2019automobile qui lui avaient caus\u00e9 des blessures graves.\nCinqui\u00e8me incident : Commentaires \u00e0 propos des voyages en Turquie et de l\u2019\u00e9thique de travail de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi\n[61] Dans sa plainte et dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de nouveau, le plaignant affirme que Brian Elliott a fait de nombreux commentaires n\u00e9gatifs et insultants dans le milieu de travail, laissant sous\u2011entendre que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi [traduction] \u00ab feignait \u00bb la maladie et faisait des voyages en Turquie durant ses cong\u00e9s de maladie et que son \u00e9thique de travail \u00e9tait douteuse.\n[62] La p\u00e9riode mentionn\u00e9e dans la plainte au cours de laquelle ces commentaires auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par Brian Elliott se situait apr\u00e8s le premier accident d\u2019automobile et plus particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2005. Selon la plainte de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, un autre employ\u00e9 aurait \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque entendu par hasard Brian Elliott dire que le plaignant [traduction] \u00ab feignait la maladie et se payait probablement un voyage en Turquie \u00bb alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie.\n[63] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, plusieurs t\u00e9moins ont affirm\u00e9 sous serment que Brenda Coutts a aussi tenu des propos d\u00e9sobligeants et n\u00e9gatifs dans le milieu de travail en laissant entendre que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi feignait des blessures et faisait des voyages en Turquie quand il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie; elle remettait \u00e9galement en question son \u00e9thique de travail et son engagement envers son travail. Lors de leur t\u00e9moignage, Brian Elliott et Brenda Coutts ont tous deux ni\u00e9 avoir fait ces commentaires.\n[64] Brian Elliott a admis dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas [traduction] \u00ab emball\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00e9thique de travail de Kouroush \u00bb durant les premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, m\u00eame s\u2019il ne l\u2019a pas supervis\u00e9 et ne pouvait expliquer concr\u00e8tement les raisons de cette opinion ni les impressions sur lesquelles elle \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e.\n[65] Plusieurs des camarades de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi ont affirm\u00e9 sous serment qu\u2019il y avait beaucoup de potins et de comm\u00e9rages parmi ses coll\u00e8gues de travail \u00e0 cause de l\u2019impression selon laquelle M. Alizadeh-Ebadi feignait la maladie et faisait des voyages en Turquie pendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie. La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019en raison de cette impression, certains de ses camarades n\u2019appr\u00e9ciaient pas M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que ses cong\u00e9s de maladie les obligeaient \u00e0 travailler davantage et \u00e0 subir une plus grande pression pour pallier ses absences.\n[66] Rien dans les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve produits ne permet de conclure que les absences du travail de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi pour des raisons de maladie \u00e9taient injustifi\u00e9es de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit d\u2019un point de vue m\u00e9dical, que les blessures d\u00e9coulant d\u2019accidents d\u2019automobile n\u2019\u00e9taient pas r\u00e9elles ou que les voyages qu\u2019il a faits en Turquie, y compris pour rendre visite \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re malade, \u00e9taient ill\u00e9gitimes de quelque mani\u00e8re que ce soit. De plus, rien dans le t\u00e9moignage de ses superviseurs, Neil Wyrchowny et Brenda Coutts, ne donne \u00e0 penser que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi avait un mauvais rendement ou une \u00e9thique de travail douteuse. Ses \u00e9valuations de rendement par Brenda Coutts \u00e9taient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement positives.\n[67] La preuve \u00e9tait contradictoire en ce qui concerne cet incident. Tout compte fait, je ne doute pas de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de Brian Elliott et Brenda Coutts lorsqu\u2019ils nient avoir tenu ces propos; cette d\u00e9n\u00e9gation est plus coh\u00e9rente et convaincante que les comptes rendus de cet incident relat\u00e9s par d\u2019autres personnes. Brian Elliott et Brenda Coutts n\u2019ont pas paru h\u00e9siter dans leur t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard et, \u00e0 mon avis, leurs d\u00e9mentis ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9dibles.\n[68] En revanche, il y avait des impr\u00e9cisions et des incoh\u00e9rences dans les t\u00e9moignages d\u2019autres personnes au sujet de l\u2019auteur des commentaires ainsi que du moment et du lieu o\u00f9 ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9s. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, Ryan Workman qui, selon M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, aurait entendu les propos de Brian Elliott en 2005, n\u2019a pas pu se souvenir dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019ils avaient r\u00e9ellement \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9s. Neil Wyrchowny a rendu un t\u00e9moignage tr\u00e8s vague dans lequel il a laiss\u00e9 entendre qu\u2019il venait tout r\u00e9cemment de se souvenir que ces propos avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 tenus par Brian Elliott, mais il ne se souvenait ni du lieu ni du moment. Des ann\u00e9es auparavant, Neil Wyrchowny avait dit \u00e0 un enqu\u00eateur de la Commission qu\u2019il ne se souvenait pas de ces propos.\n[69] Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, je ne trouve aucune preuve permettant de conclure que ces commentaires, \u00e0 supposer qu\u2019ils aient \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9s, avaient un rapport avec la race, l\u2019origine ethnique ou la religion de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit pour d\u00e9montrer que Brian Elliott ou Brenda Coutts ont tenu des propos racistes, \u00e0 caract\u00e8re ethnique ou antimusulmans \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi ou au sujet de celui\u2011ci. Je ne puis non plus d\u00e9duire qu\u2019ils auraient pu \u00eatre influenc\u00e9s par les remarques racistes attribuables \u00e0 David Atwell, qui sont mentionn\u00e9es au paragraphe 24 ci\u2011dessus, et qu\u2019ils ont agi de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi en raison de sa race, de son origine nationale ou ethnique ou de sa religion.\nSixi\u00e8me incident : Rel\u00e9gation au centre de soutien technique\n[70] Comme nous l\u2019avons vu ci\u2011dessus, il existait deux \u00ab \u00e9chelons \u00bb pour le poste de SSC. Les SSC de l\u2019\u00e9chelon 1 travaillaient au \u00ab centre de soutien technique \u00bb et s\u2019effor\u00e7aient de r\u00e9gler les probl\u00e8mes auxquels faisaient face les utilisateurs d\u2019ordinateur en \u00ab premi\u00e8re ligne \u00bb, pour ainsi dire. Si le centre de soutien technique ne r\u00e9ussissait pas \u00e0 r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me, il le renvoyait aux SSC de l\u2019\u00e9chelon 2, qui recevaient un \u00ab ticket \u00bb (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. une demande de d\u00e9pannage) pour tenter de le r\u00e9gler. Ainsi, le travail le plus complexe \u00e9tait dans l\u2019ensemble effectu\u00e9 par les SSC de l\u2019\u00e9chelon 2 et les gens avaient l\u2019impression que le centre de soutien technique \u00e9tait une \u00ab r\u00e9trogradation \u00bb pour les SSC de l\u2019\u00e9chelon 2.\n[71] Le plaignant a soulev\u00e9 cette question dans sa plainte en faisant mention d\u2019une p\u00e9riode en 2005 au cours de laquelle Brenda Coutts, Brian Elliott et Rob Pettit auraient essay\u00e9 de le [traduction] \u00ab caser \u00bb \u00e0 un poste au centre de soutien technique, mais sans succ\u00e8s en raison des efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par ses coll\u00e8gues pour les en emp\u00eacher. Cette question n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de nouveau.\n[72] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi faisait partie des quelques SSC de l\u2019\u00e9chelon 2 ayant travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le au centre de soutien technique pendant plusieurs mois.\n[73] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, l\u2019entreprise avait indiqu\u00e9 que cette initiative avait pour but de fournir une formation polyvalente aux SSC pour accro\u00eetre leur exp\u00e9rience et leurs connaissances afin de mieux servir les utilisateurs. Toutefois, certains t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sous serment que les gens choisis en premier par MTS pour une rotation au centre de soutien technique \u00e9taient ceux qui \u00e9taient r\u00e9put\u00e9s faire partie de la [traduction] \u00ab liste des cancres \u00bb de la direction et qui \u00e9taient punis pour leur mauvais rendement et les ennuis qu\u2019ils causaient.\n[74] Brenda Coutts, qui a choisi les employ\u00e9s de son groupe appel\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler au centre de soutien technique, a affirm\u00e9 sous serment que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en conflit avec elle \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, mais qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019un des employ\u00e9s qui y a travaill\u00e9 pendant plusieurs mois.\n[75] M\u00eame si cette affaire n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un grief, il est \u00e9vident que de nombreux employ\u00e9s touch\u00e9s par l\u2019initiative du centre de soutien technique ont exprim\u00e9 leurs pr\u00e9occupations et leur opposition. MTS a mis fin \u00e0 cette initiative autour de 2005, notamment \u00e0 cause de ces pr\u00e9occupations et de cette opposition.\n[76] Il convient de signaler que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et un autre t\u00e9moin qui avait travaill\u00e9 au centre de soutien technique ont indiqu\u00e9 que leur exp\u00e9rience au centre de soutien technique avait en fait \u00e9t\u00e9 utile. De plus, des employ\u00e9s qui ne pr\u00e9sentaient aucune caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e ont fait partie du groupe qui y a travaill\u00e9.\n[77] Selon la preuve, un groupe d\u2019employ\u00e9s, et non M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi seul, a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi pour cette initiative. La preuve ne me permet pas de conclure que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 au centre de soutien technique en raison de sa race, de son origine nationale ou ethnique ou de sa religion.\nSepti\u00e8me incident : Milieu de travail et r\u00e9union de TEAM hostiles\n[78] M\u00eame s\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un incident en tant que tel, cette question porte sur l\u2019impression qu\u2019avaient M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins au sujet des conditions qui r\u00e9gnaient dans leur service \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de Rob Pettit et que certains ont d\u00e9crites comme [traduction] \u00ab toxiques \u00bb. Cette question n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e dans la plainte ni dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de nouveau.\n[79] Le 14 septembre 2004, une r\u00e9union a \u00e9t\u00e9 organis\u00e9e par M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et par un certain nombre de ses coll\u00e8gues de travail qui \u00e9taient aussi membres de TEAM. Le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de cette r\u00e9union a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience. De nombreux employ\u00e9s qui ont assist\u00e9 \u00e0 cette r\u00e9union, dont M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, Neil Wyrchowny, Stephen Grant, Ryan Workman, Qwin DeBrant et Ernest Desmarais, ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Selon le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal, les questions suivantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9es avec les d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s syndicaux de TEAM qui \u00e9taient aussi pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 la r\u00e9union :\n1. Changement de titres de poste et combinaison d\u2019\u00e9chelles salariales;\n2. Affectations int\u00e9rimaires : choix et dur\u00e9e;\n3. Choix et r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des SSC d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme employ\u00e9s-pivots dans un lieu de travail en particulier;\n4. Intimidation : activement encourag\u00e9e par Rob Pettit : syst\u00e8me disciplinaire de la \u00ab quarantaine \u00bb pour les employ\u00e9s qui contestaient et qui devenaient des \u00ab cibles \u00bb; les employ\u00e9s \u00ab privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s \u00bb obtenaient les possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi et d\u2019avancement;\n5. Formation : absence de formation pertinente et formation offerte aux employ\u00e9s \u00ab privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s \u00bb;\n6. Diff\u00e9rences dans la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration;\n7. Id\u00e9es novatrices non accept\u00e9es;\n8. Attentes irr\u00e9alistes en mati\u00e8re de rendement au travail;\n9. R\u00e8gles diff\u00e9rentes pour les TB et les TI;\n10. Travail centr\u00e9 sur le processus et non sur la client\u00e8le : Rob Pettit a une politique immuable de la porte ferm\u00e9e;\n11. Manque de confiance envers l\u2019\u00e9quipe de direction de la SGSTI;\n12. Probl\u00e8mes de dotation : postes vacants non pourvus ou pourvus par des employ\u00e9s \u00ab int\u00e9rimaires \u00bb, ce qui entra\u00eene des niveaux de stress insupportables.\n[80] Les points 1 et 6 ci\u2011dessus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les deux seules questions discut\u00e9es sous la rubrique \u00ab priorit\u00e9s \u00bb dans le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de la r\u00e9union.\n[81] Les propos tenus par M. Alizadeh-Ebadi au cours de la r\u00e9union ont \u00e9t\u00e9 relat\u00e9s comme suit dans le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal : [traduction] \u00ab Nouveaux postes (promotions\/avancements) cr\u00e9\u00e9s : habituellement des postes int\u00e9rimaires. \u00bb\n[82] Aucune des affaires soulev\u00e9es pendant la r\u00e9union n\u2019a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un grief fond\u00e9 sur la convention collective avec MTS. Brenda Coutts a affirm\u00e9 sous serment qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise au courant de la r\u00e9union et du proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal apr\u00e8s le fait et que la direction \u00e9tait probablement au courant des questions discut\u00e9es, mais que MTS n\u2019a fait aucun suivi pour r\u00e9gler l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre de ces probl\u00e8mes, \u00e0 part de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019initiative de rotation au centre de soutien technique.\n[83] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Ryan Workman a indiqu\u00e9 que Brian Elliott lui avait dit de ne pas d\u00e9poser de grief au sujet de la question du centre de soutien technique et [traduction] \u00ab de ne pas faire de vagues \u00bb. Ryan Workman a affirm\u00e9 sous serment que le climat de travail s\u2019est am\u00e9lior\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la retraite de Rob Pettit.\n[84] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Ryan Workman, qui \u00e9tait un t\u00e9moin tr\u00e8s cr\u00e9dible, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019au moment de la r\u00e9union, la conduite de certains membres du groupe des employ\u00e9s faisant partie du groupe [traduction] \u00ab des moutons noirs \u00bb, dont il faisait partie avec M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et plusieurs autres, \u00e9tait loin d\u2019\u00eatre exemplaire, parce qu\u2019ils faisaient des choses comme prolonger la pause d\u00e9jeuner et prendre d\u2019autres pauses qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas permises.\n[85] Le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal et la preuve concernant la r\u00e9union indiquent clairement que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et ses coll\u00e8gues de travail de l\u2019\u00e9poque \u00e9taient insatisfaits et frustr\u00e9s de certaines des conditions qui existaient en raison d\u2019actes ou de l\u2019inaction de la direction de MTS, surtout \u00e0 cause du style de gestion de Rob Pettit.\n[86] M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et certains de ses coll\u00e8gues qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience pensaient qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient inscrits sur une [traduction] \u00ab liste de cancres \u00bb de la direction et qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas trait\u00e9s ad\u00e9quatement ou \u00e9quitablement en cons\u00e9quence, ce qui leur donnait l\u2019impression que l\u2019atmosph\u00e8re y \u00e9tait alors \u00ab toxique \u00bb.\n[87] Mais aucune des questions d\u00e9crites au paragraphe 79 ci\u2011dessus ne visait M. Alizadeh-Ebadi lui\u2011m\u00eame, mais plut\u00f4t le groupe des employ\u00e9s concern\u00e9s, dont la plupart n\u2019avaient aucune caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e. Ces affaires n\u2019\u00e9taient pas non plus express\u00e9ment li\u00e9es aux motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la plainte. Pour ces motifs, je ne crois pas que cet incident d\u00e9note que MTS se soit mal comport\u00e9e envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi en fonction de sa race, de son origine nationale ou ethnique ou de sa religion.\nHuiti\u00e8me incident : Refus de promotion au poste de sp\u00e9cialiste principal du soutien \u00e0 la client\u00e8le (employ\u00e9\u2011pivot)\n[88] Dans les diff\u00e9rentes installations de MTS \u00e0 Winnipeg o\u00f9 travaillaient des SSC, certains SSC \u00e9taient d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme \u00ab employ\u00e9s-pivots \u00bb qui, comme le terme le laisse sous\u2011entendre, occupaient un poste sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui des autres SSC. Une indemnit\u00e9 diff\u00e9rentielle \u00e9tait accord\u00e9e \u00e0 ceux qui acceptaient cette responsabilit\u00e9, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une promotion. Avant 2006, les postes ont tous \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9s \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire. \u00c0 proprement parler, les employ\u00e9s-pivots par int\u00e9rim avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9s sur recommandation de Brian Elliott et Brenda Coutts, en leur qualit\u00e9 de chefs d\u2019\u00e9quipe qui supervisaient les employ\u00e9s-pivots par int\u00e9rim, et non \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un processus de concours. \u00c0 une occasion, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a travaill\u00e9 pendant deux mois \u00e0 un poste d\u2019employ\u00e9\u2011pivot par int\u00e9rim pour remplacer un employ\u00e9 absent temporairement, mais la plupart des titulaires ont occup\u00e9 un poste int\u00e9rimaire pendant des p\u00e9riodes beaucoup plus longues.\n[89] En 2006, MTS a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de pourvoir ces postes en permanence et a lanc\u00e9 un concours pour doter six de ces postes.\n[90] L\u2019article 8 de la convention collective entre TEAM et MTS r\u00e9git l\u2019affichage et la dotation des postes vacants au sein de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation.\n[91] MTS a adopt\u00e9 un processus qui devait s\u2019appliquer aux concours. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce processus, MTS :\naffichait les postes vacants conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la convention collective;\nrecevait et \u00e9valuait tous les candidats au poste vacant en fonction des crit\u00e8res d\u00e9crits dans l\u2019avis de poste \u00e0 pourvoir;\n\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection, \u00e9cartait les candidats dont les candidatures d\u00e9montraient qu\u2019ils ne remplissaient pas les crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019avis de poste vacant ou dont les niveaux d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 ou de rendement au travail \u00e9taient inacceptables;\nrecevait en entrevue les postulants dont les candidatures d\u00e9montraient qu\u2019ils remplissaient les crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019avis de poste \u00e0 pourvoir et dont les niveaux d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 ou de rendement au travail \u00e9taient acceptables;\nattribuait le poste.\n[92] En 2006, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature, parmi d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s, \u00e0 un concours visant \u00e0 pourvoir environ six postes vacants d\u2019employ\u00e9-pivot. Pour doter ces postes vacants, MTS a suivi le processus d\u00e9crit au paragraphe 91.\n[93] M. Alizadeh-Ebadi r\u00e9pondait aux crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019avis de poste \u00e0 pourvoir et ses niveaux d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 et de rendement au travail \u00e9taient acceptables. Avec huit autres candidats, il a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u en entrevue par un comit\u00e9 de trois personnes compos\u00e9 de Brian Elliott, Brenda Coutts et Cathy Hanischuk-Morris, une sp\u00e9cialiste du recrutement des ressources humaines dont les t\u00e2ches consistaient notamment \u00e0 recruter des candidats de l\u2019entreprise et de l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur afin de doter les postes vacants. Le comit\u00e9 a interview\u00e9 les candidats qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9s du processus \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection.\n[94] Normalement, MTS faisait appel \u00e0 un comit\u00e9 de trois personnes compos\u00e9 du superviseur du poste vacant, d\u2019une personne \u00ab neutre \u00bb issue d\u2019un autre service et qui n\u2019avait aucun lien avec le poste, ainsi que d\u2019un sp\u00e9cialiste des RH pour orienter la d\u00e9marche. Comme les candidats \u00e0 ces six postes en particulier allaient devoir travailler sous la supervision soit de Brenda Coutts, soit de Brian Elliott (trois chacun), soit les deux chefs d\u2019\u00e9quipe responsables de ces postes, MTS a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait plus efficace d\u2019inclure dans le comit\u00e9 ces deux chefs d\u2019\u00e9quipe et de ne pas ajouter au comit\u00e9 une personne neutre d\u2019un autre service.\n[95] La plupart, sinon l\u2019ensemble, des employ\u00e9s-pivots int\u00e9rimaires d\u00e9j\u00e0 en place \u2013 qui avaient tous \u00e9t\u00e9 recommand\u00e9s aux postes int\u00e9rimaires qu\u2019ils occupaient par Brenda Coutts ou par Brian Elliott \u2013 ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leur candidature aux postes permanents et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7us en entrevue.\n[96] Voici comment s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 le processus :\nBrian Elliott et Brenda Coutts ont r\u00e9dig\u00e9 les qualit\u00e9s requises dans la description des emplois en s\u2019inspirant d\u2019un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent concours au poste d\u2019employ\u00e9-pivot;\nAvant les entrevues, les questions d\u2019entrevue ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9es ainsi qu\u2019une fiche de correction indiquant les bonnes r\u00e9ponses. Il y avait deux types de questions : les questions techniques et les questions sur les comp\u00e9tences essentielles. Brenda Coutts et Brian Elliott ont r\u00e9dig\u00e9 les questions techniques et les r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 celles\u2011ci, et Cathy Hanischuk-Morris a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 les questions sur les comp\u00e9tences essentielles;\nAvant les entrevues, un syst\u00e8me de notation sur 100 points a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli, dont cinq points \u00e9taient allou\u00e9s \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation lors de l\u2019entrevue et les 95 points restants \u00e9taient accord\u00e9s en fonction des r\u00e9ponses aux questions de l\u2019entrevue. Approximativement 60 % de ces points restants \u00e9taient accord\u00e9s pour les questions techniques, et 40 % pour les questions sur les comp\u00e9tences essentielles. Chaque question donnait droit \u00e0 un nombre maximal de points qui variait d\u2019une question \u00e0 l\u2019autre. Brian Elliott et Brenda Coutts ont \u00e9tabli le nombre de points accord\u00e9s pour les questions techniques. Cathy Hanischuk-Morris a \u00e9tabli le nombre de points accord\u00e9s pour les questions sur les comp\u00e9tences essentielles. Pour obtenir le poste, le candidat devait atteindre ou d\u00e9passer une note pr\u00e9d\u00e9termin\u00e9e;\nAvant les entrevues, Cathy Hanischuk-Morris a donn\u00e9 au comit\u00e9 la consigne d\u2019interroger les candidats de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que la m\u00eame personne pose la m\u00eame question \u00e0 chaque candidat dans le m\u00eame ordre sans faire de suggestion ni offrir d\u2019aide;\nCathy Hanischuk-Morris a expliqu\u00e9 le d\u00e9roulement du processus des entrevues \u00e0 chaque candidat d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de chaque entrevue;\nLa note obtenue par chaque candidat \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue devait \u00eatre calcul\u00e9e d\u00e8s la fin de celle\u2011ci et avant l\u2019entrevue du prochain candidat. Les trois membres du comit\u00e9 contribuaient de fa\u00e7on \u00e9gale \u00e0 la notation des r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 chacune des questions et le comit\u00e9 devait en venir \u00e0 un consensus sur celui\u2011ci. Au cours du processus, les membres du comit\u00e9 ont compar\u00e9 leurs notes apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tabli la mesure dans laquelle les r\u00e9ponses du candidat \u00e9taient compatibles avec la grille de r\u00e9ponses de l\u2019entrevue. La notation finale de l\u2019entrevue a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie en additionnant chaque note individuelle;\nUne fois que tous les candidats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7us en entrevue et \u00e9valu\u00e9s, les membres du comit\u00e9 se sont rencontr\u00e9s \u00e0 nouveau pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il fallait apporter des ajustements \u00e0 la notation. Cette rencontre avait pour but d\u2019assurer la coh\u00e9rence du syst\u00e8me de notation \u00e0 la suite de toutes les entrevues, afin que les candidats ne soient pas p\u00e9nalis\u00e9s en fonction du moment o\u00f9 ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9s par rapport aux autres candidats;\nEn fin de compte, le classement final des candidats a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli \u00e0 l\u2019aide des notes re\u00e7ues \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que six postes d\u2019employ\u00e9-pivot \u00e9taient disponibles, les postes devaient \u00eatre offerts aux six candidats les mieux class\u00e9s, dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils avaient obtenu ou d\u00e9pass\u00e9 une note pr\u00e9d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[97] Aucun poste n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi. Les postes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts aux six candidats qui occupaient un poste d\u2019employ\u00e9-pivot par int\u00e9rim, et ceux\u2011ci les ont accept\u00e9s. R\u00e9jean David s\u2019est class\u00e9 au 7e rang au concours, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a obtenu le 8e rang et Qwin DeBrant, le neuvi\u00e8me. Un certain nombre de mois apr\u00e8s le concours, un poste d\u2019employ\u00e9-pivot s\u2019est lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et MTS a nomm\u00e9 R\u00e9jean David au poste vacant sans tenir de concours.\n[98] Les r\u00e9sultats du concours n\u2019ont pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un grief et la documentation qui s\u2019y rattachait, y compris les documents faisant \u00e9tat des notes obtenues \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue et de la m\u00e9thode de calcul employ\u00e9e, n\u2019\u00e9tait plus disponible pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente instruction.\n[99] Des t\u00e9moignages au sujet de cet incident ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus \u00e0 l\u2019audience par M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, Brenda Coutts, Brian Elliott et Don Rooney, qui \u00e9tait directeur des relations de travail, de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de l\u2019environnement de MTS pendant la p\u00e9riode pertinente et qui occupe toujours ce poste.\n[100] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, l\u2019issue du concours avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avance par Brenda Coutts et Brian Elliott pour aider et promouvoir leurs favoris, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire les titulaires qu\u2019ils avaient nomm\u00e9s aux postes int\u00e9rimaires et qui jouissaient ainsi d\u2019une position avantageuse dans le concours. De plus, il croyait que la d\u00e9cision avait \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9e par des blagues et des propos n\u00e9gatifs prononc\u00e9s ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 son sujet par David Atwell et Brenda Coutts, y compris ceux qui faisaient mention de ses voyages en Turquie, de ses absences du travail pendant ses cong\u00e9s de maladie et de son \u00e9thique de travail.\n[101] M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a \u00e9galement remis en question la d\u00e9cision de ne pas nommer un troisi\u00e8me membre vraiment neutre au sein du comit\u00e9, au lieu de Brenda Coutts ou de Brian Elliott qui ne l\u2019aimaient pas selon lui. En dernier lieu, il a remis en question les r\u00e9sultats sous pr\u00e9texte qu\u2019il avait plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 que certains des candidats retenus et que ses connaissances techniques, sa scolarit\u00e9 et ses comp\u00e9tences \u00e9taient sup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 celles de certains autres candidats retenus, \u00e0 son avis.\n[102] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Brenda Coutts a affirm\u00e9 que le processus d\u00e9crit au paragraphe 96 ci\u2011dessus a \u00e9t\u00e9 rigoureusement suivi dans ce cas et qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9roul\u00e9 exactement de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que les concours pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents dont elle s\u2019\u00e9tait occup\u00e9e, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019absence d\u2019une personne \u00ab neutre \u00bb.\n[103] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Brenda Coutts, m\u00eame si les titulaires jouissaient probablement d\u2019un avantage en raison de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience qu\u2019ils avaient acquise en occupant les postes int\u00e9rimaires d\u2019employ\u00e9-pivot pendant de longues p\u00e9riodes, les r\u00e9sultats du concours \u00e9taient enti\u00e8rement attribuables \u00e0 leurs notes \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue, ils n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019avance et ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas fond\u00e9s sur un quelconque favoritisme envers les titulaires ni sur la race, la religion ou l\u2019origine ethnique de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des candidats. Elle a affirm\u00e9 sous serment que la moiti\u00e9 des six candidats retenus \u00e9taient issus de minorit\u00e9s visibles (deux Philippins et un autochtone) et que les deux tiers des candidats qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus \u00e9taient des hommes de race blanche.\n[104] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, Brenda Coutts a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sous serment que si M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a obtenu une note \u00e9gale ou sup\u00e9rieure au r\u00e9sultat minimum le qualifiant pour devenir titulaire du poste, il s\u2019\u00e9tait class\u00e9 au 8e rang sur les neuf candidats re\u00e7us en entrevue. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, il avait obtenu de bonnes notes pour ses r\u00e9ponses aux questions techniques, mais en ce qui concerne les comp\u00e9tences essentielles ses r\u00e9sultats \u00e9taient moindres.\n[105] Le t\u00e9moignage de Brian Elliott corroborait celui de Brenda Coutts. Il a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 sous serment que ce sont les RH qui ont dict\u00e9 la composition du comit\u00e9. De plus, il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que Cathy Hanischuk-Morris avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019attribution des notes seulement pour les questions sur les comp\u00e9tences essentielles, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne connaissait pas bien les questions techniques. M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a obtenu pour les questions techniques de meilleurs r\u00e9sultats que pour celles sur les comp\u00e9tences essentielles. Il a ajout\u00e9 que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi avait obtenu de meilleurs r\u00e9sultats que R\u00e9jean David sur le plan technique, mais que M. David avait recueilli une meilleure note que celle de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue. Il a ajout\u00e9 que l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 n\u2019avait jou\u00e9 aucun r\u00f4le dans l\u2019entrevue et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas fait preuve de parti pris contre M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi dans le d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019entrevue.\n[106] Don Rooney n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 au concours tenu en 2006 pour pourvoir les postes d\u2019employ\u00e9-pivot, mais il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet du processus en termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux du point de vue des RH. Il a confirm\u00e9 que la d\u00e9marche emprunt\u00e9e dans le cadre du concours de 2006 \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait conforme au processus qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 lors de tous les autres concours de MTS pendant la p\u00e9riode allant de 1989 \u00e0 2015 dans les trois unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation de MTS.\n[107] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Don Rooney a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la premi\u00e8re fois que plus d\u2019un gestionnaire recruteur participait \u00e0 un concours. Il arrivait que ce soit le cas dans les trois unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation de MTS lorsqu\u2019il y avait plusieurs postes vacants qui \u00e9taient chapeaut\u00e9s par deux gestionnaires. Il ne savait pas si le cas s\u2019\u00e9tait produit dans une unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation de TEAM avant 2006, mais cela \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 depuis. Quand le concours n\u00e9cessitait l\u2019intervention de deux gestionnaires recruteurs, le comit\u00e9 mis sur pied pour les entrevues se composait de chacun des gestionnaires recruteurs et du repr\u00e9sentant des RH. Cette composition \u00e9tait dict\u00e9e par le repr\u00e9sentant des RH. MTS \u00e9conomisait des ressources en menant ses concours de cette fa\u00e7on, au lieu de tenir plus d\u2019un concours pour pourvoir les m\u00eames postes.\n[108] J\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 tr\u00e8s clairs et tr\u00e8s coh\u00e9rents les t\u00e9moignages de Brenda Coutts, Brian Elliott et Don Rooney \u00e0 propos de cet incident. J\u2019estime que tous ces t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9dibles dans leur t\u00e9moignage au sujet de l\u2019incident. \u00c0 mon avis, leur d\u00e9position n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contredite par ce que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 et elle ne m\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 l\u2019impression que le processus et les entrevues avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on injuste ou partiale de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit au d\u00e9triment de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi.\n[109] J\u2019estime que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi au sujet de cet incident \u00e9tait int\u00e9ress\u00e9 et constitu\u00e9 d\u2019impressions. Il ne m\u2019a pas convaincu que l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des candidats qui avaient re\u00e7u une offre d\u2019emploi par suite de leurs r\u00e9sultats en entrevue, y compris R\u00e9jean David, \u00e9taient aussi ou moins qualifi\u00e9s que lui mais ne pr\u00e9sentaient pas les caract\u00e9ristiques distinctives formant le fondement de sa plainte.\n[110] M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 sous serment \u00e0 l\u2019audience qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u2019avis qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re injuste du fait que Brenda Coutts ne lui avait pas confi\u00e9 un poste int\u00e9rimaire d\u2019employ\u00e9-pivot, sauf pour l\u2019occasion susmentionn\u00e9e. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il croyait que ce fait prouvait que Brenda Coutts avait fait preuve de parti pris contre lui au moment des nominations dans le groupe de SSC dont il faisait partie et qui relevait d\u2019elle. Il avait mentionn\u00e9 les \u00ab postes int\u00e9rimaires \u00bb comme un probl\u00e8me pendant la r\u00e9union de TEAM d\u00e9crite dans les paragraphes consacr\u00e9s au septi\u00e8me incident ci\u2011dessus, m\u00eame si le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9cis \u00e0 ce sujet. Il a dit qu\u2019il avait le sentiment que ces postes int\u00e9rimaires \u2013 qui s\u2019av\u00e9raient \u00eatre des postes \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u2013 avaient accru les chances de formation et de promotion des int\u00e9rimaires dans l\u2019organisation. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, il ne semble pas avoir abord\u00e9 cette question avec Brenda Coutts dans aucune des \u00e9valuations de son rendement, ni avec Neil Wyrchowny, dont il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s proche et qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019origine des postes int\u00e9rimaires d\u2019employ\u00e9-pivot. Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de nommer une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019int\u00e9rim qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e \u00e0 une personne aussi ou moins qualifi\u00e9e que lui mais qui ne pr\u00e9sentait pas les caract\u00e9ristiques distinctives formant le fondement de sa plainte.\n[111] Brenda Coutts a affirm\u00e9 sous serment qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant des pr\u00e9occupations du plaignant \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, et elle a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s son affectation int\u00e9rimaire, elle avait \u00e9crit une note tr\u00e8s \u00e9logieuse \u00e0 son sujet \u00e0 Wayne Horseman et elle avait fait allusion \u00e0 son bon travail dans son \u00e9valuation du rendement suivante. Elle a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il avait \u00e9crit un courriel pour faire \u00e9tat de sa d\u00e9ception apr\u00e8s avoir appris qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi aux postes permanents d\u2019employ\u00e9-pivot, et qu\u2019elle lui avait parl\u00e9 et lui avait conseill\u00e9 d\u2019am\u00e9liorer les comp\u00e9tences qui lui faisaient d\u00e9faut et d\u2019essayer de nouveau. Wayne Horseman lui a \u00e9galement prodigu\u00e9 les m\u00eames conseils. Brenda Coutts a affirm\u00e9 sous serment que ses choix d\u2019employ\u00e9s-pivots par int\u00e9rim \u00e9taient limit\u00e9s, mais qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine ethnique ou la religion. Je crois qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9dible dans son t\u00e9moignage et j\u2019accepte ce t\u00e9moignage pour cet incident.\nNeuvi\u00e8me incident : Absence de prise en consid\u00e9ration d\u2019une invalidit\u00e9 par le truchement d\u2019un programme de retour au travail graduel, 2007\u20112009\n[112] Comme nous l\u2019avons vu aux paragraphes 4 \u00e0 8 inclusivement, cet incident et le motif illicite de la d\u00e9ficience n\u2019\u00e9taient pas mentionn\u00e9s dans la plainte ni dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de nouveau de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi. La Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas recevoir la plainte additionnelle relativement \u00e0 cet incident que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019ajournement de cette audience le 18 juin 2014. Cette autre plainte n\u2019a donc jamais fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate ni d\u2019une saisine du Tribunal par la Commission. La d\u00e9cision de la Commission n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une r\u00e9vision judiciaire. Apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de la Commission, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a supprim\u00e9, dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de nouveau, un passage au sujet de cet incident portant sur les motifs illicites de la race et de la d\u00e9ficience et qui figurait dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9. En d\u00e9pit de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, cette question est abord\u00e9e dans les pr\u00e9sentes comme un incident, parce qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019\u00e9tape de la preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience, l\u2019avocat de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi l\u2019a incluse dans ses observations \u00e9crites qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es et qu\u2019il a transmises \u00e0 MTS le 15 mai 2017 ainsi que dans sa plaidoirie du 19 mai 2017.\n[113] MTS a offert \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi un programme de retour graduel au travail apr\u00e8s son premier accident d\u2019automobile en 2001, comme nous l\u2019avons vu au paragraphe 13 ci\u2011dessus. MTS n\u2019a pas offert \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi un programme de retour graduel au travail apr\u00e8s son deuxi\u00e8me accident d\u2019automobile, comme le pr\u00e9cise le paragraphe 14 ci\u2011dessus.\n[114] Le 11 mai 2007, MTS a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 Des Hathaway, d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ind\u00e9pendante de l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur, comme coordonnateur du retour au travail de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi. Celui\u2011ci n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l\u2019audience, mais diverses lettres ainsi qu\u2019un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des notes qu\u2019il a prises entre 2007 et 2009 \u00e9taient joints \u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits des parties produit comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Ces notes n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[115] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience, il semble que Wayne Horseman ait donn\u00e9 l\u2019ordre de ne pas offrir \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi un programme de retour graduel au travail avant qu\u2019il soit jug\u00e9 apte \u00e0 100 % \u00e0 rentrer au travail. Toutefois, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u00e9tait bien mince concernant ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement produit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des possibilit\u00e9s de retour graduel au travail de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque ainsi que sa capacit\u00e9 et sa volont\u00e9 de rentrer au travail de fa\u00e7on graduelle. Les parties \u00e0 l\u2019audience n\u2019ont appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner ni Wayne Horseman, ni aucun m\u00e9decin praticien, ni Des Hathaway, comme nous l\u2019avons vu.\n[116] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Don Rooney, qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas concern\u00e9 par cet incident, a notamment affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction] \u00ab Non. Je pense que dans ce cas \u2013 je veux dire je ne sais pas \u2013 je ne me suis pas occup\u00e9 de ce cas \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, je n\u2019ai pas particip\u00e9 au processus d\u00e9cisionnel. D\u2019apr\u00e8s ce que je peux voir, M. Horseman, qui ne fait plus partie de l\u2019entreprise, a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 dire : \u201cJe mets mon point sur la table, nous ne ferons aucun accommodement\u201d. Si cette d\u00e9cision avait \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019attention de Bill Kominsky, par exemple, qui s\u2019occupait du dossier des accommodements \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, je pense, il me l\u2019aurait signal\u00e9 et nous aurions assur\u00e9ment dit : \u201cWayne Horseman, tu as tort. Je sais que tu as des budgets \u00e0 respecter, mais cette affaire est plus importante que le budget de ton service. Tu dois lui offrir un accommodement.\u201d \u00bb\n[117] Don Rooney a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que MTS avait comme pratique entre 2007 et 2009 de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des employ\u00e9s qui avaient besoin d\u2019un programme de retour au travail graduel \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9.\nDixi\u00e8me incident : Traitement lors du retour au travail en 2009\n[118] Cet incident englobe de nombreux \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui se sont produits apr\u00e8s le retour au travail de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2009 et qui, selon celui\u2011ci, prouvent que MTS a manqu\u00e9 de d\u00e9licatesse et a \u00e9t\u00e9 peu accueillante envers lui en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9 qui rentrait au travail au bout de presque deux ans d\u2019une absence caus\u00e9e par les graves blessures qu\u2019il avait subies lors d\u2019un accident d\u2019automobile dont il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas responsable. Il estime que ce traitement est une preuve suppl\u00e9mentaire de discrimination.\na) Aucun acc\u00e8s fourni au niveau administratif\n[119] La premi\u00e8re journ\u00e9e de son retour au travail, le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2009, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas l\u2019acc\u00e8s int\u00e9gral au niveau administratif \u00e0 tous les syst\u00e8mes de MTS. Il lui fallait cet acc\u00e8s pour faire son travail. M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a d\u00fb investir un peu de temps et d\u2019efforts pour corriger la situation. Brenda Coutts a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi au d\u00e9but de l\u2019apr\u00e8s\u2011midi pour lui confirmer que Glen Fryatt avait r\u00e9tabli son acc\u00e8s. Dans l\u2019objet de son courriel, elle avait indiqu\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab ID Admin. de Krash \u00bb. M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a jug\u00e9 que cette mention manquait de tact \u00e0 son \u00e9gard apr\u00e8s les blessures graves qu\u2019il avait subies, et qu\u2019elle d\u00e9montrait que MTS ne prenait pas au s\u00e9rieux son retour au travail.\nb) Premier refus de cong\u00e9 pour la f\u00eate turque du Nevruz\n[120] De plus, la premi\u00e8re journ\u00e9e de son retour au travail, le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2009, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a eu une rencontre avec sa superviseure, Brenda Coutts, qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au travail pour rencontrer M. Alizadeh-Ebadi m\u00eame si elle ne se sentait pas bien. Brenda Coutts a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une note de service au sujet de cette rencontre et elle l\u2019a envoy\u00e9e par courriel le m\u00eame jour \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi. Le courriel contenait des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences sugg\u00e9rant \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi de demander de l\u2019aide, au besoin, s\u2019il devait soulever des choses. Dans le courriel, il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019on s\u2019attendait \u00e0 ce que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi ne demande pas de cong\u00e9 pendant sa formation d\u2019appoint au cours des deux semaines suivantes, que des demandes de cette nature ne seraient pas approuv\u00e9es et que Brenda Coutts allait \u00eatre en cong\u00e9 jusqu\u2019au 16 mars 2009. M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 par Brenda Coutts qu\u2019il devait prendre ses cinq journ\u00e9es de cong\u00e9 annuel accumul\u00e9es avant la fin du mois d\u2019avril de cette ann\u00e9e\u2011l\u00e0, sinon il allait les perdre.\n[121] Le ou vers le 10 mars 2009, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a avis\u00e9 Brian Elliott, son superviseur par int\u00e9rim pendant le cong\u00e9 de Brenda Coutts, qu\u2019il d\u00e9sirait s\u2019absenter les 12 et 13 mars 2009 pour c\u00e9l\u00e9brer la f\u00eate culturelle traditionnelle turque du Nevruz, marquant le Nouvel An. Le Nevruz correspond \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quinoxe du printemps qui a en fait lieu le ou vers le 21 mars, mais il est c\u00e9l\u00e9br\u00e9 pendant quatre mercredis avant la date r\u00e9elle, dont aucun ne correspondait aux 12 et 13 mars en 2009. M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et Brenda Coutts se sont quelque peu contredit dans leur t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 propos de la question de savoir s\u2019il avait au d\u00e9part demand\u00e9 les jours de cong\u00e9 pour c\u00e9l\u00e9brer le Nevruz ou pour des raisons personnelles.\n[122] D\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu, Brian Elliott a rejet\u00e9 la demande, parce qu\u2019il avait compris erron\u00e9ment qu\u2019elle allait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la directive de Brenda Coutts enjoignant \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi de ne pas demander de cong\u00e9 et aussi parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait trop tard pour intervenir ad\u00e9quatement dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des horaires des employ\u00e9s. Un \u00e9change tr\u00e8s anim\u00e9 de courriels entre M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et Brian Elliott en a d\u00e9coul\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s avoir soumis le rejet de la demande \u00e0 ses sup\u00e9rieurs hi\u00e9rarchiques, Wayne Horseman a fini par accorder le cong\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi. \u00c0 son retour de cong\u00e9, Brenda Coutts a r\u00e9primand\u00e9 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi par courrier \u00e9lectronique au sujet du ton de ses courriels \u00e0 Brian Elliott et Wayne Horseman.\n[123] M. Alizadeh-Ebadi estimait que le premier refus \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable et injuste et qu\u2019il ne se serait pas produit n\u2019eut \u00e9t\u00e9 son origine ethnique. D\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, ce refus a fait en sorte qu\u2019il s\u2019est senti stress\u00e9 et angoiss\u00e9 par la perspective de son retour au travail.\nc) Formation d\u2019appoint inad\u00e9quate\n[124] Comme nous l\u2019avons mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 120 ci\u2011dessus, une p\u00e9riode de formation d\u2019appoint \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vue lorsque M. Alizadeh-Ebadi est rentr\u00e9 au travail le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2009 apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre absent\u00e9 pendant si longtemps.\n[125] Aucun programme officiel de formation d\u2019appoint n\u2019\u00e9tait en place, mais Brenda Coutts s\u2019attendait \u00e0 ce qu\u2019au cours des deux premi\u00e8res semaines, M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi fasse de \u00ab l\u2019auto-formation \u00bb en posant des questions \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9\u2011pivot, R\u00e9jean David, et en acceptant de s\u2019occuper des demandes de d\u00e9pannage \u00ab faciles \u00e0 traiter \u00bb. M\u00eame si Brenda Coutts avait avis\u00e9 un certain nombre de SSC de tenir compte du retour au travail de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et de l\u2019aider, elle n\u2019a pas rencontr\u00e9 R\u00e9jean David pour lui donner des directives au sujet de ses attentes.\n[126] Du point de vue de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, il n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucune formation d\u2019appoint valable et a eu besoin d\u2019aide pour des questions techniques, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le monde de la technologie avait \u00e9volu\u00e9 si rapidement pendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait absent du travail. Il a affirm\u00e9 sous serment que R\u00e9jean David n\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9ellement pr\u00eat \u00e0 le rencontrer quand il avait besoin d\u2019aide; il a bien re\u00e7u une certaine aide de quelques\u2011uns de ses coll\u00e8gues, mais celle\u2011ci \u00e9tait insuffisante et prouvait que MTS ne s\u2019int\u00e9ressait pas vraiment \u00e0 lui. Il est donc pass\u00e9 pour incomp\u00e9tent aux yeux de ses coll\u00e8gues et du milieu des utilisateurs et il s\u2019est senti d\u00e9prim\u00e9.\n[127] R\u00e9jean David, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin tr\u00e8s cr\u00e9dible, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait re\u00e7u aucune directive particuli\u00e8re de la part de Brenda Coutts \u00e0 propos d\u2019un programme de formation d\u2019appoint pour M. Alizadeh-Ebadi. Il a affirm\u00e9 sous serment qu\u2019il \u00e9tait souvent trop occup\u00e9 pour r\u00e9pondre aux questions, mais il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait l\u2019impression que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi paraissait tr\u00e8s renferm\u00e9 et malheureux quand il est rentr\u00e9 au travail. Il a ajout\u00e9 que la formation d\u2019appoint offerte \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u00e9tait essentiellement la m\u00eame qu\u2019il avait observ\u00e9e dans le cas d\u2019autres personnes qui \u00e9taient rentr\u00e9es au travail apr\u00e8s une absence. Son poste de travail \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 juste \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de celui de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et il a affirm\u00e9 que ce dernier lui r\u00e9pondait simplement [traduction] \u00ab OK \u00bb quand il lui demandait comment les choses se passaient pour lui.\n[128] Dans son t\u00e9moignage au sujet de cet incident, Brenda Coutts a notamment d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nelle a pris des dispositions pour que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi soit trait\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re comparable au traitement qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7u \u00e0 son retour ant\u00e9rieur au travail apr\u00e8s un cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 et \u00e0 celui dont avaient b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019autres personnes de retour apr\u00e8s un cong\u00e9 de maladie ou \u00e0 leur entr\u00e9e ou leur r\u00e9int\u00e9gration dans le milieu de travail;\nelle ne savait pas que M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi avait besoin d\u2019une aide ou d\u2019une formation suppl\u00e9mentaire, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que ce dernier ne l\u2019avait jamais inform\u00e9e d\u2019un besoin de cette nature, qu\u2019il avait laiss\u00e9 un message \u00e0 Des Hathaway, le 3 mars 2009, lui signalant [traduction] \u00ab que MTS faisait preuve d\u2019indulgence et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 se plaindre \u00bb et qu\u2019il avait envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 Brian Elliott pour lui indiquer qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait rapidement mis \u00e0 niveau;\nelle avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 R\u00e9jean David d\u2019aider et d\u2019encadrer M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et elle avait fait des d\u00e9marches aupr\u00e8s d\u2019autres coll\u00e8gues de M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi pour qu\u2019ils l\u2019aident et l\u2019appuient dans son retour au travail;\nquand elle est revenue de son cong\u00e9, R\u00e9jean David et d\u2019autres coll\u00e8gues lui ont dit que la transition de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas faite en douceur, contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on lui avait fait croire; on lui a alors dit que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi n\u2019\u00e9tait pas int\u00e9ress\u00e9 et semblait d\u00e9tach\u00e9.\nd) Perte de donn\u00e9es du disque dur de son ordinateur\n[129] Pendant l\u2019absence de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, son ordinateur a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre employ\u00e9. Habituellement, quand un employ\u00e9 s\u2019absentait pendant une p\u00e9riode prolong\u00e9e, son ordinateur \u00e9tait attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre employ\u00e9, mais le contenu du disque dur \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 \u00eatre sauvegard\u00e9 sur un disque compact pour que l\u2019employ\u00e9 puisse avoir de nouveau acc\u00e8s aux donn\u00e9es \u00e0 son retour au travail. Normalement, les donn\u00e9es \u00e9taient confi\u00e9es au gestionnaire de l\u2019employ\u00e9 qui les lui remettait \u00e0 son retour. Certains employ\u00e9s n\u2019utilisaient pas le disque dur et pr\u00e9f\u00e9raient sauvegarder leurs donn\u00e9es dans un serveur, mais ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le cas de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi.\n[130] L\u2019ordinateur de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9attribu\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux modalit\u00e9s normales, mais le contenu de son disque dur n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sauvegard\u00e9 sur un disque compact, contrairement \u00e0 la politique de la compagnie. Cela a priv\u00e9 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi de renseignements importants, tant pour des raisons professionnelles que personnelles, et la situation l\u2019a frustr\u00e9 et m\u00e9content\u00e9.\n[131] Brenda Coutts avait confi\u00e9 \u00e0 James Dondo, un autre SSC, la t\u00e2che de sauvegarder les donn\u00e9es du disque dur de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi; mais \u00e0 l\u2019insu de Mme Coutts, M. Dondo a omis de s\u2019en acquitter. Elle n\u2019a pas fait de suivi aupr\u00e8s de lui pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer les donn\u00e9es sauvegard\u00e9es de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi sur un disque avant que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi lui en fasse la demande \u00e0 son retour au travail. Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la situation, Mme Coutts s\u2019est aper\u00e7ue que les donn\u00e9es n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sauvegard\u00e9es sur un disque par M. Dondo, comme elle le lui avait demand\u00e9.\n[132] Quand M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a fait part de ce probl\u00e8me \u00e0 Brenda Coutts, le 16 mars 2009, jour o\u00f9 celle\u2011ci est rentr\u00e9e au travail apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9, un \u00e9change tr\u00e8s anim\u00e9 de courriels a eu lieu. Au d\u00e9part, quand M. Alizadeh-Ebadi lui a pos\u00e9 la question, Mme Coutts a r\u00e9pondu que M. Dondo n\u2019avait pas archiv\u00e9 les donn\u00e9es comme il \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 le faire. M. Alizadeh-Ebadi lui a r\u00e9pondu sur un ton sarcastique : [traduction] \u00ab Beau travail SGSTI \u00bb. Brenda Coutts lui a alors r\u00e9pondu : \u00ab Ce sont des choses qui arrivent, tant pis \u00bb. M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a r\u00e9torqu\u00e9 : \u00ab agis comme une dame si tu ne veux pas agir comme une gestionnaire \u00bb, et Brenda Coutts lui a r\u00e9pondu en avertissant M. Alizadeh-Ebadi : \u00ab Fais attention, tu fr\u00f4les l\u2019insubordination. Il n\u2019y a rien que je puisse faire. \u00bb\n[133] Plus tard le m\u00eame jour, Brenda Coutts et M. Alizadeh-Ebadi ont eu une rencontre au cours de laquelle elle lui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des excuses pour ses propos. M. Alizadeh-Ebadi pr\u00e9tend avoir lui aussi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des excuses, ce que Brenda Coutts nie. Apr\u00e8s cette rencontre, Brenda Coutts lui a envoy\u00e9 un courriel dans lequel elle a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 la rencontre, elle a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 les excuses qu\u2019elle lui avait faites, elle a admis que ses propos manquaient de professionnalisme et elle lui a dit qu\u2019elle comprenait sa frustration. Elle n\u2019a pas mentionn\u00e9 les excuses qu\u2019il lui aurait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es. De plus, le courriel se poursuivait par une r\u00e9primande \u00e0 son endroit pour les courriels qu\u2019il lui avait envoy\u00e9s et pour ses demandes de cong\u00e9 pendant son absence. M. Alizadeh-Ebadi s\u2019est alors senti \u00e0 nouveau mal accept\u00e9 et victime de discrimination.\n[134] Plus tard ce jour\u2011l\u00e0, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u le courriel de Brenda Coutts, M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi a quitt\u00e9 le travail en se plaignant de douleurs thoraciques et il s\u2019est rendu \u00e0 l\u2019H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Saint\u2011Boniface. Il a re\u00e7u son cong\u00e9 de l\u2019h\u00f4pital le m\u00eame jour.\n[135] Du 23 f\u00e9vrier 2009 au 23 mars 2009, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au travail 14 jours entre ses absences pour cause de maladie et ses cong\u00e9s. Brenda Coutts \u00e9tait au travail cinq de ces journ\u00e9es. Le 3 mars 2009, Des Hathaway a signal\u00e9 que M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi lui avait indiqu\u00e9 que son retour au travail s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9roul\u00e9 correctement, apr\u00e8s une premi\u00e8re semaine dans des t\u00e2ches adapt\u00e9es. Le 5 mars 2009, M. Hathaway a signal\u00e9 avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi ce jour\u2011l\u00e0 \u00e0 propos d\u2019une maladie qui l\u2019avait forc\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019absenter du travail les 3 et 4 mars; celui\u2011ci l\u2019a alors inform\u00e9 que le probl\u00e8me semblait se r\u00e9sorber de lui\u2011m\u00eame.\n[136] Le 23 mars, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a quitt\u00e9 le travail pendant la journ\u00e9e en laissant une simple note \u00e0 Brenda Coutts pour lui annoncer qu\u2019il \u00e9tait malade et qu\u2019il allait consulter son m\u00e9decin. Ce jour\u2011l\u00e0, le Dr Groohi, de la clinique m\u00e9dicale Red River \u00e0 Winnipeg, a \u00e9crit une lettre dans laquelle il indiquait que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi devait s\u2019absenter du travail entre le 24 mars et le 24 avril 2009 [traduction] \u00ab pour cause de maladie \u00bb. Le 23 mars a \u00e9t\u00e9 la derni\u00e8re journ\u00e9e de travail de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi. Des Hathaway a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi le 25 mars et il a indiqu\u00e9 que sa maladie courante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas reli\u00e9e \u00e0 ses maladies ant\u00e9rieures.\n[137] En date d\u2019avril 2009, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi s\u2019\u00e9tait install\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver et y \u00e9tait trait\u00e9 par le Dr Samborski. Au d\u00e9part, gr\u00e2ce aux contacts que Des Hathaway avait \u00e9tablis avec M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et avec le Dr Samborski le 16 avril 2009, celui\u2011ci pensait que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi serait en mesure de rentrer au travail autour du 24 avril 2009; des efforts ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s en vue de son retour au travail. Toutefois, le 26 avril 2009, le Dr Samborski a \u00e9crit une note pr\u00e9cisant que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi devait s\u2019absenter du travail \u00ab pour cause de maladie \u00bb jusqu\u2019au 25 juillet.\n[138] Le 15 mai 2009, Des Hathaway a \u00e9crit au Dr Samborski afin de lui demander des renseignements susceptibles d\u2019aider MTS \u00e0 prendre des dispositions, sous forme de mesures d\u2019adaptation au besoin, en vue du retour au travail de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi. Des Hathaway a constat\u00e9 que l\u2019absence de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 ne paraissait pas \u00eatre imputable \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes physiques, mais plut\u00f4t au stress caus\u00e9 par ses conditions de travail. Il a fait parvenir un formulaire du programme de retour au travail au Dr Samborski pour que celui\u2011ci le remplisse.\n[139] Le Dr Samborski a rempli et sign\u00e9 le formulaire le 22 mai 2009. Dans ses commentaires, il a indiqu\u00e9 que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u00e9tait trait\u00e9 pour une affection non physique et il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que, m\u00eame s\u2019il esp\u00e9rait que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi puisse retourner au travail \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 au cours des quatre \u00e0 six semaines suivantes, celui\u2011ci ne serait pas capable de retourner \u00e0 son ancien poste, et qu\u2019il ne [traduction] \u00ab comptait pas retourner chez MTS \u00bb.\n[140] J\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, selon lequel les actes de Brenda Coutts et d\u2019autres chez MTS lors des \u00e9v\u00e9nements entourant cet incident l\u2019ont frustr\u00e9 et m\u00e9content\u00e9 et lui ont donn\u00e9 l\u2019impression de ne pas \u00eatre accept\u00e9 \u00e0 son retour au travail. Des erreurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commises et des courriels inappropri\u00e9s et tr\u00e8s anim\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9chang\u00e9s. Toutefois, je ne peux pas d\u00e9duire ni conclure, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve dont je dispose, que ces incidents \u00e9taient fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou la religion de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi. Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la preuve, je ne peux pas non plus croire que personne d\u2019autre que David Atwell chez MTS a eu un comportement raciste envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi pendant son emploi chez MTS.\nOnzi\u00e8me incident : Enqu\u00eate interne et rapport de MTS\n[141] Le 25 mars 2009, le syndicat TEAM a \u00e9crit une lettre au nom de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u00e0 Sandy Adelman, sp\u00e9cialiste de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en emploi chez MTS, pour l\u2019informer notamment du fait que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi croyait qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement, d\u2019intimidation et de discrimination d\u2019ordre racial pendant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es. La lettre faisait notamment mention des propos de David Atwell, du surnom \u00ab Crash \u00bb, de la r\u00e9ception glaciale qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7ue \u00e0 son retour en 2009, du rejet initial de sa demande de cong\u00e9 pour le Nevruz, du manque de possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019avancement et du refus d\u2019un deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur, et elle indiquait que tous ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements l\u2019avaient oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre un cong\u00e9 de maladie en raison de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et de la d\u00e9pression. La lettre ne faisait pas mention du neuvi\u00e8me incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus.\n[142] La lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e comme une plainte interne fond\u00e9e sur la politique de MTS en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement et de respect en milieu de travail qui \u00e9tait en vigueur pendant toute la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par cette plainte. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise \u00e0 Caroline Taylor, \u00e0 Toronto, qui \u00e9tait alors la sp\u00e9cialiste principale de la politique des RH et de la gouvernance de MTS, pour qu\u2019elle fasse enqu\u00eate.\n[143] Le 7 avril 2009, Mme Taylor a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 une entrevue t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi pour tenter de dresser la liste des questions qui, selon lui, devaient faire l\u2019objet de l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Elle a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 des notes au sujet de l\u2019entrevue et elle les lui a fait parvenir pour qu\u2019il les examine et les commente. En se reportant \u00e0 sa conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec lui, elle a ensuite pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un document qui \u00e9num\u00e9rait les sujets de ses plaintes et qui en donnait une description. Elle lui a transmis le document et lui a demand\u00e9 ses commentaires. Elle lui a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et elle a \u00e9chang\u00e9 des courriels avec lui entre le 7 et le 16 avril. Il lui a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019apporter quelques modifications au document et elle les a int\u00e9gr\u00e9es \u00e0 la version d\u00e9finitive de celui\u2011ci.\n[144] La version d\u00e9finitive du document faisait \u00e9tat des sujets suivants, accompagn\u00e9s de descriptions : [traduction] \u00ab rejet de la demande de deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur \u00e0 des fins de recherche \u00bb; \u00ab commentaires irrespectueux en 2001\u20112002 \u00bb; \u00ab manque de formation technique en 2002 \u00bb; \u00ab absence d\u2019avancement en 2006 \u00bb; \u00ab absence de formation d\u2019appoint au retour d\u2019un cong\u00e9 prolong\u00e9 apr\u00e8s le deuxi\u00e8me accident d\u2019automobile (f\u00e9vrier 2009) \u00bb; \u00ab demande de cong\u00e9 pour une f\u00eate culturelle turque rejet\u00e9e en mars 2009 \u00bb; \u00ab commentaire irrespectueux concernant l\u2019enl\u00e8vement du contenu de l\u2019ordinateur pendant une absence prolong\u00e9e (mars 2009) \u00bb. Le document ne faisait pas mention du neuvi\u00e8me incident (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. l\u2019absence de prise en consid\u00e9ration de son invalidit\u00e9) qui est d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus.\n[145] Entre le 20 avril et le 19 mai 2009, Mme Taylor a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 des entrevues t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques au sujet de la plainte interne avec Wayne Horseman, David Atwell, Brenda Coutts, Brian Elliott et Qwin DeBrant et elle a pris des notes au cours de ces entrevues. Elle n\u2019a pas interview\u00e9 d\u2019anciens employ\u00e9s comme Neil Wyrchowny ou Ernest Desmarais.\n[146] Le 20 mai 2009, Mme Taylor a remis un rapport contenant ses conclusions au sujet de la plainte interne. Voici son r\u00e9sum\u00e9 et ses recommandations :\n[traduction]\n\u00ab R\u00e9sum\u00e9 des conclusions :\nBien que certains propos discriminatoires semblent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9s il y a plus de cinq ans, l\u2019examen de la plainte elle\u2011m\u00eame et des courriels fournis par Kouroush ne permet pas de conclure qu\u2019il y a actuellement de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race ou l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique. Dans bien des cas, les entrevues r\u00e9alis\u00e9es avec les personnes qui auraient agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers Kouroush ont permis d\u2019obtenir des explications diff\u00e9rentes au sujet des d\u00e9cisions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises.\nLes attentes de Kouroush en mati\u00e8re de ressources, de formation, de promotion et de cong\u00e9s \u00e0 court d\u00e9lai de pr\u00e9avis ne semblent pas r\u00e9alistes et elles n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 combl\u00e9es pour des raisons qui n\u2019ont rien \u00e0 voir avec la race ou l\u2019origine nationale.\nKouroush emploie un ton irrespectueux et hostile dans ses courriels \u00e0 la direction, qu\u2019il a lui\u2011m\u00eame fournis, et il a provoqu\u00e9 au moins une r\u00e9ponse non professionnelle de la part de la direction, mais cet incident n\u2019est pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme discriminatoire.\nLes conclusions qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9es en revue avec Mark Eklove, conseiller juridique, et Daniele Malcolm, directrice, Politique des RH et gouvernance, le 20 mai 2009. Voici les recommandations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9es :\nRecommandations:\n1. La direction doit se souvenir qu\u2019elle est tenue de toujours communiquer de fa\u00e7on professionnelle avec Kouroush.\n2. Kouroush doit \u00eatre conseill\u00e9 afin qu\u2019il fasse preuve de respect et de courtoisie dans tous ses rapports avec la direction.\n3. Kouroush doit \u00eatre conseill\u00e9 au sujet des strat\u00e9gies qui lui permettraient d\u2019atteindre ses objectifs de carri\u00e8re dans le cadre de la d\u00e9marche d\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement. \u00bb\n[147] Le rapport de Caroline Taylor contenait les observations suivantes \u00e0 propos des commentaires d\u00e9sobligeants de David Atwell :\n[traduction]\n\u00ab Point 2 : Commentaires irrespectueux\nA. Commentaire au sujet de la carte de membre d\u2019AI\u2011Qa\u00efda en 2001\nApr\u00e8s le 11 septembre, Kouroush affirme que le chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe Dave Atwell lui aurait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 deux ou trois reprises s\u2019il allait d\u00e9voiler sa carte de membre d\u2019AI\u2011Qa\u00efda. Dave nie l\u2019avoir fait, mais Qwin DeBrant confirme avoir entendu Dave faire mention d\u2019AI\u2011Qa\u00efda \u00e0 deux ou trois reprises \u00e0 Kouroush entre 2001 et 2004. Qwin n\u2019a pas entendu d\u2019autres propos irrespectueux de la part de Dave \u00e0 Kouroush ou \u00e0 propos de celui\u2011ci. Qwin a affirm\u00e9 que Dave avait aussi fait des remarques insultantes \u00e0 propos d\u2019autres personnes dans le pass\u00e9, mais qu\u2019il s\u2019en abstenait depuis tr\u00e8s longtemps.\nCes propos ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenus il y a plus de cinq ans. Aucune plainte n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e auparavant et Kouroush a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Dave de cesser de faire des commentaires de cette nature.\nB. Surnom \u00ab Crash \u00bb en 2002\nKouroush affirme que Dave a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appeler \u00ab Crash \u00bb devant les autres apr\u00e8s son accident d\u2019automobile en 2002. Dave l\u2019a admis et a dit qu\u2019il avait pris ce surnom de camarades de Kouroush. Le surnom \u00ab Crash \u00bb n\u2019est pas li\u00e9 \u00e0 la race ni \u00e0 l\u2019origine nationale, mais plut\u00f4t au dossier de conducteur. \u00bb\n[148] Apr\u00e8s avoir transmis son rapport, Mme Taylor en a envoy\u00e9 une copie par courriel \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et elle a eu une discussion avec lui \u00e0 ce sujet le 27 mai 2009.\n[149] La r\u00e9action de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u00e0 la suite du rapport est bien illustr\u00e9e dans un courriel qu\u2019il a fait parvenir \u00e0 MTS le 9 juillet 2009, dans lequel il d\u00e9missionne de son emploi en date du 25 juillet 2009.\n[traduction]\n\u00ab Bonjour Don,\nCompte tenu du fait que j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination pendant si longtemps et en raison de l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne partiale qui me fait porter le bl\u00e2me pour certaines fautes, je n\u2019ai d\u2019autre choix que de d\u00e9missionner.\nLa col\u00e8re et la frustration que j\u2019\u00e9prouve \u00e0 la suite du r\u00e9sultat d\u2019une enqu\u00eate \u201cprotectrice\u201d me causent de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et de la nervosit\u00e9 et je ne veux pas finir \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital encore une fois.\nLe simple fait d\u2019imaginer ou d\u2019envisager un retour dans ce milieu me rend malade et je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 renoncer \u00e0 mes ann\u00e9es de dur labeur en \u00e9change de mon bien\u2011\u00eatre mental et physique.\nPar la pr\u00e9sente, je vous informe et j\u2019avise MTS que je ne retournerai pas au travail apr\u00e8s mon cong\u00e9 de maladie (qui se termine le 25 juillet). Vous pouvez donc consid\u00e9rer la pr\u00e9sente comme mon pr\u00e9avis.\nJe vous remercie,\nKouroush \u00bb\n[150] Brenda Coutts a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 un rapport de cessation d\u2019emploi au sujet de M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi, dans lequel elle a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait d\u2019avis \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 que M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi avait un taux d\u2019absent\u00e9isme \u00e9lev\u00e9, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait difficile de lui fournir de la formation et qu\u2019il n\u2019offrait pas un rendement du m\u00eame niveau que celui des autres membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipe. M\u00eame si M. Alizadeh-Ebadi pr\u00e9sentait effectivement un taux d\u2019absent\u00e9isme \u00e9lev\u00e9, rien dans la preuve ne permet de conclure que l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre de ses absences n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9e. De plus, m\u00eame s\u2019il para\u00eet s\u2019\u00eatre renferm\u00e9 vers la fin de son emploi, rien dans la preuve ne corrobore l\u2019avis de Brenda Coutts \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, selon lequel il \u00e9tait difficile de lui fournir de la formation et n\u2019offrait pas un rendement satisfaisant dans les circonstances.\n[151] MTS ne fait plus appel \u00e0 des membres de son personnel pour effectuer les enqu\u00eates au sujet des plaintes, qu\u2019elle confie maintenant \u00e0 des tiers ind\u00e9pendants.\nIII. Cadre juridique \u2013 Responsabilit\u00e9\n[152] Le plaignant a le fardeau initial d\u2019\u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de discrimination. La preuve \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es et qui, si on leur pr\u00eate foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une r\u00e9plique de l\u2019intim\u00e9. L\u2019apparence d\u2019un grief justifi\u00e9 est \u00e9tablie \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la seule preuve du plaignant; la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019est pas prise en compte dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation.\nCommission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpson\u2011Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536 (\u00ab O\u2019Malley \u00bb).\n[153] La norme de preuve qu\u2019il convient d\u2019appliquer est la norme de preuve en mati\u00e8re civile, \u00e0 savoir la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s.\nQu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier A\u00e9ronautique Centre de formation), 2015 CSC 39, [2015] 2 R.C.S. 789.\n[154] Le plaignant n\u2019est pas tenu de prouver que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait l\u2019intention d\u2019agir de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie. En fait, on dit souvent que la discrimination n\u2019est pas une pratique normalement affich\u00e9e ouvertement, et le plaignant ne dispose pas toujours d\u2019une preuve directe dans une affaire de discrimination. Par cons\u00e9quent, il faut tenir compte de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances pour d\u00e9terminer si on peut discerner ce que le Tribunal a qualifi\u00e9 de \u00ab parfum subtile de discrimination \u00bb. Pour ce faire, on peut faire une d\u00e9duction \u00e0 partir d\u2019une preuve circonstancielle. On peut tirer une conclusion de discrimination lorsque la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e rend cette conclusion plus probable que les autres conclusions ou hypoth\u00e8ses possibles.\nBasi c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, (1988), 9 CHRR D\/5029 (\u00ab Basi \u00bb).\n[155] Une preuve prima facie ne peut pas reposer sur de simples all\u00e9gations sinc\u00e8res ou sur des all\u00e9gations qui sont \u00e9tay\u00e9es par une preuve insuffisamment d\u00e9taill\u00e9e. Les all\u00e9gations doivent \u00eatre \u00ab compl\u00e8tes et suffisantes \u00bb. Une preuve qui est vague, qui rel\u00e8ve de l\u2019impression et qui est principalement constitu\u00e9e d\u2019opinions personnelles ne suffit pas \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une apparence de grief justifi\u00e9.\nKhiamal c. Greyhound Canada Transportation Corporation, 2007 TCDP 34; Hill c. Air Canada, 2003 TCDP 9 (\u00ab Hill \u00bb); Morin c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 TCDP 41 (\u00ab Morin \u00bb).\n[156] Pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019article 7b) de la LCDP, le plaignant doit \u00e9tablir que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait \u00e0 son \u00e9gard une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable par rapport \u00e0 d\u2019autres et qu\u2019il existait un lien entre la diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable et un motif illicite de discrimination pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la LCDP. La diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable sous\u2011entend qu\u2019une distinction a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite entre le plaignant et un ou plusieurs autres employ\u00e9s et qu\u2019elle cause un pr\u00e9judice au plaignant.\nOpheim c. Gagan Gill & Gillco Inc., 2016 TCDP 12; Chaudhary c. Smoother Movers, 2013 TCDP 15.\n[157] Dans les affaires mettant en cause un concours pour l\u2019obtention d\u2019un emploi, vis\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 7b) de la LCDP, le Tribunal a \u00e9tabli un crit\u00e8re \u00e0 trois volets qui sert de guide dans les cas o\u00f9 une autre personne que le plaignant est engag\u00e9e. Dans ces cas, le plaignant doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour l\u2019emploi convoit\u00e9, qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas obtenu l\u2019emploi convoit\u00e9 et que l\u2019emploi convoit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 un candidat pas plus qualifi\u00e9 que lui, mais qui n\u2019a pas le trait distinctif qui sert de fondement \u00e0 sa plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne. Mais ce crit\u00e8re ne doit pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re rigide ou arbitraire; il faut plut\u00f4t appr\u00e9cier les circonstances de chaque cas. En fin de compte, il s\u2019agit de savoir si le plaignant a satisfait au crit\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat O\u2019Malley, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire : si elle est accept\u00e9e, est\u2011ce que la preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant le tribunal est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier une d\u00e9cision en faveur du plaignant en l\u2019absence d\u2019une r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e?\nPremakumar c. Air Canada, 2002 CanLII 23561 (TCDP)\n[158] Une fois que le plaignant s\u2019est d\u00e9charg\u00e9 du fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de discrimination, il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que le comportement en apparence discriminatoire peut s\u2019expliquer de mani\u00e8re raisonnable. La r\u00e9ponse ou l\u2019explication doit \u00eatre crue et ne doit pas s\u2019av\u00e9rer un pr\u00e9texte. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la discrimination soit l\u2019unique raison de la d\u00e9cision ou de la conduite reproch\u00e9e pour qu\u2019une plainte soit accueillie. Il suffit que la discrimination ait \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur, m\u00eame si d\u2019autres facteurs \u00e9taient aussi en cause.\nBasi, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e.\n[159] Le pouvoir du Tribunal d\u2019examiner une plainte d\u00e9coule de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de demander au Tribunal d\u2019instruire une plainte en vertu de l\u2019article 49 de la LCDP. Si la Commission d\u00e9cide de ne pas recevoir une plainte en application de l\u2019article 41(1)e) de la LCDP, la plainte ne donnera lieu \u00e0 aucune enqu\u00eate et la Commission ne demandera pas au Tribunal d\u2019instruire la plainte en application de l\u2019article 49. C\u2019est la raison pour laquelle le Tribunal n\u2019a pas le pouvoir d\u2019instruire une plainte que la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas recevoir.\n[160] L\u2019article 50(1) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal donne aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations sur les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte. Le fait pour une partie \u00e0 une audience d\u2019avoir le droit de conna\u00eetre les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es contre elle et d\u2019avoir une possibilit\u00e9 \u00e9quitable d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre est une question d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, conform\u00e9ment aux principes de justice naturelle qui sont incarn\u00e9s dans cette disposition de la LCDP.\n[161] Selon le devoir d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, les personnes vis\u00e9es par une d\u00e9cision doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter enti\u00e8rement et \u00e9quitablement leur position. Elles ont droit \u00e0 ce que les d\u00e9cisions touchant leurs droits, int\u00e9r\u00eats ou privil\u00e8ges soient prises \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un processus \u00e9quitable, impartial et ouvert, adapt\u00e9 au contexte l\u00e9gal, institutionnel et social de la d\u00e9cision.

Bien que la LCDP ne donne pas la d\u00e9finition du terme \u00ab harc\u00e8lement \u00bb, le Tribunal et les cours de justice ont donn\u00e9 des directives sur son interpr\u00e9tation qui sont pertinentes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, notamment :\ni) la conduite doit \u00eatre non sollicit\u00e9e par la victime et li\u00e9e \u00e0 un motif de distinction illicite qui a un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le milieu de travail ou des cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9judiciables en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi pour la victime;\nMorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e.\nii) le harc\u00e8lement r\u00e9side essentiellement dans la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un climat de travail hostile, qui porte atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 personnelle du plaignant;\nDawson c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2008 TCDP 41 (\u00ab Dawson \u00bb).\niii) un seul incident peut, dans certains cas, suffire \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail hostile; dans d\u2019autres cas, il faut un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition ou de persistance.

Questions en litige\n[164] Les questions en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire sont les suivantes :\ni) Le Tribunal devrait\u2011il statuer sur les all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur les motifs illicites de la race ou de la d\u00e9ficience en ce qui concerne le neuvi\u00e8me incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus?\nii) Le Tribunal devrait\u2011il statuer sur l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le motif illicite de la d\u00e9ficience en ce qui concerne l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des autres incidents d\u00e9crits ci\u2011dessus?\nM. Alizadeh-Ebadi s\u2019est\u2011il acquitt\u00e9 du fardeau de prouver \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de discrimination dans le cadre de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des autres incidents d\u00e9crits ci\u2011dessus et sur lesquels le Tribunal est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 statuer?\nSi M. Alizadeh-Ebadi s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 du fardeau de prouver \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de discrimination dans le cadre de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des autres incidents d\u00e9crits ci\u2011dessus et sur lesquels le Tribunal est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 statuer, MTS s\u2019est\u2011elle acquitt\u00e9e de son fardeau en donnant une explication raisonnable qui n\u2019est pas un pr\u00e9texte?\nLe cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, quelles mesures de redressement devraient \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce?\nV. Analyse \u2013 Responsabilit\u00e9\nA. Premi\u00e8re question\n[165] En d\u00e9pit des faits \u00e9nonc\u00e9s aux paragraphes 4 \u00e0 8 inclusivement et mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 nouveau au paragraphe 112, l\u2019avocat de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations \u00e9crites pour \u00e9tayer les all\u00e9gations de discrimination de la part de MTS envers M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi, dans le cadre du neuvi\u00e8me incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus, en invoquant non seulement les motifs illicites de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique et de la religion, mais aussi le motif illicite de la d\u00e9ficience. De plus, l\u2019avocat de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations \u00e9crites pour \u00e9tayer les all\u00e9gations de discrimination de la part de MTS envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi dans le cadre des autres incidents d\u00e9crits ci\u2011dessus, en invoquant des motifs illicites qui comprenaient le motif illicite de la d\u00e9ficience. Avant de produire ces arguments, aucune requ\u00eate n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant le Tribunal pour modifier la plainte de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi ou les actes de proc\u00e9dure qui ne font, ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre, pas mention du neuvi\u00e8me incident ni de la d\u00e9ficience comme motif illicite dans le contexte des autres incidents.\n[166] Comme nous l\u2019avons vu au paragraphe 9 ci\u2011dessus, les parties se sont \u00e9chang\u00e9 leurs observations sur consentement de leurs avocats plusieurs jours avant que les plaidoiries soient entendues. Dans ses observations \u00e9crites, l\u2019avocat de MTS n\u2019a pas fait mention du neuvi\u00e8me incident ni du motif illicite de la d\u00e9ficience dans le contexte de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des incidents d\u00e9crits ci\u2011dessus. Les observations \u00e9crites de MTS faisaient \u00e9tat des \u00e9v\u00e9nements (sauf du neuvi\u00e8me \u00e9v\u00e9nement qui n\u2019y \u00e9tait pas mentionn\u00e9) en les qualifiant d\u2019\u00ab incidents \u00bb et elles en faisaient l\u2019analyse en lien avec les motifs illicites \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la plainte, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique et la religion, mais pas la d\u00e9ficience qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mentionn\u00e9e dans la plainte ni dans les actes de proc\u00e9dure de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi.\n[167] Dans sa plaidoirie du 19 mai 2017, l\u2019avocat de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a reconnu que l\u2019avocat de MTS n\u2019avait pas fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au neuvi\u00e8me incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus ni au motif illicite de la d\u00e9ficience dans ses observations \u00e9crites relativement \u00e0 l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des incidents. L\u2019avocat de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a \u00e9galement reconnu, dans sa plaidoirie, que MTS avait b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019un \u00ab laissez\u2011passer \u00bb en ce qui concerne le neuvi\u00e8me incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la Commission avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas se saisir de la plainte additionnelle de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi.\n[168] Toutefois, l\u2019avocat de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a fait valoir dans sa plaidoirie que le Tribunal devrait, pour trancher le litige, consid\u00e9rer [traduction] \u00ab les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9ficience \u00bb comme un motif de distinction illicite par MTS relativement \u00e0 certains des autres incidents d\u00e9crits dans la plainte, m\u00eame si la d\u00e9ficience n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mentionn\u00e9e comme motif illicite dans la plainte ni dans les actes de proc\u00e9dure. Les \u00ab ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9ficience \u00bb faisaient partie du passage que M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi a supprim\u00e9 dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 (avec la race) dans le contexte du neuvi\u00e8me incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus apr\u00e8s que la Commission a refus\u00e9 de s\u2019en saisir dans le cadre d\u2019une plainte additionnelle. Selon la plaidoirie de l\u2019avocat de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, ce motif d\u00e9coule du fait que m\u00eame si M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de mesures d\u2019adaptation de la part de MTS sous la forme d\u2019un programme de retour au travail graduel pendant environ un an et demi apr\u00e8s son premier accident d\u2019automobile en 2001, Brenda Coutts, Brian Elliott et d\u2019autres gestionnaires de MTS n\u2019auraient pas cru que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u00e9tait d\u00e9ficient \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 et auraient tenu des propos au travail qui laissaient entendre qu\u2019il \u00ab feignait \u00bb, qu\u2019il avait probablement fait des voyages en Turquie pendant sa p\u00e9riode d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente et que son \u00e9thique de travail \u00e9tait donc douteuse.\n[169] Dans sa plaidoirie, l\u2019avocat de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a fait valoir que cette conduite all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de la part de Brenda Coutts, de Brian Elliott et d\u2019autres gestionnaires de MTS \u2013 qui consistait \u00e0 ne pas croire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieure de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et \u00e0 faire des commentaires non corrobor\u00e9s au sujet de son \u00e9thique de travail et de ses voyages en Turquie \u2013 a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses all\u00e9gations d\u2019actes discriminatoires envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de MTS, y compris en ce qui concerne l\u2019emploi du surnom \u00ab Krash \u00bb et le fait que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 promu en 2006. Autrement dit, m\u00eame si la d\u00e9ficience n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mentionn\u00e9e comme motif illicite dans la plainte ou les actes de proc\u00e9dure, l\u2019avocat de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a fait valoir dans sa plaidoirie que la d\u00e9ficience de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi d\u00e9coulant de son premier accident d\u2019automobile (\u00e0 la suite duquel il avait b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de mesures d\u2019adaptation) avait contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 un certain nombre des pr\u00e9tendus incidents discriminatoires imput\u00e9s \u00e0 MTS et qui seraient survenus \u00e0 la suite de cet accident, parce que les gestionnaires de MTS ne croyaient pas \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieure de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi. D\u2019apr\u00e8s les observations orales de l\u2019avocat de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, le Tribunal devrait maintenant en tenir compte pour d\u00e9cider du pr\u00e9sent litige.\n[170] L\u2019avocat de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a cit\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision Egan c. Canada Revenue Agency, 2012 TCDP 31, une d\u00e9cision que j\u2019ai rendue dans un litige dont je suis encore saisi. Dans cette affaire, j\u2019ai permis que l\u2019on apporte une modification \u00e0 une plainte apr\u00e8s avoir conclu qu\u2019il existait un lien logique entre la modification et la plainte originale et que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne subirait aucun pr\u00e9judice, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait amplement le temps d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre. Contrairement au pr\u00e9sent litige, j\u2019ai pris ma d\u00e9cision dans cette affaire datant de 2012 \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant bien avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience. En fait, l\u2019audience dans cette affaire vient \u00e0 peine de commencer.\n[171] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 166 ci\u2011dessus, l\u2019avocat de MTS n\u2019a pas mentionn\u00e9 le neuvi\u00e8me incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus ni le motif illicite de la d\u00e9ficience dans le contexte de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des incidents dans ses observations \u00e9crites qu\u2019il a transmises \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi quelques jours avant la derni\u00e8re journ\u00e9e d\u2019audience au cours de laquelle les plaidoiries devaient \u00eatre entendues. Dans sa plaidoirie, l\u2019avocat de MTS n\u2019\u00e9tait pas du m\u00eame avis que l\u2019avocat de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi au sujet de la premi\u00e8re question en litige pour les motifs suivants : 1) le Tribunal n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 convenablement saisi du neuvi\u00e8me incident et du motif illicite de la d\u00e9ficience dans le contexte de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des incidents afin d\u2019en d\u00e9cider, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas mentionn\u00e9s dans la plainte trait\u00e9e par la Commission et qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont donc pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate ni d\u2019un renvoi au Tribunal; 2) \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape tardive apr\u00e8s la preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience, il serait injuste pour le Tribunal de juger qu\u2019il est valablement saisi du neuvi\u00e8me incident ou du motif illicite de la d\u00e9ficience dans le contexte de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des incidents avant de rendre sa d\u00e9cision.\n[172] Je souscris aux arguments de MTS en ce qui concerne la premi\u00e8re question en litige pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci\u2011dessous.\n[173] M. Alizadeh-Ebadi n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019absence de prise en consid\u00e9ration d\u2019une invalidit\u00e9 dans sa plainte ni dans ses actes de proc\u00e9dure et ces documents ne contiennent aucune mention du motif illicite de la d\u00e9ficience.\n[174] La Commission a refus\u00e9 d\u2019examiner la plainte additionnelle de M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi, dans laquelle il invoquait l\u2019absence de prise en consid\u00e9ration d\u2019une invalidit\u00e9 par le truchement d\u2019un programme de retour au travail graduel apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident de 2007. Cette plainte additionnelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e en invoquant les motifs illicites de la race et des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de d\u00e9ficience apr\u00e8s qu\u2019une modification visant \u00e0 ajouter cette all\u00e9gation \u00e0 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions a suscit\u00e9 des objections de la part de MTS.\n[175] On doit pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019en demandant l\u2019ajournement de la pr\u00e9sente audience en juin 2014 et en d\u00e9posant par la suite sa plainte additionnelle, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a conclu que le neuvi\u00e8me incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus et les motifs de la race et des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de d\u00e9ficience relativement \u00e0 celui\u2011ci n\u2019\u00e9taient pas inclus dans sa plainte originale. La d\u00e9cision de la Commission n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une r\u00e9vision judiciaire et aucune requ\u00eate n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal pour modifier la plainte ou les actes de proc\u00e9dure. Apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas examiner la plainte additionnelle et avant la reprise de l\u2019audience en juin 2016, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a supprim\u00e9 les mots \u00ab race et ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de d\u00e9ficience \u00bb dans la modification propos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, ainsi que toute all\u00e9gation relative \u00e0 l\u2019absence de prise en consid\u00e9ration d\u2019une invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019accident d\u2019automobile de 2007.\n[176] Pour ces motifs, en ce qui concerne le premier volet de la premi\u00e8re question en litige et compte tenu des faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et du paragraphe 159 ci\u2011dessus, je suis d\u2019avis que le Tribunal n\u2019est pas valablement saisi du neuvi\u00e8me incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus et qu\u2019il ne devrait pas statuer sur les all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race et la d\u00e9ficience concernant le neuvi\u00e8me incident.\n[177] L\u2019avocat de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi fait valoir que le Tribunal devrait conclure que MTS a fait preuve de discrimination envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi dans le cadre de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des incidents d\u00e9crits ci\u2011dessus, laquelle discrimination \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e en partie sur le motif illicite de la d\u00e9ficience, comme le d\u00e9montre l\u2019incr\u00e9dulit\u00e9 de certains gestionnaires au sujet des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de d\u00e9ficience de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u00e0 la suite de son premier accident d\u2019automobile, lorsque MTS a pris des mesures d\u2019adaptation envers M Alizadeh-Ebadi en lui offrant un programme de retour au travail graduel. Le Tribunal est invit\u00e9 \u00e0 rendre cette d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape des plaidoiries, alors que l\u2019\u00e9tape de la preuve est termin\u00e9e depuis longtemps et sans qu\u2019une requ\u00eate lui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour modifier la plainte ou les actes de proc\u00e9dure. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, on ne trouve aucune mention dans la plainte ni dans les actes de proc\u00e9dure du motif illicite de la d\u00e9ficience ni d\u2019une all\u00e9gation relative \u00e0 l\u2019absence de prise en consid\u00e9ration d\u2019une invalidit\u00e9 en particulier.\n[178] \u00c0 mon avis, \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019\u00e9tape de la preuve lors de l\u2019audience, MTS avait toutes les raisons de croire que les all\u00e9gations invoquant le motif illicite de la d\u00e9ficience n\u2019\u00e9taient pas l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente instruction, compte tenu des faits \u00e9nonc\u00e9s aux paragraphes 4 \u00e0 8 ci\u2011dessus et des mentions de ces faits au paragraphe 112. MTS a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa preuve en tenant compte de cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9 et il serait injuste et contraire aux principes de justice naturelle de changer maintenant la port\u00e9e de l\u2019instruction en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce en raison de moyens invoqu\u00e9s par l\u2019avocat de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi pour faire en sorte que le motif illicite de la d\u00e9ficience soit vis\u00e9 par la pr\u00e9sente instruction.\n[179] Pour ces motifs, en ce qui concerne le deuxi\u00e8me volet de la premi\u00e8re question en litige et compte tenu des faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et des paragraphes 160, 161 et 162 ci\u2011dessus, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il serait injuste de statuer sur toute all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le motif illicite de la d\u00e9ficience dans le contexte de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des incidents d\u00e9crits ci\u2011dessus.\nB. Deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me questions en litige\nPremier incident : Remarques formul\u00e9es par David Atwell\n[180] Compte tenu de la preuve, y compris des conclusions que j\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9es aux paragraphes 22, 24, 27, 31, 35, 36, 37 et 40 ci\u2011dessus, je suis d\u2019avis que M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 de son fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de discrimination contre lui \u00e0 MTS, discrimination fond\u00e9e sur les motifs illicites de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 14(1)c) de la LCDP, en ce qui concerne le premier incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus.\n[181] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 aux paragraphes 25 et 26 ci\u2011dessus, David Atwell a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des excuses \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi pour son comportement et MTS a admis que certaines remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes formul\u00e9es pendant un certain temps par M. Atwell sur le lieu de travail \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi constituaient du harc\u00e8lement au sens de la LCDP.\n[182] Essentiellement, MTS a expliqu\u00e9 cette conduite comme suit : (i) le nombre limit\u00e9 de commentaires et la p\u00e9riode limit\u00e9e au cours de laquelle ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9s permettent de conclure que le harc\u00e8lement n\u2019\u00e9tait pas grave ni persistant; (ii) la trop grande sensibilit\u00e9 de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi aux commentaires et le fait qu\u2019il les a exag\u00e9r\u00e9s dans son t\u00e9moignage; (iii) le fait que l\u2019incident n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9 \u00e0 la direction avant le rapport interne Taylor, ce qui disculpe MTS en vertu de l\u2019article 65(2) de la LCDP.\n[183] \u00c0 mon avis, la preuve et mes conclusions, y compris celles qui sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es aux paragraphes 31, 35, 36 et 40 ci\u2011dessus, infirment les explications de MTS mentionn\u00e9es ci\u2011dessus. Pour ce qui est de l\u2019article 65(2) de la LCDP, compte tenu de mes conclusions au paragraphe 35 ci\u2011dessus, la direction de MTS \u00e9tait consciente ou aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre consciente du comportement harcelant de M. Atwell envers M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi bien avant le rapport de Caroline Taylor, comme l\u2019ont affirm\u00e9 les propres t\u00e9moins de MTS.\n[184] En cons\u00e9quence, MTS aurait d\u00fb prendre des mesures positives pour mettre fin \u00e0 ce harc\u00e8lement quand David Atwell a prononc\u00e9 ces paroles d\u00e9sobligeantes. Elle a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son devoir de prendre des mesures promptes et efficaces, conform\u00e9ment aux principes juridiques \u00e9nonc\u00e9s aux alin\u00e9as 163(viii) et (ix) ci\u2011dessus.\nDeuxi\u00e8me incident : Refus d\u2019accorder un deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur\n[185] Compte tenu de la preuve, y compris de mes conclusions au paragraphe 48 ci\u2011dessus, je suis d\u2019avis que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 de son fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de discrimination contre lui \u00e0 MTS, discrimination fond\u00e9e sur les motifs illicites de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de la religion, sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019article 7b) de la LCDP, en ce qui concerne le deuxi\u00e8me incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus.\n[186] \u00c0 mon avis, au moment de cet incident, David Atwell \u00e9tait intol\u00e9rant envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi en raison de sa race, de son origine nationale ou ethnique ou de sa religion et il l\u2019a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 en rejetant sa demande l\u00e9gitime, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019entremise de son superviseur Neil Wyrchowny, de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier du m\u00eame privil\u00e8ge de disposer d\u2019un deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur qui lui \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire, comme en avaient la plupart de ses coll\u00e8gues. Les motifs de ce refus qu\u2019a mentionn\u00e9s David Atwell dans son t\u00e9moignage ne sont pas cr\u00e9dibles ni raisonnables \u00e0 mes yeux, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019un deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur \u00e9tait un outil dont M. Alizadeh-Ebadi avait besoin pour faire son travail et que la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par son superviseur Neil Wyrchowny pour en obtenir un \u00e9tait l\u00e9gitime au plan de l\u2019analyse de rentabilisation.\n[187] MTS a expliqu\u00e9 cette conduite comme suit : i) M. Alizadeh-Ebadi n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment des autres; ii) le refus n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 sur un motif illicite indiqu\u00e9 dans la plainte. Compte tenu de la preuve, je ne peux admettre ces explications. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le clairement que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues par suite du refus de lui accorder un deuxi\u00e8me ordinateur, lequel n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9 \u00e0 pratiquement aucun d\u2019entre eux. De plus, David Atwell \u00e9tait \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque intol\u00e9rant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la race, de l\u2019origine ethnique ou de la religion de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, comme le pr\u00e9cisent mes conclusions relativement au premier incident, et son attitude envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a \u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 mon avis, un facteur omnipr\u00e9sent dans tous ses rapports avec lui.\n[188] \u00c0 mon avis, les principes juridiques \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au paragraphe 154 ci\u2011dessus appuient mon raisonnement au sujet du deuxi\u00e8me incident, dans la mesure o\u00f9 j\u2019ai d\u00e9duit qu\u2019on peut percevoir le \u00ab parfum subtile de la discrimination \u00bb dans cet incident en raison des actes de David Atwell.\nTroisi\u00e8me incident : Rejet de demandes de formation\n[189] Compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, y compris de mes conclusions au paragraphe 51 ci\u2011dessus, j\u2019estime que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi s\u2019est d\u00e9charg\u00e9 de son fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de discrimination contre lui \u00e0 MTS, discrimination fond\u00e9e sur les motifs illicites de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de la religion, comme le pr\u00e9voit l\u2019article 7b) de la LCDP, en ce qui concerne le troisi\u00e8me incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus.\n[190] Le raisonnement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 aux paragraphes 186, 187 et 188 ci\u2011dessus en ce qui concerne le deuxi\u00e8me incident est applicable au troisi\u00e8me incident, en ce sens que j\u2019estime que David Atwell \u00e9tait \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque intol\u00e9rant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la race, de l\u2019origine ethnique ou de la religion de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi. Par cons\u00e9quent, il l\u2019a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 pour ces motifs illicites en rejetant la demande de formation pour le projet Win2K pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au nom de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, alors qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas refus\u00e9 cette formation \u00e0 d\u2019autres coll\u00e8gues de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi qui ne poss\u00e9daient pas ses caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles. L\u00e0 encore, je suis en mesure de d\u00e9duire, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve en ce qui concerne cet incident, que les actes de David Atwell d\u00e9gagent un \u00ab parfum subtile de discrimination \u00bb.\nQuatri\u00e8me incident : Emploi des surnoms \u00ab Crash \u00bb ou \u00ab Kourash \u00bb\n[191] Compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, y compris des conclusions que j\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 60 ci\u2011dessus, j\u2019estime que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9 de son fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de discrimination contre lui \u00e0 MTS, discrimination fond\u00e9e sur les motifs illicites de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de la religion, en vertu de l\u2019article 14(1)c) ou de l\u2019article 7b) de la LCDP, en ce qui concerne le quatri\u00e8me incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus.\n[192] Ces surnoms n\u2019\u00e9taient pas agr\u00e9ables \u00e0 entendre ou \u00e0 lire pour M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi en raison des blessures qu\u2019il avait subies lors de ses accidents d\u2019automobile. L\u2019emploi de ces jeux de mots inspir\u00e9s de son nom t\u00e9moigne d\u2019un manque de sensibilit\u00e9 et de respect envers une personne qui avait subi des blessures douloureuses \u00e0 la suite d\u2019accidents dont il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas responsable. M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a fait savoir \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues qu\u2019il n\u2019appr\u00e9ciait pas l\u2019emploi de ces noms, mais ils ont persist\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de sa carri\u00e8re chez MTS. Toutefois, les arguments que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi fait valoir relativement \u00e0 cet incident invoquent express\u00e9ment le motif illicite de la d\u00e9ficience dont le Tribunal n\u2019est pas saisi et au sujet duquel il n\u2019a pas \u00e0 se prononcer en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, pour les raisons donn\u00e9es ci\u2011dessus dans la partie V, analyse de la premi\u00e8re question en litige.\nCinqui\u00e8me incident : Commentaires \u00e0 propos des voyages en Turquie et de l\u2019\u00e9thique de travail de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi\n[193] Compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, y compris des conclusions que j\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9es aux paragraphes 67, 68 et 69 ci\u2011dessus, j\u2019estime que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9 de son fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de discrimination contre lui \u00e0 MTS, discrimination fond\u00e9e sur les motifs illicites de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de la religion, au titre de l\u2019article 14(1)c) ou de l\u2019article 7b) de la LCDP, en ce qui concerne le cinqui\u00e8me incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus.\n[194] \u00c0 mon avis, Brenda Coutts, la superviseure de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, et Brian Elliott, qui le supervisait en l\u2019absence de Mme Coutts, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas influenc\u00e9s par leur association avec David Atwell au point de tenir des propos discriminatoires envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi. Peut\u2011\u00eatre ont\u2011ils \u00e9t\u00e9 de bons ou de m\u00e9diocres gestionnaires, mais, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 ci\u2011dessus, j\u2019accepte leur t\u00e9moignage et le fait qu\u2019ils nient avoir tenu de tels propos. J\u2019estime que leur t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait cr\u00e9dible et coh\u00e9rent au sujet de cet incident. Je juge que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins qui ont laiss\u00e9 entendre qu\u2019ils avaient tenu ces propos a \u00e9t\u00e9 vague et incoh\u00e9rent et qu\u2019il relevait d\u2019impressions.\n[195] En dernier lieu, l\u2019argumentation de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi relativement \u00e0 cet incident faisait le lien entre ces propos et le motif illicite de la d\u00e9ficience dont le Tribunal n\u2019est pas saisi et au sujet duquel il n\u2019a pas \u00e0 se prononcer en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, pour les raisons donn\u00e9es ci\u2011dessus sous la partie V, analyse de la premi\u00e8re question en litige.\nSixi\u00e8me incident : Rel\u00e9gation au centre de soutien technique\n[196] Compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, y compris des conclusions que j\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 77 ci\u2011dessus, j\u2019estime que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9 de son fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de discrimination contre lui \u00e0 MTS, discrimination fond\u00e9e sur les motifs illicites de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de la religion, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 7b) de la LCDP, en ce qui concerne le sixi\u00e8me incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus.\n[197] \u00c0 mon avis, la preuve au sujet de cet incident d\u00e9montre sans \u00e9quivoque que les actes de MTS ne visaient pas M. Alizadeh-Ebadi lui\u2011m\u00eame, mais plut\u00f4t un groupe d\u2019employ\u00e9s qui comprenait M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et certains de ses coll\u00e8gues. La mise \u00e0 l\u2019essai de ce programme \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre, de la part de MTS, une mauvaise d\u00e9cision qui visait, du moins en partie, un groupe d\u2019employ\u00e9s dont certains n\u2019\u00e9taient pas tenus en haute estime par la direction en raison de leur rendement. Toutefois, j\u2019estime que cette d\u00e9cision ne visait pas M. Alizadeh-Ebadi lui\u2011m\u00eame et qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e sur les motifs illicites de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de la religion. De nombreux membres du groupe de coll\u00e8gues touch\u00e9s par ce programme n\u2019avaient aucune caract\u00e9ristique distinctive prot\u00e9g\u00e9e.\nSepti\u00e8me incident : Milieu de travail et r\u00e9union de TEAM hostiles\n[198] Compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, y compris des conclusions que j\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 87 ci\u2011dessus, j\u2019estime que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9 de son fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de discrimination contre lui \u00e0 MTS, discrimination fond\u00e9e sur les motifs illicites de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de la religion, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 14(1)c) ou \u00e0 l\u2019article 7b) de la LCDP, en ce qui concerne le septi\u00e8me incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus.\n[199] Au cours de la r\u00e9union qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 cet incident, de nombreux travailleurs syndiqu\u00e9s et leurs repr\u00e9sentants ont discut\u00e9 d\u2019un certain nombre d\u2019enjeux qui pr\u00e9sageaient sans doute un mauvais climat de travail \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque au sein de la division GSTI en raison de divers actes ou de l\u2019inaction de la direction de MTS. Les actes de la direction dont les participants se sont plaints au cours de la r\u00e9union ne comprenaient pas la discrimination vis\u00e9e par la LCDP. Le groupe [traduction] \u00ab des moutons noirs \u00bb mentionn\u00e9 dans le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de la r\u00e9union s\u2019appliquait autant \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi qu\u2019\u00e0 un certain nombre de ses coll\u00e8gues dont plusieurs n\u2019avaient aucune caract\u00e9ristique distinctive prot\u00e9g\u00e9e.\n[200] \u00c0 mon avis et dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es que mon raisonnement au paragraphe 197 ci\u2011dessus en ce qui concerne le sixi\u00e8me incident, cet incident ne constitue pas de la discrimination, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne visait pas seulement M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 sur les motifs illicites de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de la religion.\nHuiti\u00e8me incident : Refus de promotion au poste de sp\u00e9cialiste principal du soutien \u00e0 la client\u00e8le (employ\u00e9-pivot)\n[201] Compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, y compris des conclusions que j\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9es aux paragraphes 108, 109 et 111 ci\u2011dessus, j\u2019estime que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9 de son fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de discrimination contre lui \u00e0 MTS, discrimination fond\u00e9e sur les motifs illicites de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de la religion, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 7b) de la LCDP, en ce qui concerne le huiti\u00e8me incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus.\n[202] Il ressort tr\u00e8s clairement des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve relatifs \u00e0 cet incident qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par le comit\u00e9 de trois personnes \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une \u00e9valuation \u00e9quitable du rendement de tous les candidats en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie de questions d\u2019examen qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es et not\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on juste et coh\u00e9rente. Rien \u00e0 propos de ce concours ne me donne l\u2019impression qu\u2019il existait un quelconque parti pris contre M. Alizadeh-Ebadi. Je ne per\u00e7ois aucun \u00ab parfum subtile \u00bb de discrimination de la part de MTS envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi dans cet incident.\n[203] D\u2019autre part, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 aux paragraphes 108, 109 et 111 ci\u2011dessus, je suis d\u2019avis que les t\u00e9moignages de Brenda Coutts, Brian Elliott et Don Rooney \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s cr\u00e9dibles, tandis que celui de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u00e9tait vague et fond\u00e9 sur des impressions de l\u2019incident et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tablissait pas, de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit, que le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 trois volets \u00e9nonc\u00e9 au paragraphe 157 a \u00e9t\u00e9 rempli en ce qui concerne le concours pour les postes d\u2019employ\u00e9-pivot ou une autre possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019int\u00e9rim qui ne lui aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e.\nDixi\u00e8me incident : Traitement lors du retour au travail en 2009\n[204] Compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, y compris des conclusions que j\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 140, j\u2019estime que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9 du fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de discrimination contre lui \u00e0 MTS, discrimination fond\u00e9e sur les motifs illicites de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de la religion, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 14(1)c) ou \u00e0 l\u2019article 7b) de la LCDP, en ce qui concerne le dixi\u00e8me incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus.\n[205] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve relatifs \u00e0 cet incident me donnent \u00e0 penser que les superviseurs de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et certains de ses coll\u00e8gues n\u2019\u00e9taient pas aussi sympathiques ou obligeants envers lui qu\u2019ils auraient d\u00fb l\u2019\u00eatre dans les circonstances \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0. Cette situation a sans doute contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 son sentiment d\u2019inutilit\u00e9, de frustration et de d\u00e9pression. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve, je crois \u00e9galement que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un employ\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement heureux ou motiv\u00e9 \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque et qu\u2019il agissait en cons\u00e9quence pour des raisons qui d\u00e9coulaient de ses blessures r\u00e9centes, de ses absences du travail et de la r\u00e9ception froide qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7ue dans son milieu de travail. \u00c0 mon avis, la combinaison de ces facteurs a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019origine de certains des actes et des comportements regrettables et d\u00e9plac\u00e9s qui se sont produits entre la direction et M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, dont la plupart t\u00e9moignaient d\u2019une mauvaise gestion de la part de MTS et de Brenda Coutts en particulier.\n[206] M\u00eame si aucun expert m\u00e9dical n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l\u2019audience, vu le rapport de l\u2019H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Saint\u2011Boniface au sujet de son admission et de son cong\u00e9 le 16 mars 2009, il est probable que les incidents qui se sont produits ce jour\u2011l\u00e0 concernant la perte des donn\u00e9es de son ordinateur et les \u00e9changes tr\u00e8s anim\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet avec Brenda Coutts l\u2019aient incit\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter son travail et \u00e0 se rendre \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital en raison de douleurs thoraciques et du stress. Mais je ne peux pas d\u00e9tecter le \u00ab parfum subtile de discrimination \u00bb envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi dans les \u00e9v\u00e9nements relat\u00e9s au sujet de cet incident. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 140, je ne suis pas en mesure de d\u00e9duire ou de conclure que l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre de ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 d\u2019une fa\u00e7on quelconque sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou la religion de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi.\nOnzi\u00e8me incident : Enqu\u00eate interne et rapport de MTS\n[207] De toute \u00e9vidence, pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s aux paragraphes 180 \u00e0 188 ci\u2011dessus, je ne puis souscrire aux conclusions en ce qui concerne les points 1 et 2 du rapport interne \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019enqu\u00eate (qui correspondent au premier et au deuxi\u00e8me incidents ci\u2011dessus) ni aux recommandations qui en d\u00e9coulent. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 ci\u2011dessus, j\u2019estime que MTS a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation de cr\u00e9er et maintenir un milieu de travail sans harc\u00e8lement en omettant de prendre des mesures promptes et efficaces envers David Atwell au moment du harc\u00e8lement et du comportement injuste de celui\u2011ci envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, alors qu\u2019elle en \u00e9tait consciente ou qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb en \u00eatre consciente. \u00c0 mon avis, les conclusions et les recommandations de Caroline Taylor en ce qui concerne ces points sont erron\u00e9es et inop\u00e9rantes, car elle a conclu que rien de plus ne pouvait \u00eatre fait \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le harc\u00e8lement de la part de David Atwell \u00e9tait chose du pass\u00e9 et qu\u2019aucune plainte interne en bonne et due forme n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. Pour ces motifs, des ordonnances r\u00e9paratoires concernant ces questions sont rendues ci\u2011dessous.\n[208] De plus, j\u2019estime que l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne et le rapport ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9s d\u2019une fa\u00e7on quelque peu superficielle et sans l\u2019objectivit\u00e9 qui s\u2019imposait. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019enqu\u00eate aurait d\u00fb faire appel \u00e0 d\u2019anciens employ\u00e9s cl\u00e9s, comme Neil Wyrchowny et Ernest Desmarais \u2013 qui n\u2019auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9s par une relation d\u2019emploi existante avec MTS \u2013, au lieu de se limiter \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s en place chez MTS (dont certains, y compris David Atwell, semblent avoir donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Caroline Taylor une version de la preuve l\u00e9g\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rente de celle que j\u2019ai entendue). De plus, il est difficile d\u2019assurer le caract\u00e8re objectif et \u00e9quitable de ce type d\u2019exercice quand on fait appel \u00e0 un enqu\u00eateur qui travaille aussi pour la compagnie et quand on fait r\u00e9viser son rapport par des avocats employ\u00e9s de la compagnie avant sa publication. Je pr\u00e9sume que MTS est d\u2019accord sur ce point, puisqu\u2019elle a chang\u00e9 ses pratiques \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 151 ci\u2011dessus.\n[209] Nonobstant les paragraphes 206 et 207 ci\u2011dessus, sur la foi de la preuve dont je dispose, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne et le rapport, ainsi que les conclusions et recommandations de Caroline Taylor, ne constituent pas un traitement d\u00e9favorable ou du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur les motifs illicites de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de la religion de la part de Mme Taylor ou de MTS envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, au sens de la LCDP. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 ci\u2011dessus, je ne puis souscrire \u00e0 certains aspects de la d\u00e9marche qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e dans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne et du rapport ni \u00e0 certaines des conclusions et des recommandations. D\u2019apr\u00e8s ce que je comprends, les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne et du rapport ont boulevers\u00e9 et d\u00e9\u00e7u M. Alizadeh-Ebadi. Mais je ne puis conclure \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve dont je dispose que Caroline Taylor ou MTS auraient agi d\u2019une mani\u00e8re discriminatoire envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi dans le cadre de la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne et du rapport ou de l\u2019\u00e9laboration des conclusions et des recommandations.\nVI. D\u00e9cision\n[210] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, je juge que la plainte est fond\u00e9e en ce qui concerne :\na) le premier incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus, en application de l\u2019article 14(1)c) de la LCDP, pour les motifs illicites de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de la religion;\nb) le deuxi\u00e8me incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus, en application de l\u2019article 7b) de la LCDP, pour les motifs illicites de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de la religion;\nc) le troisi\u00e8me incident d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus, en application de l\u2019article 7b) de la LCDP, pour les motifs illicites de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de la religion.\n[211] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, je conclus que la plainte n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e en ce qui concerne les incidents 4 \u00e0 8 d\u00e9crits ci\u2011dessus ainsi que les incidents 10 et 11 d\u00e9crits ci\u2011dessus, et je la rejette en cons\u00e9quence. Comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9 plus haut, je ne suis pas valablement saisi du neuvi\u00e8me incident et la plainte en d\u00e9coulant est donc \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9e.\nVII. Cadre juridique \u2013 R\u00e9parations\n[212] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 2 ci\u2011dessus, l\u2019article 53(2) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e peut, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 54, rendre une ordonnance \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire et y inclure les conditions que le membre instructeur consid\u00e8re indiqu\u00e9es et qui sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es aux alin\u00e9as a) \u00e0 e) inclusivement.\n[213] En pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une preuve de pr\u00e9judice moral, il faut tenter d\u2019indemniser la victime. L\u2019octroi du montant maximal permis par l\u2019article 53(2)e) de la LCDP doit \u00eatre r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux cas d\u2019actes discriminatoires les plus flagrants.\nGrant c. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2012 TCDP 10 (\u00ab Grant \u00bb).\n[214] L\u2019article 53(3) de la LCDP est une disposition qui a pour objet de dissuader et de d\u00e9courager ceux qui se livrent de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires. Il y a un acte discriminatoire d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 lorsque l\u2019acte discriminatoire et l\u2019atteinte aux droits de la personne prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Loi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 intentionnels. On entend par \u00ab acte inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00bb un acte qui t\u00e9moigne d\u2019un m\u00e9pris ou d\u2019une indiff\u00e9rence quant aux cons\u00e9quences et d\u2019une mani\u00e8re d\u2019agir t\u00e9m\u00e9raire ou insouciante. L\u2019octroi du montant maximal que pr\u00e9voit cette disposition est \u00e0 r\u00e9server aux cas les plus graves.\nGrant, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e.\n[215] L\u2019article 53(2)b) de la LCDP conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019ordonner la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration d\u2019un employ\u00e9 qui a perdu son emploi \u00e0 cause d\u2019un acte discriminatoire de son employeur \u00e0 son endroit. Pour que le Tribunal puisse exercer ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, il doit \u00eatre convaincu qu\u2019il existe au moins une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse, sinon une probabilit\u00e9, que le plaignant aurait occup\u00e9 ce poste n\u2019eut \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019acte discriminatoire et que la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration est indiqu\u00e9e dans les circonstances, et il doit analyser le lien entre la pratique discriminatoire et la perte pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\nGrant, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e.\n[216] Bien que, s\u2019agissant d\u2019une plainte fond\u00e9e, le Tribunal jouisse d\u2019un vaste pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire lui permettant d\u2019ordonner des mesures de redressement en vertu de l\u2019article 53(2) de la LCDP afin de replacer le plaignant dans la situation dans laquelle il se serait trouv\u00e9 si l\u2019acte discriminatoire n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 commis, l\u2019emploi des mots \u00ab entra\u00een\u00e9s par l\u2019acte \u00bb signifie qu\u2019il doit y avoir un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre la r\u00e9paration accord\u00e9e et la discrimination. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal doit \u00e9tudier soigneusement tous les faits pertinents, au cas par cas, afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien de causalit\u00e9 suffisant pour justifier la r\u00e9paration.\nCanada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), [2001] A.C.F. no 1922 (\u00ab Carter \u00bb).\n[217] Il incombe au plaignant de prouver qu\u2019il a droit aux r\u00e9parations sollicit\u00e9es. Il doit prouver que si l\u2019acte discriminatoire ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas produit, il aurait obtenu les paiements et les prestations qu\u2019il demande en guise de r\u00e9paration (ou, s\u2019il demande un remboursement, qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas eu \u00e0 engager les d\u00e9penses r\u00e9clam\u00e9es). Pour s\u2019acquitter de ce fardeau, le plaignant doit prouver par pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s qu\u2019il existe une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse que les dommages pour lesquels il demande une indemnisation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s par la conduite en violation de la LCDP.\nCulic c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2007 TCDP 1.\n[218] Le Tribunal doit \u00eatre guid\u00e9 par le bon sens, qui exige que des limites encadrent la responsabilit\u00e9 des cons\u00e9quences d\u2019un acte, en l\u2019absence de mauvaise foi. Le bon sens nous enseigne qu\u2019il faut exclure les cons\u00e9quences qui se manifestent le long de la cha\u00eene de causalit\u00e9, mais qui sont trop lointaines.\nCarter, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e.\nVIII. Analyse \u2013 R\u00e9parations\nC. Quatri\u00e8me question en litige\n[219] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape des plaidoiries, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a fait valoir que tous les incidents d\u00e9crits ci\u2011dessus avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9s, d\u00e9montrant ainsi le bien-fond\u00e9 de sa plainte. Au m\u00eame moment, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a \u00e9galement fait des observations sur les r\u00e9parations, m\u00eame si, de toute \u00e9vidence, il ignorait alors ce qu\u2019allait \u00eatre ma d\u00e9cision sur la responsabilit\u00e9. \u00c0 son avis, compte tenu des faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je devrais rendre une ordonnance d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 MTS en application des articles 53(2) et 53(3) de la LCDP et y inclure les modalit\u00e9s suivantes :\nDes dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux \u00e9quivalant au montant maximal de 20 000 $ pour le pr\u00e9judice moral d\u00e9coulant des actes discriminatoires, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 53(2)e) de la LCDP;\nUne indemnisation sp\u00e9ciale \u00e9quivalant au montant maximal de 20 000 $ pour avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019actes discriminatoires d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9s ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9s, en vertu de l\u2019article 53(3) de la LCDP;\nLa r\u00e9int\u00e9gration de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi dans un poste semblable \u00e0 celui qu\u2019il occupait avant de d\u00e9missionner, en vertu de l\u2019article 53(2)b) de la LCDP;\nEn vertu des articles 53(2)b), c) et d) de la LCDP :\nl\u2019octroi des pertes de salaire entre le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2009 et le 30 juin 2015 (cette date ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 convenue par les parties dans leur expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits), repr\u00e9sentant un montant de 161 180 $ qui \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence entre les gains totaux (y compris le r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration variable, le r\u00e9gime d\u2019actionnariat des employ\u00e9s, les frais dentaires et le montant des primes pr\u00e9vus dans la convention collective) que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi aurait encaiss\u00e9s chez MTS s\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 par MTS pendant cette p\u00e9riode et les revenus qu\u2019il a r\u00e9ellement gagn\u00e9s au cours de la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode;\nl\u2019octroi d\u2019un montant \u00e0 quantifier ult\u00e9rieurement pour la perte de revenus de pension;\nl\u2019octroi d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement de 12 419,30 $ (qui comprend des frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement de 4 000 $ ainsi qu\u2019une somme de 8 419,30 $ en p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 de liquidation d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que pour sa maison de Winnipeg) pour les d\u00e9penses qu\u2019il a engag\u00e9es afin de se r\u00e9installer avec sa famille en Colombie\u2011Britannique.\nM. Alizadeh-Ebadi a fait valoir qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas eu \u00e0 assumer toutes les pertes et les d\u00e9penses susmentionn\u00e9es s\u2019il \u00e9tait demeur\u00e9 un employ\u00e9 de MTS, ce qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas sans les actes discriminatoires de MTS qui l\u2019ont oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter son emploi.\nL\u2019octroi des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur tous les chefs de dommages au taux de la Banque du Canada \u00e0 compter de la date de la perte jusqu\u2019au 30 juin 2015 ou selon ce que le Tribunal d\u00e9cidera, en vertu de l\u2019article 53(4) de la LCDP.\nEn vertu de l\u2019article 53(2)a) de la LCDP,une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 MTS d\u2019offrir \u00e0 ses gestionnaires de premi\u00e8re ligne une formation sur la sensibilit\u00e9 et une formation portant sur la discrimination et ses obligations sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP. De plus, une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 MTS de collaborer avec la Commission pour faire en sorte de mettre en \u0153uvre les politiques appropri\u00e9es, en particulier en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement, de discrimination et de respect en milieu de travail.\nM. Alizadeh-Ebadi fait valoir que ces ordonnances sont n\u00e9cessaires, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas \u00e9vident que MTS a tir\u00e9 des le\u00e7ons de cette exp\u00e9rience et parce qu\u2019elle doit changer ses fa\u00e7ons de r\u00e9agir \u00e0 l\u2019avenir face \u00e0 la discrimination en milieu de travail.\n[220] M. Alizadeh-Ebadi affirme que la pr\u00e9sente affaire repr\u00e9sente l\u2019accumulation de tous les incidents de discrimination d\u00e9crits ci\u2011dessus, qui ont culmin\u00e9 lors des dixi\u00e8me et onzi\u00e8me incidents qui l\u2019ont finalement incit\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9missionner de son poste chez MTS pour se prot\u00e9ger et pour prot\u00e9ger son bien\u2011\u00eatre. Il affirme qu\u2019il a d\u00fb quitter le travail et se rendre \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital \u00e0 cause de douleurs thoraciques et du stress que lui a occasionn\u00e9 l\u2019accueil peu enthousiaste de ses coll\u00e8gues \u00e0 son retour au travail en f\u00e9vrier 2009, apr\u00e8s une absence de deux ans \u00e0 la suite des blessures qu\u2019il avait subies lors d\u2019un accident dont il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas responsable. Il a dit qu\u2019il avait alors eu des flashbacks de tous les incidents pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents d\u00e9crits ci\u2011dessus, qu\u2019il estimait tous discriminatoires. Quand il a finalement fait une plainte interne \u00e0 propos de ces incidents en vertu de la politique sur le respect en milieu de travail de MTS, il a essuy\u00e9 une rebuffade de la part de MTS dans un rapport interne qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, [traduction] \u00ab noyait le poisson \u00bb. Il affirme qu\u2019il s\u2019est alors aper\u00e7u qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas retourner travailler chez MTS, \u00e0 cause de cette accumulation de comportements discriminatoires de la part de MTS au fil des ans; ceux\u2011ci n\u2019\u00e9taient pas r\u00e9gl\u00e9s et le rendaient d\u00e9prim\u00e9, angoiss\u00e9 et souffrant quand il \u00e9tait au travail chez MTS. Apr\u00e8s avoir quitt\u00e9 MTS et s\u2019\u00eatre install\u00e9 en Colombie\u2011Britannique, il a donc d\u00e9missionn\u00e9, en d\u00e9pit du fait que Des Hathaway tentait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation pour qu\u2019il r\u00e9int\u00e8gre les effectifs. Il fait valoir qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas remis sa d\u00e9mission chez MTS si les incidents d\u00e9crits ci\u2011dessus, qu\u2019il croit tous discriminatoires, ne s\u2019\u00e9taient pas produits. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a affirm\u00e9 que les mesures de r\u00e9paration d\u00e9crites au paragraphe 219 ci\u2011dessus devraient \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de MTS, parce que les incidents discriminatoires chez MTS ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nuisibles, pr\u00e9judiciables et d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9s et qu\u2019ils l\u2019ont forc\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter son emploi chez MTS.\n[221] MTS r\u00e9torque qu\u2019un comportement discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli seulement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du premier incident et uniquement pendant une p\u00e9riode relativement courte il y a longtemps. MTS fait valoir qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas responsable du premier incident, parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019y avait pas consenti, comme le pr\u00e9voit l\u2019article 65(2) de la LCDP, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u de plainte \u00e0 ce sujet. Elle ajoute que dans tous les autres incidents, la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur les motifs illicites de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de la religion n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e ou, si elle l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9, que MTS a fourni une explication raisonnable qui n\u2019est pas un pr\u00e9texte au sujet du comportement. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle fait valoir qu\u2019aucune mesure de r\u00e9paration ne devrait \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9e.\n[222] Je conclus que la plainte \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e en ce qui concerne les premier, deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me incidents d\u00e9crits ci\u2011dessus, comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 au paragraphe 210, mais que le reste de la plainte, qui vise les incidents 4 \u00e0 11 inclusivement, est rejet\u00e9, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 211 ci\u2011dessus.\n[223] Essentiellement, je juge que la discrimination exerc\u00e9e par MTS envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement attribuable au comportement de David Atwell au d\u00e9but de l\u2019emploi de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait alors intol\u00e9rant envers la race, l\u2019origine ethnique ou nationale ou la religion de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi et qu\u2019il s\u2019est livr\u00e9 aux actes discriminatoires mentionn\u00e9s relativement aux incidents 1, 2 et 3 d\u00e9crits ci\u2011dessus. Je conclus d\u2019autre part que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s boulevers\u00e9 et malheureux \u00e0 cause de ces incidents et qu\u2019il a fait conna\u00eetre ses sentiments \u00e0 d\u2019autres, que MTS \u00e9tait au courant ou aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre au courant de ces actes discriminatoires de David Atwell, qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb agir en cons\u00e9quence pour faire en sorte d\u2019y mettre fin et qu\u2019elle a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation de le faire.\n[224] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus qu\u2019une ordonnance doit \u00eatre rendue contre MTS pour les actes discriminatoires que j\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9s en ce qui concerne les incidents 1, 2 et 3 d\u00e9crits ci\u2011dessus, parce qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment discriminatoires et qu\u2019ils ont caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice moral grave \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi. Je crois que la conduite de David Atwell lors de ces incidents \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s blessante et pr\u00e9judiciable pour M. Alizadeh-Ebadi. MTS aurait d\u00fb y mettre fin il y a de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait au courant ou aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre au courant de ce qu\u2019il se passait. Je viens donc \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019un montant de 20 000 $ pour chacun des deux chefs de r\u00e9clamation pr\u00e9vus aux articles 53(2)e) et 53(3) de la LCDP est justifi\u00e9 et appropri\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et que MTS doit \u00eatre condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 le payer \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi pour ces incidents de discrimination, avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 53(4) de la LCDP sur chacun des deux montants de 20 000 $, calcul\u00e9s et payables \u00e0 compter du 1er janvier 2002 jusqu\u2019au 30 juin 2015.\n[225] Essentiellement, j\u2019estime que les incidents 4 \u00e0 8 ainsi que les incidents 10 et 11 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 blessants et p\u00e9nibles pour M. Alizadeh-Ebadi pour diverses raisons qui sont tr\u00e8s faciles \u00e0 comprendre. Certains \u00e9taient imputables \u00e0 une gestion m\u00e9diocre de la part de MTS et d\u2019autres, au comportement d\u00e9plac\u00e9 d\u2019employ\u00e9s de MTS envers M. Alizadeh\u2011Ebadi. Toutefois, \u00e0 mon avis, ils n\u2019ont pas donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un comportement discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur les motifs illicites de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de la religion envers M. Alizadeh-Ebadi par quiconque chez MTS. C\u2019est la raison pour laquelle je ne peux pas conclure qu\u2019il existe un lien de causalit\u00e9 fond\u00e9 sur la discrimination entre ces incidents et la d\u00e9mission de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, qui aurait pu m\u2019autoriser \u00e0 ordonner les r\u00e9parations pr\u00e9vues par la LCDP que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi demande aux paragraphes 219c), d) et e) ci\u2011dessus \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces incidents. \u00c0 mon avis, il n\u2019existe pas non plus de lien de causalit\u00e9 raisonnable ou logique qui aurait justifi\u00e9 ces r\u00e9parations entre les incidents 1, 2 et 3 d\u00e9crits ci\u2011dessus et la d\u00e9mission de M. Alizadeh-Ebadi, compte tenu du temps qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre ces incidents et la d\u00e9mission. Autrement dit, m\u00eame si j\u2019estime que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a eu raison de ne pas vouloir continuer \u00e0 travailler chez MTS pour prot\u00e9ger sa sant\u00e9 et son bien\u2011\u00eatre, \u00e0 cause des sentiments qu\u2019il \u00e9prouvait face au climat dans lequel il \u00e9voluait chez MTS en 2009, je ne pense pas que le climat qui y r\u00e9gnait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque \u00e9tait imputable \u00e0 un comportement discriminatoire de MTS envers lui. Pour ces motifs, je ne rendrai pas les ordonnances que M. Alizadeh-Ebadi demande aux paragraphes 219c), d) et e) ci\u2011dessus.\n[226] Cependant, je me pr\u00e9occupe du fait que David Atwell pourrait encore avoir besoin d\u2019aide pour apprendre \u00e0 agir avec respect envers les autres en milieu de travail, m\u00eame si j\u2019ai entendu des t\u00e9moignages laissant entendre qu\u2019il a modifi\u00e9 son comportement dans l\u2019intervalle. Je me pr\u00e9occupe \u00e9galement du fait que MTS ne comprend pas encore tout \u00e0 fait qu\u2019elle doit agir de mani\u00e8re plus proactive pour r\u00e9agir dans des circonstances comme celles auxquelles M. Alizadeh-Ebadi a d\u00fb faire face dans le contexte des incidents 1, 2 et 3 ci\u2011dessus et qu\u2019elle pourrait devoir modifier ses politiques pour obtenir de meilleurs r\u00e9sultats \u00e0 ce chapitre. Pour ces motifs, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 MTS de consulter la Commission pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 ces deux lacunes.\nIX. Ordonnances\n[227] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, j\u2019ordonne par les pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 MTS :\nde payer \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi la somme de 20 000 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral, en vertu de l\u2019article 53(2)e) de la LCDP, avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats calcul\u00e9s du 1er janvier 2002 au 30 juin 2015, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 53(4) de la LCDP;\nde payer \u00e0 M. Alizadeh-Ebadi la somme de 20 000 $ en guise d\u2019indemnisation sp\u00e9ciale, en vertu de l\u2019article 53(3) de la LCDP, avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats calcul\u00e9s du 1er janvier 2002 au 30 juin 2015, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 53(4) de la LCDP;\nde consulter la Commission afin d\u2019inscrire David Atwell \u00e0 un ou des cours de formation traitant du respect en milieu de travail et de la discrimination, de consulter \u00e9galement la Commission pour que celle\u2011ci passe en revue ses diverses politiques portant sur le harc\u00e8lement, le respect en milieu de travail et la discrimination et de les modifier en cons\u00e9quence au besoin.\nSign\u00e9 par :\nEdward P.

Les plaintes\n[1] Sur le fondement de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi), Mme Ashraf Karimi soutient que son employeur, anciennement MTS Allstream Inc., maintenant Zayo Canada Inc. (Zayo), l\u2019a prise \u00e0 partie et trait\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9favorable en raison de son sexe et de sa d\u00e9ficience. L\u2019employeur aurait notamment formul\u00e9 des critiques injustifi\u00e9es, lui aurait attribu\u00e9 un imposant volume de t\u00e2ches, dont des t\u00e2ches qui d\u00e9passaient les limites physiques li\u00e9es \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience, lui aurait refus\u00e9 des possibilit\u00e9s de formation et, finalement, l\u2019aurait r\u00e9trograd\u00e9e. Mme Karimi pr\u00e9tend avoir souffert de stress, d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et de d\u00e9pression \u00e0 cause de ce traitement et avoir d\u00fb prendre un cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e \u00e0 plusieurs reprises. Une fois ses prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e \u00e9puis\u00e9es, elle a pris un cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e. Elle a ensuite tent\u00e9 de retourner au travail, mais Mme Karimi affirme que Zayo lui a refus\u00e9 toute forme d\u2019accommodement.\n[2] Mme Karimi soutient \u00e9galement qu\u2019aux termes de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi, le fait que Zayo ne soit pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement aux fins de son retour au travail s\u2019apparente \u00e0 des repr\u00e9sailles en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la plainte qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e relativement au traitement discriminatoire dont elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime en milieu de travail.\n[3] Durant ses observations orales finales, l\u2019avocat de Mme Karimi a soulev\u00e9, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, une all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 10b) de la Loi. Comme ce motif n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 dans les plaintes initialement d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par Mme Karimi et que Zayo n\u2019a pas v\u00e9ritablement eu l\u2019occasion de r\u00e9pondre, le Tribunal estime qu\u2019il serait inappropri\u00e9 de se prononcer sur cette question. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019est pas question de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en application de l\u2019article 10b) de la Loi dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs.\n[4] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je rejette les plaintes de Mme Karimi.\nII. Proc\u00e9dure d\u2019audience\n[5] La pr\u00e9sente affaire a d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue par l\u2019ancien membre B\u00e9langer. La pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve a pris fin le 17 septembre 2014. Des observations finales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par \u00e9crit et des observations orales finales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en avril 2015. Malheureusement, le membre B\u00e9langer est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 27 novembre 2015.\n[6] Peu de temps apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du membre B\u00e9langer, le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal a communiqu\u00e9 avec les parties pour les en aviser et pour discuter de la poursuite de l\u2019affaire. J\u2019ai ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au dossier et charg\u00e9 de le mener \u00e0 terme. Les parties ont alors pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations \u00e9crites afin de savoir si le Tribunal devait trancher l\u2019affaire dans le cadre d\u2019une nouvelle audience ou s\u2019il pouvait le faire en se fondant sur le dossier existant. \u00c0 la r\u00e9ception des observations, une s\u00e9rie de conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de gestion d\u2019instance (les CTGI) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues avec les parties afin d\u2019en discuter, d\u2019obtenir des pr\u00e9cisions et de d\u00e9terminer la fa\u00e7on de mener cette affaire \u00e0 terme.\n[7] Avant que le Tribunal ne rende sa d\u00e9cision, les parties ont convenu qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de tenir une nouvelle audition des t\u00e9moins et que l\u2019affaire devait se poursuivre sur la foi du dossier d\u2019instruction. Les parties ont \u00e9galement convenu que le dossier contiendrait toute la preuve orale pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience, toute la preuve (pi\u00e8ces) pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience ainsi que toutes les observations, orales et \u00e9crites, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 ce jour. Par ailleurs, mon examen de la preuve sera fond\u00e9 sur les transcriptions et les enregistrements audio de l\u2019audience.\n[8] Mme Karimi avait demand\u00e9 de t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 nouveau devant moi, mais cette demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e le 30 mai 2016. Les parties avaient convenu de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 mes questions ou de me fournir les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l\u2019examen de la preuve, notamment en rappelant un t\u00e9moin pour qu\u2019il r\u00e9ponde \u00e0 certaines questions. Elles avaient \u00e9galement convenu que, si un t\u00e9moin \u00e9tait rappel\u00e9, elles auraient l\u2019occasion de lui poser leurs propres questions en lien avec les miennes. Enfin, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les parties pourraient faire des d\u00e9clarations pr\u00e9liminaires \u2014 ce que l\u2019on a appel\u00e9 une \u00ab vue d\u2019ensemble \u00bb de l\u2019affaire \u2014 avant que j\u2019ouvre l\u2019audience et examine attentivement toute la preuve, y compris les enregistrements audio de l\u2019audience pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par le membre B\u00e9langer, et les observations \u00e9crites d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par les parties. Les parties ont donc donn\u00e9 cette vue d\u2019ensemble le 26 octobre 2016.\n[9] Malheureusement, les parties n\u2019ont pas pu pr\u00e9senter toutes leurs observations orales finales au membre B\u00e9langer avant son d\u00e9c\u00e8s. Le 9 novembre 2017, apr\u00e8s mon examen du dossier \u2014 y compris des enregistrements \u2014, les parties ont convenu qu\u2019aucune autre observation orale n\u2019\u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire. Elles ont conclu que les observations \u00e9crites qu\u2019elles avaient pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment d\u00e9pos\u00e9es \u00e9taient suffisantes.\nIII. Question pr\u00e9liminaire\n[10] En premier lieu, je dois examiner la lettre que Zayo a envoy\u00e9e au Tribunal le 8 avril 2015, dans laquelle elle s\u2019oppose aux observations \u00e9crites formul\u00e9es en r\u00e9plique par Mme Karimi le 31 mars 2015 au motif que la r\u00e9plique est une fa\u00e7on irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re d\u2019amener de nouveaux arguments et de se fonder sur des faits non d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve.\n[11] Apr\u00e8s avoir attentivement examin\u00e9 le dossier de l\u2019affaire, je souscris \u00e0 la description que fait Zayo de la r\u00e9plique de Mme Karimi. Par cons\u00e9quent, les nouveaux arguments invoqu\u00e9s par Mme Karimi ne seront pas pris en consid\u00e9ration puisqu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 introduits de mani\u00e8re irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re dans la r\u00e9plique. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, j\u2019estime que les nouveaux arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9plique ne sont pas pertinents quant au r\u00e8glement des plaintes. Les r\u00e9pliques fond\u00e9es sur des faits non \u00e9tay\u00e9s par des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9s au dossier, ces r\u00e9pliques ne seront pas pris en consid\u00e9ration non plus. Contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019affirme Mme Karimi dans sa lettre du 14 avril 2015, je ne suis pas convaincu qu\u2019il existe des circonstances exceptionnelles en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qui justifient l\u2019application de mesures correctives particuli\u00e8res, comme l\u2019indiquent les paragraphes 64 et 69 \u00e0 78 de l\u2019affaire Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada et al. c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), 2014 TCDP 2 (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien 2014). Dans l\u2019affaire Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien 2014, l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de plus de cinquante mille documents \u00e9tait en cause. Il semble que le Tribunal ait, dans cette affaire, envisag\u00e9 une mesure corrective principalement \u00e0 cause du grand volume de documents susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre pertinents. De plus, au moment o\u00f9 le Tribunal a pris la mesure corrective dans cette affaire, la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve se poursuivait. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la plaignante demande en quelque sorte au Tribunal de rouvrir la partie de la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve plus de six mois apr\u00e8s la cl\u00f4ture de l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Je remarque \u00e9galement que Mme Karimi semble avoir abandonn\u00e9 la position qu\u2019elle avait prise dans sa lettre du 14 avril 2015 puisqu\u2019elle a r\u00e9cemment convenu que l\u2019affaire devait \u00eatre jug\u00e9e sur la foi du dossier seulement (voir par. 7 ci-dessus). En outre, apr\u00e8s avoir lu les r\u00e9pliques contest\u00e9es, j\u2019estime que, m\u00eame si elles m\u2019avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 valablement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, elles n\u2019auraient eu aucune incidence sur ma d\u00e9cision au sujet des plaintes.\nIV. Les circonstances \u00e0 l\u2019origine des plaintes\nA. Attitude critique et surveillance de la part du gestionnaire\n[12] L\u2019entreprise maintenant connue sous le nom de Zayo offre des services de communication et des services Internet aux entreprises. Mme Karimi a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e en 2000 en tant que technicienne en communication de niveau 2 (CT) et a travaill\u00e9 au Service Internet, aussi appel\u00e9 le Centre d\u2019essais et de mise en service (CEMS) pendant l\u2019audience. De 2000 \u00e0 2006, ses \u00e9valuations de rendement indiquent qu\u2019elle avait r\u00e9pondu aux attentes. Zayo utilisait un syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9valuation selon lequel le rendement \u00e9tait faible, ad\u00e9quat ou \u00e9lev\u00e9 et Mme Karimi semble avoir eu un rendement \u00ab ad\u00e9quat \u00bb pendant cette p\u00e9riode.\n[13] En d\u00e9cembre 2005, M. Paul Picard est devenu le gestionnaire du Service Internet. En avril 2006, Mme Karimi \u00e9tait alors la seule femme qui travaillait au sein de cette \u00e9quipe. Mme Karimi pr\u00e9tend que c\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 que M. Picard a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 la prendre \u00e0 partie et \u00e0 critiquer son travail et sa ponctualit\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re injustifi\u00e9e.\nPlaintes des clients\n[14] Mme Karimi a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 trois dossiers clients \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels M. Picard lui a ensuite parl\u00e9 de son rendement. J\u2019ai utilis\u00e9 des acronymes au lieu de pr\u00e9ciser le nom des clients afin de prot\u00e9ger leur droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e en tant que tierces parties \u00e0 l\u2019instance. Les trois incidents se rapportaient \u00e0 des d\u00e9marches faites aupr\u00e8s de certains clients, soit FA en f\u00e9vrier 2006, DEL en mars 2006 et ABXL en mars et avril 2006. Mme Karimi pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 injustement critiqu\u00e9e pour avoir commis des erreurs ou pour avoir cr\u00e9\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes alors que ces erreurs et probl\u00e8mes \u00e9taient attribuables \u00e0 d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s ou aux clients eux-m\u00eames.\n[15] L\u2019affaire FA d\u00e9coule d\u2019une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le client concernant la configuration et l\u2019installation des services de r\u00e9seau faites en f\u00e9vrier 2006. Mme Karimi \u00e9tait l\u2019une des personnes ayant servi le client. Dans un courriel du client, il \u00e9tait sous-entendu que Mme Karimi n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u tous les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019installation dont elle avait besoin pour terminer le travail. Dans ce courriel de FA dat\u00e9 du 23 f\u00e9vrier 2006, \u00e0 23 h 36 (courriel \u00e9chang\u00e9 entre deux employ\u00e9s de FA et ensuite transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Zayo), il semble que Mme Karimi croyait avoir accompli le travail et en avoir avis\u00e9 le client, mais qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tonn\u00e9e d\u2019apprendre (du client) qu\u2019il restait encore beaucoup \u00e0 faire. Le client a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Karimi s\u2019est alors [traduction] \u00ab f\u00e2ch\u00e9e \u00bb contre lui. L\u2019installation a pris plusieurs heures, au lieu des 30 minutes initialement pr\u00e9vues par Mme Karimi. Le lendemain, un gestionnaire principal de Zayo a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Paul Picard pour lui demander de r\u00e9unir les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires afin de pouvoir faire un suivi aupr\u00e8s du client. En outre, le client n\u2019\u00e9tait pas satisfait des co\u00fbts d\u2019installation puisque, selon lui, les co\u00fbts auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 moins \u00e9lev\u00e9s si Zayo et ses employ\u00e9s avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 bien pr\u00e9par\u00e9s et inform\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019installation du service.\n[16] Le lendemain, par courriel, M. Picard a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Karimi de lui faire part de ses commentaires sur ce dossier puisque le client avait affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019installation aurait pu \u00eatre mieux g\u00e9r\u00e9e. Il ressort de la r\u00e9ponse de Mme Karimi qu\u2019elle croyait que l\u2019installation \u00e9tait r\u00e9ussie puisque le service n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 interrompu. M. Picard a aussi communiqu\u00e9 avec un coll\u00e8gue de Mme Karimi, qui avait aussi travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019installation du service. Dans un courriel envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Picard, ce coll\u00e8gue a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un travail tr\u00e8s complexe, qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas travaill\u00e9 directement avec le client et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019avait aucun commentaire \u00e0 formuler au sujet de l\u2019opinion qu\u2019avait le client \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du service offert. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait toujours possible de faire mieux et que l\u2019entreprise pouvait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des commentaires du client pour essayer d\u2019am\u00e9liorer la prestation des services.\n[17] M. Picard a r\u00e9pondu au gestionnaire principal pour lui laisser savoir qu\u2019il avait discut\u00e9 avec Mme Karimi et un autre coll\u00e8gue, qu\u2019il y avait eu des probl\u00e8mes avec l\u2019installation et que son groupe n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant de tous les changements requis. De plus, M. Picard a ajout\u00e9 que Mme Karimi pouvait am\u00e9liorer ses comp\u00e9tences en communication et que cette derni\u00e8re l\u2019avait elle-m\u00eame reconnu lors d\u2019une s\u00e9ance d\u2019encadrement. M. Picard a \u00e9galement r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu\u2019ils avaient re\u00e7u un autre courriel dans lequel le client remerciait Mme Karimi pour son aide et affirmait que tout fonctionnait. Le gestionnaire principal a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 M. Picard pour le remercier et a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne voulait pas punir ou accuser qui que ce soit, mais qu\u2019il souhaitait plut\u00f4t profiter de l\u2019occasion pour permettre \u00e0 tout le monde de s\u2019am\u00e9liorer.\n[18] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Picard a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il prenait les plaintes des clients tr\u00e8s au s\u00e9rieux lorsqu\u2019il travaillait l\u00e0 puisque l\u2019entreprise avait connu, et connaissait toujours, une p\u00e9riode difficile sur le plan financier et qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas se permettre de perdre des clients. Il ne se rappelait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ses rencontres avec Mme Karimi au sujet de cet incident, mais a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait rencontr\u00e9 Mme Karimi dans son bureau \u00e0 cloisons et qu\u2019il avait l\u2019habitude d\u2019envoyer ensuite un courriel pour confirmer ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait dit. M. Picard a indiqu\u00e9 que ses responsabilit\u00e9s consistaient notamment \u00e0 effectuer un suivi aupr\u00e8s des employ\u00e9s sur les plaintes des clients afin de r\u00e9gler les probl\u00e8mes de rendement, offrir de l\u2019encadrement, superviser et guider les employ\u00e9s et corriger leurs faiblesses. Enfin, aucune autre mesure n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par suite de l\u2019incident.\n[19] L\u2019affaire DEL est survenue en mars 2006 et concerne un client dont l\u2019installation du service risquait de ne pas pouvoir \u00eatre termin\u00e9e \u00e0 temps par Zayo. Mme Karimi a mentionn\u00e9 cette affaire pour prouver qu\u2019elle avait fait l\u2019objet de critiques injustifi\u00e9es puisqu\u2019elle avait fait tout ce qu\u2019elle pouvait dans ce dossier et qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas responsable des erreurs commises. Dans une s\u00e9rie de courriels \u00e9chang\u00e9s entre M. Picard et Mme Karimi, cette derni\u00e8re a fait remarquer qu\u2019il y aurait des cons\u00e9quences pour le client et pour Zayo si le service ne pouvait pas \u00eatre install\u00e9 le lendemain. Mme Karimi a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Picard de saisir un sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019affaire puisqu\u2019elle ne croyait pas \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 le faire. M. Picard a propos\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Karimi de transmettre le dossier \u00e0 qui de droit et lui a ensuite indiqu\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait la personne-ressource. L\u2019\u00e9change de courriels s\u2019est poursuivi. Dans l\u2019un de ces courriels, Mme Karimi affirmait qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas s\u2019en charger puisqu\u2019un dossier doit \u00eatre transmis d\u2019un gestionnaire \u00e0 un autre. M. Picard a ensuite demand\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre employ\u00e9 de s\u2019occuper du dossier. Le 29 mars 2006, apr\u00e8s que M. Picard eut demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Karimi de fournir les d\u00e9tails reli\u00e9s \u00e0 cette affaire \u00e0 son coll\u00e8gue, Mme Karimi a \u00e9crit que les [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] sup\u00e9rieurs d[evaient] exercer des pressions pour obtenir les services d\u2019un technicien \u00bb.\n[20] Ensuite, lors d\u2019une discussion avec Mme Karimi, M. Picard a donn\u00e9 ce dossier en exemple pour \u00e9tablir que cette derni\u00e8re devait am\u00e9liorer son rendement. Le 12 avril 2006, M. Picard a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Karimi pour faire suite aux discussions qu\u2019ils avaient eues concernant les am\u00e9liorations qu\u2019elle devait apporter \u00e0 son rendement. DEL et un autre client (ABXL, dont il est question plus loin) \u00e9taient nomm\u00e9s dans le courriel. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, M. Picard a inscrit que le rendement de Mme Karimi \u00e9tait inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la norme, qu\u2019elle devait assumer la responsabilit\u00e9 de ses commandes et communiquer de fa\u00e7on proactive avec les clients et l\u2019\u00e9quipe des ventes et qu\u2019elle devait s\u2019efforcer de s\u2019am\u00e9liorer.\n[21] L\u2019incident avec ABXL est survenu en mars et en avril 2006 et concernait une demande de service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re incorrecte par un autre employ\u00e9 de Zayo au moment de la saisie de la commande. Il semble que cet autre employ\u00e9 avait entr\u00e9 le mauvais code ou mal trait\u00e9 le dossier d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part, et ne l\u2019avait pas transmis de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e au CEMS. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019installation n\u2019allait pas avoir lieu le jour o\u00f9 le client l\u2019avait demand\u00e9e et en avait besoin. Mme Karimi avait re\u00e7u le dossier le 22 mars 2006.\n[22] Mme Karimi a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas responsable des erreurs commises dans ce dossier et que la direction avait commis une erreur en n\u2019accordant pas plus d\u2019attention aux exigences de la commande. M. Picard a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le fait que le client avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Karimi le 30 mars 2006 et que, par cons\u00e9quent, cette derni\u00e8re aurait d\u00fb mieux s\u2019acquitter de sa t\u00e2che qui consistait \u00e0 garder le client inform\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tat de la demande de service.\n[23] Aucun autre t\u00e9moin ne s\u2019est exprim\u00e9 sur la question de savoir si ou comment M. Picard l\u2019a trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment de Mme Karimi, pour ce qui concerne des erreurs ou des probl\u00e8mes survenus dans une installation ou un dossier.\nCourriels relatifs \u00e0 la ponctualit\u00e9\n[24] Mme Karimi pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 prise \u00e0 partie et souvent critiqu\u00e9e devant d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s en raison de son manque de ponctualit\u00e9. Selon elle, les autres employ\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas eu \u00e0 faire face \u00e0 ce genre de critiques. Au vu de la preuve, M. Picard a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Karimi \u00e0 deux reprises \u2013 le 20 avril 2006 et le 24 avril 2006, apr\u00e8s 8 h, le d\u00e9but de sa journ\u00e9e de travail \u2013 pour lui signaler qu\u2019elle devait appeler en cas de retard. M. Picard a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait l\u2019habitude d\u2019envoyer un courriel apr\u00e8s avoir discut\u00e9 avec un employ\u00e9 de son rendement. Dans le courriel du 24 avril 2006, M. Picard faisait le point sur la conversation qu\u2019il avait eue avec Mme Karimi ce jour-l\u00e0 et il lui a \u00e9crit que s\u2019il lui \u00e9tait impossible d\u2019arriver \u00e0 8 h, ils pouvaient en discuter et essayer de modifier son horaire de travail au besoin. M. Picard a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Karimi \u00e9tait la seule employ\u00e9e cens\u00e9e travailler entre 8 h et 9 h.\n[25] Mme Karimi a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 M. Picard par courriel que la conversation du 24 avril 2006 n\u2019avait pas eu lieu en priv\u00e9, qu\u2019elle se sentait prise \u00e0 partie en raison de ses retards et que cela avait une incidence sur sa sant\u00e9. M. Picard lui a r\u00e9pondu le m\u00eame jour, pr\u00e9cisant que leurs discussions avaient eu lieu en priv\u00e9. M. Picard a affirm\u00e9 que les autres n\u2019avaient pas pu entendre les discussions tenues dans son bureau \u00e0 cloisons, m\u00eame si le volume de la conversation \u00e9tait plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019habitude, parce que les cloisons de son bureau \u00e9taient plus \u00e9lev\u00e9es que les autres, que son bureau \u00e9tait entour\u00e9 de bureaux vides et que le Service Internet \u00e9tait \u00e9loign\u00e9 des autres.\nAutre critique injustifi\u00e9e all\u00e9gu\u00e9e\n[26] Le 12 avril 2006, M. Picard a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 Mme Karimi dans lequel il d\u00e9crivait tr\u00e8s bri\u00e8vement un certain nombre de probl\u00e8mes relatifs au rendement, y compris au fait que Mme Karimi avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vue endormie \u00e0 son bureau, ce qui \u00e9tait inacceptable. M. Picard a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait trouv\u00e9 Mme Karimi, les bras crois\u00e9s et la t\u00eate baiss\u00e9e, et qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait r\u00e9veill\u00e9e en sursaut. Mme Karimi a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne dormait pas, mais qu\u2019elle ne se sentait pas bien. Elle reposait donc sa t\u00eate sur ses bras crois\u00e9s. Ni M. Picard ni la direction n\u2019ont pris d\u2019autres mesures par suite de cet incident.\n[27] Au cours d\u2019une rencontre survenue le 25 avril 2006, Mme Karimi s\u2019est plainte \u00e0 M. Picard du traitement qu\u2019il lui r\u00e9servait. Selon elle, M. Picard lui aurait dit qu\u2019il serait inutile d\u2019aller discuter de ses probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail avec le syndicat. Mme Karimi a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief aupr\u00e8s de son syndicat. M. Picard a ni\u00e9 avoir sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Karimi de ne pas s\u2019adresser au syndicat. Le grief a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 et le syndicat n\u2019y a pas donn\u00e9 suite.\n[28] Dans un courriel dat\u00e9 du 26 avril 2006, dont l\u2019objet \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab Comportement nuisible \u00bb, M. Picard a indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Karimi que la veille, elle avait cri\u00e9 apr\u00e8s lui pour la deuxi\u00e8me fois pendant une discussion, qu\u2019il y avait des politiques relatives au respect mutuel et que les cris n\u2019\u00e9taient pas acceptables. M. Picard a \u00e9crit que les [traduction] \u00ab cris \u00bb d\u00e9rangeaient l\u2019\u00e9quipe, que ce type de comportement avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une discussion, que Mme Karimi devait s\u2019efforcer de contr\u00f4ler sa col\u00e8re et que, si elle souhaitait discuter calmement, une rencontre pouvait \u00eatre organis\u00e9e.\n[29] Un seul t\u00e9moin se rappelait avoir entendu Mme Karimi et M. Picard crier. M. Muktar \u00e9tait un coll\u00e8gue de Mme Karimi. Il travaillait pour le Service de donn\u00e9es alors que Mme Karimi travaillait pour le Service Internet. Les deux groupes relevaient de M. Picard. Le bureau de M. Muktar \u00e9tait celui qui \u00e9tait le plus proche du bureau de M. Picard. M. Muktar a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il se souvenait d\u2019une fois o\u00f9 Mme Karimi \u00e9tait all\u00e9e dans le bureau de M. Picard et qu\u2019il avait entendu ce dernier crier. En contre\u2011interrogatoire, il a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Karimi criait probablement aussi, mais qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas savoir quel \u00e9tait le sujet de la conversation.\n[30] \u00c0 l\u2019exception de M. Muktar, personne n\u2019a affirm\u00e9 avoir entendu des cris ou avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin de discussions excessivement bruyantes entre Mme Karimi et M. Picard.\n[31] Selon Mme Karimi, ses rapports avec M. Picard lui ont fait vivre un grand stress et de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et, par cons\u00e9quent, elle a d\u00fb prendre un cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e de dix jours \u00e0 compter du 27 avril 2006. Elle est retourn\u00e9e au travail le 8 mai 2006.\nB. Attribution d\u2019un imposant volume de t\u00e2ches, dont des t\u00e2ches qui d\u00e9passaient les limites physiques li\u00e9es \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Karimi\n[32] Mme Karimi pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019\u00e0 son retour le 8 mai 2006, M. Picard lui a attribu\u00e9 un imposant volume de travail. La preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9tait un courriel que M. Picard avait envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s du Service Internet (y compris \u00e0 Mme Karimi), dans lequel il demandait aux autres membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipe de remettre \u00e0 Mme Karimi les dossiers dont elle \u00e9tait responsable, et de lui en indiquer l\u2019\u00e9tat. Il les remerciait ensuite de s\u2019\u00eatre occup\u00e9s de ces commandes en plus de leur charge de travail habituelle. Il les remerciait \u00e9galement pour leur travail d\u2019\u00e9quipe et leur service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le.\n[33] Mme Karimi a affirm\u00e9 que ce m\u00eame apr\u00e8s-midi, M. Picard lui a aussi demand\u00e9 de faire l\u2019inventaire des routeurs, ce qui n\u00e9cessitait le levage de charges lourdes. Elle ne pouvait pas s\u2019acquitter de cette t\u00e2che en raison de ses d\u00e9ficiences physiques, car elle avait une restriction m\u00e9dicale qui limitait ses aptitudes. Cette t\u00e2che consistait \u00e0 aider Peter Allaert, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 le gestionnaire de Mme Karimi de 2002 \u00e0 2005 et qui, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, \u00e9tait le gestionnaire principal du Service de fourniture d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Internet. M. Picard lui a dit que la t\u00e2che lui revenait puisqu\u2019elle occupait le poste du matin, ce \u00e0 quoi elle a r\u00e9pondu par courriel qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas s\u2019acquitter de cette t\u00e2che en raison de ses probl\u00e8mes de dos et de poignets. Elle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que si cette t\u00e2che ne n\u00e9cessitait pas qu\u2019elle soul\u00e8ve de lourds objets, elle se ferait un plaisir d\u2019aider.\n[34] M. Picard ne savait pas que Mme Karimi avait des restrictions m\u00e9dicales. Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u le courriel de Mme Karimi, M. Picard a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Allaert pour lui demander si un certificat m\u00e9dical avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 au dossier et pour savoir quelles \u00e9taient les exigences li\u00e9es au levage de charges pour cette t\u00e2che. Le lendemain matin, le 9 mai 2006, M. Picard a aussi \u00e9crit au gestionnaire principal des Ressources humaines (RH) pour lui demander si un certificat m\u00e9dical avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 au dossier relativement aux probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 de Mme Karimi. Plus tard ce jour\u2011l\u00e0, avant de recevoir l\u2019attestation m\u00e9dicale des RH, M. Picard a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Karimi pour lui donner plus de d\u00e9tails sur les types de routeurs dont devait s\u2019occuper la personne qui travaillait pendant le quart du matin. Ces d\u00e9tails avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis par M. Allaert. Ce dernier avait \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00e9quipement \u00e9tait identique \u00e0 celui que Mme Karimi \u00e9tait alors appel\u00e9e \u00e0 manipuler, et avait envoy\u00e9 un manuel qui \u00e9nonce les caract\u00e9ristiques de chaque type de routeur, y compris la taille et le poids.\n[35] Le 10 mai 2006, M. Picard a re\u00e7u la confirmation des RH qu\u2019un certificat m\u00e9dical figurait au dossier de Mme Karimi, selon lequel elle avait certaines restrictions. MM. Picard et Allaert ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les routeurs en question \u00e9taient identiques \u00e0 ceux que Mme Karimi fournissait et manipulait depuis 2000. M. Allaert a reconnu que c\u2019est lui qui avait demand\u00e9 de l\u2019aide et que c\u2019est M. Picard qui avait d\u00e9sign\u00e9 l\u2019employ\u00e9e. Mme Karimi a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019en d\u00e9pit du fait que M. Picard avait confirm\u00e9 que son dossier contenait un certificat m\u00e9dical attestant ses capacit\u00e9s physiques restreintes, il lui a tout de m\u00eame redemand\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 l\u2019inventaire des routeurs. Mme Karimi a ajout\u00e9 que cette t\u00e2che \u00e9tait habituellement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e par un autre service.\n[36] M. Picard a affirm\u00e9 que le quart de travail commen\u00e7ant \u00e0 8 h \u00e9tait une p\u00e9riode moins occup\u00e9e au centre d\u2019appels et qu\u2019il voulait maintenir la productivit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s. Il avait choisi Mme Karimi pour participer \u00e0 l\u2019inventaire des routeurs parce que sa journ\u00e9e de travail commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 8 h. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une t\u00e2che particuli\u00e8re au quart de travail, et non \u00e0 la personne. Si une autre personne avait occup\u00e9 ce quart de travail, elle se serait vu attribuer cette t\u00e2che.\n[37] Une semaine apr\u00e8s, le 16 mai 2006, Mme Karimi et M. Allaert parlaient toujours de la t\u00e2che \u00e0 effectuer. Ce dernier a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019assurerait qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait pas \u00e0 soulever d\u2019objets lourds et que les routeurs seraient apport\u00e9s \u00e0 son bureau et retir\u00e9s de son bureau. Au final, Mme Karimi a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019en raison de sa propre charge de travail, elle ne pouvait pas apporter son aide. Les t\u00e9moignages de Mme Karimi et de M. Picard ont permis de confirmer que cette derni\u00e8re ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e de la t\u00e2che en fin de compte.\n[38] Le prochain incident \u00e0 l\u2019origine de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination est survenu pr\u00e8s d\u2019un an plus tard.\nC. R\u00e9affectation et refus de possibilit\u00e9s de formation\n[39] Le 23 avril 2007, Mme Karimi a \u00e9t\u00e9 temporairement r\u00e9affect\u00e9e, du Service Internet au Service de la conception. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, elle \u00e9tait la seule employ\u00e9e de sexe f\u00e9minin dans le Service Internet. Zayo pr\u00e9tend que le gestionnaire du Service de la conception, Tim Richardson, a demand\u00e9 qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 poss\u00e9dant une exp\u00e9rience Internet soit transf\u00e9r\u00e9 dans son service afin d\u2019offrir une formation par rotation des postes. Des courriels d\u2019Anna Di Nuccio, la directrice de M. Richardson, montrent que certaines responsabilit\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00e9quipe Internet avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quipe de conception de circuit un an auparavant. Au bureau de Calgary, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de former quelqu\u2019un pour faire le travail. Maintenant, l\u2019objectif consistait \u00e0 harmoniser les op\u00e9rations du bureau de Toronto avec celles du bureau de Calgary et, de l\u2019avis g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, il serait plus facile de faire venir quelqu\u2019un ayant les connaissances et les comp\u00e9tences n\u00e9cessaires au lieu de former un tout nouvel employ\u00e9. En outre, cela semblait \u00eatre une possibilit\u00e9 de perfectionnement int\u00e9ressante et Mme Karimi semblait \u00eatre une bonne candidate pour ce poste. Tim Richardson, Peter Allaert, Paul Picard et Anna Di Nuccio ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des raisons qui sous-tendent l\u2019affectation, c.-\u00e0-d. harmoniser les op\u00e9rations de Toronto et de Calgary, faire appel aux comp\u00e9tences des membres du Service Internet, \u00e9largir la port\u00e9e des travaux et accro\u00eetre l\u2019expertise des membres du Service de la conception et offrir aux employ\u00e9s une formation par rotation de postes. Comme Mme Karimi avait exprim\u00e9 le d\u00e9sir de perfectionner ses comp\u00e9tences, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de lui offrir la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre temporairement r\u00e9affect\u00e9e au Service de la conception. Selon Zayo, Mme Karimi n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenue d\u2019accepter la r\u00e9affectation temporaire, mais cette derni\u00e8re a volontairement accept\u00e9 l\u2019offre, avec son syndicat.\n[40] Mme Karimi a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 ses repr\u00e9sentants syndicaux pour leur faire part de certaines pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9affectation, mais elle leur a demand\u00e9 de ne pas transmettre l\u2019information \u00e0 la direction puisqu\u2019elle ne voulait pas donner l\u2019impression qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9e d\u2019accepter le poste. Elle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019elle accepterait l\u2019offre. Un repr\u00e9sentant syndical a fait savoir \u00e0 la direction de fa\u00e7on non officielle que Mme Karimi ne souhaitait pas accro\u00eetre ses comp\u00e9tences, mais le syndicat et Mme Karimi n\u2019ont pris aucune autre mesure pour discuter avec la direction de Zayo. Par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Karimi n\u2019a jamais inform\u00e9 la direction qu\u2019elle ne voulait pas \u00eatre temporairement r\u00e9affect\u00e9e.\n[41] Selon Mme Karimi, il est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans sa convention collective que les r\u00e9affectations sont fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019anciennet\u00e9. Pourtant, c\u2019est elle que M. Picard a choisie m\u00eame si elle avait plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 que certains de ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin du Service Internet. Selon le t\u00e9moignage du d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical Dylan Gadwa et la preuve documentaire des repr\u00e9sentants syndicaux Camilla Leblanc et Ken Burton, la convention collective ne pr\u00e9voyait aucun crit\u00e8re d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 en ce qui concerne les affectations temporaires. La preuve documentaire \u00e9tait compos\u00e9e de courriels \u00e9chang\u00e9s entre Mme Karimi et ses repr\u00e9sentants syndicaux, dans lesquels ils interpr\u00e9taient les dispositions applicables de la convention collective. M. Gadwa \u00e9tait \u00e9galement un coll\u00e8gue de Mme Karimi, nomm\u00e9 au sein de la m\u00eame classification professionnelle et au sein du m\u00eame groupe de travail.\n[42] Mme Karimi se pr\u00e9occupait de ses droits et de son niveau d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, en cas de mises \u00e0 pied dans le Service de la conception. Elle a sollicit\u00e9 l\u2019aide de son syndicat pour confirmer ses droits. Zayo pr\u00e9tend que les RH ont clairement dit \u00e0 Mme Karimi que la r\u00e9affectation \u00e9tait temporaire et qu\u2019elle faisait toujours partie du Service Internet. Zayo a \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9 que s\u2019il y avait une restructuration, comme des mises \u00e0 pied dans le Service de la conception, Mme Karimi retournerait \u00e0 son poste et \u00e0 son service d\u2019attache. Mme Karimi s\u2019inqui\u00e9tait aussi du fait qu\u2019elle aurait moins d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 dans le Service de la conception puisqu\u2019elle venait de se joindre au groupe.\n[43] Selon Mme Karimi, M. Picard lui a dit que, lors de sa r\u00e9affectation, ses comp\u00e9tences seraient mises en application et qu\u2019elle aurait acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des possibilit\u00e9s de formation et de d\u00e9veloppement. Cependant, elle pr\u00e9tend s\u2019\u00eatre vu attribuer des t\u00e2ches ne n\u00e9cessitant aucune comp\u00e9tence pr\u00e9cise et refuser des possibilit\u00e9s de formation qui \u00e9taient offertes \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle soutient que ses coll\u00e8gues du Service Internet avaient re\u00e7u une formation suppl\u00e9mentaire, qu\u2019elle a manqu\u00e9 parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait alors dans le Service de la conception. De plus, elle estime ne pas avoir eu une formation \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 celle suivie par ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin du Service de la conception.\n[44] Zayo soutient que la raison pour laquelle Mme Karimi n\u2019a pas b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019une formation officielle ou de cours de formation \u00e9tait qu\u2019elle devait, lors de son affectation temporaire, transmettre ses connaissances en mati\u00e8re d\u2019Internet aux employ\u00e9s du Service de la conception. Cependant, elle a re\u00e7u une formation informelle sous la forme d\u2019observation au poste de travail. Zayo soutient \u00e9galement que Mme Karimi souhaitait effectuer un travail de conception plus complexe, mais qu\u2019avant d\u2019apprendre \u00e0 effectuer des t\u00e2ches plus complexes, elle devait d\u2019abord ma\u00eetriser les t\u00e2ches moins complexes.\n[45] Tim Richardson a affirm\u00e9 que la principale m\u00e9thode de formation utilis\u00e9e au sein du Service de la conception \u00e9tait l\u2019observation au poste de travail ou la formation c\u00f4te \u00e0 c\u00f4te. Aucun programme de formation officiel ni aucune s\u00e9rie de cours ne devait \u00eatre suivi pour travailler dans le Service de la conception. Il arrivait \u00e0 l\u2019occasion qu\u2019un cours soit offert lorsqu\u2019une nouvelle technologie ou un nouveau produit faisait son apparition. M. Richardson a ajout\u00e9 que tous les autres employ\u00e9s du Service de la conception auraient re\u00e7u la m\u00eame formation, soit la formation c\u00f4te \u00e0 c\u00f4te. Mme Karimi a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas satisfaite de ce genre de formation et qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait suivre des cours donn\u00e9s par un instructeur ou des cours sanctionn\u00e9s par un certificat. Elle avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 apprendre en passant du temps avec des coll\u00e8gues. Cela \u00e9tant dit, les parties n\u2019ont pu fournir aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve quant \u00e0 une formation qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte aux autres employ\u00e9s du Service de la conception, soit avant l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de Mme Karimi ou pendant son affectation, et qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re. Une preuve non contredite a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience pour d\u00e9montrer que Mme Karimi avait re\u00e7u la m\u00eame formation que tout autre employ\u00e9 du service, qu\u2019il fasse d\u00e9j\u00e0 partie de l\u2019\u00e9quipe ou non.\nD. R\u00e9trogradation\/r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrage\n[46] Mme Karimi soutient avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9trograd\u00e9e \u00e0 un poste de technicienne en communication de niveau 1 le 28 novembre 2007. Zayo a d\u00e9crit cela comme un r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrage des effectifs. Mme Karimi pr\u00e9tend que, selon l\u2019ordre d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, des coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin ayant moins d\u2019exp\u00e9rience auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre r\u00e9trograd\u00e9s avant elle.\n[47] Selon Zayo, les changements apport\u00e9s \u00e9taient une forme de \u00ab r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrage \u00bb, lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 en vertu de la convention collective. Ce r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrage avait \u00e9t\u00e9 annonc\u00e9 au Service Internet dans un courriel dat\u00e9 du 14 novembre 2007. Dans le cadre du r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrage, deux employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s du Service Internet au Service de la gestion des commandes parce que ce service avait besoin de plus de ressources. Conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la convention collective, en l\u2019absence de volontaires, les employ\u00e9s d\u00e9butants (ceux ayant le moins d\u2019anciennet\u00e9) du service vis\u00e9 \u00e9taient transf\u00e9r\u00e9s dans un autre service. Mme Karimi et un coll\u00e8gue de sexe masculin ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s puisqu\u2019ils \u00e9taient les deux employ\u00e9s ayant le moins d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 dans le Service Internet. Comme leurs nouvelles t\u00e2ches \u00e9taient d\u2019une classification diff\u00e9rente, ils sont pass\u00e9s de CT2 \u00e0 CT1. Cependant, ils ont b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019une protection salariale, de sorte que Mme Karimi \u00e9tait toujours r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de CT2.\n[48] Mme Karimi a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief en ce qui concerne le r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrage, mais le syndicat l\u2019a retir\u00e9 apr\u00e8s en avoir discut\u00e9 avec Zayo lors d\u2019une rencontre s\u2019inscrivant dans la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement des griefs. Le syndicat \u00e9tait convaincu que le r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrage avait \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la convention collective.\n[49] Dans sa plainte, Mme Karimi a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle devait figurer plus haut sur la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elle n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9e, mais dans son t\u00e9moignage, elle a reconnu qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait un des deux employ\u00e9s ayant le moins d\u2019anciennet\u00e9. M. Gadwa, qui \u00e9tait son repr\u00e9sentant syndical \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait l\u2019un des deux employ\u00e9s ayant le moins d\u2019anciennet\u00e9.\n[50] M. Picard a affirm\u00e9 n\u2019avoir jou\u00e9 aucun r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer qui devait \u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9 puisque l\u2019exercice \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019anciennet\u00e9. Il n\u2019a pas non plus particip\u00e9 au processus d\u00e9cisionnel relatif au r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrage puisque la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise \u00e0 un \u00e9chelon sup\u00e9rieur de la direction de Zayo.\n[51] Jennifer Bazinet, gestionnaire du Service de prestation des services \u2014 Donn\u00e9es et Internet, a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait eu un r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrage parce que le Service de gestion des commandes allait assumer un plus grand nombre de fonctions, dont certaines avaient jusqu\u2019alors \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par le CEMS. Le Service de gestion des commandes relevait de sa responsabilit\u00e9. Dans le cadre du r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrage, certaines des t\u00e2ches accomplies par le CEMS \u00e0 l\u2019ach\u00e8vement d\u2019une commande devaient alors \u00eatre effectu\u00e9es par le Service de gestion des commandes. Les t\u00e2ches en question \u00e9taient semblables \u00e0 celles d\u00e9j\u00e0 remplies par les gestionnaires de commandes et Zayo estimait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait plus appropri\u00e9 que ces t\u00e2ches soient toutes accomplies par le Service de la gestion des commandes. Le transfert des t\u00e2ches, du CEMS au Service de gestion des commandes, n\u00e9cessitait la restructuration de ces groupes afin d\u2019\u00e9quilibrer les ressources.\n[52] Apr\u00e8s le r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrage, Mme Bazinet est devenue la gestionnaire imm\u00e9diate de Mme Karimi dans le Service de gestion des commandes. Mme Bazinet a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Karimi pouvait se montrer r\u00e9ticente et se contredisait parfois lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait question de la formation. \u00c0 certains moments, Mme Karimi pr\u00e9tendait avoir besoin de formation et \u00e0 d\u2019autres, elle affirmait savoir ce qu\u2019elle faisait et ne pas avoir besoin de formation puisqu\u2019elle avait travaill\u00e9 au CEMS alors que le Service de gestion des commandes n\u2019existait pas encore et que le CEMS avait ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 des fonctions semblables. Cependant, Mme Bazinet a ajout\u00e9 que le travail effectu\u00e9 par le Service de gestion des commandes \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rent, que des syst\u00e8mes diff\u00e9rents \u00e9taient utilis\u00e9s, que des m\u00e9thodes diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9taient appliqu\u00e9es et que des groupes diff\u00e9rents \u00e9taient en place.\n[53] La formation offerte \u00e9tait l\u2019observation au poste de travail ou la formation c\u00f4te \u00e0 c\u00f4te, o\u00f9 un gestionnaire de commandes d\u2019exp\u00e9rience est jumel\u00e9 avec un gestionnaire moins exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 pour effectuer des commandes de base. Ensuite, on augmentait graduellement le nombre de commandes et la complexit\u00e9 des commandes attribu\u00e9es au nouveau gestionnaire de commandes. Voil\u00e0 la formation dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient tous les nouveaux gestionnaires de commandes. L\u2019autre employ\u00e9 qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps que Mme Karimi a re\u00e7u cette m\u00eame formation. Mme Bazinet a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu un employ\u00e9 du CEMS qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 et qui avait pris pr\u00e8s d\u2019un an \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser son travail. Mme Karimi progressait lentement comparativement aux autres, selon Mme Bazinet.\n[54] Mme Bazinet a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 divers moments, plusieurs mois apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e, Mme Karimi avait demand\u00e9 que plusieurs commandes soient r\u00e9attribu\u00e9es puisqu\u2019elle ne ma\u00eetrisait pas les technologies pr\u00e9cises utilis\u00e9es. Mme Bazinet estimait \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 que Mme Karimi avait accus\u00e9 un retard dans son apprentissage puisqu\u2019elle travaillait toujours sur les commandes de base. De plus, le volume de commandes attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Karimi \u00e9tait minime, comparativement \u00e0 ce que Mme Bazinet estimait \u00eatre un volume normal. Enfin, Mme Bazinet a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Karimi avait commis des erreurs \u2014 qualifi\u00e9es d\u2019erreurs de base li\u00e9es \u00e0 la connaissance du travail \u2014 dans le traitement de certains dossiers pendant cette p\u00e9riode. Mme Bazinet estimait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9courageant de voir Mme Karimi commettre de telles erreurs deux mois apr\u00e8s son transfert.\n[55] Mme Bazinet a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Karimi a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors d\u2019une conversation que le travail \u00e9tait en de\u00e7\u00e0 de son niveau de comp\u00e9tence. Mme Bazinet a essay\u00e9 de faire comprendre \u00e0 Mme Karimi que la d\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 son transfert n\u2019\u00e9tait pas personnelle, mais qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une d\u00e9cision op\u00e9rationnelle.\nE. Absence de mesures d\u2019accommodement et repr\u00e9sailles\n[56] Suivant sa r\u00e9trogradation et son transfert, Mme Karimi a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 ressentir des sympt\u00f4mes de d\u00e9pression. En avril 2008, ou vers cette date, elle est partie en cong\u00e9 de maladie et, apr\u00e8s \u00eatre bri\u00e8vement retourn\u00e9e au travail pendant une semaine, elle est repartie en cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e vers le 8 juillet 2008.\n[57] Au d\u00e9but d\u2019octobre 2008, Mme Karimi a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Zayo trois certificats m\u00e9dicaux distincts, lesquels peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\nun certificat dat\u00e9 de juillet 2008 selon lequel les t\u00e2ches effectu\u00e9es par Mme Karimi devaient \u00eatre modifi\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on permanente;\nun certificat dat\u00e9 du 2 septembre 2008 selon lequel Mme Karimi ne pouvait pas, dans un avenir pr\u00e9visible, travailler \u00e0 son lieu de travail habituel;\nun certificat du Dr Aaron Malkin dat\u00e9 du 2 octobre 2008 selon lequel Mme Karimi pouvait retourner au travail de fa\u00e7on graduelle \u00e0 la fin du mois. Selon ce certificat, il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire que Mme Karimi puisse travailler de la maison afin de retourner travailler.\nZayo s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur le certificat le plus r\u00e9cent pour \u00e9valuer les mesures d\u2019accommodement possibles et a conclu finalement qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas permettre \u00e0 Mme Karimi de travailler de la maison. Elle a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e pendant environ 8 mois, jusqu\u2019en mars 2009.\n[58] Zayo a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas accepter la demande de t\u00e9l\u00e9travail de Mme Karimi en raison des exigences op\u00e9rationnelles. Zayo a indiqu\u00e9 que Mme Karimi avait seulement re\u00e7u trois mois de formation dans le cadre de ses nouvelles fonctions avant de partir en cong\u00e9 de maladie, ce qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisant pour lui permettre de travailler de fa\u00e7on ind\u00e9pendante. De plus, elle progressait tr\u00e8s lentement.\n[59] M. Van Horne, qui avait occup\u00e9 divers postes de RH au sein de Zayo, y compris un poste de conseiller en RH et un poste de gestionnaire principal des relations de travail, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au nom de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. M. Van Horne a affirm\u00e9 que la demande de mesures d\u2019accommodement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Karimi ne pouvait pas \u00eatre accept\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux crit\u00e8res de la politique sur le t\u00e9l\u00e9travail. Cependant, il a reconnu que la politique sur les mesures d\u2019accommodement en milieu de travail de l\u2019entreprise permettait le t\u00e9l\u00e9travail. Les deux politiques \u00e9taient distinctes et ind\u00e9pendantes l\u2019une de l\u2019autre.\n[60] Mme Bazinet et M. Van Horne ont discut\u00e9 de la demande de mesures d\u2019accommodement avant de parler \u00e0 Mme Karimi. Mme Bazinet a confirm\u00e9 que Mme Karimi ne r\u00e9pondait pas \u00e0 quelques-uns des principaux crit\u00e8res de la politique sur le t\u00e9l\u00e9travail, comme (i) le fait que l\u2019employ\u00e9 doive \u00eatre motiv\u00e9; (ii) le fait que l\u2019employ\u00e9 n\u2019ait pas besoin d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9troitement supervis\u00e9; (iii) le fait que l\u2019employ\u00e9 soit \u00e0 l\u2019aise de travailler de fa\u00e7on isol\u00e9e, et; (iv) le fait que le rendement pass\u00e9 et actuel de l\u2019employ\u00e9 r\u00e9ponde aux attentes ou les d\u00e9passe. Mme Bazinet a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nMme Karimi n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de travailler de fa\u00e7on ind\u00e9pendante sans \u00eatre \u00e9troitement supervis\u00e9e;\nMme Karimi n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u une formation compl\u00e8te;\nla formation n\u2019\u00e9tait pas donn\u00e9e en salle de classe puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une formation en cours d\u2019emploi, de sorte que Mme Karimi devait se pr\u00e9senter au bureau;\nla formation n\u00e9cessitait habituellement 6 mois ou plus;\nMme Karimi avait eu des probl\u00e8mes de rendement au cours des 3 premiers mois et avait besoin du soutien imm\u00e9diat de ses pairs pour l\u2019aider pendant qu\u2019elle apprenait \u00e0 effectuer le travail et \u00e0 g\u00e9rer les probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s aux commandes susceptibles de survenir.\n[61] Aux termes de la politique sur les mesures d\u2019accommodement en milieu de travail, des crit\u00e8res semblables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en consid\u00e9ration pour arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que Mme Karimi ne pouvait pas b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de mesures d\u2019accommodement lui permettant de travailler de la maison.\n[62] Pour ces raisons, Zayo a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que Mme Karimi ne pouvait pas travailler de la maison.\n[63] De plus, Mme Bazinet a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Karimi n\u2019avait pas connu un bon rendement au cours des 3 mois pendant lesquels elle avait travaill\u00e9 au sein du Service de gestion de commandes. Elle devait apprendre \u00e0 utiliser de nouveaux syst\u00e8mes et de nouveaux processus et, m\u00eame s\u2019ils pr\u00e9sentaient certaines similitudes avec ceux utilis\u00e9s dans son ancien service, ils pr\u00e9sentaient aussi de nombreuses diff\u00e9rences. Zayo affirme aussi qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas permettre \u00e0 Mme Karimi de retourner progressivement \u00e0 son poste r\u00e9gulier parce qu\u2019au sein du Service de gestion de commandes, les d\u00e9lais \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s serr\u00e9s et il y avait un grand risque d\u2019erreurs tr\u00e8s co\u00fbteuses. Chaque commande \u00e9tait trait\u00e9e par un employ\u00e9, qui \u00e9tait alors la seule personne-ressource du client et qui devait \u00eatre disponible pour corriger les erreurs commises. Les gestionnaires de commandes devaient g\u00e9rer le dossier du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019\u00e9quipe de gestion des commandes ne pouvait pas avoir une employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps partiel.\n[64] Le 30 mars 2009, ou vers cette date, Mme Karimi avait \u00e9puis\u00e9 ses prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e. Elle a donc pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e. Le 30 mars 2009, Mme Karimi est retourn\u00e9e travailler pour Zayo conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 un plan de travail individuel\/plan de retour au travail \u00e9labor\u00e9 par Great-West Life, lequel devait faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une discussion avec Zayo et d\u2019une approbation de cette derni\u00e8re. Mme Bazinet n\u2019avait pas pr\u00e9vu le retour au travail de Mme Karimi puisqu\u2019elle n\u2019en avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e par Great-West Life. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019au courant de ce m\u00eame apr\u00e8s-midi que Mme Bazinet et un repr\u00e9sentant de Great-West Life ont pu avoir une conversation pendant laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 que Mme Karimi devait retourner au travail. Mme Bazinet a affirm\u00e9 ne pas avoir vu le plan de travail individuel ce jour-l\u00e0. Mme Bazinet, qui \u00e9tait toujours la gestionnaire de Mme Karimi, a offert \u00e0 celle-ci un travail \u00e0 court terme qui consistait \u00e0 nettoyer la base de donn\u00e9es informatique, trois jours par semaine, ce qui concordait avec les capacit\u00e9s restreintes de Mme Karimi.\n[65] Selon Zayo, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une affectation temporaire visant \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre, \u00e0 court terme, aux besoins de Mme Karimi, et non d\u2019une affectation permanente. Zayo pr\u00e9tend que Mme Karimi a accept\u00e9 cette mesure d\u2019accommodement et qu\u2019elle a effectu\u00e9 le travail sans difficult\u00e9 apparente. Mme Karimi affirme qu\u2019elle s\u2019est vu attribuer la t\u00e2che non sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e de faire le m\u00e9nage des dossiers alors qu\u2019elle aurait pu recevoir de la formation, comme cela \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu dans son plan de travail individuel\/plan de retour au travail. Mme Bazinet a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cette t\u00e2che permettait \u00e0 Mme Karimi de se refamiliariser avec les divers syst\u00e8mes et commandes avant de retourner \u00e0 son poste \u00e0 temps plein dans le Service de gestion de commandes. Selon Mme Bazinet, pendant son affectation, Mme Karimi devait effectuer exactement le m\u00eame type de travail qu\u2019un gestionnaire de commandes, mais sans avoir \u00e0 g\u00e9rer les d\u00e9lais serr\u00e9s et les r\u00e9percussions sur la client\u00e8le. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle estimait que cette affectation constituait en quelque sorte une formation. Elle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que Mme Karimi ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas vu attribuer des commandes habituellement confi\u00e9es \u00e0 un gestionnaire de commandes parce que celui-ci doit s\u2019occuper des commandes du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin et que les clients et les autres services doivent avoir une seule personne-ressource pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 leurs questions. Cela n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 possible si Mme Karimi avait travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 temps partiel, quelques heures par jour.\n[66] Le 26 octobre 2009, Mme Bazinet a dit \u00e0 Mme Karimi qu\u2019elle devait retourner \u00e0 temps plein la semaine suivante. Zayo avait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e par Great-West Life que Mme Karimi n\u2019\u00e9tait plus admissible aux prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e et que son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 ne suscitait plus de pr\u00e9occupations justifiant un horaire adapt\u00e9. Vers cette date, Mme Bazinet a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait plus de t\u00e2ches de nettoyage informatique \u00e0 effectuer. La preuve ne pr\u00e9cise pas si l\u2019assureur a fourni l\u2019information en premier ou s\u2019il l\u2019a fournie seulement une fois que les t\u00e2ches li\u00e9es au m\u00e9nage des dossiers \u00e9taient presque termin\u00e9es.\n[67] Selon Mme Karimi, elle ne pouvait pas \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, physiquement ou mentalement, tol\u00e9rer de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 son lieu de travail \u00e0 temps plein. Mme Karimi pr\u00e9tend que ce probl\u00e8me aurait pu \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9 si elle avait pu travailler de la maison.\n[68] Le 27 octobre 2009, Mme Karimi, par l\u2019entremise de son avocat, a inform\u00e9 Zayo qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de retourner travailler \u00e0 temps plein et a fourni la copie d\u2019une note sign\u00e9e par son m\u00e9decin traitant et dat\u00e9e du 22 octobre 2009, selon lequelle elle [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] n\u2019[avait] pas l\u2019\u00e9tat physique ou mental pour retourner travailler \u00e0 temps plein. Elle dev[ait] partir en cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e. \u00bb Une rencontre a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 organis\u00e9e entre Mme Karimi, des membres de la direction et des repr\u00e9sentants de son syndicat.\n[69] Le 19 novembre 2009, Mme Karimi a rencontr\u00e9 les repr\u00e9sentants de Zayo et un repr\u00e9sentant de son syndicat. Zayo l\u2019a avis\u00e9e qu\u2019elle n\u2019allait plus lui permettre de travailler trois jours par semaine, comme elle l\u2019avait fait depuis le 31 mars 2009. Zayo a dit \u00e0 Mme Karimi qu\u2019elle devait retourner travailler \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 partir du 7 d\u00e9cembre 2009, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi elle ne serait plus autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 travailler.\n[70] Comme Mme Karimi cherchait toujours \u00e0 obtenir des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e (elle interjetait appel de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019assureur selon laquelle elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible aux prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e), Zayo soutient qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 lui accorder un cong\u00e9 temporaire sans solde : (i) jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit rendue dans le cadre de sa demande\/son appel; (ii) jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle puisse retourner travailler \u00e0 temps plein; ou (iii) jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que Zayo puisse trouver un autre poste lui permettant de travailler trois jours par semaine. Afin que Mme Karimi ait un certain revenu pendant le processus d\u2019appel, Zayo l\u2019avait avis\u00e9e qu\u2019elle pouvait utiliser le solde de son indemnit\u00e9 de cong\u00e9. Zayo a \u00e9galement mis Mme Karimi en cong\u00e9 pay\u00e9 du 29 d\u00e9cembre 2009 au 1er janvier 2010 pour lui permettre de r\u00e9gler les probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s \u00e0 ses documents m\u00e9dicaux.\n[71] Zayo affirme avoir activement cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement en essayant de trouver un poste adapt\u00e9 pour Mme Karimi. Dans le cadre de ce processus, le 2 d\u00e9cembre 2009, Zayo a offert \u00e0 Mme Karimi un poste \u00e0 temps partiel pour lequel elle devait travailler ailleurs (\u00e0 Etobicoke) en soir\u00e9e pendant la semaine et la nuit durant la fin de semaine. Du m\u00eame coup, malgr\u00e9 le fait que Zayo lui avait permis de travailler trois jours par semaine pendant plus de huit mois sans aucun document m\u00e9dical, Mme Karimi a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que Zayo lui a demand\u00e9 de fournir des documents m\u00e9dicaux avant qu\u2019elle ne puisse effectuer d\u2019autres t\u00e2ches. Selon Mme Karimi, le poste \u00e0 temps partiel que Zayo lui a offert \u00e0 Etobicoke n\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019une fa\u00e7on peu convaincante de para\u00eetre attentionn\u00e9e. Elle pr\u00e9tend avoir refus\u00e9 le poste parce que le lieu de travail \u00e9tait loin de chez elle, que ses douleurs au dos l\u2019emp\u00eachaient de faire de longs d\u00e9placements et que ses troubles du sommeil l\u2019emp\u00eachaient de travailler la nuit.\n[72] Selon Zayo, l\u2019offre \u00e9tait une offre l\u00e9gitime visant \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 Mme Karimi de travailler \u00e0 temps partiel et, \u00e0 sa connaissance, le poste respectait les restrictions d\u2019ordre m\u00e9dical de cette derni\u00e8re. Quand elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 l\u2019offre, Zayo a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Karimi de lui fournir une attestation m\u00e9dicale selon laquelle elle \u00e9tait capable de travailler, car au vu des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux les plus r\u00e9cents au dossier, soit le certificat m\u00e9dical dat\u00e9 du 22 octobre 2009, elle ne pouvait pas travailler \u00e0 temps plein et elle devait obtenir un cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e. Zayo affirme ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de trouver un autre poste \u00e0 temps partiel qui respectait les capacit\u00e9s physiques restreintes de Mme Karimi apr\u00e8s que cette derni\u00e8re eut refus\u00e9 le poste \u00e0 Etobicoke. Zayo soutient qu\u2019elle ne pouvait donc pas permettre \u00e0 Mme Karimi de retourner au travail apr\u00e8s le 4 d\u00e9cembre 2009 si elle ne fournissait pas un nouveau document m\u00e9dical. Zayo avait convenu de continuer \u00e0 chercher des postes adapt\u00e9s aux besoins de Mme Karimi et, si elle en trouvait un, Mme Karimi devrait alors fournir de nouveaux documents m\u00e9dicaux.\n[73] S\u2019agissant de la demande de documents m\u00e9dicaux, Zayo a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019elle exigeait ces documents parce que Mme Karimi voulait donner suite \u00e0 sa demande de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e au motif qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait totalement incapable de travailler, tout en demandant des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour pouvoir retourner au travail. Des t\u00e9moins de Zayo ont affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pas une id\u00e9e claire de l\u2019employabilit\u00e9 de la plaignante.\n[74] Le 7 d\u00e9cembre 2009, Zayo a avis\u00e9 Mme Karimi qu\u2019elle recevrait une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 trois jours par semaine jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2009 gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une combinaison des indemnit\u00e9s de cong\u00e9 annuel et de jour f\u00e9ri\u00e9. Mme Karimi s\u2019est oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 cette utilisation de ses indemnit\u00e9s, mais Zayo a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas son mot \u00e0 dire et qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la bienvenue au travail si elle n\u2019en recevait pas l\u2019autorisation de son m\u00e9decin. Le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2009 \u00e9tait donc la derni\u00e8re journ\u00e9e de travail de Mme Karimi et elle est en cong\u00e9 depuis.\n[75] Le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2009, Mme Karimi, par l\u2019entremise de son avocat, a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Zayo un certificat sign\u00e9 par son m\u00e9decin, dont voici un extrait :\n[traduction]\nTout d\u2019abord, j\u2019aimerais rappeler ma suggestion du 22 octobre 2009 selon laquelle Mme Karimi devrait \u00eatre en cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e. Comme cela semble inacceptable pour l\u2019employeur, je suis dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 proposer le compromis suivant.\nJe suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 accepter que Mme Ashraf Karimi travaille trois jours par semaine, selon un horaire souple, pendant une p\u00e9riode d\u2019essai et sous ma supervision, dans un endroit diff\u00e9rent de celui de son lieu de travail actuel. Travailler de longues heures \u00e0 son lieu de travail actuel aurait pour effet d\u2019aggraver son \u00e9tat. Il serait bien de trouver un endroit plus pr\u00e8s de chez elle compte tenu de ses capacit\u00e9s physiques restreintes.\n[76] Ryan Stammer, un sp\u00e9cialiste en relations de travail alors \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de Zayo, travaillait au dossier de Mme Karimi depuis l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2009. Il lui incombait de participer \u00e0 toute d\u00e9cision susceptible de devenir une question de relations de travail, notamment en s\u2019assurant que les mesures prises par les gestionnaires respectaient la convention collective. S\u2019agissant du poste offert \u00e0 Mme Karimi en d\u00e9cembre 2009, M. Stammer avait pris plusieurs mesures pour trouver un poste adapt\u00e9, notamment en envoyant des courriels \u00e0 divers coll\u00e8gues des RH pour leur demander s\u2019ils avaient des postes vacants au sein de leurs unit\u00e9s de travail, s\u2019ils avaient des t\u00e2ches pouvant \u00eatre effectu\u00e9es par une employ\u00e9e en t\u00e9l\u00e9travail ou s\u2019ils \u00e9taient au courant de diverses t\u00e2ches inh\u00e9rentes \u00e0 plusieurs postes qui pourraient \u00eatre combin\u00e9es ou divis\u00e9es. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il assurait un suivi au moins une fois par semaine pour trouver un poste qui r\u00e9pondrait aux besoins de Mme Karimi, sans succ\u00e8s. Il a attribu\u00e9 une partie de cet \u00e9chec aux mises \u00e0 pied ayant eu lieu au sein de l\u2019entreprise dans les mois qui avaient pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, et donc, au fait qu\u2019il y avait moins de postes vacants.\n[77] M. Van Horne avait t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet du nombre d\u2019avis de mise \u00e0 pied qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s de la fin de 2008 au d\u00e9but de 2010. Selon lui, beaucoup d\u2019employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied. Environ 20 %, ou plus, des divers postes CT (CT1 \u00e0 CT3) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9s, soit plus de 100 employ\u00e9s. M. Stammer a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il a cess\u00e9 de chercher des postes adapt\u00e9s aux besoins de Mme Karimi au-del\u00e0 de f\u00e9vrier 2010, quand cette derni\u00e8re a vu ses prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 r\u00e9tablies et qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e admissible au programme d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e.\n[78] Le 11 janvier 2010, Mme Karimi a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief selon lequel elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019actes persistants de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience de la part de Zayo qui aurait refus\u00e9 de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement. Zayo a rejet\u00e9 le grief \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape et le syndicat n\u2019y a pas donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape.\n[79] En d\u00e9finitive, la demande de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e de Mme Karimi a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e en f\u00e9vrier 2010, ou vers cette date, r\u00e9troactivement au 6 juillet 2009. Depuis, elle re\u00e7oit des prestations.\nV. Questions en litige\nLes questions dont j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi se r\u00e9sument ainsi :\nLa plaignante a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et\/ou la d\u00e9ficience de la part de Zayo, l\u2019intim\u00e9e, en violation de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi, \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa premi\u00e8re plainte?\nSi la plaignante \u00e9tablit l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et\/ou la d\u00e9ficience, l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut-elle prouver que les restrictions contest\u00e9es d\u00e9coulaient d\u2019exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es (\u00ab EPJ \u00bb) au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) et du paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi?\nLa plaignante a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience de la part de Zayo \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa deuxi\u00e8me plainte?\nSi la plaignante \u00e9tablit l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience, l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut-elle prouver que les restrictions contest\u00e9es d\u00e9coulaient d\u2019exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) et du paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi?\nLa plaignante a-t-elle fait l\u2019objet de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de Zayo au sens de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi?\nVI. Cadre juridique\n[80] Il incombe \u00e0 Mme Karimi d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve prima facie est \u00ab [\u2026] celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 [\u2026] \u00bb (voir Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 RCS 536, au paragraphe 28, 23 DLR (4th) 321).\n[81] Pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination sur le fondement de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi, les plaignants doivent montrer : (1) qu\u2019ils poss\u00e8dent une caract\u00e9ristique que la Loi prot\u00e8ge contre la discrimination; (2) qu\u2019ils ont subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable dans le cadre de leur emploi du fait d\u2019une situation vis\u00e9e par l\u2019article 7 de la Loi; et (3) que la ou les caract\u00e9ristiques prot\u00e9g\u00e9es ont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable (voir Moore c. Colombie-Britannique (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61, au paragraphe 33, [2012] 3 RCS 360). Les trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments doivent \u00eatre prouv\u00e9s selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s (voir Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier A\u00e9ronautique Centre de formation), 2015 CSC 39, aux paragraphes 56 et 65, [2015] 2 RCS 789 (Bombardier)).\n[82] De m\u00eame, pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de repr\u00e9sailles, les plaignants doivent montrer : (1) qu\u2019ils ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi; (2) qu\u2019ils ont subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable par suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de leur plainte; et (3) que la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable subi (voir Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada et al. c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (pour le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), 2015 TCDP 14, aux paragraphes 3 \u00e0 30 (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien 2015); et Premi\u00e8re Nation Millbrook c. Tabor, 2016 CF 894, aux paragraphes 54 \u00e0 64, 270 ACWS (3d) 451 (Tabor CF)).\n[83] Un intim\u00e9 peut se d\u00e9fendre contre toute all\u00e9gation de discrimination prima facie en pr\u00e9sentant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant que ses actes n\u2019\u00e9taient pas discriminatoires, en se pr\u00e9valant d\u2019un moyen de d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vu par la loi et qui justifie son acte discriminatoire, ou les deux (voir Bombardier, au paragraphe 64). En r\u00e9ponse aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination de Mme Karimi fond\u00e9es sur le sexe, pendant la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa demande de mesures d\u2019accommodement, Zayo soutient que ses actes n\u2019\u00e9taient pas discriminatoires. S\u2019agissant des all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9es sur la d\u00e9ficience formul\u00e9es par Mme Karimi, Zayo affirme n\u2019avoir pris aucune mesure de repr\u00e9sailles contre la plaignante et invoque l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la Loi, selon lequel ne constituent pas des actes discriminatoires \u00ab les refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de l\u2019employeur qui d\u00e9montre qu\u2019ils d\u00e9coulent d\u2019exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es \u00bb. Le paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi pr\u00e9cise \u00e9galement que les faits pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) sont des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es si Zayo d\u00e9montre que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de Mme Karimi constituent une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\nVII. Analyse\nA. La plaignante a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et\/ou la d\u00e9ficience de la part de Zayo, l\u2019intim\u00e9e, en violation de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi, \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa premi\u00e8re plainte?\n[84] Avant d\u2019examiner le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte, le Tribunal souligne l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e par Zayo dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions (\u00ab EDP \u00bb) selon laquelle la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vis\u00e9e par la premi\u00e8re plainte renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal. Avant le d\u00e9but de la partie de l\u2019audience r\u00e9serv\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve, Zayo a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait l\u2019intention de faire valoir ses arguments d\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re journ\u00e9e de l\u2019audience, ce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas fait. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le formulaire de plainte de Mme Karimi, je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 accepter qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience, mais seulement en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019incident relatif \u00e0 l\u2019attribution des t\u00e2ches \u00e0 son retour au travail apr\u00e8s un cong\u00e9 de maladie et \u00e0 la t\u00e2che li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019inventaire des routeurs. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que, dans ces deux cas, la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement devant le Tribunal. Cependant, dans ses conclusions finales, la plaignante n\u2019a soulign\u00e9 que le motif de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Le Tribunal examinera tout de m\u00eame la situation en tenant compte tant de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe que de celle fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience.\na. Attitude critique et surveillance de la part du gestionnaire\n[85] Mme Karimi pr\u00e9tend que, comme elle \u00e9tait la seule employ\u00e9e de sexe f\u00e9minin dans le Service Internet, M. Picard l\u2019a prise \u00e0 partie et l\u2019a trait\u00e9e diff\u00e9remment, notamment en critiquant son rendement et sa ponctualit\u00e9, en lui attribuant un imposant volume de t\u00e2ches et en lui refusant des possibilit\u00e9s de formation offertes \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin. Au final, elle affirme que son sexe a influenc\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la r\u00e9affecter au Service de la conception et de la r\u00e9trograder. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience, Mme Karimi soutient \u00e9galement que M. Picard l\u2019a surcharg\u00e9e de travail et lui a attribu\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches n\u00e9cessitant le levage de lourdes charges alors qu\u2019il savait que sa d\u00e9ficience entrave sa capacit\u00e9 d\u2019accomplir de telles t\u00e2ches.\n[86] Zayo soutient que M. Picard n\u2019a pas injustement critiqu\u00e9 le travail ou la ponctualit\u00e9 de Mme Karimi. Si M. Picard a r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Karimi du fait qu\u2019elle devait se pr\u00e9senter au travail \u00e0 l\u2019heure, c\u2019est justement parce qu\u2019elle avait des probl\u00e8mes de ponctualit\u00e9. Cela dit, aucune mesure disciplinaire, \u00e9crite ou autre, n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Karimi, que ce soit pour des raisons de rendement ou de ponctualit\u00e9. M. Picard a critiqu\u00e9 son travail et sa ponctualit\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re informelle, comme il l\u2019a fait avec tout autre employ\u00e9. De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Zayo affirme que Mme Karimi avait une haute opinion de ses comp\u00e9tences et avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019entendre avec ceux \u2014 coll\u00e8gues et gestionnaires \u2014 qui critiquaient son travail, tant avant qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de M. Picard.\n[87] Zayo affirme que d\u2019autres femmes du Service de donn\u00e9es relevaient de M. Picard et que le CEMS, le Service de donn\u00e9es et le Service Internet travaillaient ensemble. Mais, quel que f\u00fbt le degr\u00e9 de collaboration de ces deux services, le fait est que d\u2019autres femmes relevaient de M. Picard. Aucune n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\n[88] Le sexe est un motif de distinction illicite aux termes de la Loi. Bien que les deux premiers crit\u00e8res soient respect\u00e9s, le Tribunal estime que Mme Karimi ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e de son fardeau de la preuve en ce qui concerne le troisi\u00e8me aspect du crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli de lien entre son sexe et le traitement qu\u2019elle a subi.\n[89] Le Tribunal comprend la situation pr\u00e9caire dans laquelle se trouvait Mme Karimi chez Zayo puisqu\u2019elle travaillait pour l\u2019entreprise \u00e0 un moment o\u00f9 celle-ci subissait une pression \u00e9conomique et faisait l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u2019importante r\u00e9organisation, ce qui l\u2019a oblig\u00e9e \u00e0 changer de service et \u00e0 apprendre de nouvelles t\u00e2ches. Cependant, Mme Karimi n\u2019a pas fourni suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour d\u00e9montrer que son sexe a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable. Le fait qu\u2019elle ait peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 la seule femme \u00e0 travailler au sein du Service Internet ne remplit pas, en soi ou compte tenu des autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve au dossier, le crit\u00e8re de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s requis pour d\u00e9montrer que des d\u00e9cisions contraires \u00e0 ses int\u00e9r\u00eats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises et que son sexe a constitu\u00e9 un facteur ayant contribu\u00e9 aux effets pr\u00e9judiciables. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve, direct ou indirect, n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour \u00e9tablir que le sexe de Mme Karimi avait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans le traitement diff\u00e9rentiel dont elle a fait l\u2019objet.\nPlaintes des clients\n[90] En ce qui a trait aux all\u00e9gations de surveillance inappropri\u00e9e faite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du travail de Mme Karimi, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment au sujet des critiques faites \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de son rendement dans les divers dossiers de clients mentionn\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, je ne dispose d\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve me permettant de penser que son sexe a constitu\u00e9 un facteur d\u00e9terminant dans cette surveillance. Bien que certaines critiques aient \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es \u00e0 tort, car il semble que Mme Karimi ne soit pas responsable de certaines des erreurs, je ne dispose d\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve, outre les sentiments subjectifs de Mme Karimi, d\u00e9montrant que le sexe de cette derni\u00e8re ait eu une incidence sur la fa\u00e7on dont M. Picard l\u2019a trait\u00e9e. Il ressort clairement de la preuve que Mme Karimi avait des probl\u00e8mes de rendement et que son gestionnaire, M. Picard, avait raison de lui en parler. Par exemple, dans l\u2019affaire DEL, les courriels \u00e9chang\u00e9s entre Mme Karimi et M. Picard d\u00e9montrent qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7u l\u2019autorisation de transmettre le dossier \u00e0 qui de droit, mais qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait simplement d\u2019avis qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable qu\u2019un sup\u00e9rieur exerce de la pression. En fait, Mme Karimi a reconnu dans un courriel envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 son syndicat le 13 avril 2006 qu\u2019elle aurait pu transmettre elle-m\u00eame le dossier, mais qu\u2019elle ne l\u2019avait pas fait parce qu\u2019elle croyait que la demande aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e plus rapidement si un gestionnaire l\u2019avait envoy\u00e9e.\n[91] Zayo a expliqu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on raisonnable pourquoi M. Picard estimait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait important de laisser Mme Karimi savoir que des erreurs avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 commises dans ces dossiers particuliers et que cela avait entra\u00een\u00e9 des d\u00e9lais dans la prestation des services aux clients. La preuve constitu\u00e9e de courriels, lesquels refl\u00e9taient pleinement les pr\u00e9occupations des clients, \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t claire. Des erreurs avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 commises, les clients n\u2019\u00e9taient pas satisfaits et les pr\u00e9occupations de ces derniers devaient faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un suivi.\n[92] Zayo a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle prenait les plaintes des clients tr\u00e8s au s\u00e9rieux puisque d\u2019autres entreprises exer\u00e7aient une forte concurrence et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait important d\u2019am\u00e9liorer le service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le afin de garder les clients. Apr\u00e8s avoir attentivement examin\u00e9 les courriels \u00e9chang\u00e9s entre M. Picard et Mme Karimi, je suis d\u2019avis que les messages envoy\u00e9s par M. Picard \u00e0 Mme Karimi ne semblaient pas avoir pour objectif de la bl\u00e2mer, la punir ou la p\u00e9naliser. Au contraire, ces messages visaient \u00e0 cerner les probl\u00e8mes afin d\u2019am\u00e9liorer les pratiques et \u00e0 s\u2019assurer que les clients avaient v\u00e9cu une exp\u00e9rience positive. Par exemple, dans l\u2019affaire DEL, apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9attribu\u00e9 le dossier \u00e0 un coll\u00e8gue de Mme Karimi, M. Picard a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re de lui fournir un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des dates importantes afin d\u2019\u00e9valuer en quoi le service pouvait \u00eatre am\u00e9lior\u00e9. Il n\u2019y a eu aucune r\u00e9percussion pour Mme Karimi et aucune r\u00e9primande ne lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9e.\n[93] En outre, la cha\u00eene de courriels portant sur l\u2019incident FA d\u00e9montre clairement que M. Picard et le gestionnaire principal responsable des comptes clients voulaient am\u00e9liorer le service pour l\u2019avenir et non recueillir des renseignements dans le but d\u2019adresser une r\u00e9primande. Au final, Zayo n\u2019a pris aucune autre mesure relativement aux probl\u00e8mes de rendement de Mme Karimi.\nCourriels relatifs \u00e0 la ponctualit\u00e9\n[94] En ce qui concerne les divers \u00e9changes portant sur la ponctualit\u00e9 de Mme Karimi, je ne peux trouver aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e9tayant l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle M. Picard \u00e9tait critique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa ponctualit\u00e9 \u00e0 cause de son sexe, en totalit\u00e9 ou en partie. J\u2019estime que M. Picard voulait s\u2019assurer que Mme Karimi \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente au tout d\u00e9but de son quart de travail et qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 pouvait effectuer les t\u00e2ches requises du Service Internet pendant la p\u00e9riode appropri\u00e9e. Mme Karimi \u00e9tait la seule employ\u00e9e cens\u00e9e travailler entre 8 et 9 h et il devait veiller \u00e0 ce que quelqu\u2019un puisse r\u00e9pondre aux appels des clients. De plus, M. Picard a indiqu\u00e9 dans un de ses courriels que si une raison imp\u00e9rative emp\u00eachait Mme Karimi d\u2019arriver \u00e0 l\u2019heure au travail, ils pouvaient examiner ensemble la possibilit\u00e9 de modifier son quart de travail, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour \u00e9tablir que Mme Karimi avait demand\u00e9 un tel changement.\n[95] Pendant l\u2019audience, Mme Karimi a demand\u00e9 que Zayo effectue une recherche dans les courriels de M. Picard pour trouver des courriels semblables qu\u2019il aurait envoy\u00e9s aux autres employ\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient en retard ou avaient des probl\u00e8mes de ponctualit\u00e9. Zayo a consenti \u00e0 la demande et fait une recherche, mais n\u2019a trouv\u00e9 aucun courriel de ce genre. Zayo a soulev\u00e9 un certain nombre de raisons pour lesquelles la recherche a \u00e9t\u00e9 infructueuse, notamment le fait que M. Picard avait cess\u00e9 de travailler pour Zayo en 2012 et que, selon une politique de l\u2019entreprise, les courriels des anciens employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient supprim\u00e9s dans les trois mois suivant la fin de l\u2019emploi. D\u2019autres explications techniques ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 offertes. Mme Karimi me demande de tirer une conclusion d\u00e9favorable du fait que la recherche n\u2019a g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 aucun r\u00e9sultat, ce que je refuse de faire puisque, selon moi, l\u2019explication de Zayo selon laquelle les courriels n\u2019\u00e9taient plus disponibles en raison des politiques de l\u2019entreprise en mati\u00e8re de conservation de l\u2019information \u00e9tait raisonnable. De plus, bien que Zayo n\u2019ait fourni aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve documentaire pour d\u00e9montrer que d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s avaient re\u00e7u des courriels semblables apr\u00e8s \u00eatre arriv\u00e9s en retard au travail, aucun autre t\u00e9moin \u00e0 l\u2019audience n\u2019a contredit le t\u00e9moignage de M. Picard concernant ses pratiques de communication sur la ponctualit\u00e9.\n[96] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que la preuve ne permet pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe constituait un facteur dans le traitement d\u00e9favorable qu\u2019elle aurait subi (Bombardier, aux paragraphes 56, 65).\nAutre critique injustifi\u00e9e all\u00e9gu\u00e9e\n[97] En ce qui concerne l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle M. Picard aurait tent\u00e9 de dissuader Mme Karimi de s\u2019adresser \u00e0 son syndicat, la preuve n\u2019est pas concluante quant \u00e0 l\u2019exactitude de la description de l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement faite par Mme Karimi. Au final, elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief, lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 et n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 au palier suivant.\n[98] S\u2019agissant des incidents li\u00e9s \u00e0 des comportements nuisibles et \u00e0 des cris, il ressort de la preuve que les deux parties se sont probablement disput\u00e9es. M. Picard a invoqu\u00e9 les politiques sur le respect en milieu de travail quand il a envoy\u00e9 un courriel de suivi \u00e0 Mme Karimi.\n[99] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019incident \u00e0 la suite duquel M. Picard a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Karimi du fait qu\u2019elle avait dormi \u00e0 son bureau, ou qu\u2019elle avait simplement pos\u00e9 sa t\u00eate sur ses bras, M. Picard a eu raison de traiter l\u2019incident comme un probl\u00e8me de rendement.\n[100] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 tous ces incidents li\u00e9s \u00e0 un traitement critique de mani\u00e8re individuelle, mais aussi de mani\u00e8re collective, et je ne peux conclure que le sexe constituait un facteur dans le traitement que Mme Karimi a re\u00e7u de la part de M. Picard.\n[101] Il est bien possible que M. Picard et Mme Karimi ne s\u2019aimaient pas, ou que l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre, ou les deux, avaient des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 entrer en relation avec l\u2019autre, mais rien ne me porte \u00e0 croire que ces probl\u00e8mes \u00e9taient li\u00e9s \u00e0 des motifs de discrimination.\nb. R\u00e9affectation et refus de possibilit\u00e9s de formation\n[102] Le Tribunal fait remarquer encore une fois que la plainte initiale et l\u2019EDP de Mme Karimi qualifiaient de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe le refus des possibilit\u00e9s de formation. Cependant, dans ses observations finales, Mme Karimi a affirm\u00e9 que ce refus \u00e9tait seulement attribuable \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience et au fait que l\u2019employeur ne voulait pas donner une suite favorable \u00e0 une partie de ses besoins expos\u00e9s dans sa deuxi\u00e8me plainte. Le Tribunal a tout de m\u00eame examin\u00e9 si Mme Karimi s\u2019\u00e9tait vu refuser de la formation en raison de son sexe et de sa d\u00e9ficience alors qu\u2019elle travaillait au sein du Service de la conception.\n[103] En ce qui concerne la r\u00e9affectation de Mme Karimi au Service de la conception, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune preuve que la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en fonction du sexe de cette derni\u00e8re. Mme Karimi a appel\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin, Ian Cameron, pour qu\u2019il t\u00e9moigne sur la question de savoir si la convention collective avait \u00e9t\u00e9 bien appliqu\u00e9e, mais j\u2019accorde peu d\u2019importance \u00e0 ce t\u00e9moignage. M. Cameron n\u2019\u00e9tait pas directement impliqu\u00e9 dans les \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e0 l\u2019origine des plaintes de Mme Karimi, il ne connaissait pas tous les faits pour \u00e9valuer la situation et il ne traitait pas les griefs portant sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des dispositions de la convention collective. Ce t\u00e9moin a finalement reconnu que l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas prise en compte quand venait le temps d\u2019affecter temporairement un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre service. De plus, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e quant aux communications entre le vice-pr\u00e9sident du syndicat et un gestionnaire principal des relations de travail d\u00e9montre que les dispositions appropri\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9es et que l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 ne constituait pas un facteur dans le choix de l\u2019employ\u00e9 temporairement r\u00e9affect\u00e9 au Service de la conception. J\u2019admets donc que les r\u00e8gles \u00e9tablies dans la convention collective ont \u00e9t\u00e9 suivies.\n[104] Zayo a produit une preuve convaincante des arguments op\u00e9rationnels qui sous\u2011tendent la d\u00e9cision, comme il est indiqu\u00e9 au paragraphe 39 ci-dessus. De plus, Mme Karimi a eu l\u2019occasion de s\u2019opposer \u00e0 la r\u00e9affectation. Or, elle n\u2019a pas exprim\u00e9 ses objections de fa\u00e7on claire et non \u00e9quivoque. Un repr\u00e9sentant du syndicat a officieusement inform\u00e9 la direction que Mme Karimi n\u2019\u00e9tait pas int\u00e9ress\u00e9e par la r\u00e9affectation, mais cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019en a pas officiellement inform\u00e9 la direction et n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 au syndicat de prendre des mesures officielles pour d\u00e9poser un grief. Au contraire, Mme Karimi a indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Picard qu\u2019elle se r\u00e9jouissait de cette r\u00e9affectation, comme le prouve un courriel qu\u2019elle lui a envoy\u00e9 et qui pr\u00e9cisait qu\u2019elle [traduction] \u00ab appr\u00e9ciait la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019apprentissage \u00bb. Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, il incombe \u00e0 la plaignante de d\u00e9montrer que la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe constituait un facteur d\u00e9terminant dans la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019affecter temporairement au Service de la conception. Ce lien n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[105] J\u2019estime que Mme Karimi ne s\u2019est pas vu refuser des possibilit\u00e9s de formation pendant qu\u2019elle travaillait dans le Service de la conception pour des raisons li\u00e9es \u00e0 son sexe ou \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience. Il ressort clairement de la preuve que Mme Karimi a \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9e de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que les autres employ\u00e9s du service. Rien n\u2019indique que de la formation a \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte aux autres employ\u00e9s du service alors qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Karimi. La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que la m\u00e9thode de formation ne plaisait pas \u00e0 Mme Karimi, mais rien ne permet de croire qu\u2019elle s\u2019est vu refuser la formation n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019accomplissement de ses t\u00e2ches dans le Service de la conception, et ce, en raison de son sexe.\n[106] Pendant l\u2019affectation temporaire de Mme Karimi au Service de la conception, elle \u00e9tait, \u00e0 toutes fins utiles, un membre de ce service. Par cons\u00e9quent, si de la formation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues du Service Internet, elle n\u2019y aurait pas particip\u00e9. Mme Karimi n\u2019a fourni aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve pour d\u00e9montrer quelles formations, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, elle aurait manqu\u00e9es et quelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les r\u00e9percussions possibles sur elle. En cons\u00e9quence, je conclus que, pendant l\u2019affectation, elle n\u2019a subi aucun effet pr\u00e9judiciable sous forme de formation manqu\u00e9e.\nc. R\u00e9trogradation et r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrage\n[107] Mme Karimi a admis qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait l\u2019un des deux employ\u00e9s ayant le moins d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 dans le Service Internet et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 vis\u00e9e, \u00e0 juste titre aux termes de la convention collective, par le r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrage effectu\u00e9 par Zayo.\n[108] J\u2019accepte l\u2019explication de Zayo selon laquelle le personnel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9\u00e9quilibr\u00e9 pour des raisons li\u00e9es \u00e0 la restructuration des activit\u00e9s op\u00e9rationnelles. Dans l\u2019avis, il \u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9 que quatre employ\u00e9s devaient \u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9s. Il \u00e9tait facile d\u2019identifier les deux premiers employ\u00e9s puisqu\u2019ils \u00e9taient les derniers sur la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 (Mme Karimi et un coll\u00e8gue de sexe masculin). MM. Picard et Van Horne ont parl\u00e9 de transf\u00e9rer deux autres employ\u00e9s (employ\u00e9s 3 et 4), mais cette discussion ne concernait pas du tout Mme Karimi. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que la plaignante n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que le sexe avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en consid\u00e9ration lorsque Zayo a pris la d\u00e9cision de restructurer ses activit\u00e9s, ce qui a n\u00e9cessairement entra\u00een\u00e9 le r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrage des employ\u00e9s (Mme Karimi et un coll\u00e8gue de sexe masculin ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s), y compris la fusion de divers groupes.\nd. Attribution d\u2019un imposant volume de t\u00e2ches, dont des t\u00e2ches qui d\u00e9passaient les capacit\u00e9s physiques li\u00e9es \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Karimi\n[109] En ce qui concerne le travail qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Karimi \u00e0 son retour au travail le 8 mai 2006, je ne vois rien d\u2019inappropri\u00e9 dans le fait que M. Picard ait redonn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Karimi ses dossiers. Rien n\u2019indique que Mme Karimi se soit vu attribuer plus de dossiers qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019habitude, ou plus de dossiers que les autres employ\u00e9s. Elle a simplement r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 ses propres dossiers \u00e0 son retour au travail. Il n\u2019y avait rien d\u2019arbitraire, de punitif ou de malveillant dans le fait de lui retourner ses dossiers. Mme Karimi a affirm\u00e9 se sentir d\u00e9pass\u00e9e par les t\u00e2ches \u00e0 accomplir, mais rien ne d\u00e9montre qu\u2019elle ait exig\u00e9 ou demand\u00e9 un retour au travail progressif ou qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9sentait de nouvelles capacit\u00e9s restreintes susceptibles de nuire \u00e0 son travail. Encore une fois, je ne vois aucun lien entre le sexe ou la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Karimi et le fait qu\u2019elle ait r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 ses dossiers \u00e0 son retour au travail apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9 de maladie.\n[110] Mme Karimi affirme avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et sur la d\u00e9ficience puisqu\u2019elle s\u2019est vu attribuer l\u2019inventaire des routeurs, mais, selon moi, elle n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 avoir subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 cause de cette t\u00e2che. Au final, elle n\u2019a pas r\u00e9alis\u00e9 la t\u00e2che et elle n\u2019en a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9e.\n[111] Il est \u00e9vident que Mme Karimi avait besoin de mesures d\u2019accommodement en raison de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 (des douleurs au dos et au poignet qui l\u2019emp\u00eachent de soulever des charges lourdes). Zayo a fourni des explications raisonnables pour justifier le fait qu\u2019on avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Karimi de faire l\u2019inventaire des routeurs, \u00e0 savoir que la t\u00e2che devait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e pendant son quart de travail et que Mme Karimi \u00e9tait la seule personne qui travaillait pendant ce quart. De plus, une fois que M. Picard a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 du fait que Mme Karimi avait besoin de mesures d\u2019accommodement et qu\u2019il en a re\u00e7u la confirmation, il a tent\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses besoins. Il a v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 les manuels des routeurs pour s\u2019assurer que leur poids \u00e9tait semblable \u00e0 celui des routeurs dont s\u2019occupait d\u00e9j\u00e0 Mme Karimi. Enfin, M. Allaert a pris des mesures pour s\u2019assurer qu\u2019elle pouvait s\u2019acquitter de cette t\u00e2che sans soulever de lourdes charges puisqu\u2019il avait trouv\u00e9 quelqu\u2019un pour lui apporter les routeurs et les sortir de son bureau apr\u00e8s leur configuration.\n[112] J\u2019accepte les t\u00e9moignages de MM. Picard et Allaert selon lesquels la t\u00e2che avait \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Karimi parce qu\u2019elle devait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e pendant son quart de travail. Cependant, Mme Karimi a affirm\u00e9 que le d\u00e9but de son quart de travail \u00e9tait une p\u00e9riode fort occup\u00e9e puisqu\u2019elle \u00e9tait alors la seule employ\u00e9e \u00e0 travailler. J\u2019accepte la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Zayo selon laquelle cette p\u00e9riode n\u2019\u00e9tait pas particuli\u00e8rement occup\u00e9e et que l\u2019employ\u00e9e recevait peu d\u2019appels de clients. Autrement, j\u2019imagine que Zayo aurait affect\u00e9 plus d\u2019employ\u00e9s \u00e0 ce quart de travail. De plus, les courriels envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 d\u00e9montraient que Mme Karimi avait invoqu\u00e9 ses capacit\u00e9s physiques restreintes pour justifier qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure d\u2019accomplir la t\u00e2che. En fait, elle avait indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle aurait aim\u00e9 y contribuer mais ses capacit\u00e9s physiques restreintes l\u2019en emp\u00eachaient. Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, j\u2019estime que rien n\u2019indiquait que Mme Karimi avait re\u00e7u un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Par ailleurs, MM. Picard et Allaert n\u2019ont rien dit ou fait, directement ou indirectement, qui donnerait \u00e0 penser que Mme Karimi avait \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 effectuer la t\u00e2che en raison de son sexe. Au final, ce qui manque en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, c\u2019est la preuve que Mme Karimi a subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable puisqu\u2019elle n\u2019a jamais accompli la t\u00e2che et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable du fait qu\u2019elle ne l\u2019a pas ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e.\nB. La plaignante a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience de la part de Zayo \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa deuxi\u00e8me plainte?\n[113] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019aspect \u00ab d\u00e9ficience \u00bb de la plainte de Mme Karimi, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que cette derni\u00e8re pr\u00e9sentait une autre d\u00e9ficience, soit la d\u00e9pression, et cela n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9. Elle a subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable du fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 travailler de la maison apr\u00e8s en avoir fait la demande en 2008 et qu\u2019il lui a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 interdit de continuer \u00e0 travailler apr\u00e8s novembre 2009. En d\u00e9pit de ses demandes de mesures d\u2019accommodement, elle n\u2019a pas pu retourner travailler. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que Mme Karimi s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9e de son fardeau de preuve prima facie puisque sa d\u00e9ficience avait contribu\u00e9 au traitement pr\u00e9judiciable qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7u.\nC. Si la plaignante \u00e9tablit l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience, l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut-elle prouver que les restrictions contest\u00e9es d\u00e9coulaient d\u2019exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) et du paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi?\n[114] Pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une EPJ et d\u2019une contrainte excessive correspondante, Zayo doit, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, prouver (i) qu\u2019elle a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause; (ii) qu\u2019elle a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail; et (iii) que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail. Pour prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, il faut d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est impossible de composer avec les employ\u00e9s qui ont les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que le demandeur sans que l\u2019employeur subisse une contrainte excessive (Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 RCS 3, au paragraphe 54). La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9\u2011e\u2011s de techniques professionnelles et de bureau d\u2019Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec, section locale 2000 (SCFP\u2011FTQ), 2008 CSC 43, au paragraphe 16, [2008] 2 RCS 561 (Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec), que la norme n\u2019est pas l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 :\nLe crit\u00e8re n\u2019est pas l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 pour un employeur de composer avec les caract\u00e9ristiques d\u2019un employ\u00e9. L\u2019employeur n\u2019a pas l\u2019obligation de modifier de fa\u00e7on fondamentale les conditions de travail, mais il a cependant l\u2019obligation d\u2019am\u00e9nager, si cela ne lui cause pas une contrainte excessive, le poste de travail ou les t\u00e2ches de l\u2019employ\u00e9 pour lui permettre de fournir sa prestation de travail.\n[115] De plus, dans l\u2019affaire Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2014 CAF 131, au paragraphe 21, [2015] 3 RCF 103 (Cruden), la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que la Loi ne conf\u00e8re aucun droit proc\u00e9dural distinct en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accommodement.\n[116] La plaignante soutient que la politique sur le t\u00e9l\u00e9travail et, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le crit\u00e8re selon lequel l\u2019employ\u00e9 doit avoir deux ans d\u2019exp\u00e9rience dans un poste avant de pouvoir travailler de la maison, est la norme qu\u2019il convient d\u2019\u00e9valuer. Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. Le t\u00e9l\u00e9travail est une mesure d\u2019accommodement et, par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019estime que la norme qu\u2019il faut \u00e9valuer est celle selon laquelle Zayo oblige les gestionnaires de commandes \u00e0 faire la formation et \u00e0 travailler au bureau.\n[117] Je conclus que la norme adopt\u00e9e par Zayo, selon laquelle les gestionnaires de commandes doivent faire leur formation et travailler au bureau, est rationnellement li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause, en ce que qu\u2019elle vise \u00e0 minimiser les erreurs susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre co\u00fbteuses. Zayo croyait que les gestionnaires de commandes avaient besoin de formation, de conseils et de soutien de la part de leurs coll\u00e8gues du Service de gestion des commandes et qu\u2019ils pouvaient recevoir tout cela qu\u2019en \u00e9tant au travail, dans les bureaux de Zayo, compte tenu de la nature et du rythme du travail. L\u2019objectif de Zayo consistait \u00e0 minimiser les erreurs dans les services offerts aux clients et dans les commandes pendant la formation de nouveaux employ\u00e9s. Les gestionnaires de commandes \u00e9taient form\u00e9s en travaillant \u00e0 des dossiers actifs, et non \u00e0 de vieux dossiers ou \u00e0 des dossiers clos.\n[118] J\u2019estime par ailleurs que Zayo a adopt\u00e9 la norme de bonne foi. Le travail des gestionnaires de commandes ressemble \u00e0 celui effectu\u00e9 dans un centre d\u2019appels. Les gestionnaires de commandes r\u00e9pondent aux appels des clients, v\u00e9rifient les divers logiciels, consignent les commandes, inscrivent des notes, coordonnent les t\u00e2ches et les r\u00e9partissent entre les divers services de Zayo et configurent le mat\u00e9riel et les logiciels. De nombreux probl\u00e8mes peuvent survenir dans le cadre d\u2019une commande et ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir travaill\u00e9 et b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 du soutien de leurs coll\u00e8gues que les gestionnaires de commandes deviennent suffisamment comp\u00e9tents pour accomplir le travail par eux-m\u00eames. D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de Mme Bazinet, il faut au moins six mois pour qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 comprenne bien tous les probl\u00e8mes qu\u2019il peut rencontrer dans le cadre de son travail. Dans certains cas, il faut deux ans pour que l\u2019employ\u00e9 s\u2019initie \u00e0 son r\u00f4le et devienne autonome. La dur\u00e9e de la formation n\u2019est pas \u00e9tablie. La formation d\u2019un gestionnaire de commandes consiste principalement \u00e0 apprendre aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s d\u2019un autre gestionnaire. De plus, si la plaignante avait travaill\u00e9 chez elle, \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur des bureaux, elle n\u2019aurait pas pu se tourner vers un coll\u00e8gue pour simplement lui demander de l\u2019aide si un probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait survenu pendant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone avec un client ou un technicien. Le Tribunal accepte le t\u00e9moignage non contredit de Mme Bazinet selon lequel cet aspect de l\u2019environnement de travail \u00e9tait essentiel \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des t\u00e2ches. Dans bien des cas, les commandes des clients doivent \u00eatre trait\u00e9es dans des d\u00e9lais serr\u00e9s et les clients veulent habituellement parler au gestionnaire de commandes qui s\u2019occupe de leur commande du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin afin de minimiser les erreurs et assurer un service fonctionnel. Les clients commerciaux dont les commandes n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 bien trait\u00e9es ou dont les connexions n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entretenues convenablement risquent de perdre des revenus s\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas les services Internet n\u00e9cessaires pour mener leurs activit\u00e9s. Certaines entreprises avaient menac\u00e9 de poursuivre Zayo pour les erreurs qu\u2019elle avait commises.\n[119] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, au cours des quelques mois o\u00f9 Mme Karimi s\u2019initiait \u00e0 son nouveau r\u00f4le de gestionnaire de commandes, Zayo \u00e9tait d\u2019avis qu\u2019elle faisait de lents progr\u00e8s dans le cadre de sa formation. Selon Mme Bazinet, la plaignante faisait encore des erreurs de base, ne s\u2019occupait toujours pas de dossiers plus complexes et n\u2019avait pas atteint un niveau de compr\u00e9hension o\u00f9 elle pouvait g\u00e9rer ses dossiers par elle-m\u00eame, avec un minimum de soutien ou sans supervision directe. Mme Bazinet a aussi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9taill\u00e9s quant aux erreurs commises par Mme Karimi, selon lesquels cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait incapable d\u2019accomplir son travail de fa\u00e7on efficace et qu\u2019elle avait besoin du soutien et de la supervision de ses coll\u00e8gues. Le Tribunal estime qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune raison de croire que Mme Karimi fournirait un meilleur rendement en travaillant de la maison, sans le soutien et la supervision dont elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie en travaillant dans les bureaux de Zayo. Mme Bazinet a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Karimi n\u2019aurait pas pu recevoir le soutien de ses pairs si elle avait travaill\u00e9 de la maison, car les autres gestionnaires de commandes auraient pu \u00eatre occup\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des appels au moment o\u00f9 elle leur aurait demand\u00e9 de l\u2019aide par courriel ou par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Par cons\u00e9quent, Zayo s\u2019est pench\u00e9e sur la question de savoir si Mme Karimi pouvait recevoir sa formation \u00e0 la maison et travailler en tant que gestionnaire de commandes \u00e0 partir de la maison. Mme Karimi n\u2019a fourni aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui allait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019\u00e9valuation faite par Mme Bazinet de son rendement, ou qui contestait d\u2019autres aspects du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Bazinet.\n[120] Certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s selon lesquels un autre employ\u00e9 du Service de gestion de commandes travaillait de la maison, mais les circonstances \u00e9taient compl\u00e8tement diff\u00e9rentes. Mme Bazinet a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de cet employ\u00e9. Elle a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un gestionnaire exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 qui avait travaill\u00e9 au sein du groupe et avec les syst\u00e8mes de gestion de commandes pendant une dizaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es. L\u2019employ\u00e9 travaillait au sein du Service de gestion des commandes, mais son travail \u00e9tait distinct et tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent de celui des autres gestionnaires. Il \u00e9tait un expert sur une t\u00e2che particuli\u00e8re puisqu\u2019il l\u2019avait ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e pendant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es. Il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019un nouvel employ\u00e9 qui avait besoin de formation, de conseils et de soutien pour accomplir les t\u00e2ches requises. De plus, en 2008, on a tent\u00e9 de former un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler de la maison et \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter certaines t\u00e2ches r\u00e9alis\u00e9es par Mme Karimi et d\u2019autres gestionnaires de commandes. Or, l\u2019employ\u00e9 a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait trop difficile de faire la formation de la maison et, par cons\u00e9quent, la formation a \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e.\n[121] \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, Zayo n\u2019a pas cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de Mme Karimi en lui trouvant un autre poste ou en l\u2019envoyant travailler dans d\u2019autres bureaux puisqu\u2019il \u00e9tait clairement indiqu\u00e9 sur le certificat m\u00e9dical le plus r\u00e9cent, dat\u00e9 du 2 octobre 2008, qu\u2019elle devait travailler de la maison pour pouvoir retourner graduellement au travail.\n[122] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, j\u2019estime que Zayo s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 de son fardeau en d\u00e9montrant que le fait d\u2019obliger les gestionnaires de commandes \u00e0 travailler dans les bureaux de l\u2019entreprise et \u00e0 y recevoir la formation \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de son but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail, soit de minimiser les erreurs (et les co\u00fbts li\u00e9s \u00e0 ces erreurs) et d\u2019aider les gestionnaires de commandes \u00e0 gagner de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019estime que Zayo aurait subi une contrainte excessive si elle avait permis \u00e0 Mme Karimi de recevoir sa formation chez elle et de travailler de chez elle en tant que gestionnaire de commandes.\n[123] Apr\u00e8s que Zayo eut avis\u00e9 Mme Karimi qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas lui permettre de travailler de la maison en tant que gestionnaire de commandes, Mme Karimi n\u2019a pas envoy\u00e9 d\u2019autres messages \u00e0 Zayo. Dans le cadre du processus d\u2019accommodement, toutes les parties concern\u00e9es, soit l\u2019employ\u00e9e et l\u2019employeur (et peut-\u00eatre le syndicat, ce que les parties n\u2019ont jamais contest\u00e9), doivent prendre part \u00e0 des discussions sur les besoins, les restrictions et les solutions. Mme Karimi a affirm\u00e9 que Zayo devait explorer les autres mesures d\u2019accommodement possibles, y compris la question de savoir si elle pouvait travailler \u00e0 partir d\u2019un autre endroit ou \u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 un autre poste. Le Tribunal rejette cet argument parce que le fait d\u2019envoyer Mme Karimi travailler dans un autre endroit (autre que son domicile) allait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la restriction m\u00e9dicale que son m\u00e9decin avait formul\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intention de Zayo. Si la situation de Mme Karimi avait chang\u00e9 au point o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de travailler \u00e0 partir d\u2019un autre endroit ou dans un autre poste, l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement de Zayo aurait peut-\u00eatre alors \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clench\u00e9e. Ce n\u2019est tout simplement pas le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[124] Au final, Mme Karimi a continu\u00e9 de recevoir des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 une fois sa demande de t\u00e9l\u00e9travail refus\u00e9e. Great-West Life a \u00e9labor\u00e9 le plan de travail individuel\/plan de retour au travail avant qu\u2019elle ne retourne au travail le 30 mars 2009. Mme Karimi a pris contact avec Zayo seulement en mars 2009, quand elle est retourn\u00e9e travailler de fa\u00e7on graduelle, soit trois jours par semaine conform\u00e9ment aux conditions du plan de travail individuel\/plan de retour au travail.\n[125] Selon le Tribunal, lorsque Mme Karimi a repris graduellement le travail alors qu\u2019elle avait des restrictions m\u00e9dicales, Zayo a fait tout son possible pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses besoins. Elle a tenu compte de ses restrictions et lui a demand\u00e9 de faire le m\u00e9nage des dossiers pendant plus de huit mois. Elle utilisait alors les m\u00eames syst\u00e8mes qu\u2019elle aurait utilis\u00e9s si elle avait travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein dans le Service de gestion des commandes et, par cons\u00e9quent, elle a pu apprendre \u00e0 les utiliser dans un environnement o\u00f9 elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 g\u00e9rer les d\u00e9lais li\u00e9s aux dossiers actifs.\n[126] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9crit pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, les mesures d\u2019accommodement ont pris fin pour deux raisons. Premi\u00e8rement, Great-West Life avait conclu que Mme Karimi ne pr\u00e9sentait plus aucune restriction m\u00e9dicale qui justifiait la prise de mesures d\u2019accommodement et a fait conna\u00eetre sa position \u00e0 Zayo. Deuxi\u00e8mement, Mme Karimi avait termin\u00e9 le travail adapt\u00e9 que lui avait attribu\u00e9 Zayo. Une fois le m\u00e9nage des dossiers termin\u00e9, Zayo a discut\u00e9 avec Mme Karimi et a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 lui chercher un poste adapt\u00e9. Ensuite, le 2 d\u00e9cembre 2009, Mme Karimi s\u2019est vu offrir un poste \u00e0 temps partiel au Bureau de contr\u00f4le situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Etobicoke, lequel respectait ses restrictions m\u00e9dicales et le fait qu\u2019elle devait travailler \u00e0 temps partiel, ce que Zayo \u00e9tait toujours pr\u00eate \u00e0 lui accorder. Cependant, Mme Karimi a refus\u00e9 ce poste parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait loin de chez elle, que ses probl\u00e8mes de dos l\u2019emp\u00eachaient de faire de longs d\u00e9placements et que ses troubles de sommeil l\u2019emp\u00eachaient de travailler la nuit. Le Tribunal estime toutefois que les documents m\u00e9dicaux qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9s ne faisaient pas \u00e9tat de ces nouvelles limites ou restrictions.\n[127] Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, Zayo a indiqu\u00e9, au moment o\u00f9 elle a offert le poste adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Karimi, que cette derni\u00e8re devait fournir un certificat m\u00e9dical d\u2019aptitude au travail \u00e0 jour puisque selon le dernier document m\u00e9dical, elle devait \u00eatre en cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e. J\u2019estime que Mme Karimi avait la possibilit\u00e9 et l\u2019obligation de fournir d\u2019autres renseignements sur ces restrictions \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Autrement dit, Zayo \u00e9tait confuse. Mme Karimi demandait un poste adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 temps partiel, signe qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 travailler, mais elle demandait \u00e9galement des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e par l\u2019entremise de Great-West Life. Zayo estimait avoir le droit de demander une confirmation selon laquelle Mme Karimi pouvait retourner au travail sans danger, ainsi que des renseignements qui lui permettraient de s\u2019acquitter de son obligation d\u2019accommodement. Je suis d\u2019accord, car il faut se rappeler que les \u00ab [\u2026] mesures d\u2019accommodement ont pour but de permettre \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 capable de travailler de le faire \u00bb (Hydro Qu\u00e9bec, au paragraphe 14, se fondant sur Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville); Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Boisbriand (Ville), 2000 CSC 27, [2000] 1 RCS 665).\n[128] Zayo soutient que Mme Karimi aurait d\u00fb accepter le poste au Bureau de contr\u00f4le d\u2019Etobicoke parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une mesure d\u2019accommodement raisonnable qui respectait ses restrictions. Selon Zayo, Mme Karimi a droit \u00e0 une mesure d\u2019accommodement raisonnable. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019elle soit parfaite. Zayo, quant \u00e0 elle, ne devrait pas \u00eatre tenue de cr\u00e9er ou de maintenir un poste administratif pour Mme Karimi. Je suis d\u2019accord (voir Hydro Qu\u00e9bec, aux paragraphes 14 \u00e0 16; et Waddle c. Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique et al, 2017 TCDP 24, au paragraphe 109).\n[129] Mme Karimi a eu tout le temps d\u2019exprimer clairement dans ses documents m\u00e9dicaux en quoi consistaient ses restrictions et limites. Rien dans ces documents n\u2019indiquait qu\u2019elle avait des capacit\u00e9s restreintes quant \u00e0 la distance de conduite ou au quart de nuit ou toute autre restriction qui l\u2019emp\u00eachait d\u2019accepter le poste \u00e0 Etobicoke. Selon moi, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une offre de mesures d\u2019accommodement raisonnable, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e avec les meilleures intentions, qui \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le dernier certificat m\u00e9dical dat\u00e9 du 22 octobre 2009 fourni par Mme Karimi et qui, sous r\u00e9serve d\u2019un nouveau document m\u00e9dical attestant que Mme Karimi pouvait r\u00e9pondre aux exigences du poste, aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre accept\u00e9e. Comme il est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Central Okanagan School District No. 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 RCS 970, \u00e0 la page 995, 95 DLR (4th) 577 :\nLorsque l\u2019employeur fait une proposition qui est raisonnable et qui, si elle \u00e9tait mise en \u0153uvre, remplirait l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement, le plaignant est tenu d\u2019en faciliter la mise en \u0153uvre. [\u2026] L\u2019autre aspect de cette obligation est le devoir du plaignant d\u2019accepter une mesure d\u2019accommodement raisonnable. C\u2019est cet aspect que le juge McIntyre a mentionn\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat O'Malley. Le plaignant ne peut s\u2019attendre \u00e0 une solution parfaite. S\u2019il y a rejet d\u2019une proposition qui serait raisonnable compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, l\u2019employeur s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 de son obligation.\n[130] Le repr\u00e9sentant syndical de Mme Karimi en avait fait mention, mais rien n\u2019indiquait autrement que Zayo savait que le poste \u00e0 Etobicoke ne convenait pas en raison de son emplacement. De plus, Mme Karimi avait envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 son repr\u00e9sentant syndical, M. Gadwa, le 1er d\u00e9cembre 2009, pour lui laisser savoir que s\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible d\u2019obtenir un poste \u00e0 Markham, elle \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 travailler en tout autre lieu qui ne soit pas son lieu de travail actuel.\n[131] Lors de discussions tenues entre Mme Karimi, ses repr\u00e9sentants syndicaux et des membres de Zayo, il semble que Mme Karimi souhaitait travailler \u00e0 Markham. L\u2019employeur et le repr\u00e9sentant syndical de Mme Karimi se sont renseign\u00e9s sur les postes et le travail \u00e0 effectuer \u00e0 Markham, et ils ont tous les deux conclu que le travail qui devait \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 \u00e0 cet endroit n\u00e9cessitait que les employ\u00e9s soul\u00e8vent des objets lourds et assument des responsabilit\u00e9s qui outrepassaient les limites de Mme Karimi. J\u2019estime que Zayo, en faisant cette demande de renseignements, s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9e de son obligation de d\u00e9ployer des efforts d\u2019accommodement raisonnables.\n[132] Mme Karimi, par l\u2019entremise de son avocat de l\u2019\u00e9poque, a fourni un certificat m\u00e9dical le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2009 selon lequel elle pouvait retourner travailler \u00e0 temps partiel dans un endroit autre que son lieu de travail actuel. Il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait bien que Mme Karimi puisse travailler dans des bureaux situ\u00e9s plus pr\u00e8s de son domicile compte tenu de ses capacit\u00e9s physiques restreintes. Ce certificat, fourni quelques semaines apr\u00e8s que Mme Karimi s\u2019est vu offrir le poste au Bureau de contr\u00f4le, a n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la part de Zayo une nouvelle obligation d\u2019accommodement.\n[133] Zayo soutient avoir cherch\u00e9 avec diligence un poste qui respectait les restrictions de Mme Karimi, mais ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de trouver ou de cr\u00e9er un tel poste. Elle conteste plus particuli\u00e8rement l\u2019all\u00e9gation de Mme Karimi selon laquelle d\u2019autres postes qui r\u00e9pondaient \u00e0 ses besoins \u00e9taient disponibles. Ryan Stammer a fourni des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui illustraient les mesures qu\u2019il avait prises pour trouver des postes adapt\u00e9s. Il avait notamment communiqu\u00e9 avec diverses unit\u00e9s de travail de Zayo pour savoir si des postes \u00e9taient vacants, si elles avaient des t\u00e2ches qui pouvaient \u00eatre combin\u00e9es ou divis\u00e9es dans le but de cr\u00e9er un poste et ainsi permettre \u00e0 une employ\u00e9e de travailler de son domicile, ou d\u2019un autre endroit que le lieu de travail actuel de la plaignante. M. Stammer a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il assurait un suivi aupr\u00e8s des gestionnaires une fois par semaine, tant aupr\u00e8s de la partie syndicale que de la partie patronale. Selon lui, il n\u2019a trouv\u00e9 aucun poste parce que Zayo avait fait de nombreuses mises \u00e0 pied et compressions \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une diminution des activit\u00e9s.\n[134] Le Tribunal reconna\u00eet que Zayo \u00e9prouvait des difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 et qu\u2019elle r\u00e9duisait ses effectifs. Malgr\u00e9 ses difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res et le fait qu\u2019elle ait d\u00fb abolir plus de 100 postes CT \u2014 ce qui repr\u00e9sentait 20 % de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation \u2014, Zayo a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher une fa\u00e7on de faire travailler Mme Karimi tout en respectant ses limites. Malheureusement, aucun autre poste ne r\u00e9pondait aux besoins de Mme Karimi. Le Tribunal est convaincu que Zayo a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 des efforts raisonnables pour prendre en compte la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Karimi dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela ne constituait pas une contrainte excessive.\n[135] Pour ces raisons, je conclus que Zayo s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9e de son obligation d\u2019accommodement.\nD. La plaignante a-t-elle fait l\u2019objet de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de Zayo au sens de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi?\n[136] Il est important de rappeler que les plaignants ne sont pas tenus de produire un type d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve en particulier pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de repr\u00e9sailles :\nAu contraire, dans chaque affaire, le fait de savoir si la preuve produite est suffisante pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de repr\u00e9sailles (voir Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CAF 154 (CanLII), au paragraphe 27) est une question mixte de fait et de droit. Si l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment que l\u2019on pr\u00e9sente pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de repr\u00e9sailles est suffisant, il revient dans ce cas au Tribunal d\u2019examiner la preuve du plaignant, de pair avec n\u2019importe quel \u00e9l\u00e9ment pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9, en vue de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019improbable que l\u2019on a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles.\n(voir Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien 2015, au paragraphe 29)\n[137] \u00c0 la suite du traitement discriminatoire pr\u00e9sum\u00e9, Mme Karimi soutient avoir souffert d\u2019une d\u00e9pression grave. Apr\u00e8s avoir pris cong\u00e9 pour soigner sa d\u00e9pression, elle pr\u00e9tend que Zayo ne lui a pas fourni un environnement de travail ad\u00e9quat ni ne lui a donn\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de faire du t\u00e9l\u00e9travail. Elle soutient \u00e9galement que Zayo a refus\u00e9 de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour la punir d\u2019avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre Paul Picard concernant le traitement qu\u2019il lui r\u00e9servait. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, elle affirme que Zayo a tent\u00e9 de se d\u00e9barrasser d\u2019elle en lui causant des difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res et des souffrances mentales. En l\u2019emp\u00eachant de travailler de la maison, elle ne pouvait travailler que trois jours par semaine et ne gagnait pas son plein salaire. De plus, elle pr\u00e9tend que Zayo a voulu la forcer \u00e0 retourner au travail \u00e0 temps plein alors qu\u2019il lui \u00e9tait physiquement et mentalement impossible de le faire selon son m\u00e9decin.\n[138] Enfin, Mme Karimi soutient s\u2019\u00eatre retrouv\u00e9e, contre sa volont\u00e9, en cong\u00e9 sans solde au moment m\u00eame o\u00f9 Zayo apprenait qu\u2019elle ne recevait pas de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. Zayo a aussi d\u00e9cid\u00e9 unilat\u00e9ralement quels jours allaient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s pour combler les cong\u00e9s de Mme Karimi. Cette derni\u00e8re soutient qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un plan impersonnel et d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9 par Zayo dans le but de la retirer des effectifs en la pla\u00e7ant dans une situation pr\u00e9caire, l\u2019obligeant ainsi \u00e0 accepter une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part. Mme Karimi soutient que le fait que Zayo n\u2019ait pas pris de mesures d\u2019accommodement a eu pour effet de l\u2019isoler davantage de son domaine d\u2019emploi, lequel \u00e9tait technique et en constante \u00e9volution, et d\u2019aggraver sa d\u00e9pression, laquelle \u00e9tait attribuable aux circonstances \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la plainte initiale.\n[139] Nul ne conteste que Mme Karimi ait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne le 28 octobre 2008. Nul ne conteste non plus qu\u2019elle ait subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable du fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 travailler de chez elle apr\u00e8s en avoir fait la demande en 2008, et qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait pas pu continuer \u00e0 travailler dans un poste adapt\u00e9 apr\u00e8s novembre 2009.\n[140] Bien qu\u2019il ne soit pas n\u00e9cessaire de prouver l\u2019existence d\u2019une intention pour \u00e9tayer une plainte de repr\u00e9sailles, Mme Karimi devait fournir au Tribunal une preuve compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier que sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne constituait un facteur dans le traitement pr\u00e9judiciable que Zayo lui a fait subir \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte, et ce, que ce traitement repose sur une perception raisonnable ou pas (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien 2015, aux paragraphes 4 et 29; Tabor CF, aux paragraphes 63 et 64).\n[141] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Mme Karimi n\u2019a fourni aucune explication \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles. Cela dit, je n\u2019ai relev\u00e9 aucune preuve, intentionnelle ou involontaire, selon laquelle Zayo a pris des d\u00e9cisions en tenant compte de la premi\u00e8re plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Karimi en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Mme Karimi soutient que M. Van Horne \u00e9tait directement concern\u00e9 par les deux plaintes. Le fait que M. Van Horne \u00e9tait vis\u00e9 par la premi\u00e8re plainte, ainsi que divers \u00e9v\u00e9nements li\u00e9s \u00e0 cette plainte, ne m\u2019am\u00e8ne pas \u00e0 conclure que Zayo a pris des d\u00e9cisions parce que Mme Karimi avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa premi\u00e8re plainte. Le r\u00f4le inh\u00e9rent qu\u2019a jou\u00e9 M. Van Horne en tant que conseiller RH et\/ou gestionnaire principal des relations de travail (il a occup\u00e9 divers postes \u00e0 divers moments chez Zayo, tous au sein des RH) fait en sorte qu\u2019il \u00e9tait concern\u00e9 puisqu\u2019il devait donner des conseils aux gestionnaires et directeurs des diverses unit\u00e9s de travail sur des questions touchant la convention collective, les diff\u00e9rentes politiques de l\u2019entreprise et d\u2019autres questions li\u00e9es aux RH. Somme toute, j\u2019estime que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la premi\u00e8re plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne n\u2019a pas constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans les d\u00e9cisions ou mesures prises par la suite par Zayo et ne pouvait pas non plus \u00eatre raisonnablement per\u00e7u comme un facteur.\n[142] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, Zayo a fait tout son possible pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de Mme Karimi dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela ne constituait pas une contrainte excessive. Au lieu de montrer que Zayo a intentionnellement essay\u00e9 de chasser Mme Karimi des effectifs, la preuve d\u00e9montre qu\u2019elle a continu\u00e9 de tenter de trouver un poste adapt\u00e9 pour Mme Karimi, tant que cette derni\u00e8re pouvait d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en mesure de travailler. En fait, Mme Karimi est toujours \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de Zayo aujourd\u2019hui. Zayo a cess\u00e9 de d\u00e9ployer des efforts d\u2019accommodement seulement quand Mme Karimi est partie en cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e et que ses prestations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9tablies en f\u00e9vrier 2010. Rien n\u2019indique qu\u2019il y a un lien entre l\u2019\u00e9chec des efforts d\u2019accommodement et le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la premi\u00e8re plainte. Zayo n\u2019a trouv\u00e9 aucun poste convenable qui r\u00e9pondait aux besoins de Mme Karimi.\n[143] Pour paraphraser le paragraphe 54 de la d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cemment rendue par le Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Tabor c. La Premi\u00e8re nation Millbrook, 2015 TCDP 18, lorsqu\u2019une personne estime avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination, elle en vient parfois \u00e0 croire que toutes les mesures qui leur sont d\u00e9favorables s\u2019apparentent \u00e0 des repr\u00e9sailles pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte. Or, toute situation d\u00e9favorable cons\u00e9cutive au d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une plainte n\u2019est pas forc\u00e9ment le fruit de repr\u00e9sailles. Mme Karimi en est venue \u00e0 croire que les d\u00e9cisions prises par Zayo \u00e9taient notamment attribuables au fait qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte, mais cela n\u2019est pas suffisant pour \u00e9tayer une conclusion de repr\u00e9sailles. Comme l\u2019a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la perception de repr\u00e9sailles de la plaignante doit \u00eatre raisonnable. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce (Tabor CF, au paragraphe 64).\nVIII.

Cette demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s survient alors que le dossier est pr\u00eat \u00e0 \u00eatre entendu mais ne l\u2019a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9.\n[3] Je ne mentionnerai pas ici tous les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans le litige principal, mais essentiellement, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant dans laquelle il soutient qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment et qu\u2019il s\u2019est vu injustement d\u00e9cerner des points de p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 dans son dossier disciplinaire, le tout ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement le 5 octobre 2012. Le motif de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans ce dossier et retenu par le Tribunal est la d\u00e9ficience.\n[4] Via Rail Canada Inc. (l\u2019intim\u00e9e) et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) n\u2019ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aucune repr\u00e9sentation suite \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant et n\u2019ont pris aucune position sur la question, s\u2019en remettant tous les deux \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de ce Tribunal.\nL\u2019article 52 de la LCDP\n[5] En vertu de l\u2019art. 52 de la LCDP, la r\u00e8gle veut que l\u2019instruction d\u2019un dossier devant le Tribunal soit publique.\n[6] Mais toujours en vertu de l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP, le Tribunal peut, dans des circonstances bien pr\u00e9cises, et s\u2019il en est convaincu, prendre toute mesure ou rendre toute ordonnance qu\u2019il juge n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction. Ces circonstances bien pr\u00e9cises sont d\u00e9finies \u00e0 l\u2019art. 52 (1) de la LCDP.\n[7] Le plaignant repose ici sa demande sur les circonstances d\u00e9crites \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a c) de l\u2019art. 52 (1), soit :\nc) il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions personnelles ou autres de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher leur divulgation dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des personnes concern\u00e9es ou dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019\u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique;\nAnalyse\nL\u2019article 52 de la LCDP\n[8] La r\u00e8gle est claire, un dossier trait\u00e9 devant ce Tribunal le sera publiquement. L\u2019instruction d\u2019un dossier est publique.\n[9] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que la conduite d\u2019une instruction publique suppose d\u2019assurer l\u2019acc\u00e8s public aux documents vers\u00e9s au dossier officiel du Tribunal \u2013 formulaire de plainte, lettres \u00e9manant de la Commission et adress\u00e9es au Tribunal, expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions, requ\u00eates, pi\u00e8ces d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en preuve, enregistrements sonores de la proc\u00e9dure, et motifs des d\u00e9cisions relatives aux requ\u00eates ainsi que d\u00e9cision finale, s\u2019il y a lieu. Ceci n\u2019est pas une liste exhaustive.\n[10] Cela est coh\u00e9rent avec le principe de transparence quasi judiciaire auquel souscrit ce Tribunal. Il d\u00e9coule de ce principe que le Tribunal doit veiller \u00e0 ne pas entraver l\u2019acc\u00e8s du public \u00e0 notre proc\u00e9dure d\u2019instruction.\n[11] Cela me permet d\u2019ajouter que le Tribunal ne prendra pas de d\u00e9cision en fonction de qui fait une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s, mais plut\u00f4t en fonction du public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. L\u2019article 52 de la LCDP se pr\u00e9occupe de l\u2019acc\u00e8s au dossier par n\u2019importe quel membre du public, y compris des demandeurs \u00e9ventuels. Il ne r\u00e9git pas le droit des individus particuliers \u00e0 y avoir acc\u00e8s. Donc, pour les fins plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de l\u2019article 52, l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un demandeur d\u2019informations (qui pourrait \u00eatre suivi par d\u2019autres) n\u2019a aucune pertinence.\n[12] Revenons \u00e0 la requ\u00eate provisoire sur laquelle je dois rendre d\u00e9cision. Cette requ\u00eate du plaignant n\u2019est malheureusement pas grandement \u00e9tay\u00e9e. Elle indique simplement et de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ce pourquoi le plaignant recherche une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 de la part de ce Tribunal pour tous les documents vers\u00e9s au dossier.\n[13] Ainsi le plaignant s\u2019exprime comme suit dans sa requ\u00eate : \u00ab Les documents faisant l\u2019objet de cette demande (d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information) contiennent des informations personnelles qui pourraient nuire \u00e0 mes chances d\u2019obtenir un emploi convenable dans l\u2019attente de ma r\u00e9int\u00e9gration chez Via Rail Canada \u00bb.\n[14] Le plaignant n\u2019indique pas quels sont les documents en particulier qui pourraient lui nuire. Cette requ\u00eate porte en effet sur tous les documents vers\u00e9s au dossier officiel du Tribunal. Cela m\u2019apparait beaucoup trop large.\n[15] De plus, le plaignant ne d\u00e9crit pas, ni n\u2019explique ses craintes et en quoi la divulgation d\u2019informations personnelles contenues dans tous ces documents constitue un risque suffisamment s\u00e9rieux \u00e0 son \u00e9gard qui permettrait \u00e0 ce Tribunal de juger que cet int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel l\u2019emporterait sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat que l\u2019instruction demeure publique.\n[16] \u00c0 mon avis, les informations tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9rales d\u00e9crites par le plaignant en une seule phrase dans sa requ\u00eate ne constituent pas des motifs suffisants justifiant une ordonnance du Tribunal allant \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui dicte que l\u2019instruction soit publique.\n[17] J\u2019ajouterais d\u2019ailleurs qu\u2019\u00e0 ce stade de la proc\u00e9dure \u2013 ce dossier n\u2019ayant pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu - plusieurs de ces informations ne sont que des all\u00e9gations qui restent \u00e0 \u00eatre prouv\u00e9es ou r\u00e9fut\u00e9es devant ce Tribunal.\nB. La loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information\n[18] Dans sa requ\u00eate, le plaignant fait \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et \u00e0 la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels.\n[19] Le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, quoiqu\u2019un Tribunal de juridiction f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, n\u2019est plus assujetti \u00e0 ces deux lois. (Voir la Loi no 1 sur le plan d\u2019action \u00e9conomique de 2014, L.C. 2014, ch. 20, articles 384, 423).\n[20] Par contre, le Tribunal, lorsqu\u2019il fait face \u00e0 une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s aux documents vers\u00e9s au dossier officiel comme il l\u2019est pr\u00e9sentement dans cette affaire, r\u00e9pond \u00e0 de telles demandes en biffant les identificateurs personnels tr\u00e8s d\u00e9licats qui n\u2019ajoutent rien \u00e0 la compr\u00e9hension de l\u2019instance par le public, comme par exemple :\ni. dates de naissance\nii. adresses r\u00e9sidentielles\niii. adresses \u00e9lectroniques personnelles\niv. num\u00e9ros de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone personnels\nv. num\u00e9ros d\u2019identification \u00e9mis par le gouvernement (p. ex. NAS, num\u00e9ro de passeport)\n[21] Le Tribunal caviarde ces informations syst\u00e9matiquement, m\u00eame en l\u2019absence d\u2019une requ\u00eate en ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9.\nC. Autres motifs\n[22] De plus, dans ce dossier, d\u00e9j\u00e0 trois d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eates pr\u00e9liminaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues et publi\u00e9es sur le site web du Tribunal. Ces d\u00e9cisions sont publiques et tous les citoyens y ont acc\u00e8s.\n[23] Il m\u2019apparait que limiter l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux documents vers\u00e9s au dossier officiel du Tribunal dans cette affaire, comme le demande le plaignant, alors que d\u00e9j\u00e0 trois d\u00e9cisions d\u00e9taill\u00e9es comportant des informations assez pr\u00e9cises sur ce litige sont publiques, ne ferait aucun sens.\n[24] La premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision portant sur une requ\u00eate en radiation d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u2019ailleurs \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue publique et est accessible depuis plus de 6 mois sur le site web du Tribunal.\nConclusion\n[25] Pour toutes ces raisons, le Tribunal rejette la requ\u00eate en ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 du plaignant.\n[26] Le Tribunal ordonne que les documents vis\u00e9s par la demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s de la tierce partie soient rendus accessible dans les 30 jours suivant la date de cette d\u00e9cision, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de celle-ci. Les renseignements personnels et tr\u00e8s d\u00e9licats dont la nature est d\u00e9crite au paragraphe 20 des motifs de cette d\u00e9cision seront biff\u00e9s des documents en question avant d\u2019\u00eatre remis au requ\u00e9rant de la demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAnie Perrault\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nLe\n11 d\u00e9cembre 2017\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal :\nT2162\/3616\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nSerge Lafreni\u00e8re c.

I\u20115. L\u2019intim\u00e9e tient des \u00e9lections tous les trois ans, et le processus est r\u00e9gi par des coutumes tant \u00e9crites qu\u2019orales, qualifi\u00e9es de [traduction] \u00ab coutumes \u00e9lectorales \u00bb. D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019intim\u00e9, ces coutumes rel\u00e8vent de pratiques ant\u00e9rieures.\n[4] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que les \u00e9lections n\u2019ont jamais eu lieu d\u2019une mani\u00e8re conforme au processus \u00e9lectoral que pr\u00e9voit la Loi sur les Indiens et que, de ce fait, l\u2019article 74 de cette loi ne s\u2019applique pas, pas plus que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019est [traduction] \u00ab revenue aux coutumes selon les exigences d\u2019une politique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale quelconque \u00bb.\n[5] En juin 2010, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a tenu des \u00e9lections selon ses coutumes \u00e9lectorales et, apr\u00e8s ces \u00e9lections, la plaignante a port\u00e9 plainte sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP au motif que les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux \u00e9lections avaient supprim\u00e9 son nom de la liste des candidats ou des bulletins de vote officiels.\n[6] La plaignante n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de demande de r\u00e9vision judiciaire en vue d\u2019obtenir l\u2019avis de la Cour quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si la suppression \u00e9tait l\u00e9gitime selon les coutumes \u00e9lectorales, mais elle a bel et bien port\u00e9 plainte en vertu de la Loi.\n[7] La plaignante a soutenu qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial ou la situation de famille, en raison du fait qu\u2019on l\u2019avait emp\u00each\u00e9e de prendre part aux \u00e9lections du conseil de 2010, parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait mari\u00e9e \u00e0 un Blanc.\n[8] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) a port\u00e9 l\u2019affaire devant le Tribunal. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ce renvoi, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de r\u00e9vision judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale le 22 mars 2013. Le fondement de cette demande est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 au paragraphe 17 des observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e :\n[traduction] 17. Dans la demande de r\u00e9vision judiciaire, la NCSL soutient, notamment, que la Loi ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 la plaignante, car les \u00e9lections fond\u00e9es sur la coutume que la NCSL a tenues en 2010 n\u2019\u00e9taient pas des \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de ce terme \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la demande, la d\u00e9cision de renvoyer la plainte empi\u00e8te sur des droits ancestraux existants de la NCSL, lesquels droits sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l\u2019article 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982. [Renvoi omis.]\n[9] \u00c0 la suite de la demande de r\u00e9vision judiciaire, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a accord\u00e9 une suspension en faveur de la poursuite de l\u2019instance par voie de d\u00e9claration le 22 janvier 2014. Dans son m\u00e9moire, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction] 18. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 une ordonnance que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendue le 22 janvier 2014, la demande de r\u00e9vision judiciaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendue en faveur de la poursuite de l\u2019instance par voie de d\u00e9claration. En rendant cette ordonnance, la Cour a formul\u00e9 les observations suivantes :\n[L]a conversion est opportune, car les faits, y compris ceux tir\u00e9s de r\u00e9cits oraux, ne peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9tablis de mani\u00e8re satisfaisante uniquement par la voie d\u2019affidavits; des t\u00e9moignages de vive voix permettront de mieux saisir les faits et \u00e9valuer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve; les \u00e9tapes de la production, des interrogatoires pr\u00e9alables et des \u00e9changes de preuves d\u2019expert qui sont inh\u00e9rentes \u00e0 une instance sont n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 une audition compl\u00e8te et \u00e9quitable des questions en litige; [\u2026] les questions de nature constitutionnelle semblent d\u00e9border le cadre de la plainte et elles touchent un nombre \u00e9lev\u00e9 de tierces parties.\n[10] La NCSL a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale une d\u00e9claration dans laquelle elle sollicite la r\u00e9paration suivante :\n[traduction] 21. Dans l\u2019action intent\u00e9e devant la CF, la NCSL sollicite une d\u00e9claration portant que la Loi ne s\u2019applique pas aux \u00e9lections coutumi\u00e8res de la NCSL et que la Commission n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence sur celles\u2011ci. La d\u00e9claration pr\u00e9cise que la Loi ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 la plainte, notamment parce que :\na) les \u00e9lections coutumi\u00e8res de la NCSL ne sont pas autoris\u00e9es par le l\u00e9gislateur et, de ce fait, la plainte ne tombe pas sous le coup de l\u2019article 2 de la Loi, lequel pr\u00e9voit que celle\u2011ci ne s\u2019applique qu\u2019aux lois qui rel\u00e8vent du \u00ab champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada \u00bb;\nb) la Loi ne s\u2019applique pas, parce que les \u00e9lections coutumi\u00e8res de la NCSL ne sont pas des \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de ce terme \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la Loi.\n[11] Le 4 novembre 2016, la NCSL a obtenu l\u2019autorisation de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en jugement sommaire, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 30 novembre 2016, en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance de la Cour portant que les \u00e9lections coutumi\u00e8res de la NCSL pour les postes de chef et de conseillers ne sont pas des \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de ce terme \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la Loi.\n[12] La plaignante n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 d\u2019avis de comparution en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la demande de r\u00e9vision judiciaire initiale. L\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9clare qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas pris part \u00e0 cette instance, elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de partie \u00e0 l\u2019action ult\u00e9rieure. La Commission n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de partie \u00e0 l\u2019action.\n[13] Les observations de la Commission, au paragraphe 10 de la page 4 de son m\u00e9moire, indiquent o\u00f9 en \u00e9tait l\u2019instance engag\u00e9e devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale au moment du d\u00e9p\u00f4t des documents relatifs \u00e0 la requ\u00eate.\n[traduction]\n10. En m\u00eame temps que se d\u00e9roulait l\u2019instance devant le Tribunal, la NCSL a engag\u00e9 diverses instances en vue d\u2019obtenir diverses formes de redressement devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Comme il est mentionn\u00e9 dans l\u2019affidavit de Finlay Moses, les mesures prises \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale comprennent ce qui suit :\na. la NCSL a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de r\u00e9vision judiciaire concernant la d\u00e9cision de renvoi de la Commission (T\u2011504\u201113, la \u00ab demande \u00bb). Mme Wirth n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 d\u2019avis de comparution. La Commission a demand\u00e9 et obtenu l\u2019autorisation d\u2019intervenir dans la demande. La NCSL a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis de question constitutionnelle. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a ordonn\u00e9 en fin de compte que la demande soit suspendue, en attendant qu\u2019on r\u00e8gle des questions que la NCSL doit plaider dans le cadre d\u2019une nouvelle action;\nb. la NCSL a intent\u00e9 une action, d\u00e9signant le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (le \u00ab PGC \u00bb) comme d\u00e9fendeur unique (T\u2011364\u201114, l\u2019\u00ab action \u00bb). Dans cette action, la NCSL sollicite diverses formes de jugement d\u00e9claratoire, dont des d\u00e9clarations portant que la plainte de Mme Wirth n\u2019est pas li\u00e9e \u00e0 la prestation de services au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, et que l\u2019application de la LCDP aux \u00e9lections coutumi\u00e8res de la NCSL empi\u00e9terait sur les droits relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des Autochtones garantis par la Constitution. Ni Mme Wirth ni la Commission ne sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9es \u00e0 titre de partie;\nc. le PGC a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une d\u00e9fense dans laquelle il n\u2019adopte aucune position sur certaines des questions soulev\u00e9es dans l\u2019action, dont celle de savoir si la plainte de Mme Wirth se rapporte \u00e0 la prestation de services au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP;\nd. la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 une demande de la Commission pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vue d\u2019obtenir l\u2019autorisation d\u2019intervenir dans l\u2019action, mais elle a laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser une nouvelle demande \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 un appel interjet\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cette ordonnance;\ne. la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la NCSL l\u2019autorisation de d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate en jugement sommaire sur la question des \u00ab services \u00bb, et a fix\u00e9 des d\u00e9lais pour que (i) la NCSL remette un avis de requ\u00eate et un affidavit au PGC (30 novembre 2016), (ii) le PGC indique s\u2019il se prononcera sur la requ\u00eate (15 d\u00e9cembre 2016) et (iii) la NCSL d\u00e9pose son dossier de requ\u00eate en jugement sommaire (31 janvier 2017);\nf. la NCSL a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis de requ\u00eate en jugement sommaire, sollicitant une d\u00e9claration portant que les \u00e9lections coutumi\u00e8res de la NCSL pour les postes de chef et de conseillers ne sont pas des \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP.\nLa position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[14] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que les questions soumises au Tribunal seront mieux r\u00e9gl\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, pour que l\u2019on puisse d\u00e9terminer convenablement l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Loi et la d\u00e9finition du terme \u00ab services \u00bb. De plus, les coutumes \u00e9lectorales et le droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale sont d\u2019importantes questions \u00e0 examiner.\n[15] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plaignante ne subira aucun pr\u00e9judice et que, s\u2019il y a pr\u00e9judice, celui\u2011ci pourrait \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9 par une ordonnance d\u2019indemnisation. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ajoute qu\u2019elle ne devrait pas avoir \u00e0 supporter des d\u00e9pens substantiels pour une audience compl\u00e8te sur les droits relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale des Autochtones et que l\u2019affaire port\u00e9e devant le Tribunal n\u2019est pas pr\u00eate pour une audience.\n[16] L\u2019intim\u00e9e se fonde sur la d\u00e9cision Renaud, Sutton et Morigeau c. Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada, 2013 TCDP 30 (\u00ab Renaud \u00bb), dans laquelle le Tribunal a ajourn\u00e9 l\u2019affaire dont il \u00e9tait saisi.\nLa position de la Commission\n[17] La Commission soutient que le Tribunal devrait tenir une audience, car l\u2019article 48.9(1) dispose que :\n48.9(1) L\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique.\n[18] La Commission fait valoir que ce n\u2019est que dans des circonstances exceptionnelles qu\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019ajourner une affaire, que les politiques et les proc\u00e9dures du Tribunal conviennent mieux \u00e0 une personne, et qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 l\u2019existence d\u2019aucune circonstance exceptionnelle.\n[19] La Commission conteste \u00e9galement l\u2019ajournement relatif \u00e0 la question des services, en ce sens que ni la plaignante ni la Commission n\u2019\u00e9taient parties devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et que le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada ne se pronon\u00e7ait pas sur cette question.\n[20] La Commission se fonde dans une large mesure sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Agence des services frontaliers) c. C.B. Powell Limited, 2010 CAF 61, au paragraphe 33 :\nPartout au Canada, les cours de justice ont reconnu et appliqu\u00e9 rigoureusement le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de non\u2011ing\u00e9rence dans les proc\u00e9dures administratives, comme l\u2019illustre la port\u00e9e \u00e9troite de l\u2019exception relative aux \u00ab circonstances exceptionnelles \u00bb. [\u2026] Qu\u2019il suffise de dire qu\u2019il ressort des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents que tr\u00e8s peu de circonstances peuvent \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es d\u2019\u00ab exceptionnelles \u00bb et que le crit\u00e8re minimal permettant de qualifier des circonstances d\u2019exceptionnelles est \u00e9lev\u00e9 [\u2026]. Les pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale ou de l\u2019existence d\u2019un parti pris, de l\u2019existence d\u2019une question juridique ou constitutionnelle importante ou du fait que les toutes les parties ont accept\u00e9 un recours anticip\u00e9 aux tribunaux ne constituent pas des circonstances exceptionnelles permettant aux parties de contourner le processus administratif d\u00e8s lors que ce processus permet de soulever des questions et pr\u00e9voit des r\u00e9parations efficaces [\u2026]. Ainsi que je le d\u00e9montrerai sous peu, l\u2019existence de ce qu\u2019il est convenu d\u2019appeler des questions de comp\u00e9tence ne constitue pas une circonstance exceptionnelle justifiant un recours anticip\u00e9 aux tribunaux.\nDe plus, \u00e0 la page 19 de ses observations, la Commission se fonde sur les passages suivants de la d\u00e9cision Nipisihkopahk Education Authority de la nation Crie de Samson c. Canada (P.G.), 2004 CF 1314, rendue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, aux paragraphes 4 \u00e0 6 et 8 \u00e0 10 :\n[4] [\u2026] il n\u2019y a aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve dans les pr\u00e9sents dossiers que les demanderesses ont subi ou subiront un quelconque pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9sultant des instances introduites devant la Commission ou le Tribunal. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, les demanderesses n\u2019ont pas, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant, re\u00e7u l\u2019ordre de faire quoi que ce soit, encore moins quelque chose qu\u2019elles ne veulent pas faire et elles n\u2019ont pas re\u00e7u l\u2019ordre de ne pas faire ou n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9es de faire quoi que ce soit qu\u2019elles croient avoir le droit de faire.\n[5] Elles pr\u00e9tendent qu\u2019elles ne sont pas soumises \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, ni au Tribunal. La question n\u2019a cependant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e dans un sens ou dans l\u2019autre. Les demanderesses se sont simplement vu donner l\u2019occasion de se d\u00e9fendre et de faire valoir leur position constitutionnelle devant le Tribunal, lequel est l\u2019organisme comp\u00e9tent pour trancher la question.\n[6] Il ne s\u2019agit l\u00e0 aucunement d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice. Si le Tribunal est d\u2019accord avec les demanderesses, l\u2019affaire se terminera l\u00e0. M\u00eame si le Tribunal n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord et rend une d\u00e9cision qui leur est d\u00e9favorable, elles n\u2019auront encore subi aucun tort tant et aussi longtemps que le Tribunal, apr\u00e8s un examen exhaustif, n\u2019aura pas d\u00e9livrer une ordonnance contre les demanderesses. Selon moi, il y aura assez de temps pour d\u00e9cider si la position constitutionnelle et l\u2019argument des demanderesses justifient que l\u2019on cherche \u00e0 obtenir le sursis de l\u2019ordonnance d\u00e9finitive du Tribunal.\n[\u2026]\n[8] [\u2026] les demanderesses, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, ont subi et ne subiront pas plus d\u2019inconv\u00e9nient que l\u2019inconv\u00e9nient relativement mineur d\u2019avoir l\u2019occasion de plaider leur cause devant un organisme comp\u00e9tent. [\u2026]\n[9] D\u2019autre part, les plaignantes ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9es de voir leurs plaintes retard\u00e9es pour cette m\u00eame p\u00e9riode de cinq ans et le temps s\u2019\u00e9coule. Toute enqu\u00eate de la part du Tribunal deviendra moins efficace car le temps entre les \u00e9v\u00e9nements faisant l\u2019objet des plaintes et la suspension de l\u2019enqu\u00eate s\u2019allonge. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une v\u00e9rit\u00e9 absolue. Justice diff\u00e9r\u00e9e est justice refus\u00e9e. Les plaignantes ont subi un grave inconv\u00e9nient du fait que leur audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 retard\u00e9e presque ind\u00e9finiment.\n[10] Il y a \u00e9galement, et cela est un aspect de ce que j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 affirm\u00e9, un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important \u00e0 servir et \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger en faisant en sorte que les plaintes devant le Tribunal soient trait\u00e9es rapidement.\n[21] L\u2019intim\u00e9e r\u00e9pond \u00e0 la Commission au sujet de sa position en affirmant que le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada est en fait le v\u00e9ritable d\u00e9fendeur dans l\u2019instance soumise \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, que le Tribunal n\u2019est pas le forum appropri\u00e9 et que le Tribunal n\u2019est pas en mesure de tenir son audience dans les circonstances actuelles. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est la mieux plac\u00e9e pour traiter cette affaire.\n[22] Depuis le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des observations des parties, le juge Phelan, de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, a rendu le 2 mars 2017 une ordonnance portant notamment ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nVU la requ\u00eate que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne [la Commission] a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par \u00e9crit en vue d\u2019obtenir le statut d\u2019intervenante dans le cadre d\u2019une requ\u00eate en suspension et, au cas o\u00f9 il ne serait pas fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, de prendre part \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente action sans frais;\nVU que la partie d\u00e9fenderesse a avis\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019adoptait aucune position \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette requ\u00eate;\nVU que la demanderesse ne s\u2019oppose pas en ce qui a trait au statut d\u2019intervenante, mais s\u2019oppose \u00e0 une suspension et \u00e0 la demande de la Commission de prendre part \u00e0 l\u2019action sans frais;\nVU que les parties conviennent que la Commission n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence sur la question en litige, mais pour des raisons diff\u00e9rentes;\nVU que les parties ont tent\u00e9 de trouver un moyen efficace de r\u00e9gler la question de droit en litige, la plaignante ayant d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en jugement sommaire;\nCONSID\u00c9RANT que, sans la participation de la Commission, il n\u2019y aurait aucune opposition efficace;\nCONSID\u00c9RANT que le r\u00f4le que joue la Commission dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire s\u2019apparente davantage \u00e0 celui d\u2019une intervenante dans un litige qu\u2019\u00e0 celui d\u2019une intervenante pour des raisons d\u2019ordre public;\nJUGEANT qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice d\u2019accorder le statut d\u2019intervenante;\nLA COUR ORDONNE :\n1. l\u2019intitul\u00e9 de la cause est modifi\u00e9 afin d\u2019ajouter la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne en tant qu\u2019intervenante;\n2. la Commission est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 intervenir dans la pr\u00e9sente instance afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en jugement sommaire de la plaignante comme si elle \u00e9tait une partie, ce qui comprend notamment le droit de signifier et de se voir signifier des documents, de d\u00e9poser des m\u00e9moires, de produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, de contre\u2011interroger et d\u2019\u00eatre contre\u2011interrog\u00e9e, de plaider et d\u2019interjeter appel.\n[\u2026]\nLa requ\u00eate en jugement sommaire de la NCSL a \u00e9t\u00e9 instruite devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale les 3 et 4 octobre 2017. La d\u00e9cision n\u2019a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue.\nAnalyse\n[23] La position de la Commission visant \u00e0 rejeter la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e serait normalement convaincante. Toutefois, dans les pr\u00e9sentes circonstances, il y a un certain nombre de questions qui font contrepoids.\n[24] Premi\u00e8rement, la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne consiste pas simplement \u00e0 contester la question de savoir si ses \u00e9lections coutumi\u00e8res sont des [traduction] \u00ab services au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi \u00bb. Elle conteste \u00e9galement la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de la Loi, revendiquant un droit ancestral \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale garanti \u00e0 l\u2019article 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982. C\u2019est donc dire qu\u2019une conclusion quant \u00e0 l\u2019existence de discrimination dans les circonstances actuelles, en supposant que la plainte est fond\u00e9e, ne r\u00e9glerait pas le pr\u00e9sent litige. Le Tribunal doit garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que l\u2019exigence l\u00e9gale quant \u00e0 la tenue d\u2019une audience \u00ab rapide \u00bb doit \u00eatre temp\u00e9r\u00e9e dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur des parties et, dans les circonstances actuelles, une audience du Tribunal sur l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi serait de nature \u00e0 s\u00e9parer et \u00e0 compliquer l\u2019instance.\n[25] Deuxi\u00e8mement, on pourrait dire que l\u2019ordonnance rendue par le juge Phelan le 2 mars 2017 a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission le droit de faire plus que simplement contester sur le fond la requ\u00eate en jugement sommaire.\n[traduction] 2. la Commission est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 intervenir dans la pr\u00e9sente instance afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en jugement sommaire de la plaignante comme si elle \u00e9tait une partie, ce qui comprend notamment, le droit de signifier et de se voir signifier des documents, de d\u00e9poser des m\u00e9moires, de produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, de contre\u2011interroger et d\u2019\u00eatre contre\u2011interrog\u00e9e, de plaider et d\u2019interjeter appel.\n[26] Ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de donne \u00e0 penser que la Commission pourrait aussi contester le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter une telle requ\u00eate dans les circonstances, car celle\u2011ci pourrait court\u2011circuiter l\u2019application du r\u00e9gime administratif. L\u2019ordonnance du 2 mars 2017, par laquelle le juge Phelan a ajout\u00e9 la Commission \u00e0 titre de partie afin de veiller \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il y ait une repr\u00e9sentation et des arguments pour traiter la question relative aux services, n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue au moment de la pr\u00e9sentation des observations dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en ajournement.\n[27] Troisi\u00e8mement, il est admis que, m\u00eame si Mme Wirth ne participe pas \u00e0 l\u2019instance engag\u00e9e devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u2013 et il ressort du dossier qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 involontairement exclue de l\u2019action \u2013 les observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en r\u00e9ponse par l\u2019intim\u00e9e donnent \u00e0 penser que la plaignante a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas participer en raison d\u2019un manque de ressources, de l\u2019absence d\u2019un avocat pour assurer sa d\u00e9fense et d\u2019un manque de compr\u00e9hension des questions constitutionnelles soulev\u00e9es dans l\u2019action. Cela suscite bel et bien des probl\u00e8mes d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice, mais ces probl\u00e8mes sont abord\u00e9s \u00e0 la cour par la Commission dans le cadre de l\u2019examen de la question des \u00ab services \u00bb devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[28] C\u2019est donc dire que le pr\u00e9ambule et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments fondamentaux de l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale donnent \u00e0 penser que la Commission a obtenu le statut d\u2019intervenante pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour qu\u2019il y ait une opposition efficace. Compte tenu de tous les facteurs, la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e en vue d\u2019obtenir un ajournement en attendant que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale se prononce sur sa requ\u00eate en jugement sommaire ne semble pas d\u00e9raisonnable. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019affaire port\u00e9e devant le Tribunal est ajourn\u00e9e en attendant l\u2019issue de la requ\u00eate en jugement sommaire qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale au sujet de la question des \u00ab services \u00bb (article 5), apr\u00e8s quoi l\u2019affaire sera port\u00e9e de nouveau devant le Tribunal.\nSign\u00e9e par\nGeorge E.

Introduction\n[1] Madame Nahame O\u2019Bomsawin a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre le Conseil des Ab\u00e9nakis d\u2019Odanak (\u00ab le Conseil \u00bb) aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (\u00ab la Commission \u00bb) le 15 avril 2013. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019enqu\u00eate, la Commission a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 cette plainte au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (\u00ab le Tribunal \u00bb) pour instruction le 15 septembre 2015.\n[2] Selon l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP), Mme O\u2019Bomsawin pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elle a subi une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille dans le cadre d\u2019un processus d\u2019embauche. Elle affirme qu\u2019elle s\u2019est vue refuser le poste pour lequel elle postulait \u2014 un poste de contractuel \u2014 Charg\u00e9e de projet (Coordonnatrice en agr\u00e9ment) au Centre de sant\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak. Mme O\u2019Bomsawin pr\u00e9tend que le Conseil aurait choisi de mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 sa candidature car elle est la fille du directeur de ce centre de sant\u00e9. Le Conseil pr\u00e9tend que la candidate retenue \u00e9tait plus motiv\u00e9e que Mme O\u2019Bomsawin pour l\u2019emploi et que ce facteur \u00e9tait d\u00e9terminant dans leur choix.\n[3] Une audience a eu lieu du 20 au 21 d\u00e9cembre 2016 \u00e0 Sorel-Tracy, Qu\u00e9bec. La plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par avocats \u00e0 l\u2019audience. La Commission a choisi de ne pas compara\u00eetre \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[4] Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu et consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la preuve et les arguments des parties, je juge que la plainte de Mme O\u2019Bomsawin est fond\u00e9e pour les raisons qui suivent.\nII. Les faits\nA. Les Ab\u00e9nakis d\u2019Odanak\n[5] Mme O\u2019Bomsawin est membre de la nation des Ab\u00e9nakis du territoire autochtone d\u2019Odanak. N\u00e9e \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, elle a grandi au sein de la communaut\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak. Elle a quitt\u00e9 la communaut\u00e9 vers l\u2019\u00e2ge de 18 ans pour compl\u00e9ter des \u00e9tudes \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al mais y retournait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. Ses parents habitent toujours dans la communaut\u00e9.\n[6] La communaut\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak se situe sur la rive est de la rivi\u00e8re Saint-Fran\u00e7ois, \u00e0 32 km \u00e0 l\u2019est de Sorel, dans la municipalit\u00e9 r\u00e9gionale de comt\u00e9 de Nicolet-Yamaska dans la r\u00e9gion administrative du Centre-du-Qu\u00e9bec.\n[7] De nombreux membres de la communaut\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak portent les m\u00eames noms de famille sans qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait de lien de parent\u00e9 entre eux. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce Mme O\u2019Bomsawin et le chef actuel du Conseil, M. Rick O\u2019Bomsawin, portent le m\u00eame nom de famille mais ne sont pas li\u00e9s entre eux.\nB. Les qualifications de Mme O\u2019Bomsawin\n[8] Mme O\u2019Bomsawin est la fille du directeur du Centre de sant\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak, M. Deny O\u2019Bomsawin. Elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler au Centre de sant\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak en 2004, en tant que responsable d\u2019un projet d\u2019organisation de colloque. Elle avait alors 18 ans \u2013 il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un emploi \u00e9tudiant. Mme O\u2019Bomsawin semble s\u2019\u00eatre bien acquitt\u00e9e de ses t\u00e2ches. Il n\u2019y a pas eu de plaintes et elle a termin\u00e9 son mandat.\n[9] De 2005 \u00e0 2008, elle a compl\u00e9t\u00e9 ses \u00e9tudes \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al et y a obtenu son baccalaur\u00e9at en science de la communication. De 2008 \u00e0 2009, Mme O\u2019Bomsawin a compl\u00e9t\u00e9 un dipl\u00f4me d\u2019\u00e9tude sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e en gestion.\n[10] En ao\u00fbt 2009, elle applique et obtient le poste de Coordonnatrice du programme national de formation des contr\u00f4leurs communautaires de la qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019eau au Centre de sant\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak. Elle obtient ce poste sans avoir fait d\u2019entrevue. Le mandat d\u00e9bute en ao\u00fbt 2009 et se termine en janvier 2011 avec la fin du financement du programme. Il n\u2019y a pas eu de plaintes au cours de ce mandat.\n[11] En f\u00e9vrier 2011, Mme O\u2019Bomsawin applique et obtient le poste d\u2019Organisatrice communautaire au Programme Services \u00e0 l\u2019Enfance et \u00e0 la famille (SEFPN) au Grand Conseil de la Nation Wabanaki. Elle a pass\u00e9 une entrevue pour obtenir ce poste.\n[12] En octobre 2011, Mme O\u2019Bomsawin d\u00e9missionne de son poste au Grand Conseil de Wabanaki. En interrogatoire et en contre-interrogatoire, elle explique qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas heureuse dans ce poste et qu\u2019elle pense avoir d\u2019autres possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emplois, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al ou au Conseil.\n[13] En f\u00e9vrier 2012, elle obtient un mandat de trois mois \u00e0 titre de Charg\u00e9e de projet \u2013 programme de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 alimentaire au Centre de sant\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak. Mme O\u2019Bomsawin obtient ce mandat apr\u00e8s avoir envoy\u00e9 son CV et sans avoir \u00e0 passer d\u2019entrevue. Le mandat se termine en mai 2012.\nC. Le Poste contractuel \u2013 Charg\u00e9(e) de projet (Coordonnateur (trice) en agr\u00e9ment)\n[14] Le 9 juillet 2012, le Conseil vote une r\u00e9solution et mandate le Centre de sant\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak de proc\u00e9der avec le processus d\u2019agr\u00e9ment du Centre de Sant\u00e9. Le directeur du Centre de sant\u00e9 r\u00e9dige alors un avis de concours pour le poste de coordonnateur en agr\u00e9ment et proc\u00e8de \u00e0 son affichage. Mme O\u2019Bomsawin, apr\u00e8s avoir vu l\u2019avis de concours affich\u00e9 au Centre de sant\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak, applique le 16 juillet 2012 pour le Poste contractuel \u2013 Charg\u00e9(e) de projet (Coordonnateur (trice) en agr\u00e9ment) (\u00ab Poste \u00bb).\n[15] Il est ressorti lors de l\u2019audience que l\u2019avis de concours a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 deux fois. La deuxi\u00e8me fois, la date de cl\u00f4ture du concours \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rente que la premi\u00e8re fois. Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 au Tribunal quelle \u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re date de cl\u00f4ture \u2013 elle \u00e9tait plus tard que la date finalement affich\u00e9e \u2014 mais les parties s\u2019entendent pour conclure que la date officielle de cl\u00f4ture du concours fut le 26 juillet 2012.\n[16] La description de t\u00e2ches du Poste et les exigences requises sont demeur\u00e9es les m\u00eames sur les deux avis de concours. Selon l\u2019avis de concours, les principales responsabilit\u00e9s de ce poste consistaient \u00e0 \u00e9laborer un cadre conceptuel, superviser le processus d\u2019agr\u00e9ment, assurer la liaison entre le personnel et Agr\u00e9ment Canada, coordonner et favoriser l\u2019auto-\u00e9valuation, s\u2019occuper des d\u00e9tails logistiques des visites d\u2019agr\u00e9ment et participer aux rencontres de r\u00e9seautage r\u00e9gionales et de formation en vue de pr\u00e9parer la visite d\u2019agr\u00e9ment.\n[17] Les exigences requises se lisaient comme suit :\nFormation universitaire compl\u00e9t\u00e9e en gestion de projet ou en gestion\nExp\u00e9rience comme charg\u00e9e de projet\nAptitudes en communications interpersonnelles\nHabilet\u00e9s \u00e0 bien travailler sous pression\nExcellentes aptitudes \u00e0 communiquer oralement ou par \u00e9crit\nExp\u00e9rience avec les organismes gouvernementaux\nConnaissance du milieu\nBilingue (fran\u00e7ais \u2013 anglais)\n[18] Le poste affich\u00e9 \u00e9tait financ\u00e9 par Sant\u00e9 Canada, de qui relevait le certificat d\u2019agr\u00e9ment recherch\u00e9 par le Centre de sant\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak. Sant\u00e9 Canada n\u2019avait \u00e9mis aucune exigence particuli\u00e8re quant \u00e0 ce poste.\nD. Le comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection\n[19] Au d\u00e9but du mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2012, quelques jours apr\u00e8s la fin du concours, le chef du Conseil, de qui rel\u00e8ve le Centre de sant\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak, demande au consultant en ressources humaines Robert St-Ours, qui travaille pour le Conseil, de s\u2019occuper du processus quant \u00e0 cet avis de concours. Il ne semble pas satisfait du processus d\u00e9j\u00e0 mis en place par le directeur du Centre, M. Deny O\u2019Bomsawin, p\u00e8re de la plaignante.\n[20] M. St-Ours rencontre alors M. Deny O\u2019Bomsawin, directeur du Centre de sant\u00e9 et lui propose de mettre en place un processus avec entrevues. Ce dernier est d\u2019accord. Un comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection est mis en place. C\u2019est ce comit\u00e9 qui proc\u00e9dera aux entrevues.\n[21] Le comit\u00e9 est form\u00e9 de M. St-Ours, alors consultant en ressources humaines pour le Conseil et de M. Daniel G. Nolett, directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Conseil. Le directeur du Centre de sant\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak, M. Deny O\u2019Bomsawin, ne si\u00e8ge pas au comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection. Le chef de bande, Rick O\u2019Bomsawin, non plus.\nE. L\u2019\u00e9valuation des candidats\n[22] En ao\u00fbt 2012, apr\u00e8s la date de cl\u00f4ture de l\u2019avis de concours, trois personnes ont appliqu\u00e9 pour le poste, soit Mme O\u2019Bomsawin et deux autres candidats. Les entrevues pour le poste auront lieu d\u00e9but octobre, et pour Mme O\u2019Bomsawin plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le 1er octobre 2012. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, un des candidats s\u2019est d\u00e9sist\u00e9. Il n\u2019y a plus que deux candidates en liste : Mme O\u2019Bomsawin et l\u2019autre candidate.\n[23] Il s\u2019est donc pass\u00e9 plus de deux mois entre la fin de l\u2019avis de concours (26 juillet 2012) et le d\u00e9but des entrevues (1er octobre 2012). Pendant ce temps, aucune modification n\u2019est apport\u00e9e au concours et aucun r\u00e9affichage du poste avec de nouvelles descriptions de t\u00e2ches, responsabilit\u00e9s ou exp\u00e9riences requises n\u2019est publi\u00e9.\n[24] Les membres du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection ont une grille d\u2019\u00e9valuation pour proc\u00e9der aux entrevues. Cette grille contient les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants d\u2019\u00e9valuation avec la pond\u00e9ration suivante :\nFormation \u2013 25 points\nExp\u00e9rience en gestion de projets \u2013 20 points\nQualit\u00e9 des r\u00e9ponses \u2013 15 points\nConnaissance des programmes \u2013 10 points\nAnglais \u2013 10 points\n\u00c9valuation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u2013 10 points\nMaturit\u00e9 (enthousiasme, motivation et exp\u00e9rience de vie) \u2013 10 points\nTotal : 100 points\n[25] Mme O\u2019Bomsawin passe en entrevue le 1er octobre 2012. L\u2019entrevue dure environ quarante-cinq minutes. Selon elle, l\u2019entrevue s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e normalement. Mme O\u2019Bomsawin indique qu\u2019elle s\u2019est fait poser des questions standard. Il s\u2019agit de la deuxi\u00e8me entrevue de travail pour elle. Sur ses aptitudes de communications, Mme O\u2019Bomsawin n\u2019a pas eu \u00e0 donner des exemples d\u2019\u00e9crits.\n[26] MM St-Ours et Nolett, selon leur t\u00e9moignage, indiquent \u00e9galement que Mme O\u2019Bomsawin a eu une entrevue correcte mais qu\u2019elle semblait manquer de motivation. La grille d\u2019\u00e9valuation est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e lors de l\u2019audience et indique que Mme O\u2019Bomsawin a re\u00e7u un pointage de 78 de la part de M. Nolett et de 83 de la part de M. St\u2011Ours. L\u2019autre candidate a quant \u00e0 elle re\u00e7u un pointage de 74 de la part de M. Nollett et de 77 de la part de M. St-Ours.\n[27] Malgr\u00e9 le fait que l\u2019avis de concours indique qu\u2019une formation universitaire soit n\u00e9cessaire et que cet avis n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9, il est octroy\u00e9 25 et 23 points aux deux candidates par les deux membres du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re. Les pointages sont identiques et pourtant seule Mme O\u2019Bomsawin a une formation universitaire au niveau baccalaur\u00e9at compl\u00e9t\u00e9e.\n[28] Les membres du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection ont inform\u00e9 le Tribunal, lors de leur t\u00e9moignage, qu\u2019une telle formation \u00e9tait \u00e0 leur avis non n\u00e9cessaire. Selon eux, leurs avis \u00e9taient bas\u00e9s sur des informations transmises par Sant\u00e9 Canada qu\u2019une formation de niveau coll\u00e9gial et une exp\u00e9rience professionnelle pertinente \u00e0 titre de charg\u00e9 de projet \u00e9taient suffisantes pour le poste. C\u2019est pourquoi ils ont mis le m\u00eame pointage aux deux candidates, m\u00eame s\u2019il appert des CV d\u00e9pos\u00e9s que l\u2019une avait clairement une formation universitaire compl\u00e9t\u00e9e et l\u2019autre pas.\n[29] Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que cette opinion de la part des membres du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection \u00e9tait bas\u00e9e sur une exigence de Sant\u00e9 Canada, qui finan\u00e7ait ce projet. De toute fa\u00e7on, malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019il se soit \u00e9coul\u00e9 plus de deux mois entre la date de cl\u00f4ture de l\u2019avis de concours et le d\u00e9but des entrevues, l\u2019avis de concours n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 pour refl\u00e9ter l\u2019opinion des membres du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection et ainsi indiquer \u00e0 tout candidat potentiel la r\u00e9elle formation requise pour ce poste selon les membres du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection.\n[30] Un r\u00e9affichage du poste avec des qualifications diff\u00e9rentes aurait peut-\u00eatre permis d\u2019avoir plus de candidats pour le poste en question. Ainsi, \u00e0 la date des entrevues, les candidates qui avaient postul\u00e9 l\u2019avaient fait en fonction d\u2019un avis de concours qui indiquait qu\u2019une formation universitaire \u00e9tait requise.\n[31] De plus, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019exp\u00e9rience en gestion de projets de la plaignante \u00e9tait nettement plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e que celle de l\u2019autre candidate, le tout tel que la grille d\u2019\u00e9valuation elle-m\u00eame le refl\u00e8te avec un pointage de 15 pour Mme O\u2019Bomsawin et de 5 pour l\u2019autre candidate.\n[32] Mme O\u2019Bomsawin a aussi obtenu un pointage plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour ses connaissances des programmes. M. Nolett lui a donn\u00e9 un pointage de 9 sur 10 et M. St-Ours de 5 sur 10. L\u2019autre candidate a obtenu 3 et 2 sur 10 respectivement.\n[33] \u00c0 la lecture des grilles d\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u00e9pos\u00e9es, l\u2019autre candidate a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 surpasser Mme O\u2019Bomsawin dans la qualit\u00e9 de ses r\u00e9ponses et sa motivation. L\u2019autre candidate a eu 15 sur 15 des deux membres du comit\u00e9 pour la qualit\u00e9 de ces r\u00e9ponses, compar\u00e9 \u00e0 un pointage de 12 et 13 pour Mme O\u2019Bomsawin. Quant \u00e0 la motivation, l\u2019autre candidate a r\u00e9ussi un score parfait de 10 sur 10 des deux membres du comit\u00e9, mais Mme O\u2019Bomsawin a seulement eu 4 et 5 respectivement.\nF. La d\u00e9cision du Conseil\n[34] Le 29 octobre 2012, le Conseil se r\u00e9unit pour prendre une d\u00e9cision sur le Poste. Lors de la r\u00e9union du Conseil, les grilles d\u2019\u00e9valuation ne sont pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9es. M. St-Ours informe verbalement les membres du Conseil des pointages et fait une recommandation. Malgr\u00e9 un pointage plus bas de la part des deux membres du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection, il recommande l\u2019autre candidate.\n[35] Lors de leurs t\u00e9moignages MM St-Ours et Nolett indiquent que leur recommandation conjointe pour retenir l\u2019autre candidate, malgr\u00e9 un pointage dans la grille d\u2019\u00e9valuation plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e pour Mme O\u2019Bomsawin, tient au fait que cette derni\u00e8re semblait plus motiv\u00e9e par le poste. Il est r\u00e9solu par le Conseil d\u2019engager l\u2019autre candidate pour le Poste.\n[36] Il est tr\u00e8s rare que le Conseil ait \u00e0 choisir le candidat pour des emplois de ce genre. Habituellement ce genre de d\u00e9cision est pris par la direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, sans l\u2019intervention du Conseil.\n[37] Le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Conseil, M. Nolett, confirme dans son t\u00e9moignage que cette situation est rare et unique. Son unicit\u00e9 tient dans le fait, selon les t\u00e9moignages entendus, que l\u2019une des candidates est la fille du directeur du Centre de sant\u00e9.\n[38] Mme Claire O\u2019Bomsawin, membre du Conseil depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, qui a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 lors de l\u2019audience, indique \u00e9galement que cette proc\u00e9dure est inhabituelle et que l\u2019on a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 ainsi parce que \u00ab Nahame est la fille de Deny \u00bb.\n[39] Mme O\u2019Bomsawin est inform\u00e9e le 31 octobre de la d\u00e9cision du Conseil et demande une rencontre avec MM St-Ours et Nolett. Quelques jours plus tard, le 2 novembre 2012, elle rencontre les deux membres du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection. MM St-Ours et Nolett r\u00e9p\u00e8tent \u00e0 Mme O\u2019Bomsawin qu\u2019il s\u2019agit du choix du Conseil. M. St-Ours lors de cette rencontre confirme avoir mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme O\u2019Bomsawin que les \u00ab d\u00e9cisions du Conseil peuvent parfois faire des victimes\u2026 \u00bb.\n[40] M. Nolett confirme dans son t\u00e9moignage que lors de cette rencontre, il a dit \u00e0 Mme O\u2019Bomsawin que \u00e7a faisait \u00ab trois contrats qu\u2019elle avait au Centre de sant\u00e9 sans entrevue et que \u00e7a faisait jaser dans la communaut\u00e9\u2026 \u00bb. Les deux membres du comit\u00e9 confirment \u00e9galement lors de leur t\u00e9moignage, de m\u00eame que Mme O\u2019Bomsawin, que le crit\u00e8re de motivation soulev\u00e9 par le Conseil comme \u00e9tant un crit\u00e8re important pour le choix du candidat, n\u2019a pas du tout \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9 lors de cette rencontre.\nIII. Le cadre juridique\n[41] Au sens de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP, le refus d\u2019employer un individu fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite constitue un acte discriminatoire. La situation de famille constitue un motif de distinction illicite en vertu de l\u2019article 3 de la m\u00eame loi.\n[42] Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintes fois d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par les diff\u00e9rents Tribunaux et par ce Tribunal en particulier qu\u2019il incombe au plaignant d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Selon l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, Ontario (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne) c. Simpson-Sears Ltd., 1985 CanLII 18 (CSC), paragraphe 28, la preuve prima facie est la preuve suffisante jusqu\u2019\u00e0 preuve du contraire qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[43] Dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, Mme O\u2019Bomsawin doit, selon l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP, d\u00e9montrer sur preuve fond\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s : (1) qu\u2019elle poss\u00e8de une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e contre la discrimination; (2) que le Conseil a refus\u00e9 de l\u2019employer; (3) que la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e constitue un facteur qui a jou\u00e9 dans le refus de l\u2019employer (Moore c. British Columbia (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61, par. 33 (\u00ab Moore \u00bb); Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier A\u00e9ronautique Centre de formation), 2015 CSC 39, par. 56 et 64 [\u00ab Bombardier \u00bb]).\n[44] C\u2019est ainsi que les juges de la Cour supr\u00eame s\u2019exprimaient dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bombardier pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 :\n[63] Enfin, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat plus r\u00e9cent Moore, la juge Abella, au nom de notre Cour, s\u2019est exprim\u00e9e en ces termes :\n. . . pour \u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de discrimination, les plaignants doivent d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019ils poss\u00e8dent une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par le Code contre la discrimination, qu\u2019ils ont subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable relativement au service concern\u00e9 et que la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable. Une fois la discrimination \u00e9tablie \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a alors le fardeau de justifier la conduite ou la pratique suivant le r\u00e9gime d\u2019exemptions pr\u00e9vu par les lois sur les droits de la personne. Si la conduite ou pratique ne peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e, le tribunal conclura \u00e0 l\u2019existence de la discrimination. [Nous soulignons; par. 33.]\n[45] Dans le cas qui nous pr\u00e9occupe, la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e a trait \u00e0 l\u2019emploi. La plaignante all\u00e8gue en effet s\u2019\u00eatre vu refuser un emploi sur la base d\u2019un motif de discrimination, soit celui de situation de famille.\n[46] En mati\u00e8re d\u2019embauche, il semble y avoir un consensus entre les parties aux pr\u00e9sentes que les crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis dans la d\u00e9cision Shakes c Rex Pak Ltd., (1982), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001, paragraphe 8918 (commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate de l\u2019Ontario) (\u00ab Shakes \u00bb) s\u2019appliquent.\n[47] Ces crit\u00e8res sont qu\u2019une preuve prima facie est \u00e9tablie lorsque:\nLa plaignante avait les comp\u00e9tences requises pour l\u2019emploi;\nLa plaignante n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e;\nUne personne qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mieux qualifi\u00e9e, mais qui ne poss\u00e9dait pas le trait distinctif \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la plainte, a subs\u00e9quemment obtenu le poste.\n[48] Quoique les parties semblent s\u2019entendre sur ces crit\u00e8res, le Tribunal d\u00e9sire ici ajouter que les crit\u00e8res \u00e9labor\u00e9s dans Shakes servent uniquement de guide et que ces crit\u00e8res ne doivent pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s d\u2019une mani\u00e8re rigide ou arbitraire. Ainsi les circonstances dans chaque cas doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es afin de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019application de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre de ces crit\u00e8res, en tout ou en partie, est opportune (voir Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204, par. 18; Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CAF 154, par. 25-30). Bressette c Conseil de bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle et de Stony Point, 2004, TCDP 40 (\u00ab Bressette \u00bb), ainsi que Premakumar c. Air Canada, (2002), C.H.R.D., paragraphe 77 (T.C.D.P.) (QL).\n[49] Je suis d\u2019avis que dans la situation qui nous pr\u00e9occupe, les crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis tant dans Shakes que dans Moore peuvent s\u2019appliquer. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, les crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Shakes aident \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le motif de distinction illicite \u00e9tait un facteur dans le traitement d\u00e9favorable all\u00e9gu\u00e9.\n[50] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une plainte, un intim\u00e9 peut soumettre une preuve pour montrer que ses actions n\u2019\u00e9taient pas discriminatoires ou se pr\u00e9valoir d\u2019un moyen de d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vu par la LCDP qui justifie la discrimination. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Conseil a tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer que ses actions n\u2019\u00e9taient pas discriminatoires et que l\u2019embauche d\u2019une autre candidate reposait plut\u00f4t sur les comp\u00e9tences de cette autre candidate. Il incombe alors \u00e0 Mme O\u2019Bomsawin de d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019explication du Conseil n\u2019est qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte de discrimination (voir Bressette pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par. 34).\n[51] De plus, il est important d\u2019ajouter qu\u2019il est rarement possible de d\u00e9montrer par une preuve directe qu\u2019il y a eu discrimination. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve directs de discrimination ou de l\u2019intention de discriminer pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de la LCDP (voir Bombardier, par. 40-41). La t\u00e2che du Tribunal consiste donc \u00ab \u2026\u00e0 tenir compte de toutes les circonstances et de tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il est possible de d\u00e9tecter de \u201csubtiles odeurs de discrimination\u201d \u00bb (voir Basi c. Cie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 1988 CanLII 108 (TCDP) (\u00ab Basi \u00bb); Tabor c. La Premi\u00e8re nation Millbrook, 2015 TDCP 9, par. 14).\n[52] De plus, tel qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, (1991) 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (CAF) (\u00ab Holden \u00bb), paragraphe 7, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires soient le seul motif des actes reproch\u00e9s pour que la plainte soit jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e. Il suffit que le motif de distinction illicite ait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019un des facteurs ayant contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019employeur (voir Bombardier, par. 44-52).\nIV. L\u2019analyse\nA. La preuve prima facie\n[53] Mme O\u2019Bomsawin pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9e pour le poste, qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e et que la personne embauch\u00e9e a obtenu le poste m\u00eame si elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas plus qualifi\u00e9e et parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas le motif de distinction illicite all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\n[54] Je suis d\u2019accord que la preuve prima facie de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\n[55] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les deux premiers \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore ne sont pas disput\u00e9s. Premi\u00e8rement, Mme O\u2019Bomsawin est la fille du directeur du Centre de sant\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak. La caract\u00e9ristique de situation de famille est pr\u00e9sente car le terme \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb inclut l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un membre de la famille en particulier (voir B. c. Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne), 2002 CSC 66, par. 39-41). Et dans une communaut\u00e9 autochtone tiss\u00e9e serr\u00e9e comme celle d\u2019Odanak, elle est encore plus ressentie. Deuxi\u00e8mement, il n\u2019y a pas de question que Mme O\u2019Bomsawin s\u2019est vue refuser le Poste avec le Centre de sant\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak.\n[56] En ce qui a trait au troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, je suis convaincue sur preuve fond\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s que la caract\u00e9ristique de la situation de la famille ait constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans le refus d\u2019employer Mme O\u2019Bomsawin. Elle poss\u00e9dait les qualifications requises, soit une formation universitaire de niveau baccalaur\u00e9at compl\u00e9t\u00e9e au moment de l\u2019entrevue. Elle avait de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience en gestion de projets et d\u00e9tenait \u00e9galement une formation universitaire \u00e0 cet effet. Mme O\u2019Bomsawin avait une certaine connaissance des programmes puisqu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 travaill\u00e9 au Centre de sant\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak. M. St-Ours lors de son t\u00e9moignage a m\u00eame reconnu \u00ab qu\u2019elle avait une connaissance des programmes de Sant\u00e9 Canada et qu\u2019elle avait une qualification particuli\u00e8re, plus que l\u2019autre candidate \u00bb. M. St-Ours, un peu plus loin dans son t\u00e9moignage va m\u00eame jusqu\u2019\u00e0 admettre que Mme O\u2019Bomsawin \u00e9tat \u00ab surqualifi\u00e9e \u00bb pour le poste.\n[57] Ses emplois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 accomplis sans qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait de plainte. Les t\u00e9moins entendus ont m\u00eame confirm\u00e9 durant leur t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pas de reproches \u00e0 faire \u00e0 Mme O\u2019Bomsawin quant au travail effectu\u00e9 dans le pass\u00e9.\n[58] M. Nolett a m\u00eame reconnu lui avoir fait parvenir une lettre de recommandation en mai 2012.\n[59] Mme O\u2019Bomsawin n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue pour le poste et celle qui l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mieux qualifi\u00e9e (je dirais m\u00eame moins \u2014 elle ne poss\u00e9dait pas une formation universitaire de niveau baccalaur\u00e9at compl\u00e9t\u00e9e au moment de l\u2019entrevue et n\u2019avait aucune exp\u00e9rience de gestion de projets) et ne poss\u00e9dait pas, en effet, le trait distinctif \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la plainte.\n[60] M. Nolett a indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal qu\u2019il \u00e9tait important de juger les candidats sur l\u2019ensemble de leurs comp\u00e9tences. Pourtant, il semblerait que la candidate choisie ait \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue sur l\u2019unique base du crit\u00e8re de motivation et non dans son ensemble, tel qu\u2019il appert des grilles de pointage soumises et des r\u00e9sultats pour les deux candidates, soit un r\u00e9sultat combin\u00e9 plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour Mme O\u2019Bomsawin que pour la candidate retenue, et de l\u2019aveu m\u00eame des t\u00e9moins au Tribunal.\n[61] Mme O\u2019Bomsawin s\u2019est vue refuser un emploi et la situation de famille a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans le choix effectu\u00e9 par le Conseil. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la situation de famille ait constitu\u00e9 le seul et unique facteur dans ce choix pour qu\u2019il y ait eu discrimination, il suffit que ce soit un des facteurs (arr\u00eat Holden, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9).\n[62] Une \u00ab subtile odeur de discrimination \u00bb (arr\u00eat Basi, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9) a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente tout au cours de l\u2019audience. Les t\u00e9moins ont fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait que dans le pass\u00e9 Mme O\u2019Bomsawin avait eu des emplois parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait la fille du directeur du Centre. Si dans le pass\u00e9 ce fut le cas, ce n\u2019est pas le pass\u00e9 qui est devant le Tribunal. Le fait qu\u2019il y ait peut-\u00eatre eu discrimination dans le pass\u00e9 et que Mme O\u2019Bomsawin ait obtenu des emplois parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait la fille du directeur du Centre \u2013 et je ne prends pas position ici car cela n\u2019\u00e9tait pas devant moi \u2013 ne donne pas la permission au Conseil de faire de la discrimination \u00e9galement, mais en sens inverse.\n[63] Au cours des diff\u00e9rents t\u00e9moignages, \u00e0 plusieurs reprises il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait mention que \u00ab \u00e7a jasait beaucoup dans la communaut\u00e9\u2026 \u00bb. \u00c7a jasait de quoi? Du fait que Mme O\u2019Bomsawin \u00e9tait la fille de Deny O\u2019Bomsawin. Est-ce que \u00e7a jasait de ses comp\u00e9tences? Non fut la r\u00e9ponse de M. St-Ours \u00e0 cette question.\n[64] M. Nolett et Mme Claire O\u2019Bomsawin ont \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il \u00e9tait rare que le Conseil ait \u00e0 trancher sur de tels contrats d\u2019emplois. \u00c0 la question \u00ab est-ce la premi\u00e8re fois que l\u2019on proc\u00e9dait ainsi? \u00bb, Mme Claire O\u2019Bomsawin, membre du Conseil depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, a r\u00e9pondu tout de go \u00ab oui, parce que c\u2019\u00e9tait la fille de Deny! \u00bb.\n[65] Finalement, lors de la rencontre de Mme O\u2019Bomsawin le 2 novembre 2012 avec les membres du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection, pour discuter de la d\u00e9cision prise par le Conseil quelques jours auparavant, il n\u2019est nullement question de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de motivation. Ni M. St-Ours ni M. Nolett ne mentionnent \u00e0 la plaignante que le facteur de motivation a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cisif dans la recommandation faite au Conseil et la d\u00e9cision prise par celui-ci. Au contraire, lors de cette rencontre, on fait plut\u00f4t allusion, \u00e0 mots couverts, au fait que Mme O\u2019Bomsawin \u00e9tant la fille du directeur du Centre, cela a pu avoir une incidence.\n[66] M. St-Ours reconnait dans son t\u00e9moignage avoir mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme O\u2019Bomsawin que \u00ab parfois les d\u00e9cisions du Conseil peuvent faire des victimes\u2026 \u00bb. M. St-Ours ne parle pas du crit\u00e8re de motivation \u00e0 la plaignante lors de cette rencontre.\n[67] Quant \u00e0 M. Nolett, il reconnait \u00e9galement dans son t\u00e9moignage que l\u2019explication de la motivation n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie \u00e0 Mme O\u2019Bomsawin lors de cette rencontre port-mortem. Il reconnait aussi avoir dit quelque chose comme \u00ab 1, 2, 3 contrats sans entrevue, \u00e7a commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 jaser dans la communaut\u00e9\u2026 \u00bb.\n[68] Pour ces motifs, je conclus que la plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP, pour le motif de situation de famille.\nB. L\u2019explication du Conseil\n[69] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Conseil a tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer que ses actions n\u2019\u00e9taient pas discriminatoires et que l\u2019embauche d\u2019une autre candidate reposait plut\u00f4t sur les comp\u00e9tences de cette autre candidate.\n[70] Ainsi, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que la candidate retenue \u00e9tait plus motiv\u00e9e que la plaignante pour l\u2019emploi et que ce facteur \u00e9tait d\u00e9terminant dans le choix qui devait \u00eatre fait.\n[71] Pourtant \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la grille d\u2019\u00e9valuation utilis\u00e9e par le Conseil pour proc\u00e9der aux entrevues, le crit\u00e8re de motivation ne vaut que 10 points sur 100 et inclus \u00e9galement \u00ab exp\u00e9rience de vie \u00bb. Plus de deux mois se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s entre la date de cl\u00f4ture du concours et les entrevues, et pourtant aucun changement \u00e0 la grille d\u2019\u00e9valuation n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour refl\u00e9ter le crit\u00e8re important que semble \u00eatre la motivation selon les propos des t\u00e9moins du Conseil. En fait, le Conseil de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s subjective et sans respecter sa propre grille d\u2019\u00e9valuation a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire du crit\u00e8re de motivation le seul crit\u00e8re en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, de lui donner plus de poids que sa propre grille d\u2019\u00e9valuation lui en donnait, le tout afin de justifier une d\u00e9cision qui clairement \u00e9tait discriminatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme O\u2019Bomsawin.\n[72] Le Conseil a de plus, \u00e0 plusieurs reprises plaid\u00e9 le fait que l\u2019avis de concours ne refl\u00e9tait pas les r\u00e9els pr\u00e9requis pour le poste qui \u00e9tait affich\u00e9. Que la formation scolaire et les exp\u00e9riences pr\u00e9alables n\u2019\u00e9taient pas aussi importantes que celles d\u00e9crites dans l\u2019avis de concours. Pourtant, au moment de cette constatation en ao\u00fbt 2012, le Conseil pr\u00e9f\u00e8re ne pas r\u00e9afficher le poste avec une nouvelle description. Ce faisant, il ne peut aujourd\u2019hui plaider son propre manquement pour justifier le choix qu\u2019il a fait.\n[73] En toute transparence pour les candidats qui avaient appliqu\u00e9 pour le poste selon l\u2019avis publi\u00e9, il aurait \u00e0 tout le moins fallu les informer que les crit\u00e8res avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9s.\n[74] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le Conseil a aussi argument\u00e9 que le refus d\u2019embaucher Mme O\u2019Bomsawin reposait sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019aptitude \u00e0 entretenir et \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper des relations interpersonnelles. De l\u2019avis du Conseil, cette aptitude doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce comme une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, et consid\u00e9rant que la requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas manifest\u00e9 ou autrement d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle la d\u00e9tenait, cela constitue \u00e0 elle seule une raison de refuser de l\u2019embaucher.\n[75] \u00c0 part de promouvoir cet argument, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 aucune preuve pour \u00e9tablir une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. Notamment, pour \u00e9tablir une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, l\u2019article 15 (2) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit d\u00e9montrer que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019une personne ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Encore, aucune preuve de contrainte excessive n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par le Conseil.\n[76] Pour toutes ces raisons, j\u2019estime que la preuve du Conseil n\u2019est pas convaincante et ne constitue qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte.\nV. Plainte jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e\n[77] Sur la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je conclus donc que le Conseil a commis un acte discriminatoire selon l\u2019article 7 a) de la LCDP, fond\u00e9e sur le motif de situation de famille, en refusant d\u2019employer la plaignante, Nahame O\u2019Bomsawin.\nVI. Le redressement\n[78] Lorsque le Tribunal juge une plainte fond\u00e9e, ce dernier a le pouvoir de rendre des ordonnances en fonction de l\u2019article 53 de la LCDP. Dans le cas qui nous pr\u00e9occupe, Mme O\u2019Bomsawin demande au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner au Conseil de l\u2019indemniser pour des pertes de salaire, le pr\u00e9judice moral, l\u2019acte discriminatoire d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9, et d\u2019accorder des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur ses indemnit\u00e9s. Ce sont les articles 53 (2) c), 53 (2) e), 53 (3) et 53 (4) qui s\u2019appliquent. Nous allons les analyser un apr\u00e8s l\u2019autre en fonction de la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e.\nA. La perte de salaire (art. 53(2) c))\n[79] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 53 (2) c) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 responsable de discrimination d\u2019indemniser la victime pour perte de salaires et de d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte discriminatoire.\n[80] Certaines r\u00e8gles doivent \u00eatre respect\u00e9es dans l\u2019application de cet article. Tout d\u2019abord, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 268, paragraphe 37 (\u00ab Chopra \u00bb), a bien pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il doit exister un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre l\u2019acte discriminatoire dont a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 responsable l\u2019intim\u00e9 et la perte de salaire all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\n[81] De plus, la LCDP pr\u00e9cise clairement que le Tribunal peut indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9 ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire. Encore, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Chopra, paragraphe 40, est venue clarifier ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal en faisant reposer l\u2019application de cette r\u00e8gle sur une pr\u00e9misse importante, soit celle de l\u2019att\u00e9nuation des dommages :\nLa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 encourager l\u2019efficience \u00e9conomique en exigeant que les personnes qui ont subi des pertes prennent des mesures pour minimiser leur perte, puisqu\u2019il n\u2019est pas dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de permettre que des membres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 maximisent leur perte au d\u00e9triment d\u2019autres personnes, m\u00eame ci celles\u2011ci sont responsables de la perte\u2026\n[82] Mme O\u2019Bomsawin a appliqu\u00e9 sur l\u2019emploi de coordonnatrice en agr\u00e9ment du Centre de sant\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak alors qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas d\u2019emploi. Seules deux personnes ont eu des entrevues pour ce poste. Malgr\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ait eu le temps de r\u00e9afficher le poste entre le mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt et le mois d\u2019octobre 2012, et ainsi peut-\u00eatre avoir plus d\u2019applications pour le poste, le Conseil a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 de son plein gr\u00e9 poursuivre le processus avec seulement deux candidates, dont Mme O\u2019Bomsawin. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu sur la base de la preuve qui m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e que Mme O\u2019Bomsawin a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination. Sans cette discrimination, je suis convaincue qu\u2019elle aurait eu l\u2019emploi car elle avait, dans son ensemble, plus de comp\u00e9tences et d\u2019exp\u00e9rience demand\u00e9es que l\u2019autre candidate pour pouvoir faire le travail pour lequel elle avait appliqu\u00e9.\n[83] Le Tribunal a pleinement comp\u00e9tence pour d\u00e9dommager la victime de discrimination m\u00eame si celle-ci n\u2019a pas perdu un emploi mais la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019en avoir un. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a en effet, dans l\u2019affaire Canada (Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Singh, 2000 CanLII 15208 (CF), aux paragraphes 86-89, affirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal d\u2019indemniser la perte salariale d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une perte de possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi, \u00ab m\u00eame si la chose n\u2019\u00e9tait pas garantie \u00bb.\n[84] Mme O\u2019Bomsawin pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elle a droit \u00e0 un d\u00e9dommagement de 50 138.43 $ pour perte de salaire, ce qui repr\u00e9sente la diff\u00e9rence entre ce qu\u2019elle aurait suppos\u00e9ment gagn\u00e9 en trois ans si elle avait obtenu le contrat, moins le salaire qu\u2019elle a r\u00e9ellement gagn\u00e9 pendant ces trois ann\u00e9es.\n[85] Elle a mitig\u00e9 ses dommages puisqu\u2019elle a en effet obtenu un autre emploi. Cet emploi, selon les avis de cotisation d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve lui a permis de gagner un salaire de 78 823.95 $. Puisque ce travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 hors du territoire autochtone, il \u00e9tait imposable et un total de 14 302.38 $ a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 en imp\u00f4ts selon ces m\u00eames avis de cotisation. Elle a donc gagn\u00e9 un salaire net de 64 521.57$.\n[86] Si Mme O\u2019Bomsawin avait eu l\u2019emploi de coordonnatrice en agr\u00e9ment, elle n\u2019aurait pas eu \u00e0 payer d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur son salaire puisque le travail aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 sur le territoire autochtone.\n[87] L\u00e0 o\u00f9 je suis en d\u00e9saccord avec Mme O\u2019Bomsawin c\u2019est sur le montant qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elle aurait gagn\u00e9 si elle avait eu l\u2019emploi. En effet, rien ne nous indique que le salaire qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 celui pr\u00e9tendu par elle, soit 35 $ de l\u2019heure pour 21 heures par semaine.\n[88] Tout d\u2019abord, l\u2019avis de concours ne publicisait aucun salaire. Le salaire \u00e9tait \u00e0 discuter avec la personne ayant eu l\u2019emploi, en fonction de ses comp\u00e9tences et exp\u00e9riences pass\u00e9es. Mme O\u2019Bomsawin n\u2019a pas fait la preuve qu\u2019elle aurait eu un salaire de 35 $ de l\u2019heure. Par contre, selon les t\u00e9moignages entendus, les emplois pass\u00e9s de Mme O\u2019Bomsawin au Centre de sant\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak lui auraient permis de gagner des salaires horaires allant de 26 $ de l\u2019heure \u00e0 35 $ de l\u2019heure.\n[89] De plus, il est ressorti de la preuve lors de l\u2019audience que le Conseil \u00e9tait soucieux d\u2019octroyer un salaire respectueux des grilles de salaires \u00e9labor\u00e9s par le Conseil et que les salaires de Mme O\u2019Bomsawin par le pass\u00e9 n\u2019avaient pas toujours respect\u00e9 ces grilles. La personne qui a eu le poste de coordonnatrice en agr\u00e9ment et qui a effectu\u00e9 le mandat de trois ans \u00e0 quant \u00e0 elle obtenu un salaire de 21 $ de l\u2019heure.\n[90] Compte tenu de tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, et parce que la plaignante avait clairement au moment des entrevues plus de comp\u00e9tences et d\u2019exp\u00e9riences que l\u2019autre candidate, et parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un mandat de trois ans, soit le plus long mandat que Mme O\u2019Bomsawin aurait obtenu du Centre de sant\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak, il m\u2019apparait juste de conclure que le salaire horaire sur lequel sera bas\u00e9e la perte de salaire sera de 26 $ de l\u2019heure, soit le salaire que Mme O\u2019Bomsawin recevait lorsqu\u2019elle a fait son mandat de trois mois pour le poste de charg\u00e9 de projet en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 alimentaire.\n[91] Ainsi sur la base d\u2019un contrat de trois ans \u00e0 raison de 21 h par semaine \u00e0 26 $ de l\u2019heure, le salaire total qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme O\u2019Bomsawin aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de 85 176 $, non imposable.\n[92] Si on soustrait le salaire gagn\u00e9 par Mme O\u2019Bomsawin pendant ces m\u00eames ann\u00e9es (principe d\u2019att\u00e9nuation des dommages) moins l\u2019imp\u00f4t qu\u2019elle a pay\u00e9 sur ce salaire, soit 64 521.57 $ selon les avis de cotisation d\u00e9pos\u00e9s, on arrive \u00e0 une perte nette de 20 654.43 $.\n[93] Mme O\u2019Bomsawin plaide \u00e9galement qu\u2019elle a d\u00fb travailler 35 h par semaine pour obtenir un salaire moindre que ce qu\u2019elle aurait obtenu si elle avait travaill\u00e9 uniquement 21 h par semaine pour le Centre de sant\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak et demande un d\u00e9dommagement pour la diff\u00e9rence. Elle soumet qu\u2019elle aurait pu occuper un autre emploi ou g\u00e9n\u00e9rer des revenus en travaillant 21 h par semaine via une semaine de trois jours.\n[94] Je ne crois pas que Mme O\u2019Bomsawin ait droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 compensatoire li\u00e9e aux nombres d\u2019heures travaill\u00e9es par semaine. La preuve n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que si la plaignante avait eu le contrat de coordonnatrice en agr\u00e9ment elle aurait utilis\u00e9 les heures qui lui restaient dans la semaine pour se trouver un autre emploi. La plaignante elle-m\u00eame a \u00e9t\u00e9 vague sur cette question, all\u00e9guant qu\u2019elle aurait plut\u00f4t prioris\u00e9 sa qualit\u00e9 de vie.\n[95] Pour ces raisons, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de verser \u00e0 la plaignante la somme de 20 654.43 $ \u00e0 titre de perte de salaire.\nB. Indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral (art. 53 (2) e))\n[96] En vertu de l\u2019article 53 (2) e) de la LCDP, la plaignante r\u00e9clame une somme de 20 000 $ pour le pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9tend avoir subi. La plaignante pr\u00e9tend avoir v\u00e9cu un stress tr\u00e8s important depuis l\u2019annonce publique par le Conseil qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019emploi pour lequel elle avait appliqu\u00e9. Elle pr\u00e9tend avoir subi une forme de trahison, que la d\u00e9cision qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise l\u2019a forc\u00e9 en quelque sorte a quitt\u00e9 la communaut\u00e9 et \u00e0 s\u2019\u00e9loigner de sa famille. Elle a d\u00fb voir un m\u00e9decin et s\u2019est fait prescrire des m\u00e9dicaments pour l\u2019aider \u00e0 se remettre des \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Par contre, la plaignante n\u2019a apport\u00e9 aucune preuve d\u2019experts quant au lien existant entre sa situation m\u00e9dicale et la perte d\u2019opportunit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi qu\u2019elle a subie. Il n\u2019y a eu aucune preuve d\u2019expert dans ce dossier.\n[97] Cela ne veut pas dire par contre que Mme O\u2019Bomsawin n\u2019a pas subi de stress li\u00e9 \u00e0 cette situation. La communaut\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak est une petite communaut\u00e9 et le sentiment de trahison au sein de la communaut\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre ni\u00e9, particuli\u00e8rement au sein d\u2019une communaut\u00e9 autochtone. Mme O\u2019Bomsawin, malgr\u00e9 ses comp\u00e9tences, n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019emploi et celle qui l\u2019a obtenu n\u2019avait pas de comp\u00e9tences additionnelles \u00e0 Mme O\u2019Bomsawin, au contraire. On a voulu lui envoyer un message et cette derni\u00e8re a compris qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas jug\u00e9e sur la base de ses comp\u00e9tences mais uniquement parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait la fille de quelqu\u2019un. Le sentiment d\u2019injustice \u00e9tait r\u00e9el.\n[98] Cependant 20 000 $ est le montant maximal selon la loi qui peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e et le Tribunal l\u2019accorde habituellement pour les cas les plus graves : lorsque la port\u00e9e et la dur\u00e9e de la souffrance du plaignant d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019acte discriminatoire justifient le montant complet.\n[99] Compte tenu de la preuve, et parce que je consid\u00e8re que Mme O\u2019Bomsawin a en effet subi un pr\u00e9judice d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e de cette fa\u00e7on, j\u2019ordonne au Conseil de lui payer une somme de 10 000 $ pour le pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019elle a subi.\nC. Indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale (art. 53 (3))\n[100] Mme O\u2019Bomsawin demande que le Conseil lui verse un montant de 7 500 $ \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale en vertu de l\u2019article 53 (3) de la LCDP. Cet article de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019auteur d\u2019un acte discriminatoire de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $ s\u2019il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[101] Selon l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Johnstone, 2013 CF 113, paragraphe 155 (vari\u00e9 sur autres motifs, 2014 FCA 110), l\u2019article 53 (3) est une disposition punitive visant \u00e0 dissuader ou \u00e0 d\u00e9courager ceux qui se livrent de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires. Il y a un acte discriminatoire d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 lorsque l\u2019acte discriminatoire et l\u2019atteinte aux droits de la personne ont \u00e9t\u00e9 intentionnels. Un acte inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 est celui d\u2019un m\u00e9pris ou d\u2019une indiff\u00e9rence quant aux cons\u00e9quences et d\u2019une mani\u00e8re d\u2019agir t\u00e9m\u00e9raire ou insouciante.\n[102] Tout comme pour l\u2019article 53 (2) e), le montant maximal est uniquement allou\u00e9 dans les cas les plus graves.\n[103] Les faits ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 lors de la preuve que le Conseil \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le fait que \u00e7a \u00ab jasait beaucoup dans la communaut\u00e9 \u00bb, et que l\u2019on jasait surtout du fait que Mme O\u2019Bomsawin \u00e9tait la fille du directeur du Centre de sant\u00e9 d\u2019Odanak. Les t\u00e9moins ont confirm\u00e9 que le processus mis en place et plus particuli\u00e8rement le fait que la d\u00e9cision ait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par le Conseil \u00e9tait \u00ab unique \u00bb du fait que Mme O\u2019Bomsawin \u00e9tait la fille du directeur.\n[104] MM St-Ours et Nolett ont fait preuve d\u2019un comportement d\u00e9nu\u00e9 de prudence \u00e0 mon avis lorsqu\u2019ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 l\u2019ensemble des comp\u00e9tences des candidates et de porter leur choix sur l\u2019autre candidate uniquement sur le crit\u00e8re de motivation, un crit\u00e8re qui pourtant selon leur propre grille d\u2019\u00e9valuation ne valait que 10 points sur 100.\n[105] Leurs explications lors de l\u2019audience tenaient clairement plus \u00e0 un pr\u00e9texte qu\u2019\u00e0 une explication juste et raisonnable. Ces explications mitig\u00e9es de la part du Conseil combin\u00e9es \u00e0 la preuve lors de l\u2019audience que \u00ab \u00e7a jasait beaucoup dans la communaut\u00e9 \u00bb et que le Conseil semblait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par ces comm\u00e9rages m\u2019ont convaincu qu\u2019ils ont agi en sachant fort bien qu\u2019ils ne traitaient pas Mme O\u2019Bomsawin de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable. Le Conseil a eu un comportement d\u00e9nu\u00e9 de prudence et semble clairement ne pas s\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 des cons\u00e9quences. L\u2019objectif pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait que Mme O\u2019Bomsawin n\u2019obtienne pas ce poste.\n[106] Pour ces raisons, j\u2019ordonne que le Conseil paye \u00e0 Mme O\u2019Bomsawin une indemnit\u00e9 de 7 500 $ pour avoir pos\u00e9 un acte discriminatoire inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9.\nD. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats (art. 53 (4))\n[107] En vertu de l\u2019article 53(4) de la LCDP et le r\u00e8gle 9 (12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure (03-05-04) du Tribunal, j\u2019ordonne que soit vers\u00e9 les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur tous les montants \u00e0 \u00eatre pay\u00e9s \u00e0 Mme O\u2019Bomsawin. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sera calcul\u00e9 \u00e0 taux simple sur une base annuelle en se fondant sur le taux officiel d\u2019escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle). Il courra de la date de la d\u00e9cision prise par le Conseil de ne pas embaucher la plaignante, soit le 29 octobre 2012, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date du versement de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9.\nVII. Ordonnance\n[108] La plainte de Nahame O\u2019Bomsawin est jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e et il est ordonn\u00e9 que le Conseil des Ad\u00e9nakis d\u2019Odanak :\nIndemnise la victime 20 654.43 $ \u00e0 titre de perte de salaire.\nIndemnise la victime 10 000 $ pour le pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019elle a subi.\nIndemnise la victime 7 500 $ pour avoir pos\u00e9 un acte discriminatoire d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\nVerse des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les indemnisations ci-dessus conform\u00e9ment aux conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 107 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAnie Perrault\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nLe\n17 f\u00e9vrier 2017\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal :\nT2111\/2715\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nNahame O\u2019Bomsawin c.

Conclusion 15\nVI. Ordonnance 17\nANNEXE...................................................................................................................................... 19\nI. Historique proc\u00e9dural de la plainte\n[1] Le 28 avril 1999, le Syndicat des communications de Radio-Canada (le Syndicat), d\u00e9posait une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (Commission ou CCDP) contre la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada (la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9), all\u00e9guant une disparit\u00e9 salariale entre les emplois d\u2019assistanat et de recherche, compos\u00e9 majoritairement de femmes et, les emplois de techniciens de niveau 9, compos\u00e9 majoritairement d\u2019hommes et ce, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article 11 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP).\n[2] Le Syndicat repr\u00e9sente les emplois d\u2019assistanat et de recherche alors que le Syndicat des techniciens et artisans du r\u00e9seau fran\u00e7ais (STARF) repr\u00e9sente les emplois de techniciens de niveau 9.\n[3] Le 13 ao\u00fbt 2014, la Commission demande au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (Tribunal) d\u2019instruire la portion de la plainte concernant les emplois de recherche et pr\u00e9cise que la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas r\u00e9f\u00e9rer la portion de la plainte en ce qui a trait aux emplois d\u2019assistanats. Le 25 Novembre 2014, le Pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal m\u2019assigna le dossier pour instruction. Selon la Commission, une s\u00e9rie d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e8nements et de d\u00e9cisions se sont produits entre le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte et la demande d\u2019instruction au Tribunal. Il est utile d\u2019en faire un bref survol.\n[4] Du 28 avril au 16 Octobre 1999 : La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 soul\u00e8ve l\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9 de la plainte et nie toute discrimination salariale. Elle pr\u00e9sente donc des objections en vertu des articles 40 et 41 de la LCDP et demande que la plainte soit rejet\u00e9e. Au mois d\u2019avril 2000, la Commission d\u00e9cide de statuer sur la plainte et de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Le 11 juillet 2000, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pose une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e0 la Cour F\u00e9d\u00e9rale, de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission.\n[5] Le 16 ao\u00fbt 2000, la Commission informe la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 que l\u2019enqu\u00eate se poursuit. Le 16 juillet 2002, la Cour F\u00e9d\u00e9rale rend sa d\u00e9cision rejetant la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[6] Le 5 avril 2004, les parties sont avis\u00e9es que la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer la plainte en conciliation et de demander au Pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal d\u2019instruire la plainte si une entente n\u2019est pas intervenue d\u2019ici 120 jours.\n[7] Le 8 juillet 2004, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pose une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission.\n[8] Le 12 avril 2005, la Cour F\u00e9d\u00e9rale ordonne que le dossier soit retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission pour recommencer l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la plainte et, particuli\u00e8rement, l\u2019aspect de l\u2019\u00e9valuation comparative des fonctions concern\u00e9es et \u00e0 la question de savoir si les groupes compar\u00e9s font partie d\u2019un m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement au sens de la LCDP. La Cour indique que : \u00ab Les deux parties devraient collaborer pleinement avec l\u2019enqu\u00eateur et fournir les renseignements qui leur seront demand\u00e9s. Il est entendu que, s\u2019ils n\u2019existent pas d\u00e9j\u00e0, ces renseignements devront \u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s par la ou les parties auxquelles ils sont demand\u00e9s \u00bb (voir Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio Canada c. Syndicat des communications de Radio-Canada, 2005 CF 466, au paragraphe 52).\n[9] Le 16 mars 2011 la Cour F\u00e9d\u00e9rale rejette la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas statuer sur la portion de la plainte traitant du groupe \u00ab assistanat \u00bb (voir Syndicat des communications de Radio-Canada c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CF 314).\nII. La Requ\u00eate pour divulgation de la Commission\n[10] La Commission sous la forme d\u2019une requ\u00eate, demande au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de se conformer aux R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure (03-05-04) (\u00ab les R\u00e8gles \u00bb) du Tribunal et de d\u00e9poser dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le membre instructeur, les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties et ce, dans les trente (30) jours suivant la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal.\n[11] La Commission recherche une ordonnance exigeant \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de divulguer \u00e0 la Commission et au Syndicat dans les trente (30) jours de la d\u00e9cision, les documents recherch\u00e9s par le Syndicat dans sa lettre du 15 avril 2015 qui sera abord\u00e9e un peu plus loin.\n[12] J\u2019ai pris connaissance de l\u2019ensemble du dossier et de la requ\u00eate, des pi\u00e8ces jointes \u00e0 la requ\u00eate ainsi que des arguments de toutes les parties. Il est utile de rappeler que les pi\u00e8ces jointes \u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions amend\u00e9 du Syndicat ne sont pas en possession du Tribunal et n\u2019ont donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9es pour les fins de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Pour fins de concision, je ne d\u00e9crirai pas ici chacun des arguments des parties, alors, j\u2019en ferai plut\u00f4t un bref survol.\n[13] La Commission all\u00e8gue que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de se conformer \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 6 des R\u00e8gles qui exige que chaque partie divulgue les divers documents en sa possession et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 toute question en cause. La Commission soutient donc que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est en d\u00e9faut et, demande au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner la divulgation de tous les documents pertinents au pr\u00e9sent litige.\n[14] La Commission soul\u00e8ve \u00e9galement que l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 indique que cette derni\u00e8re est en possession d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de documents susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019affaire devant le Tribunal mais qu\u2019il lui est impossible de les remettre aux parties puisque ces derni\u00e8res n\u2019ont pas identifi\u00e9 les documents qu\u2019elles souhaitent obtenir.\n[15] La Commission et le Syndicat ne sont pas en mesure d\u2019identifier les documents \u00e0 obtenir puisque ceux-ci ne sont pas en leur possession. De plus, la Commission argue qu\u2019en mati\u00e8re de divulgation, le Tribunal doit prot\u00e9ger l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus. Cela exige une divulgation pleine et enti\u00e8re de tous les documents potentiellement pertinents de toutes les parties et pour ce faire, le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 une partie de les divulguer.\n[16] Le Syndicat soutient que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a, de par sa propre admission, en sa possession, des documents potentiellement pertinents que le Syndicat souhaite obtenir pour administrer sa preuve afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte et pour lui permettre de compl\u00e9ter ses expertises. Il ajoute que dans ce dossier fort complexe, la divulgation est n\u00e9cessaire afin que le processus devant le Tribunal, se d\u00e9roule de fa\u00e7on efficace. De plus, selon le Syndicat, l\u2019employeur conserve nombre de documents de diff\u00e9rentes formes portant sur la nature des emplois des diff\u00e9rents groupes, leur r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et leurs titulaires.\n[17] Le Syndicat ajoute qu\u2019en f\u00e9vrier 2015, il a transmis sa preuve documentaire \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans sa lettre d\u2019avril 2015, de faire \u00e0 son tour, sa divulgation. Face au refus de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, le Syndicat s\u2019adresse au Tribunal afin qu\u2019il ordonne la divulgation de:\nToutdocument, lettre, courriel, note, pouvant potentiellement \u00eatre pertinent au pr\u00e9sent litige, et plus particuli\u00e8rement, mais non limitativement;\nLes conventions collectives SARDEC et ACTRA en vigueur entre 1995 et 1998;\nLes affichages de postes du groupe recherche et du groupe comparateur des techniciens de la cat\u00e9gorie 9 depuis le mois de juin 1995 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui;\nLes documents, lettres, courriels, notes, questionnaires, portant ou traitant des t\u00e2ches, fonctions ou exigences \u00e0 l\u2019emploi du groupe comparateur des techniciens de la cat\u00e9gorie 9 depuis le mois de juin 1995 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui;\nLes documents, lettres, courriels, notes, questionnaires, portant ou traitant de l\u2019\u00e9valuation des postes et\/ou la cr\u00e9ation des monographies du groupe recherche et du groupe comparateur des techniciens de la cat\u00e9gorie 9 depuis le mois de juin 1995 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui.\n[18] En somme, le Syndicat soutient que l\u2019objectif de l\u2019article 1 des R\u00e8gles appuie sa requ\u00eate. Les R\u00e8gles mentionn\u00e9es dans cette d\u00e9cision sont retrouv\u00e9es en annexe.\n[19] En r\u00e9ponse, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 argue que le Syndicat est en possession de documents qu\u2019il a fait d\u00e9faut de divulguer notamment les conventions collectives SARDEC et ACTRA en vigueur de 1995 \u00e0 1998, les affichages de postes appartenant au groupe d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le Syndicat de groupe recherche ainsi que les affichages de postes appartenant audit groupe comparateur.\n[20] Quant aux autres demandes de documents ci-haut mentionn\u00e9es, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019elles sont \u00e0 ce point impr\u00e9cises et qu\u2019il lui est impossible d\u2019y donner suite. Elle ajoute que l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du Syndicat est lui-m\u00eame impr\u00e9cis.\n[21] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 mentionne qu\u2019elle d\u00e9sire une pleine collaboration avec le Tribunal et les parties, collaboration s\u2019inscrivant dans un contexte o\u00f9 les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle sont respect\u00e9es.\n[22] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans sa r\u00e9ponse, une demande qui s\u2019apparente \u00e0 une demande reconventionnelle en droit civil qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois et demande au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner au Syndicat de divulguer les documents suivants :\nCopie de toute convention collective que le Syndicat entend invoquer au soutien de ses pr\u00e9tentions (et\/ou qu\u2019il consid\u00e8re pertinente aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente affaire) et \u00e0 laquelle il a pr\u00e9sentement acc\u00e8s;\nCopie de tout affichage de poste que le Syndicat entend invoquer au soutien de ses pr\u00e9tentions (et\/ou qu\u2019il consid\u00e8re pertinente aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente affaire) et \u00e0 laquelle il a pr\u00e9sentement acc\u00e8s;\nCopie de tout document auquel le Syndicat a pr\u00e9sentement acc\u00e8s et qu\u2019il entend invoquer afin de \u2018\u2019bonifier sa preuve lors de l\u2019instruction et pour soutenir que les emplois du groupe 9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par le STARF peuvent constituer un groupe comparateur \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine respectant les objectifs de la loi (voir le paragraphe 57 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du Syndicat);\nCopie de tout document auquel le Syndicat a pr\u00e9sentement acc\u00e8s et qu\u2019il entend invoquer afin d\u2019appliquer, lors de l\u2019instruction, un possible plan d\u2019\u00e9valuation eu \u00e9gards aux fonctions comprises dans le groupe recherche et le groupe comparateur;\nCopie de tout document auquel le Syndicat a pr\u00e9sentement acc\u00e8s et qu\u2019il entend invoquer afin de d\u00e9montrer \u00e0 l\u2019instruction les fonctions du groupe comparateur retenu;\nQue le Tribunal ordonne au Syndicat de pr\u00e9ciser les titres d\u2019emploi inclus dans le groupe comparateur;\nLa m\u00e9thodologie propos\u00e9e par le Syndicat afin de comparer la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration globale des personnes occupant des fonctions comprises dans le groupe comparateur;\nLes documents sp\u00e9cifiques auxquels elle n\u2019a pas acc\u00e8s et qui sont, selon elle, n\u00e9cessaires afin de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation des fonctions concern\u00e9es et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation des r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations associ\u00e9es auxdites fonctions.\n[23] Selon la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, la plupart des documents que le Syndicat veut obtenir sont en sa possession ou son contr\u00f4le. Selon la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, cette derni\u00e8re acceptait de proc\u00e9der par le biais de subpoena duces tecum \u00e0 \u00eatre signifi\u00e9s en pr\u00e9vision de l\u2019instruction et de limiter la divulgation pr\u00e9alable puisque cette fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der \u00e9tait pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e par le Syndicat. Devant un changement d\u2019approche, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 soutient que le Syndicat devrait compl\u00e9ter son dossier plut\u00f4t que de le faire lors de l\u2019instruction.\n[24] Un autre argument avanc\u00e9 par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est celui de l\u2019obligation des plaignants en mati\u00e8re de preuve. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 affirme vouloir transmettre les documents compl\u00e9mentaires qu\u2019elle jugera pertinents \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des informations re\u00e7ues sur la m\u00e9thodologie utilis\u00e9e pour effectuer les comparaisons entre les emplois et les salaires. De plus, suite \u00e0 cette transmission, si le Syndicat estime que des documents additionnels existent, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 demande que ceux-ci soient pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment identifi\u00e9s et, de s\u2019adresser \u00e0 elle et\/ou au Tribunal.\n[25] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 demande au Tribunal de prendre acte de son engagement et \u00e9labor\u00e9 dans sa lettre du 24 avril 2015 soit que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pourra fournir les documents sp\u00e9cifiques requis dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle les a en sa possession. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ajoute qu`ensuite, elle sera en mesure de compl\u00e9ter sa divulgation ce qui, selon elle, est conforme aux principes de justice naturelle. Finalement elle avance que ces principes de justice naturelle exigent aux plaignants de d\u00e9noncer leur preuve.\nIII. Le droit applicable\n[26] D\u2019abord, il est utile de se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer au paragraphe 48.9(1) de la LCDP, lequel prescrit : \u00ab [l\u2019]instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique \u00bb.\n[27] Ainsi, conform\u00e9ment aux principes de justice naturelle et au paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi, les parties \u00e0 une instance du Tribunal doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de faire valoir leurs positions. Cela exige la divulgation de tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents aux yeux des parties. S\u2019il existe un lien rationnel entre un document demand\u00e9 et les faits, les questions ou les formes de redressement recherch\u00e9s par les parties, ce document doit \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux alin\u00e9as 6(1)d) et e) des R\u00e8gles (voir les d\u00e9cisions Guay c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale), 2004 TCDP 34, au paragraphe 42 (\u00ab Guay \u00bb); Association des employ\u00e9(e)s de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication du Manitoba inc. c. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 TCDP 28, au paragraphe 4 (\u00ab AETM inc. \u00bb); et Rai c. Gendarmerie Royale du Canada, 2013 TCDP 6, au paragraphe 28 (\u00ab Rai \u00bb)).\n[28] Bien que les R\u00e8gles ne pr\u00e9cisent pas la mani\u00e8re ou la forme que doit prendre la divulgation, l\u2019objet des r\u00e8gles et, plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, les principes d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, exigent que la divulgation et la production de documents soient suffisantes pour que chaque partie ait la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de se faire entendre (voir Grand Chief Stan Louttit et al c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, 2013 TCDP 3, au paragraphe 14 (\u00ab Louttit \u00bb)).\n[29] Les R\u00e8gles pr\u00e9voient que les parties sont tenues de divulguer les documents potentiellement pertinents qu'elles ont en leur possession. Les parties ne sont pas tenues de cr\u00e9er des documents \u00e0 des fins de divulgation (Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 42, au paragraphe 17).\n[30] Qui plus est, le paragraphe 1(2) des R\u00e8gles \u00e9nonce que celles-ci doivent \u00eatre \u00ab [\u2026] appliqu\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on lib\u00e9rale par le membre instructeur dans l\u2019affaire dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi, afin de favoriser les fins \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 1(1) \u00bb. Entre autres choses, l\u2019objet des R\u00e8gles est de permettre que \u00ab l\u2019argumentation et la preuve soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en temps opportun et de fa\u00e7on efficace \u00bb (alin\u00e9a 1(1)b) des R\u00e8gles) et que \u00ab toutes les affaires dont le Tribunal est saisi soient instruites de la fa\u00e7on la moins formaliste et la plus rapide possible \u00bb (alin\u00e9a 1(1)c) des R\u00e8gles). J\u2019ajouterais que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 1(1)c) des R\u00e8gles est conforme au paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi (voir Rai, au paragraphe 34).\n[31] Il est important de rappeler que la pertinence s\u2019appr\u00e9cie en lien avec la plainte et l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions (voir Lindor c. Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada, 2012 TCDP 14, au paragraphe 56).\n[32] Au surplus, la pertinence est une notion distincte de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 en preuve pour fins de l\u2019audition et ce principe est mentionn\u00e9 notamment dans la d\u00e9cision AETM inc., au paragraphe 4 :\n\u00ab La production de documents est assujettie au crit\u00e8re de la pertinence potentielle, qui n\u2019est pas un crit\u00e8re tr\u00e8s exigeant. Il doit y avoir une certaine pertinence entre le document ou les renseignements demand\u00e9s et la question en litige. Il ne fait aucun doute qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de veiller \u00e0 ce que tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents soient disponibles dans le cadre d\u2019une affaire comme celle en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Une partie a le droit d\u2019obtenir les renseignements ou les documents qui sont pertinents quant \u00e0 l\u2019affaire ou qui pourraient l\u2019\u00eatre. Cela ne veut pas dire que ces documents ou renseignements seront admis en preuve ou qu\u2019on leur accordera une importance significative. \u00bb\n[33] Cela dit, la demande de communication ne doit pas \u00eatre sp\u00e9culative ou \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une \u00ab partie de p\u00eache \u00bb. Les documents demand\u00e9s devraient \u00eatre d\u00e9crits de mani\u00e8re suffisamment pr\u00e9cise (voir Guay, au paragraphe 43).\nIV. Analyse\nA. Obligation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de divulgation devant le Tribunal\n[34] Les R\u00e8gles en mati\u00e8re de divulgation ont pour objet, notamment, de permettre aux parties d\u2019obtenir tous les documents potentiellement pertinents dans le but de se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter leur preuve devant le Tribunal. Ceci favorise le bon d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019instance faisant partie int\u00e9grante d\u2019une bonne administration de la justice et des principes d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[35] Ceci \u00e9tant dit, les R\u00e8gles pr\u00e9voient \u00e9galement une divulgation continue qui entrevoit les situations o\u00f9 de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve surgissent ou lorsque des documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 omis doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s.\n[36] Aux fins de divulgation, la plainte, la th\u00e9orie de la cause incluse dans l`expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions ainsi que l\u2019ensemble de ce dernier, servent de guides afin d\u2019identifier la pertinence potentielle des documents. Cette pertinence potentielle sera analys\u00e9e autant du point de vue de la partie plaignante que de celui de la partie intim\u00e9e ou de celui repr\u00e9sentant l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public en l\u2019occurrence, la Commission. Autrement dit, les documents \u00e0 divulguer ne sont pas seulement ceux qui appuient la position d\u2019une seule partie, mais bien de toutes les parties.\n[37] Le processus devant le Tribunal est un nouveau processus qui commande une divulgation enti\u00e8re et compl\u00e8te au sein m\u00eame de cette instance. Par cons\u00e9quent, les documents divulgu\u00e9s dans des processus ant\u00e9rieurs et, en dehors du processus du Tribunal, ne sont pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme faisant partie int\u00e9grante de celui-ci et doivent donc \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s et produits entre les parties.\n[38] En principe, les parties identifient clairement les documents dans leurs listes de divulgation et demandent parfois aux autres parties d\u2019identifier les documents d\u00e9sir\u00e9s et ce, dans le but d\u2019\u00e9viter une duplication. Cependant, bien que cette fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e efficace, elle n\u2019est ni obligatoire ni toujours appropri\u00e9e. Elle s\u2019av\u00e8rera peu utile si une partie n\u2019a pas inclus certains documents dans sa liste de divulgation et que les documents omis sont potentiellement pertinents pour la partie adverse.\n[39] Les parties doivent inclure suffisamment d\u2019informations dans leurs listes afin de permettre aux autres parties de comprendre ce que sont ces documents (voir Loutitt, au paragraphe 15). Ensuite, les parties sont tenues de communiquer ladite liste aux autres parties et de la mettre \u00e0 jour, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n[40] Il ne s\u2019agit donc pas de demander \u00e0 une partie d\u2019identifier les documents pr\u00e9cis qu\u2019elle d\u00e9sire et qui ne sont pas inscrits sur la liste de divulgation d`une autre partie. Pour s`acquitter de son devoir de divulgation, il faut d\u00e9crire les documents pour permettre \u00e0 la partie adverse de les identifier et il faut les lui fournir. En somme, une partie qui est en possession d\u2019un document est en meilleure position de le d\u00e9crire que la partie qui ne l\u2019a pas en sa possession et qui parfois, en ignore son existence.\n[41] Au mieux, comme dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, une partie qui estime que certains documents sont en possession de l\u2019autre partie et qui ne sont pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment d\u00e9crits sur la liste de divulgation de cette derni\u00e8re, peuvent \u00eatre demand\u00e9s en identifiant des cat\u00e9gories de documents qui se rapportent rationnellement \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement recherch\u00e9, ce que la Commission et le Syndicat ont fait ici. (Voir paragraphe 17 de cette d\u00e9cision, les points 1, 4 et 5).\n[42] Comme l\u2019a soulev\u00e9 la Commission, il est important de ne pas confondre la divulgation des documents potentiellement pertinents dans le cadre du processus du Tribunal avec la divulgation de la preuve qui sera pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e devant le Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019instruction.\n[43] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fait mention de son droit de s\u2019attendre au respect des principes de justice naturelle et de conna\u00eetre la th\u00e9orie de la cause du Syndicat et de la Commission ainsi que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve auxquels elle devra r\u00e9pondre en pr\u00e9sentant sa d\u00e9fense.\n[44] Ce principe est applicable ici puisque toutes les parties devant le Tribunal b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient de la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de se faire entendre \u00e0 l\u2019instruction.\n[45] Il n\u2019y a cependant, aucune entorse \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la justice naturelle dans le fait que les parties soient contraintes \u00e0 divulguer, la documentation potentiellement pertinente en leur possession.\n[46] Ceci \u00e9tant dit, je vais traiter d\u2019abord de la premi\u00e8re demande d\u2019ordre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Commission soit d\u2019obtenir la divulgation de :\nTout document, lettre, courriel, note, pouvant potentiellement \u00eatre pertinent au pr\u00e9sent litige. (voir le point 1 au paragraphe 17).\n[47] Je note que la Commission a fait parvenir une liste d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de sa divulgation aux parties et au Tribunal. Cette liste comporte deux annexes A et B. L\u2019Annexe A, qui comporte 141 pages, est une liste pour laquelle aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9.\n[48] En examinant cette liste, je constate qu\u2019elle compte un bon nombre de conventions collectives, tableaux, affichages et documents potentiellement pertinents au pr\u00e9sent cas. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, dans sa r\u00e9ponse, ne fait aucune mention \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait pas re\u00e7u cette divulgation. La divulgation de la Commission est donc vraisemblablement en possession de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[49] En analysant la liste de divulgation de la Commission, je remarque des similitudes entre le type de documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s et ceux vis\u00e9s par les demandes de divulgation de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. Les demandes de la Commission et du Syndicat apparaissent donc raisonnables dans les circonstances.\n[50] De plus, le Syndicat mentionne au paragraphe 80 de son expos\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions amend\u00e9 qu\u2019il fait sienne la preuve communiqu\u00e9e au mois de d\u00e9cembre 2014 par la Commission, aux parties.\n[51] Dans ce m\u00eame expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions amend\u00e9, aux paragraphes 81 et 82, le Syndicat affirme avoir communiqu\u00e9 les documents en sa possession soit, des documents transmis par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 au Syndicat ainsi que, des documents cr\u00e9\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on contemporaine, lors de la r\u00e9ception de ces documents.\n[52] Le Syndicat a affirm\u00e9, lors de l\u2019appel conf\u00e9rence du 22 juin 2015, \u00eatre all\u00e9 le plus loin possible en termes d`all\u00e9gations \u00e9tay\u00e9es dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Le reste des documents n\u00e9cessaires pour faire sa preuve serait entre les mains de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[53] Par exemple, au paragraphe 89 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions amend\u00e9 du Syndicat, ce dernier fait mention des nombreuses lacunes dans la communication de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 concernant certaines informations en ce qui a trait aux contrats du groupe recherche.\n[54] Le Syndicat avance donc que la divulgation demand\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 lui permettra de compl\u00e9ter ses expertises.\n[55] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a en sa possession, l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du Syndicat qui avance sa th\u00e9orie de la cause et la base de ses pr\u00e9tentions. De plus, la Cour F\u00e9d\u00e9rale apporte plusieurs pr\u00e9cisions dans ce dossier notamment, elle met en contexte, l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission.\n[56] Pour toutes ces raisons, j\u2019estime que les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s et les questions sont par cons\u00e9quent, bien connus des parties et ce, malgr\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de les clarifier dans le futur.\n[57] Il est utile de rappeler que puisque nous sommes en mati\u00e8re d\u2019all\u00e9gations de disparit\u00e9 salariale, les documents demand\u00e9s dans cette requ\u00eate de la Commission apparaissent potentiellement pertinents au pr\u00e9sent litige et doivent par cons\u00e9quent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s.\nB. Analyse d\u00e9taill\u00e9e\n[58] Je vais proc\u00e9der maintenant \u00e0 l\u2019analyse de chacune des demandes de cat\u00e9gories de documents de la Commission et du Syndicat afin de d\u00e9terminer la pertinence potentielle des documents demand\u00e9s dans la requ\u00eate en divulgation.\n(i) Les conventions collectives SARDEC et ACTRA en vigueur entre 1995 et 1998\n[59] L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions amend\u00e9 du Syndicat en fait mention, notamment aux paragraphes suivants, sans tous les reproduire ici pour fins de concision :\nAu paragraphe 6 : Avant le mois de juin 1998, le groupe des recherchistes \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 de trois (3) titres d\u2019emploi, lesquels \u00e9taient exclusivement fonction du syndicat qui les repr\u00e9sentait avant la red\u00e9finition des unit\u00e9s d\u2019accr\u00e9ditation par le Conseil canadien des relations industrielles en 1995. Il y avait les recherchistes SJRC (un syndicat de journalistes), les recherchistes SARDEC (un syndicat d\u2019auteurs) et les Researcher\/Program ACTRA (un syndicat d\u2019artistes).\nAu paragraphe 7 : Entre 1995 et 1998, les salari\u00e9s du groupe I, \u00e9taient donc couverts par trois conventions collectives diff\u00e9rentes, et ce, tel qu\u2019il appert notamment de la convention collective du Syndicat des journalistes de Radio Canada (CSN) d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la CCDP, pi\u00e8ce 170.\nVoir aussi, de mani\u00e8re non-exhaustive, les paragraphes 29, 30, 44.\n[60] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences et paragraphes reproduits ci-dessus, il existe un lien rationnel entre les documents demand\u00e9s soit les conventions collectives SARDEC et ACTRA et les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. Les documents sont donc potentiellement pertinents. De plus, la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une autre convention collective d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la Commission, porte \u00e0 croire que cette derni\u00e8re a divulgu\u00e9 cette dite convention aux parties. Il est donc justifi\u00e9 que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 son tour, se conforme aux R\u00e8gles et divulgue les documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession.\n[61] Par cons\u00e9quent, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 doit divulguer et produire ces documents aux parties, ce que j\u2019inclurai dans l\u2019ordonnance.\n(ii) Les affichages de postes du groupe recherche et du groupe comparateur des techniciens de la cat\u00e9gorie 9 soit : les postes Technicien interm\u00e9diaire de mise en ondes; Aiguilleur interm\u00e9diaire; Cam\u00e9raman interm\u00e9diaire; Monteur interm\u00e9diaire; Technicien interm\u00e9diaire de son depuis le mois de juin 1995 \u00e0 ce jour\n[62] On peut lire au paragraphe 37 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions amend\u00e9 du Syndicat:\nQuant aux exigences li\u00e9es aux postes du groupe professionnel de recherche de juin 1995 au jour du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, elles \u00e9taient semblables en termes de formation, d\u2019exp\u00e9rience et de comp\u00e9tences requises, et ce tel qu\u2019 il appert notamment des affichages de postes CCDP-36 \u00e0 39, 100 \u00e0 103, 326, 330, 339 \u00e0 341, 348, 351, 355, 364, 366, 373, des questionnaires d\u2019\u00e9valuation de postes d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au soutien des pr\u00e9sentes quant \u00e0 des postes exerc\u00e9s \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque par(\u2026).\n[63] De plus, au paragraphe 50 faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au groupe comparateur:\nDes descriptions d\u2019emploi et des affichages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par la CCDP d\u00e9montrant la nature des fonctions et les exigences \u00e0 l\u2019emploi, soit les pi\u00e8ces CCDP-19 \u00e0 33, 81, 82, 91, 99,189, 193.\nVoir aussi, de mani\u00e8re non-exhaustive le paragraphe, 31.\n[64] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences et paragraphes reproduits ci-dessus, il existe un lien rationnel entre les documents demand\u00e9s et les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. Les documents sont donc potentiellement pertinents. De plus, la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un bon nombre de documents de la Commission porte \u00e0 croire que cette derni\u00e8re a divulgu\u00e9 ceux-ci aux parties. Il est donc justifi\u00e9 que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 son tour, se conforme aux R\u00e8gles et divulgue les documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession.\n[65] Pour ces raisons, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 doit divulguer et produire ces documents aux parties, ce que j\u2019inclurai dans l\u2019ordonnance.\n(iii) Les documents, lettres, courriels, notes, questionnaires, portant ou traitant des t\u00e2ches, fonctions ou exigences \u00e0 l\u2019emploi du groupe comparateur des techniciens de la cat\u00e9gorie 9 soit : les postes Technicien interm\u00e9diaire de mise en ondes; Aiguilleur interm\u00e9diaire; Cam\u00e9raman interm\u00e9diaire; Monteur interm\u00e9diaire; Technicien interm\u00e9diaire de son depuis le mois de juin 1995 \u00e0 ce jour\n[66] On indique au paragraphe 69 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions amend\u00e9 du Syndicat:\nEn effet, les fonctions du groupe de recherche ont \u00e9volu\u00e9 \u00e0 travers le temps et ont eu pour effet de complexifier leur t\u00e2che alors que l\u2019inverse s\u2019est produit pour les fonctions du groupe comparateur retenu, et ce tel qu\u2019il le sera d\u00e9montr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019instruction.\nVoir aussi, de mani\u00e8re non-exhaustive, les paragraphes : 47, 94.\n[67] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences et paragraphes reproduits ci-dessus, il existe un lien rationnel entre les documents demand\u00e9s et les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. Les documents sont donc potentiellement pertinents.\n[68] Par cons\u00e9quent, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 doit divulguer et produire ces documents aux parties, ce que j\u2019inclurai dans l\u2019ordonnance.\n(iv) Les documents, lettres, courriels, notes, questionnaires, portant ou traitant de l\u2019\u00e9valuation des postes et\/ou la cr\u00e9ation des monographies du groupe recherche et du groupe comparateur des techniciens de la cat\u00e9gorie 9 soit : les postes Technicien interm\u00e9diaire de mise en ondes; Aiguilleur interm\u00e9diaire; Cam\u00e9raman interm\u00e9diaire; Monteur interm\u00e9diaire; Technicien interm\u00e9diaire de son depuis le mois de juin 1995 \u00e0 ce jour\n[69] L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions amend\u00e9 du Syndicat en fait mention notamment au paragraphe: 33 :\nPar la suite, ces emplois ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divis\u00e9s en deux titres d\u2019emplois en mars 2006, soit les recherchistes et journalistes \u00e0 la recherche, et ce, \u00e0 l\u2019issue d\u2019un exercice paritaire d\u2019\u00e9valuation des emplois s\u2019\u00e9tant \u00e9chelonn\u00e9 de 2002 \u00e0 2006, et ce tel qu\u2019il appert notamment des monographies d\u2019emploi d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par la CCDP, pi\u00e8ces CCDP-432 et 440 et des questionnaires d\u2019emplois remplis \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque pour des postes du groupe professionnel de recherche exerc\u00e9s alors par (\u2026) pi\u00e8ces CCDP 475 en liasse.\n[70] Ainsi qu\u2019au paragraphe 34 :\nCet exercice de cr\u00e9ation de monographies a eu lieu apr\u00e8s que la SRC et le SCRC eurent convenu d\u2019un plan d\u2019\u00e9valuation des emplois reprenant notamment les crit\u00e8res pr\u00e9vus par l\u2019Ordonnance de 1986, et ce tel qu\u2019il appert du Plan d\u2019\u00e9valuation 2005, version 7, d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sous les pi\u00e8ces CCDP 406 et 407.\nVoir aussi, de mani\u00e8re non-exhaustive, les paragraphes: 35, 37, 38, 45, 52, 54, 59, 65, 66, 67, 68, 94.\n[71] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences et paragraphes reproduits ci-dessus, il existe un lien rationnel entre les documents demand\u00e9s et les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. Les documents sont donc potentiellement pertinents.\n[72] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 devra donc divulguer et produire ces documents aux parties, ce que j\u2019inclurai dans l\u2019ordonnance.\nV. Conclusion\n[73] J\u2019estime que cet expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions amend\u00e9 est suffisamment pr\u00e9cis pour permettre \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019identifier les documents potentiellement pertinents ayant un lien rationnel avec un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement recherch\u00e9.\n[74] \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape-ci du dossier, le groupe comparateur est identifi\u00e9 par le Syndicat comme pouvant se trouver dans le regroupement de sous-groupes des techniciens de Qu\u00e9bec et de Moncton de la cat\u00e9gorie 9 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9s dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions amend\u00e9 du Syndicat soit : Technicien interm\u00e9diaire de mise en ondes; Aiguilleur interm\u00e9diaire; Cameraman interm\u00e9diaire; Monteur interm\u00e9diaire; Technicien interm\u00e9diaire de son, Chef installateur technique (voir paragraphe 12 de l`expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions amend\u00e9 du Syndicat).\n[75] Je ne partage donc pas l\u2019avis de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 que l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions amend\u00e9 du Syndicat ainsi que le groupe comparateur sont impr\u00e9cis.\n[76] J\u2019arrive \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il existe un lien rationnel entre les documents demand\u00e9s et identifi\u00e9s au paragraphe 17 de cette d\u00e9cision et les faits, les questions ou les formes de redressement recherch\u00e9s par la Commission et le Syndicat. Comme il fut d\u00e9montr\u00e9 plus haut, les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement recherch\u00e9s sont \u00e9tay\u00e9es dans l`expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions amend\u00e9 du Syndicat. Par cons\u00e9quent, les documents sont donc potentiellement pertinents au pr\u00e9sent litige.\n[77] Une divulgation des documents en possession de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 permettra vraisemblablement, au Syndicat, de compl\u00e9ter sa preuve quant aux sous-groupes qui pourraient possiblement \u00eatre regroup\u00e9s afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir un groupe de comparaison. Ultimement, il en incombe au Syndicat d\u2019en faire la preuve lors de l\u2019instruction.\n[78] \u00c0 ce stade-ci du dossier, j\u2019estime que la mention des postes du groupe comparateur est suffisante pour les fins de la divulgation et celui-ci pourra \u00eatre clarifi\u00e9 davantage \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure et une fois que le Syndicat aura re\u00e7u et revu la divulgation de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Le Syndicat pourra ensuite, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, \u00e0 nouveau amender son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, pour clarifier les sous-groupes constituant le groupe comparateur. Les parties pourront aussi amender leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions pour r\u00e9pondre aux amendements du Syndicat, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n[79] Pour ce qui est de la demande de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 que le Tribunal ordonne au Syndicat de divulguer la m\u00e9thodologie qui sera utilis\u00e9e pour l\u2019\u00e9valuation des salaires, je consid\u00e8re cette demande pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e puisque le Syndicat affirme ne pas pouvoir compl\u00e9ter ses expertises qu\u2019\u00e0 la suite de la divulgation de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. De plus, la m\u00e9thodologie \u00e0 pr\u00e9coniser sera possiblement identifi\u00e9e par les experts.\n[80] Il est bien reconnu que ce type de dossier est fort complexe et commande une certaine flexibilit\u00e9 dans l\u2019approche \u00e0 utiliser comme celle adopt\u00e9e, au paragraphe 78, ci-dessus. L\u2019objectif ici, n\u2019est pas de permettre de d\u00e9naturer la plainte ou la th\u00e9orie de la cause mais plut\u00f4t, de permettre, au besoin, d\u2019y apporter des clarifications qui s\u2019av\u00e8rent n\u00e9cessaires pour les fins du litige (voir la R\u00e8gle 6(5)a). Au surplus, une approche formaliste exigeant au Syndicat de compl\u00e9ter sa preuve \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape-ci, avant que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n\u2019effectue sa divulgation, est pour le moins discutable.\n[81] Par exemple, le dossier dans Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2005 TCDP 39, s\u2019\u00e9chelonna sur 250 jours d\u2019audience sur sept ann\u00e9es et comportait des milliers de documents en preuve. Dans un autre dossier, il est fait mention qu\u2019une partie devait passer en revue quelques 40 000 documents en vue de dresser une liste de documents (voir Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Canada (Ministre du Personnel du gouvernement des Territoires du Nord-Ouest), 1999 CanLII 19858). Ce ne sont que deux exemples qui d\u00e9montrent la complexit\u00e9 de ce type de dossier et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pour chaque partie de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019une certaine flexibilit\u00e9.\nVI. Ordonnance\n[82] J\u2019ordonne au Syndicat de constituer une liste d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de tous les documents qui sont en sa possession pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9.\n[83] J\u2019ordonne au Syndicat de constituer une liste d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de tous les documents qui sont en sa possession pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation est invoqu\u00e9.\n[84] J\u2019ordonne au Syndicat de communiquer ces listes aux parties et au Tribunal d\u2019ici le 3 avril 2017.\n[85] J\u2019ordonne au Syndicat de fournir un affidavit affirmant que tous les documents en sa possession ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrits dans sa liste de divulgation et, en ce qui a trait aux documents pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9, confirmation qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s et produits aux parties. Cet affidavit accompagnera la liste de divulgation du Syndicat et sera communiqu\u00e9e aux parties et au Tribunal d\u2019ici le 3 avril 2017.\n[86] J\u2019ordonne \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de se conformer \u00e0 la R\u00e8gle 6 et plus particuli\u00e8rement, 6(1)(d) et (e) et 6(4)des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal.\n[87] J\u2019ordonne \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, de divulguer et de produire d\u2019ici le 5 juin 2017, tout document, lettre, courriel, note, pouvant \u00eatre potentiellement pertinent au pr\u00e9sent litige soit ayant un lien rationnel entre un document demand\u00e9 et les faits, les questions ou les formes de redressements recherch\u00e9s par toutes les parties incluant :\nLes conventions collectives SARDEC et ACTRA en vigueur entre 1995 et 1998;\nLes affichages de postes du groupe recherche et du groupe comparateur des techniciens de la cat\u00e9gorie 9 soit : les postes Technicien interm\u00e9diaire de mise en ondes;

D\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate 13\nI. Requ\u00eate pour modifier la plainte ou d\u00e9terminer sa port\u00e9e\n[1] Mme Donna Casler pr\u00e9tend que la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (le Canadien National \u2013 \u00ab CN \u00bb) a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit, dans le cadre de son emploi, pour des motifs fond\u00e9s sur le sexe et la d\u00e9ficience, en vertu des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (\u00ab la Loi \u00bb). En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, elle soutient que le CN l\u2019a trait\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9judiciable, a refus\u00e9 de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa d\u00e9ficience et a adopt\u00e9 des politiques ou des pratiques discriminatoires.\n[2] Lorsque Mme Casler a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission le 22 septembre 2004, elle \u00e9tait en arr\u00eat de travail depuis le mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2000, et cet arr\u00eat de travail \u00e9tait attribuable, selon elle, au fait que le CN n\u2019avait pas pris des mesures d\u2019accommodement par rapport \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience. Lorsque la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e devant ce Tribunal le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2014, le CN avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 Mme Casler le 6 septembre 2006. Mme Casler soutient que son cong\u00e9diement est l\u2019aboutissement du d\u00e9faut de mesures d\u2019accommodement, comme elle l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 dans sa plainte originale. La pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate vise donc \u00e0 inclure son cong\u00e9diement et les faits aff\u00e9rents, y compris certains faits ant\u00e9rieurs au mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2000, dans la port\u00e9e de l\u2019enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par le Tribunal concernant sa plainte. Par ailleurs, Mme Casler a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pour modifier sa plainte en vue d\u2019y ajouter ces renseignements.\n[3] Le CN soutient que la plainte d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e au Tribunal se limite \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode du 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 au 22 septembre 2004. Il estime que Mme Casler ne devrait pas \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 modifier sa plainte pour y inclure des questions qui ne co\u00efncident pas avec cette p\u00e9riode de renvoi; cela porterait pr\u00e9judice au CN.\n[4] Dans cette affaire, la Commission a limit\u00e9 sa participation aux conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de gestion d\u2019instance et n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019observations concernant cette requ\u00eate provisoire.\n[5] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s, je conclus que le renvoi de la plainte de Mme Casler devant la Commission ne se limite pas \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode du 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 au 22 septembre 2004. Les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es par Mme Casler concernant les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus avant et apr\u00e8s cette p\u00e9riode, ce qui inclut son cong\u00e9diement, s\u2019inscrivent bel et bien dans le champ d\u2019application de sa plainte.\nII. Questions \u00e0 trancher\n[6] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 et pris en consid\u00e9ration les observations des parties, j\u2019ai conclu que les questions suivantes sont celles qu\u2019il me faut trancher dans cette d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate :\nDans quelle mesure le Tribunal est-il apte \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e de la plainte ou les modifications qu\u2019il convient d\u2019y apporter?\nExiste-t-il une \u00e9ch\u00e9ance ou une port\u00e9e d\u00e9finie touchant le renvoi de la plainte de Mme Casler devant le Tribunal?\nLes \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus avant le 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 et apr\u00e8s le 22 septembre 2004 rel\u00e8vent-ils de la port\u00e9e de la plainte de Mme Casler?\nLe CN subira-t-il un pr\u00e9judice si les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus avant le 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 et apr\u00e8s le 22 septembre 2004 rel\u00e8vent de la port\u00e9e de la plainte de Mme Casler?\nIII. Analyse\nA. Dans quelle mesure le Tribunal est-il apte \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e de la plainte ou les modifications qu\u2019il convient d\u2019y apporter?\n[7] Le r\u00f4le du Tribunal est d\u2019instruire les plaintes qui lui sont d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9es par la Commission (voir les articles 40, 44 et 49 de la Loi). Par cons\u00e9quent, pour d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e d\u2019une plainte et s\u2019il faut autoriser des modifications \u00e0 celle-ci, il convient d\u2019examiner la plainte originale et la demande d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission, laquelle demande comprend g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement une lettre du pr\u00e9sident, la plainte originale et le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par la Commission. Lors de cet examen, le Tribunal s\u2019assure qu\u2019il existe un lien avec les all\u00e9gations qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte originale et que cela n\u2019outrepasse pas le mandat conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission, en vertu de la Loi, en ce qui a trait au renvoi. Autrement dit, la d\u00e9cision concernant la port\u00e9e ou les modifications ne peut pas introduire une plainte fondamentalement nouvelle, qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par la Commission [voir Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Parent, 2006 CF 1313 au paragraphe 30 (\u00ab Parent \u00bb); Kanagasabapathy c. Air Canada, 2013 TCDP 7 aux paragraphes 29 et 30 (\u00ab Kanagasabapathy \u00bb); Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 1 au paragraphe 9 (\u00ab Gaucher \u00bb)].\n[8] Cela dit, il faut garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une plainte constitue la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du processus de r\u00e9solution des plaintes en vertu de la Loi. Un ensemble de faits plus ou moins exacts sont alors avanc\u00e9s et doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s plus avant par la Commission. Comme l\u2019a affirm\u00e9 le Tribunal au paragraphe 11 de la d\u00e9cision Gaucher, \u00ab [i]l est in\u00e9vitable que de nouveaux faits et de nouvelles circonstances soient souvent r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s au cours de l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Il s\u2019ensuit que les plaintes sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es. \u00bb\n[9] En effet, la plainte originale ne tient pas lieu de plaidoirie dans le processus juridictionnel du Tribunal, menant \u00e0 une audience. Au contraire, ce sont les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions d\u00e9pos\u00e9s devant le Tribunal qui \u00e9noncent les conditions plus pr\u00e9cises de l\u2019audience. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 le fond de la plainte originale est respect\u00e9, la plaignante et la Commission devraient \u00eatre autoris\u00e9es \u00e0 clarifier et \u00e0 expliquer les all\u00e9gations initiales avant la tenue d\u2019une audience \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019affaire (voir Gaucher, au paragraphe 10).\n[10] Le r\u00f4le du Tribunal dans une requ\u00eate comme celle pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce consiste \u00e0 examiner les documents et les observations concernant la port\u00e9e ou les modifications demand\u00e9es, \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la teneur m\u00eame de la plainte et \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si la d\u00e9finition de la port\u00e9e ou les modifications demand\u00e9es sont li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019objet principal de la plainte et si elles sont n\u00e9cessaires pour permettre au Tribunal d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur les questions essentielles en litige. Ce faisant, il n\u2019incombe pas au Tribunal de r\u00e9examiner l\u2019enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par la Commission ou sa d\u00e9cision de d\u00e9f\u00e9rer la plainte sur la base des r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Cette comp\u00e9tence rel\u00e8ve exclusivement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (voir Waddle c. Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique et Conf\u00e9rence ferroviaire de Teamsters Canada, 2016 TCDP 8, aux paragraphes 32 \u00e0 38).\n[11] Comme lors de toutes ses interventions lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de rendre une d\u00e9cision concernant la port\u00e9e et les modifications, le Tribunal doit respecter les principes de justice naturelle et s\u2019assurer que chacune des parties a la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter sa preuve [voir les paragraphes 48.9(1) et 50(1) de la Loi]. Toute modification qui porte \u00e0 l\u2019une des parties un pr\u00e9judice grave et irr\u00e9parable ne devrait pas \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e [voir Cook c. Premi\u00e8re Nation D\u2019onion Lake, 2002 CanLII 61849 (TCDP), au paragraphe 20].\nB. Existe-t-il une \u00e9ch\u00e9ance ou une port\u00e9e d\u00e9finie touchant le renvoi de la plainte de Mme Casler devant le Tribunal?\n[12] Selon le CN, le renvoi de la plainte de Mme Casler devant le Tribunal par la Commission comprenait une limite temporelle visant sa port\u00e9e. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que la Commission a limit\u00e9 la port\u00e9e du renvoi aux all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es durant la p\u00e9riode du 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 au 22 septembre 2004.\n[13] Le CN soutient que, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u2019abord examin\u00e9 la plainte de Mme Casler en vertu de l\u2019article 41(1) de la Loi, la Commission a \u00e9crit une lettre dat\u00e9e du 6 janvier 2005 \u00e0 l\u2019attention des parties, indiquant qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de traiter uniquement les all\u00e9gations portant sur les faits survenus entre le 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 et le 22 septembre 2004. Le CN fait valoir que cette d\u00e9cision de la Commission n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9e ou modifi\u00e9e par une d\u00e9cision ult\u00e9rieure de la Commission. Par cons\u00e9quent, la seule d\u00e9cision de la Commission respectant la p\u00e9riode de la plainte est \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans cette lettre du 6 janvier 2005; cette d\u00e9cision est donc demeur\u00e9e d\u00e9terminante et a constamment \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9e durant les enqu\u00eates de la Commission touchant la plainte et, en d\u00e9finitive, dans sa d\u00e9cision de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal.\n[14] \u00c0 mon avis, la plainte n\u2019est pas vis\u00e9e par une limite temporelle ou une port\u00e9e d\u00e9finie comme l\u2019indique le CN. Les observations du CN ne tiennent pas compte de la s\u00e9rie d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements et de d\u00e9cisions qui sont survenus apr\u00e8s la lettre du 6 janvier 2005 de la Commission et, plus important encore, de l\u2019actuel renvoi de la plainte devant ce Tribunal.\n[15] Apr\u00e8s l\u2019enqu\u00eate initiale de la Commission, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 recommand\u00e9 que la plainte soit rejet\u00e9e; cette recommandation a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans une d\u00e9cision de la Commission dat\u00e9e du 17 juin 2009. Mme Casler a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de r\u00e9vision judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission. Alors qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas eu gain de cause \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (voir Casler c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2011 CF 148 [Casler 2011]), la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 l\u2019appel et renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire devant la Commission pour que cette derni\u00e8re m\u00e8ne une nouvelle enqu\u00eate (voir Casler c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2012 CAF 135 [Casler 2012]).\n[16] Le CN renvoie aux extraits des affaires Casler 2011 et Casler 2012 afin d\u2019appuyer son argument concernant la port\u00e9e temporelle et pour indiquer qu\u2019\u00e0 aucun moment avant la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate Mme Casler n\u2019a soulev\u00e9 la question de son cong\u00e9diement ou les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus en dehors de la p\u00e9riode du 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 au 22 septembre 2004.\n[17] Toutefois, la d\u00e9cision rendue dans l\u2019affaire Casler 2012 avait pour effet de rejeter la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eate et la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision de la Commission. La premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eate et la d\u00e9cision qui en a d\u00e9coul\u00e9 de ne pas renvoyer la plainte ne sont pas pertinentes puisque la d\u00e9cision subs\u00e9quente de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur une nouvelle enqu\u00eate et sur une nouvelle d\u00e9cision de la Commission. Les affaires Casler 2011 et Casler 2012 n\u2019appuient pas l\u2019affirmation du CN selon laquelle la plainte aurait une limite temporelle ou que sa port\u00e9e serait limit\u00e9e.\n[18] \u00c0 la suite d\u2019une nouvelle enqu\u00eate, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de renvoyer la plainte de Mme Casler devant le Tribunal le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2014. Les documents de saisine transmis au Tribunal comprennent un formulaire de plainte de quatre pages sign\u00e9 par Mme Casler le 22 septembre 2004. Ce formulaire n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 jour ou modifi\u00e9 par la Commission ou Mme Casler depuis ce temps. De plus, dans les documents de saisine, on retrouve un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par la Commission et contenant de l\u2019information dans les cases \u00ab num\u00e9ro de dossier \u00bb, \u00ab date de r\u00e9ception \u00bb, \u00ab nom de la plaignante \u00bb, \u00ab adresse et nom de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00bb et \u00ab endroit o\u00f9 l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement s\u2019est produit \u00bb; ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019information ne sont pas remis en cause.\n[19] Sous la rubrique [traduction] \u00ab date de la conduite pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e \u00bb, le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte pr\u00e9cise : [traduction] \u00ab du 14 octobre 1998 au 4 juillet 2000 et du 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 au 22 septembre 2004 et \u00e0 ce jour \u00bb.

Sous la rubrique [traduction] \u00ab articles applicables de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne \u00bb, on peut lire : [traduction] \u00ab 7 et 10 \u00bb.\n[20] Sous [traduction] \u00ab Pratiques (p. ex. cong\u00e9diement, harc\u00e8lement) \u00bb, on peut lire :\n[traduction] \u00ab Emploi - Traitement diff\u00e9rent et pr\u00e9judiciable\n- D\u00e9faut de mesures d\u2019accommodement\n- Politique ou pratique discriminatoire \u00bb\n[21] Le formulaire de plainte et le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte sont accompagn\u00e9s d\u2019une lettre de la Commission (sign\u00e9e par M. David Langtry) dat\u00e9e du 28 f\u00e9vrier 2014, \u00e0 l\u2019attention de Susheel Gupta, pr\u00e9sident int\u00e9rimaire du Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. La lettre se lit comme suit :\n[traduction]\n\u00ab Je vous \u00e9cris pour vous informer que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a examin\u00e9 la plainte (20040537) de Donna Casler visant la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada.\nLa Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, de vous demander d\u2019instruire la plainte, car elle est convaincue, compte tenu des circonstances, qu\u2019une enqu\u00eate est justifi\u00e9e.\nJe tiens \u00e9galement \u00e0 vous informer que la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement d\u2019instruire les seules all\u00e9gations portant sur les faits survenus \u00e0 partir du 25 ao\u00fbt 2000.\nVous trouverez ci-joint une copie de la plainte. Le formulaire no 1, qui comporte des informations sur la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e, sera transmis par la Division des services du contentieux.\nLa plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e seront inform\u00e9es qu\u2019elles recevront du Tribunal de plus amples renseignements sur cette instance. \u00bb\n[22] Le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte ne contient pas le terme \u00ab cong\u00e9diement \u00bb sous la rubrique [traduction] \u00ab Pratiques (p. ex. cong\u00e9diement, harc\u00e8lement) \u00bb et cette lettre de M. Langtry pr\u00e9cise que la Commission [traduction] \u00ab a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement d\u2019instruire les seules all\u00e9gations portant sur les faits survenus \u00e0 partir du 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 \u00bb, sans en expliquer la pertinence, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, au Tribunal.\n[23] Durant une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence tenue le 18 octobre 2016, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de la Commission s\u2019il avait des observations \u00e0 faire concernant cette lettre, mais aucune observation n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 ce moment et comme on l\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, la Commission n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune observation sur cette requ\u00eate.\n[24] Le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 que si la Commission a l\u2019intention de demander une enqu\u00eate portant sur seulement une partie d\u2019une plainte, cette intention doit \u00eatre \u00e9nonc\u00e9e explicitement dans la lettre de demande qu\u2019elle envoie au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal (voir Kanagasabapathy aux paragraphes 30 \u00e0 32; et Blodgett c. GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy Canada Inc., 2013 TCDP 24 au paragraphe 67).\n[25] La phrase de la lettre du 28 f\u00e9vrier 2014 de M. Langtry qui se lit comme suit [traduction] \u00ab [j]e tiens \u00e9galement \u00e0 vous informer que la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement d\u2019instruire les seules all\u00e9gations portant sur les faits survenus \u00e0 partir du 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 \u00bb est un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ambigu et n\u2019est pas une limite ou une restriction explicite de la port\u00e9e de la plainte renvoy\u00e9e devant le Tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne peux convenir du fait que cette phrase a pour but ou pour effet de limiter l\u2019enqu\u00eate du Tribunal aux seuls \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus apr\u00e8s le 25 ao\u00fbt 2000. Il n\u2019y a \u00e9galement aucune mention d\u2019une date de fin comme le 22 septembre 2004, \u00e0 part le fait qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de la date du formulaire de plainte original.\n[26] J\u2019estime que la Commission n\u2019a pas impos\u00e9 de limite temporelle par rapport \u00e0 la saisine du Tribunal en ce qui concerne la plainte de Mme Casler. Cela dit, la question essentielle de cette requ\u00eate n\u2019est pas de d\u00e9terminer quand ou \u00e0 quelle date les all\u00e9gations ou les \u00e9v\u00e9nements se sont produits, mais, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, si ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements et all\u00e9gations sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019essence de la plainte originale.\nC. Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus avant le 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 et apr\u00e8s le 22 septembre 2004 rel\u00e8vent-ils de la port\u00e9e de la plainte de Mme Casler?\n[27] Mme Casler soutient que son licenciement (le 6 septembre 2006) et les circonstances qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 celui-ci, telles qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, sont inextricablement li\u00e9s \u00e0 la plainte initiale qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e et dont le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi par la Commission. Sa plainte initiale pr\u00e9cisait que la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e \u00e9tait toujours d\u2019actualit\u00e9, puisqu\u2019\u00e0 la date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte le CN n\u2019avait pas encore pris de mesures d\u2019accommodement. Mme Casler soutient que son licenciement n\u2019est que l\u2019aboutissement logique de la discrimination continue exerc\u00e9e par le CN \u00e0 son endroit et du d\u00e9faut de mesures d\u2019accommodement de ce dernier, comme le pr\u00e9cisent les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans la plainte initiale.\n[28] Le CN soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun motif raisonnable pour modifier la plainte ou pour inclure les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus avant le 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 et apr\u00e8s le 22 septembre 2004 dans la port\u00e9e de la plainte de Mme Casler. Selon le CN, les circonstances factuelles survenues apr\u00e8s le 22 septembre 2004 et qui ont men\u00e9 au licenciement de Mme Casler sont distinctes des circonstances survenues de 2000 \u00e0 2004. En outre, le CN fait valoir que le simple fait que Mme Casler ait mentionn\u00e9 dans sa plainte que la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e \u00e9tait toujours d\u2019actualit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas suffisant pour justifier la modification ou l\u2019\u00e9largissement du champ d\u2019application demand\u00e9. Une plainte, par d\u00e9finition, doit \u00eatre clairement d\u00e9finie et ne peut porter sur un probl\u00e8me qui n\u2019existe pas encore. Le CN s\u2019oppose \u00e9galement \u00e0 ce que Mme Casler formule des arguments, et pr\u00e9cise que des preuves seront pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es relativement \u00e0 des questions remontant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode ant\u00e9rieure au 25 ao\u00fbt 2000.\n[29] Comme il est mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, en statuant sur cette requ\u00eate, le Tribunal doit \u00e9valuer les observations des parties et les documents de saisine re\u00e7us de la Commission pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe un lien logique, factuel ou causal entre la port\u00e9e ou la modification demand\u00e9e et la substance de la plainte initiale qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e par la Commission. En vue de statuer sur cette requ\u00eate, j\u2019ai examin\u00e9 les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions des parties et les observations de celles-ci, ainsi que les documents de saisine re\u00e7us de la Commission.\n[30] Dans son formulaire de plainte dat\u00e9 du 22 septembre 2004, Mme Casler all\u00e8gue que le CN a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit sur la base de son sexe et de sa d\u00e9ficience, en omettant de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour lui donner du travail qui lui convienne. Mme Casler affirme qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas travaill\u00e9 depuis le 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 parce que le CN ne lui a pas offert un travail convenable.\n[31] Dans sa plainte initiale et son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, Mme Casler d\u00e9crit et met en contexte les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus avant le 25 ao\u00fbt 2000, y compris ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de travail au CN, son diagnostic (fibromyalgie et enc\u00e9phalo-my\u00e9lite myalgique) et le cong\u00e9 de maladie qui a suivi, ainsi que sa version des \u00e9v\u00e9nements li\u00e9s \u00e0 ses tentatives de retour au travail et \u00e0 ses demandes de mesures d\u2019accommodement.\n[32] En ce qui concerne les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus apr\u00e8s le 22 septembre 2004, Mme Casler pr\u00e9tend, dans sa plainte initiale, que le manquement \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement est toujours d\u2019actualit\u00e9, puisqu\u2019\u00e0 la date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte, on ne lui avait pas encore offert un poste convenable. En fin de compte, elle n\u2019est pas retourn\u00e9e au travail et a \u00e9t\u00e9 licenci\u00e9e par le CN en septembre 2006. Dans leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions respectifs, les deux parties associent le licenciement au processus d\u2019accommodement continu.\n[33] Dans tous les \u00e9v\u00e9nements d\u00e9crits par Mme Casler, les parties sont les m\u00eames, l\u2019employeur est le m\u00eame et les motifs sont les m\u00eames, et Mme Casler all\u00e8gue que les pratiques discriminatoires pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es (c.-\u00e0-d. manquement \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement et omission d\u2019offrir un travail convenable) ont le m\u00eame motif, \u00e0 savoir la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience et le sexe.\n[34] Je suis convaincue que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus avant le 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 et apr\u00e8s le 22 septembre 2004 sont factuellement et logiquement li\u00e9s \u00e0 la substance de la plainte initiale de Mme Casler. Sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019examen des arguments du CN concernant le pr\u00e9judice ci-dessous, je conclus que pour que l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur les v\u00e9ritables questions en litige soit possible, Mme Casler devrait pouvoir inclure ses all\u00e9gations de discrimination continue, apr\u00e8s sa plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 22 septembre 2004, y compris en ce qui a trait \u00e0 son licenciement et \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des faits qui y ont men\u00e9, peu importe s\u2019ils se sont produits avant le 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 ou apr\u00e8s le 22 septembre 2004.\nD. Le CN subira-t-il un pr\u00e9judice si les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus avant le 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 et apr\u00e8s le 22 septembre 2004 rel\u00e8vent de la port\u00e9e de la plainte de Mme Casler?\n[35] Le CN soutient que, si l\u2019on d\u00e9terminait que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus avant le 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 et apr\u00e8s le 22 septembre 2004 rel\u00e8vent de la port\u00e9e de la plainte de Mme Casler, cela causerait un pr\u00e9judice \u00e9vident et inh\u00e9rent au CN en violation de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et de la justice naturelle.\n[36] Le CN formule deux arguments en ce qui a trait au pr\u00e9judice : le d\u00e9calage et le fait qu\u2019il a perdu la possibilit\u00e9 de demander \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019appliquer l\u2019article 41(1) de la Loi.\n(i) D\u00e9calage\n[37] Selon le CN, un pr\u00e9judice inh\u00e9rent est caus\u00e9 par le retard de pr\u00e8s de 10 ans mis pour pr\u00e9senter la demande de modification de la plainte suite au licenciement de Mme Casler. En outre, les all\u00e9gations remontant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode ant\u00e9rieure au 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 sont li\u00e9es \u00e0 des \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus il y a plus de 16 ans. Le CN soutient que les documents et \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9ventuels li\u00e9s \u00e0 ces all\u00e9gations sont ou peuvent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 perdus. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le CN fait remarquer que son employ\u00e9 charg\u00e9 de g\u00e9rer les mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de Mme Casler et le retour au travail de celle-ci apr\u00e8s septembre 2004 est maintenant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9. De plus, une infirmi\u00e8re en sant\u00e9 du travail du CN, qui avait \u00e9galement des responsabilit\u00e9s principales relatives au retour au travail de Mme Casler et aux mesures d\u2019accommodement en sa faveur, ne travaille plus au CN et demeure injoignable.\n[38] Comme le pr\u00e9cise la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Blencoe c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (Human Rights Commission), 2000 CSC 44, au paragraphe 101 : \u00ab ...le d\u00e9lai ne justifie pas, \u00e0 lui seul, un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures comme l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en common law. Mettre fin aux proc\u00e9dures simplement en raison du d\u00e9lai \u00e9coul\u00e9 reviendrait \u00e0 imposer une prescription d\u2019origine judiciaire. \u00bb Pour justifier le rejet de la plainte ou d\u2019un aspect de celle-ci comme le demande le CN, il doit \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019un pr\u00e9judice important a \u00e9t\u00e9 subi en raison d\u2019un d\u00e9lai inacceptable. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je prends \u00e9galement note des propos du juge Mactavish qui, dans sa d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 445, a mentionn\u00e9 (au paragraphe 140) que \u00ab la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour rejeter une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00e0 une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire ne devrait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e qu\u2019avec prudence, et seulement dans les cas les plus clairs \u00bb.\n[39] \u00c0 mon avis, le CN n\u2019a pas fourni la preuve d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice important \u00e0 ce stade de la proc\u00e9dure pour justifier le rejet des all\u00e9gations vis\u00e9es par cette requ\u00eate (c.-\u00e0-d. les all\u00e9gations li\u00e9es aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus avant le 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 et apr\u00e8s le 22 septembre 2004). M\u00eame si de nombreuses ann\u00e9es se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9es avant que la plainte de Mme Casler parvienne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019audience, comme il est mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le d\u00e9calage n\u2019est pas suffisant \u00e0 lui seul pour \u00e9tablir qu\u2019un pr\u00e9judice a \u00e9t\u00e9 subi. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la non-disponibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins et des documents connexes, l\u2019argument selon lequel un pr\u00e9judice a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 est sp\u00e9culatif \u00e0 ce stade. Le CN n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 la nature du pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019il a subi en raison de la non-disponibilit\u00e9 de ces t\u00e9moins et, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re en sant\u00e9 au travail, je fais remarquer que l\u2019on n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli clairement la raison pour laquelle elle est injoignable et ne sera pas disponible pour t\u00e9moigner lors de l\u2019audience. Je fais \u00e9galement remarquer que malgr\u00e9 l\u2019argument du CN selon lequel il a subi un pr\u00e9judice, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de pr\u00e9parer un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 tous les aspects de la plainte de Mme Casler, y compris ses all\u00e9gations li\u00e9es \u00e0 des \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus avant le 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 et apr\u00e8s le 22 septembre 2004.\n[40] J\u2019estime qu\u2019il vaut mieux trancher l\u2019all\u00e9gation de pr\u00e9judice formul\u00e9e par le CN au motif du d\u00e9calage apr\u00e8s l\u2019audition de cette affaire. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve par rapport aux effets du d\u00e9calage auront alors \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au Tribunal et soumis \u00e0 l\u2019examen des parties. Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que pour les besoins de cette requ\u00eate je rejette l\u2019argument du CN selon lequel le d\u00e9calage lui a caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice, rien ne l\u2019emp\u00eache de soulever de nouveau la question \u00e0 un stade ult\u00e9rieur de la proc\u00e9dure.\n(ii) Perte de la possibilit\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9valoir de l\u2019application, par la Commission, des dispositions de l\u2019article 41(1) de la Loi\n[41] Le CN soutient qu\u2019il subira un pr\u00e9judice du fait d\u2019avoir perdu la possibilit\u00e9 de faire en sorte que les all\u00e9gations de Mme Casler d\u00e9pos\u00e9es avant le 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 et apr\u00e8s le 22 septembre 2004 soient trait\u00e9es dans le cadre des fonctions de contr\u00f4le et d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission, en vertu de l\u2019article 41(1) de la Loi. \u00c0 ce titre, il a perdu la possibilit\u00e9 de contester tout renvoi de ces all\u00e9gations par la Commission au moyen d\u2019une r\u00e9vision judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[42] Dans la foul\u00e9e, le CN soutient que si l\u2019article 41(1)b) de la Loi devait s\u2019appliquer aux all\u00e9gations de cessation d\u2019emploi de Mme Casler, il est clair que les questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la cessation seraient consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme relevant de la comp\u00e9tence exclusive d\u2019un arbitre en droit du travail. S\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019affaire Canada (Chambre des communes) c. Vaid, 2005 CSC 30 (\u00ab Vaid \u00bb), le CN soutient que toutes les questions soulev\u00e9es par une convention collective, ou en lien avec une telle convention, rel\u00e8vent, dans le cas d\u2019un employeur assujetti \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, de la comp\u00e9tence exclusive d\u2019un arbitre en droit du travail habilit\u00e9 en vertu du Code canadien du travail. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour appliquer l\u2019article 41 de la Loi \u00e0 la suite du renvoi de la plainte, il ne peut donc rectifier ce pr\u00e9judice; il soutient le rejet de cette requ\u00eate.\n[43] En ce qui concerne la perte de la possibilit\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9valoir de l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission sur les all\u00e9gations en cause dans cette requ\u00eate, l\u2019all\u00e9gation de pr\u00e9judice n\u2019est recevable que si, dans les faits, une nouvelle plainte est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. Apr\u00e8s avoir conclu que les all\u00e9gations de Mme Casler d\u00e9pos\u00e9es avant le 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 et apr\u00e8s le 22 septembre 2004 ne constituent pas le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une nouvelle plainte, j\u2019estime qu\u2019aucun pr\u00e9judice n\u2019est caus\u00e9 au CN par suite de la perte de la possibilit\u00e9 que ces all\u00e9gations suivent le processus pr\u00e9vu par la Commission (voir Parent aux paragraphes 42 \u00e0 44).\n[44] S\u2019agissant de la d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Vaid, il \u00e9tait question d\u2019un employ\u00e9 faisant l\u2019objet d\u2019un processus de griefs en vertu de la Loi sur les relations de travail au Parlement (LRTP). Dans les circonstances entourant l\u2019emploi de M. Vaid et les all\u00e9gations entourant son licenciement, la Cour supr\u00eame a jug\u00e9 que sa plainte aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre examin\u00e9e au regard de la LRTP, et non de la Loi. Je ne vois pas, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Vaid, un appui \u00e0 la proposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du CN voulant que toutes les questions soulev\u00e9es par une convention collective, ou en lien avec une telle convention, rel\u00e8vent de la comp\u00e9tence exclusive d\u2019un arbitre en droit du travail habilit\u00e9 en vertu du Code canadien du travail, dans le cas d\u2019un employeur assujetti \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Outre l\u2019affaire Vaid, le CN n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune jurisprudence, fondement l\u00e9gislatif ou autre autorit\u00e9 pour d\u00e9fendre cette proposition.\n[45] En fin de compte, l\u2019examen des all\u00e9gations de Mme Casler par le Tribunal visera surtout \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question de savoir si sa d\u00e9ficience ou son sexe \u00e9taient des facteurs d\u00e9terminants de son licenciement, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi. Il n\u2019incombe pas au Tribunal d\u2019examiner le licenciement dans son ensemble en fonction de la convention collective, que ce licenciement ait \u00e9t\u00e9 injustifi\u00e9 ou injuste, et sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019obligation pour le CN de fournir un pr\u00e9avis ou verser une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part.\nIV. D\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate\n[46] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, je conclus que le renvoi de la plainte de Mme Casler devant la Commission en ce qui concerne la plainte de Mme Casler ne se limite pas \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode du 25 ao\u00fbt 2000 au 22 septembre 2004. Les all\u00e9gations qu\u2019elle a formul\u00e9es sur les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus avant et apr\u00e8s cette p\u00e9riode, notamment en ce qui concerne son cong\u00e9diement, s\u2019inscrivent bel et bien dans le champ d\u2019application de sa plainte.\n[47] Les parties sont avis\u00e9es qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment ne devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme un r\u00e8glement des questions en litige. Il incombe toujours \u00e0 Mme Casler d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de toutes ses all\u00e9gations. En outre, cette d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate ne constitue pas une d\u00e9termination de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 ou du poids d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve particulier. Un tel argument sera \u00e9voqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[48] Je ne pense pas qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019apporter une modification en bonne et due forme \u00e0 la plainte pour que le Tribunal re\u00e7oive l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par Mme Casler, et qui examine les all\u00e9gations vis\u00e9es par cette d\u00e9cision. Comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la plainte ne tient pas lieu de plaidoirie dans le processus juridictionnel du Tribunal qui m\u00e8ne \u00e0 la tenue d\u2019une audience. Au contraire, ce sont les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions d\u00e9pos\u00e9s devant le Tribunal qui \u00e9noncent les conditions plus pr\u00e9cises de l\u2019audience.\n[49] Le CN peut d\u00e9poser une version modifi\u00e9e de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions pour aborder un aspect vis\u00e9 par cette d\u00e9cision, et Mme Casler pourra r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces modifications, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\nSign\u00e9 par\nJ.

Requ\u00eate de la Nation Nishnawbe-Aski en vue d\u2019obtenir des ordonnances d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate\n[1] Dans la d\u00e9cision Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada et al. c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), 2016 TCDP 2 (la \u00ab D\u00e9cision \u00bb), la pr\u00e9sente formation a conclu que les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans une r\u00e9serve et au Yukon sont priv\u00e9s de services \u00e9quitables \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille et\/ou sont d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s dans le cadre de la prestation de ces services, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb). Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la mani\u00e8re dont Affaires autochtones et du Nord canadien (\u00ab AANC \u00bb) con\u00e7oit, g\u00e8re et contr\u00f4le le Programme des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations (le \u00ab Programme des SEFPN \u00bb), ainsi que ses mod\u00e8les de financement correspondants et les autres ententes provinciales-territoriales connexes, entra\u00eene des refus de services et cr\u00e9e de nombreux effets pr\u00e9judiciables pour un grand nombre d\u2019enfants et de familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans une r\u00e9serve. Entre autres, les autorisations de financement du Programme des SEFPN ne sont pas fond\u00e9es sur des lois ou des normes de service des provinces et des territoires, mais plut\u00f4t sur des niveaux et des formules de financement qui ne sont pas conformes aux lois et aux normes applicables.\n[2] Le Programme des SEFPN, les formules de financement correspondantes et les autres ententes provinciales-territoriales connexes s\u2019appliquent aux seuls membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui vivent dans une r\u00e9serve et au Yukon. C\u2019est uniquement \u00e0 cause de leur race ou de leur origine nationale ou ethnique que les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations subissent les effets pr\u00e9judiciables dans le cadre de la prestation des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et aux familles \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la D\u00e9cision. De plus, ces effets pr\u00e9judiciables perp\u00e9tuent les d\u00e9savantages historiques et les traumatismes subis par les peuples autochtones, notamment en raison du syst\u00e8me des pensionnats indiens.\n[3] Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 AANC de r\u00e9former le Programme des SEFPN et le Protocole d\u2019entente sur les programmes d\u2019aide sociale pour les Indiens (l\u2019\u00ab Entente de 1965 \u00bb) de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils concordent avec les conclusions tir\u00e9es dans la D\u00e9cision. Il lui a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 de cesser d\u2019appliquer sa d\u00e9finition \u00e9troite du principe de Jordan et de prendre les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour appliquer imm\u00e9diatement ce principe en lui donnant sa pleine port\u00e9e et tout son sens.\n[4] La Nation Nishnawbe-Aski (\u00ab NNA \u00bb) sollicite diverses ordonnances d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate qui d\u00e9coulent de la D\u00e9cision ainsi que de deux d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate ult\u00e9rieures (voir 2016 TCDP 10 et 2016 TCDP 16).\n[5] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, la NNA sollicite des ordonnances concernant la prestation de services de sant\u00e9 mentale aux Premi\u00e8res Nations de l\u2019Ontario, la mise au point d\u2019un quotient d\u2019\u00e9loignement \u00e0 appliquer au financement des organismes de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance de la NNA, de m\u00eame que d\u2019autres mesures d\u2019aide propres aux divers organismes concern\u00e9s.\n[6] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada, l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res Nations, les Chiefs of Ontario et la Commission ont \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des requ\u00eates distinctes sollicitant des ordonnances d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate. La requ\u00eate de la NNA a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue du 22 au 24 mars 2017, \u00e0 Ottawa, parall\u00e8lement \u00e0 celles des autres parties.\n[7] La formation s\u2019est r\u00e9jouie d\u2019apprendre au cours de l\u2019audience que la NNA et AANC sont parvenus \u00e0 s\u2019entendre sur certains aspects de la requ\u00eate de la NNA. La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision de la formation, incorpore ces ententes. Les autres ordonnances sollicit\u00e9es par la NNA ne sont pas vis\u00e9es par la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate et feront l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate distincte.\nII. Ajournement de la demande d\u2019ordonnance ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention du suicide\n[8] En janvier 2017, deux enfants \u00e2g\u00e9s de 12 ans se sont tragiquement enlev\u00e9 la vie dans la Premi\u00e8re Nation Wapekeka (\u00ab la PN Wapekeka \u00bb), une collectivit\u00e9 de la NNA. Avant la mort de ces enfants, la PN Wapekeka avait pr\u00e9venu le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de Sant\u00e9 Canada, qu\u2019elle s\u2019inqui\u00e9tait d\u2019un pacte de suicide conclu au sein d\u2019un groupe de jeunes enfants et d\u2019adolescents. Cette information figurait dans une proposition d\u00e9taill\u00e9e dat\u00e9e de juillet 2016, qui \u00e9tait destin\u00e9e \u00e0 obtenir des fonds en vue de mettre sur pied une \u00e9quipe communautaire de sant\u00e9 mentale \u00e0 titre de mesure pr\u00e9ventive.\n[9] La proposition de la PN Wapekeka est rest\u00e9e sans r\u00e9ponse de la part du Canada pendant plusieurs mois, et une r\u00e9ponse r\u00e9active n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e qu\u2019apr\u00e8s le suicide des deux jeunes. La r\u00e9ponse m\u00e9diatique de Sant\u00e9 Canada a \u00e9t\u00e9 la suivante : le minist\u00e8re reconnaissait avoir re\u00e7u en septembre 2016 la proposition de juillet 2016, mais celle-ci avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 un [traduction] \u00ab moment peu propice dans le cycle de financement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00bb (voir l\u2019affidavit du Dr Michael Kirlew, 27 janvier 2017, au par. 16). La formation est consciente que cette r\u00e9ponse est inacceptable dans de telles circonstances et que cela a certainement d\u00fb causer des souffrances suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[10] Malheureusement, en f\u00e9vrier 2017 deux autres jeunes \u00e2g\u00e9s de 11 ans et de 21 ans se sont enlev\u00e9 la vie dans deux collectivit\u00e9s de la NNA : Deer Lake et Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug (voir l\u2019affidavit de Sol Mamakwa, 13 f\u00e9vrier 2017, au par. 5).\n[11] La formation tient \u00e0 offrir ses condol\u00e9ances aux familles et aux collectivit\u00e9s de ces jeunes, de m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e0 tous ceux qui ont perdu des enfants, dans de semblables et tragiques circonstances.\n[12] Dans sa D\u00e9cision, la formation a tir\u00e9 des conclusions au sujet des lacunes relev\u00e9es dans les services de sant\u00e9 mentale destin\u00e9s aux enfants et aux jeunes des Premi\u00e8res Nations. En particulier, elle a relev\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la prestation de ces services des probl\u00e8mes de comp\u00e9tence entre AANC et Sant\u00e9 Canada, qui cr\u00e9aient des effets pr\u00e9judiciables et des refus de services pour les enfants et les familles des Premi\u00e8res Nations. En ce qui concerne plus particuli\u00e8rement l\u2019Ontario, les services de sant\u00e9 mentale ne sont pas couverts par l\u2019Entente de 1965, m\u00eame s\u2019il en est question dans la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille de l\u2019Ontario (voir les par. 217-223, 239-242, 246, 364-373, 391-392 et 458 de la D\u00e9cision).\n[13] Dans une ordonnance faisant suite \u00e0 la D\u00e9cision et portant express\u00e9ment sur l\u2019Entente de 1965, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 AANC de fournir une justification, des donn\u00e9es et d\u2019autres informations pertinentes dans le but d\u2019aider la formation \u00e0 comprendre la mesure dans laquelle les investissements de son budget de 2016 correspondent aux besoins des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations et comment ils r\u00e9pondent, \u00e0 court terme, aux conclusions tir\u00e9es dans la D\u00e9cision \u00e0 propos des services de sant\u00e9 mentale (voir 2016 TCDP 16, au par. 73).\n[14] En r\u00e9ponse, AANC a fait savoir qu\u2019il s\u2019occupait d\u2019examiner la prestation de services suppl\u00e9mentaires dans le cadre de l\u2019Entente de 1965, comme des services de sant\u00e9 mentale, dans le cadre d\u2019un processus d\u2019engagement et de r\u00e9forme \u00e0 plus long terme avec des discussions \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale et r\u00e9gionale.\n[15] Mme Robin Buckland, directrice ex\u00e9cutive du Bureau des soins de sant\u00e9 primaires, un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la sant\u00e9 des Premi\u00e8res Nations et des Inuits de Sant\u00e9 Canada, a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve par affidavit et a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9e sur la trag\u00e9die survenue dans la PN Wapekeka. Elle n\u2019avait aucune r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 donner pour expliquer pourquoi la proposition de la PN Wapekeka \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e sans r\u00e9ponse. Toutefois, selon elle, les lacunes relev\u00e9es sur le plan des services de sant\u00e9 mentale, et cr\u00e9\u00e9es par l\u2019Entente de 1965, [traduction] \u00ab pourraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 juste titre comme une affaire relevant du principe de Jordan \u00bb.\n[16] C\u2019est dans ce contexte que la NNA sollicite une ordonnance ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention du suicide, prescrivant que l\u2019on accorde des fonds au titre du principe de Jordan \u00e0 toute collectivit\u00e9 autochtone qui pr\u00e9sente une proposition (semblable \u00e0 celle de la PN Wapekeka) faisant \u00e9tat d\u2019enfants et de jeunes vuln\u00e9rables au suicide.\n[17] Le 22 mars 2017, Sant\u00e9 Canada s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tablir avec la NNA un Groupe de travail sur la pr\u00e9vention du suicide, destin\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tablir un processus concret et simplifi\u00e9 par lequel les collectivit\u00e9s pourront pr\u00e9senter une demande de financement dans le cadre de l\u2019Initiative \u00ab L\u2019enfant d\u2019abord \u00bb (principe de Jordan) (voir l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb). Dans ce contexte, la NNA a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la formation d\u2019ajourner sine die sa requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 obtenir une ordonnance ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention du suicide, et elle a propos\u00e9 de soumettre \u00e0 la formation un rapport sur le Groupe de travail sur la pr\u00e9vention du suicide d\u2019ici au 6 septembre 2017.\n[18] La formation fait droit \u00e0 la demande de la NNA d\u2019ajourner sa requ\u00eate d\u2019une ordonnance ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention du suicide et trouve vraiment encourageante l\u2019initiative de la mise sur pied du Groupe de travail sur la pr\u00e9vention du suicide. D\u2019ici au 6 septembre 2017, la NNA pr\u00e9sentera \u00e0 la formation un rapport \u00e9crit sur ce groupe de travail et fera savoir si elle continuera ou non de solliciter un ajournement de sa demande d\u2019obtention d\u2019une ordonnance ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention du suicide.\nIII. Entente sur la mise au point et l\u2019application d\u2019un quotient d\u2019\u00e9loignement\n[19] Depuis qu\u2019elle s\u2019est jointe \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance \u00e0 titre de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e en mai 2016, la NNA s\u2019efforce d\u2019aborder la conception et l\u2019application des ordonnances de la formation en s\u2019attachant particuli\u00e8rement au contexte des collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es et nordiques de l\u2019Ontario. Elle pr\u00e9conise l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019un nouveau quotient d\u2019\u00e9loignement afin de faire en sorte que les fonds destin\u00e9s aux collectivit\u00e9s nordiques isol\u00e9es tiennent compte des co\u00fbts \u00e9lev\u00e9s de la vie ainsi que des co\u00fbts extraordinaires qu\u2019entra\u00eene la prestation de services dans ces collectivit\u00e9s.\n[20] En fait, ceci fut reconnu dans sa D\u00e9cision dans laquelle la formation a conclu que le Programme des SEFPN restreignait [la] capacit\u00e9 des organismes de SEFPN en r\u00e9gion \u00e9loign\u00e9e de recruter et de retenir du personnel et de donner des services. Par cons\u00e9quent, la formation a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 AANC d\u2019examiner sans d\u00e9lai la mani\u00e8re dont il d\u00e9termine les fonds destin\u00e9s aux organismes du Programme des SEFPN en r\u00e9gion \u00e9loign\u00e9e. Le financement actuel ne tient pas compte d\u2019aspects tels que les d\u00e9placements \u00e0 effectuer pour fournir des services ou y avoir acc\u00e8s, le co\u00fbt \u00e9lev\u00e9 de la vie et de la prestation de services dans les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es, de m\u00eame que l\u2019effet combin\u00e9 de la r\u00e9duction du financement de base destin\u00e9 aux organismes en r\u00e9gion \u00e9loign\u00e9e qui peuvent aussi \u00eatre des organismes de petite taille (voir les par. 213-233 et 291 de la D\u00e9cision). Dans sa d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate ult\u00e9rieure (2016 TCDP 16), la formation a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 AANC de fournir des renseignements d\u00e9taill\u00e9s, qui montrent clairement comment il d\u00e9termine les fonds destin\u00e9s aux organismes de SEFPN en r\u00e9gion \u00e9loign\u00e9e pour leur permettre de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins r\u00e9els des collectivit\u00e9s qu\u2019ils servent (voir la d\u00e9cision 2016 TCDP 16, au par. 81).\n[21] AANC et la NNA se sont maintenant entendus sur des modalit\u00e9s de mise au point et d\u2019application d\u2019un quotient d\u2019\u00e9loignement pour les trois organismes de SEFPN qui servent les collectivit\u00e9s de la NNA. AANC financera la mise au point de ce quotient. Le cadre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pr\u00e9cis de leur entente est en annexe (annexe A). La formation adopte ce cadre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, comme l\u2019indique l\u2019ordonnance qui suit et conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi.\n[22] Une fois de plus, la formation se r\u00e9jouit du fait qu\u2019AANC et la NNA aient conclu cette entente. Les autres parties appuient \u00e9galement cette derni\u00e8re, mais elles attendent la mise au point et l\u2019application d\u00e9finitives du quotient d\u2019\u00e9loignement dans les collectivit\u00e9s de la NNA avant d\u2019adopter une position sur son application dans tout le pays. Dans ce contexte, le Tribunal r\u00e9servera sa comp\u00e9tence en vue de revenir sur la question du quotient d\u2019\u00e9loignement et, \u00e9ventuellement, de modifier ou clarifier son ordonnance. Comme dans le cas de l\u2019ordonnance ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention du suicide, la NNA a propos\u00e9 de faire rapport \u00e0 la formation sur la mise au point et l\u2019application du quotient d\u2019\u00e9loignement d\u2019ici au 6 septembre 2017.\n[23] La formation signale aussi que le fait de souscrire \u00e0 l\u2019entente convenue entre AANC et la NNA n\u2019a pas d\u2019incidence sur les autres mesures d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate que demandent les parties. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, les requ\u00eates et les mesures que les autres parties ont demand\u00e9es \u2013 ainsi que les autres mesures sollicit\u00e9es par la NNA et qui ne sont pas vis\u00e9es par la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate \u2013 seront examin\u00e9es dans une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate distincte. Enfin, il n\u2019y a pas lieu de consid\u00e9rer que le fait que la formation souscrive \u00e0 l\u2019entente convenue entre AANC et la NNA modifie les mesures d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 ordonn\u00e9es.\nIV. Ordonnance\n[24] Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les parties et examin\u00e9 leurs observations \u00e9crites sur la requ\u00eate en mesures d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate de la NNA et les solutions trouv\u00e9es ult\u00e9rieurement avec AANC, le Tribunal ordonne ce qui suit :\nLa requ\u00eate de la NNA d\u2019une ordonnance ax\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9vention du suicide est ajourn\u00e9e sine die. La NNA pr\u00e9sentera \u00e0 la formation un rapport sur le Groupe de travail sur la pr\u00e9vention du suicide d\u2019ici au 6 septembre 2017 et elle indiquera si elle continue ou non de solliciter l\u2019ajournement de sa demande d\u2019ordonnance;\nAANC et la NNA s\u2019efforceront de mettre au point et d\u2019appliquer une formule de financement de mesures d\u2019aide imm\u00e9diate pour les trois organismes de SEFPN qui servent les collectivit\u00e9s de la NNA, conform\u00e9ment au cadre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence joint \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance en annexe (annexe B);\nAANC versera \u00e0 la NNA, dans les 30 jours suivant la date de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, des fonds d\u2019un montant de 77 931,02 $, TVH comprise, pour la phase 1, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la proposition d\u2019expert fournie par la NNA \u00e0 AANC, selon le cadre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence;\nAANC fournira \u00e0 la NNA les donn\u00e9es empiriques disponibles, dont la NNA et AANC ont convenu pour la phase 1, et ce, d\u2019ici au 15 avril 2017;\nLa NNA fera part des r\u00e9sultats de la phase 1 \u00e0 AANC d\u2019ici au 15 juillet 2017;\nConform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 4 du cadre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, AANC s\u2019engagera \u00e0 faire une nouvelle mise \u00e0 jour du rapport Barnes en se servant des donn\u00e9es du recensement de 2016 ainsi que de toutes les autres donn\u00e9es disponibles pertinentes dont conviendront la NNA et AANC;\nD\u2019ici au 6 septembre 2017 et tous les six mois par la suite, tant que la formation demeurera saisie de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, AANC et la NNA pr\u00e9senteront au Tribunal un compte rendu actualis\u00e9 de l\u2019avancement du travail de collecte et d\u2019analyse de donn\u00e9es li\u00e9 au cadre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\n[25] La formation conservera sa comp\u00e9tence sur les ordonnances susmentionn\u00e9es, au cas o\u00f9 il serait n\u00e9cessaire de les modifier ou de les clarifier ult\u00e9rieurement.\nV. Conclusions\n[26] Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience qui s\u2019est tenue du 22 au 24 mars 2017, la pr\u00e9sidente de la formation a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n[traduction] Voici quelques paroles d\u2019espoir, car sans espoir et sans vision, les gens p\u00e9rissent. La v\u00e9rit\u00e9 doit toujours \u00eatre dite, m\u00eame si elle est difficile \u00e0 entendre. C\u2019est une composante de la justice. Mais cela ne veut pas dire que nous ne pouvons pas \u00eatre porteurs d\u2019espoir; cet espoir, nous devons le faire na\u00eetre.\nL\u2019espoir est ce qui fait battre le c\u0153ur d\u2019une nation. Il donne aux gens la force de vaincre les obstacles qui paraissent insurmontables. Il rassemble les gens autour d\u2019un objectif commun et les incite \u00e0 avancer malgr\u00e9 l\u2019adversit\u00e9. J\u2019aimerais dire \u00e0 chacun que vous \u00eates tous pr\u00e9cieux et qu\u2019il y a toujours de l\u2019espoir.\n[27] La formation est d\u2019avis que les ententes conclues entre la NNA et AANC sont porteuses d\u2019espoir.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nPr\u00e9sidente de la formation\nEdward P.

Conclusion 68\nI. Plainte\n[1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 la plainte du 5 juin 2009 que Jessica Mary Stanger, la plaignante, a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e contre la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (la SCP ou Postes Canada), l\u2019intim\u00e9e, all\u00e9guant que cette derni\u00e8re a fait preuve \u00e0 son endroit de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience et son \u00e9tat matrimonial.\n[2] Le 11 juin 2012, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a demand\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte, aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, c. H\u20116 (la LCDP).\n[3] Mme Stanger a comparu et t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience, avec le soutien comp\u00e9tent de son \u00e9poux, M. Patrick Stanger qui, bien qu\u2019il ne soit pas avocat, s\u2019est remarquablement orient\u00e9 dans la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019audience du Tribunal. L\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat, Me Zygmunt Machelak. La Commission n\u2019a pas comparu \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[4] L\u2019audience s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e \u00e0 Victoria, en Colombie\u2011Britannique (BC), en trois cycles distincts d\u2019une semaine, d\u2019octobre 2013 \u00e0 janvier 2014, pour l\u2019essentiel. Il a fallu ensuite attendre de recevoir la d\u00e9position sur affidavit d\u2019un t\u00e9moin qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas assez bien portant pour t\u00e9moigner en personne. Cette proc\u00e9dure a pris plusieurs mois. Les plaidoyers finals ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus en juillet 2015.\nII. Aper\u00e7u\n[5] Mme Stanger est une employ\u00e9e de longue date de Postes Canada. Dans sa plainte, elle all\u00e8gue une discrimination en milieu de travail fond\u00e9e sur deux motifs : d\u2019une part, certains de ses coll\u00e8gues auraient fait preuve \u00e0 son endroit de discrimination en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience physique partielle. D\u2019autre part, d\u2019autres coll\u00e8gues ainsi que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (SCP) auraient agi de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en raison de sa relation et de son mariage ult\u00e9rieur avec un chef de service de Postes Canada.\nIII. D\u00e9cision\n[6] Pour les motifs qui suivent, j\u2019ai conclu qu\u2019une des all\u00e9gations avanc\u00e9es dans la plainte \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e. Les autres ne le sont pas et sont donc rejet\u00e9es.\nIV. All\u00e9gations de discrimination\n[7] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, Mme Stanger a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de 18 \u00e9v\u00e9nements distincts dont elle pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019ils constituent une discrimination illicite aux termes de la LCDP. Ses all\u00e9gations reposent sur deux motifs de discrimination pr\u00e9vus au paragraphe 3(1) de la loi: l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial et la d\u00e9ficience.\n[8] Mme Stanger all\u00e8gue cinq actes de discrimination aux termes de l\u2019article 7: une promotion lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e et elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e diff\u00e9remment, car certaines t\u00e2ches lui ont injustement \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9es en raison de son \u00e9tat matrimonial. Elle fait aussi valoir trois actes de discrimination fond\u00e9s sur sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[9] Mme Stanger all\u00e8gue en outre qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement li\u00e9 \u00e0 son emploi aux termes de l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP : sept \u00e9v\u00e9nements concernent des all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement li\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9tat matrimonial et trois autres \u00e9v\u00e9nements concernent des all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement li\u00e9 \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience.\nA. Cadre juridique\nArticle 7 de la LCDP\n[10] L\u2019article 7 de la LCDP pr\u00e9cise :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\n[11] Dans les affaires de droit de la personne, il incombe au plaignant d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire une preuve \u00ab [\u2026] qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 \u00bb. (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O\u2019Malley c. Simpsons\u2011Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536 (\u00ab O\u2019Malley \u00bb), p. 558).\n[12] Pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination dans le contexte de la LCDP, les plaignants doivent montrer: (1) qu\u2019ils poss\u00e8dent une caract\u00e9ristique que la LCDP prot\u00e8ge contre la discrimination; (2) qu\u2019ils ont subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable du fait d\u2019une situation vis\u00e9e par les articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 de la LCDP; et (3) que la ou les caract\u00e9ristiques prot\u00e9g\u00e9es ont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable (voir Moore c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61, au paragraphe 33; Siddoo c. SIDM, section locale 502, 2015 TCDP 21, paragraphe 28). Les trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la discrimination doivent \u00eatre prouv\u00e9s selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s (voir Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier A\u00e9ronautique Centre de formation) (\u00ab Bombardier \u00bb), 2015 CSC 39l, aux paragraphes 55 \u00e0 69).\n[13] Le Tribunal a reconnu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait difficile de prouver des all\u00e9gations de discrimination par une preuve directe. Ainsi qu\u2019il le soulignait dans Basi c. Cie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada 1988 CanLII 108 (TCDP) (\u00ab Basi \u00bb): \u00ab La discrimination n\u2019est pas un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne qui se manifeste ouvertement, comme on serait port\u00e9 \u00e0 le croire. Il est rare en effet qu\u2019on puisse prouver par des preuves directes qu\u2019un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis intentionnellement \u00bb. Il convient plut\u00f4t d\u2019examiner l\u2019ensemble des circonstances pour d\u00e9terminer si elles correspondent \u00e0 ce qui est d\u00e9crit dans la d\u00e9cision Basi comme \u00ab [\u2026] de subtiles odeurs de discrimination \u00bb.\n[14] Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, pour qu\u2019une plainte aboutisse, que les actes en cause soient uniquement motiv\u00e9s par des consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires. Il suffit que la discrimination soit entr\u00e9e en ligne de compte dans les actes ou les d\u00e9cisions de l\u2019employeur (Holden c. Cie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (C.A.F.)). Il incombe n\u00e9anmoins \u00e0 la plaignante de montrer qu\u2019il existe un lien entre le traitement pr\u00e9judiciable et un motif de discrimination illicite (voir Bombardier, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9, au paragraphe 52.)\n[15] Une fois la preuve prima facie de discrimination \u00e9tablie par le plaignant, ce dernier a droit \u00e0 un redressement en l\u2019absence de justification de la part de l\u2019employeur (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202, \u00e0 la page 208; Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204, au paragraphe 18).\nArticle 14 de la LCDP\n[16] L\u2019article 14 de la LCDP pr\u00e9cise :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu :\na) lors de la fourniture de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public;\nb) lors de la fourniture de locaux commerciaux ou de logements;\nc) en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi.\n[17] L\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial et la d\u00e9ficience constituent des motifs illicites de discrimination aux termes du paragraphe 3(1) de la LCDP.\n[18] Mme Stanger pr\u00e9tend que plusieurs \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus en milieu de travail constituaient du harc\u00e8lement.\n[19] Le Tribunal a tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9finir le harc\u00e8lement comme des mots ou des actes malvenus, ou qui devraient raisonnablement \u00eatre compris comme tels, li\u00e9s \u00e0 un motif illicite de discrimination, et susceptibles de nuire \u00e0 l\u2019environnement de travail ou d\u2019emporter des cons\u00e9quences professionnelles pr\u00e9judiciables pour la victime. Le harc\u00e8lement d\u00e9signe g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement des actes r\u00e9p\u00e9titifs ou persistants, quoiqu\u2019un seul acte grave puisse suffire \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un environnement de travail hostile (voir Janzen c. Platy Enterprises Ltd., [1989] 1 RCS 1252; et Kimberley Franke et Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, [1999] 3 CF 653 (\u00ab Franke \u00bb)). S\u2019agissant du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience, le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 que la cl\u00e9 \u00e9tait de d\u00e9terminer si la conduite a viol\u00e9 la dignit\u00e9 de l\u2019employ\u00e9 d\u2019un point de vue objectif, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail hostile ou malsain (voir Croteau c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2014 TCDP 16 (\u00ab Croteau \u00bb), au paragraphe 43).\n[20] Dans un contexte d\u2019all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement non sexuel, le Tribunal se demande si les commentaires concernant la d\u00e9ficience de l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 sont pertinents pour les activit\u00e9s l\u00e9gitimes et les objectifs op\u00e9rationnels de l\u2019employeur ou compatibles avec eux. Dans l\u2019affirmative, de tels commentaires ne constituent pas du harc\u00e8lement. D\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, les remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes ou les questions inutiles concernant la d\u00e9ficience sont inopportunes et n\u2019ont rien \u00e0 voir avec la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, les activit\u00e9s et les objectifs op\u00e9rationnels de l\u2019employeur. Une telle conduite, si elle est humiliante ou vexatoire, peut constituer du harc\u00e8lement (Voir Day c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2007 TCDP 43 (\u00ab Day \u00bb), au paragraphe 184.)\n[21] Aux paragraphes 45\u201146 de la d\u00e9cision Siddoo c. Syndicat international des d\u00e9bardeurs et magasiniers, section locale 502, 2015 TCDP 21 (contr\u00f4le judiciaire en instance, T \u20111742\u201115), le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 plus attentivement la signification du harc\u00e8lement :\nTout acte qui cause \u00e0 autrui une forme quelconque d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme du harc\u00e8lement. Ce qui offense une personne peut en laisser une autre indiff\u00e9rente. En outre, personne n\u2019est parfait, et il peut tous nous arriver \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019agir sans r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir, de nous montrer insensibles ou encore d\u2019\u00eatre tout bonnement stupides. Cela veut\u2011il dire qu\u2019il ne peut jamais y avoir d\u2019interactions s\u00fbres entre personnes? La question n\u2019est pas tant de savoir si une personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 offens\u00e9e ou s\u2019est sentie humili\u00e9e, mais de savoir par quelle mesure objective on peut d\u00e9finir le harc\u00e8lement de sorte que chacun saura toujours exactement comment se comporter pour l\u2019\u00e9viter.\nJe ne crois pas que l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP ait pour but de viser chaque sottise ou geste insensible commis en milieu de travail. Le harc\u00e8lement est un mot s\u00e9rieux, qui ne doit pas \u00eatre employ\u00e9 \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re, mais auquel il faut avoir vigoureusement recours lorsque la situation le justifie. Agir autrement serait le banaliser. Il ne faut pas le d\u00e9valoriser ni en diminuer l\u2019importance en le lan\u00e7ant \u00e0 tort et \u00e0 travers pour des petites m\u00e9chancet\u00e9s ou des paroles \u00e9chapp\u00e9es lorsque le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9, selon toute norme objective, est \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re.\n[22] Dans la d\u00e9cision Rampersadsingh c. Wignall, 2002 CanLII 23563 (TCDP), au paragraphe 55, le Tribunal a \u00e9galement not\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait important de ne pas banaliser la protection accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP :\n[55] La m\u00eame question a \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec dans l\u2019affaire Habachi c. Commission des droits de la personne du Qu\u00e9bec. La Cour a reconnu qu\u2019une seule action, dans la mesure o\u00f9 celle-ci est suffisamment grave et qu\u2019elle comporte un effet continu, peut constituer du harc\u00e8lement. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, Mme la juge Deschamps a laiss\u00e9 entendre qu\u2019un seul incident d\u2019agression sexuelle au travail peut comporter un effet insidieux, durable et d\u00e9favorable, ce qui suffit \u00e0 constituer du harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Toutefois, M. le juge Baudouin a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9, dans la m\u00eame affaire, que si l\u2019on conclut que les gestes ne sont pas suffisamment graves, mais qu\u2019ils constituent n\u00e9anmoins du harc\u00e8lement, il en r\u00e9sulterait la banalisation d\u2019une disposition de la Loi dont l\u2019objet est d\u2019aborder une forme bien particuli\u00e8re de discrimination [\u2026]\nV. Faits contextuels d\u2019ordre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\n[23] Plusieurs faits contextuels doivent \u00eatre relev\u00e9s, et aucun d\u2019eux n\u2019est contest\u00e9 par les parties. Mme Stanger a d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9e par Postes Canada en 1989 \u00e0 Calgary. En 1991, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 Victoria \u00e0 un poste de commis. En 1999, elle a subi une blessure au cou, sans lien avec son travail, qui l\u2019a laiss\u00e9e avec deux disques vert\u00e9braux bomb\u00e9s. En 2000, Postes Canada a conclu qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une employ\u00e9e souffrant d\u2019une \u00ab d\u00e9ficience partielle permanente \u00bb, couramment d\u00e9sign\u00e9e dans l\u2019entreprise comme une DPP.\n[24] De juin 2000 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son d\u00e9part de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de traitement du courrier de Victoria (ETCVic) en 2008, la DPP de Mme Stanger impliquait les restrictions suivantes \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de travail :\nPoids soulev\u00e9 du sol \u00e0 la taille : maximum de 10 livres.\nTransport d\u2019articles \u00e0 l\u2019aide des deux mains : maximum de 15 livres.\nPosition debout : maximum de deux heures.\n[25] Postes Canada a facilit\u00e9 le retour au travail de Mme Stanger de 2002 \u00e0 2004 par le biais d\u2019un programme de retour progressif au travail. En 2004, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e au quart num\u00e9ro 3 dans la section Communication A \u00e0 l\u2019ETCVic. Chaque section de quart, compos\u00e9e d\u2019environ 16 employ\u00e9s, devait s\u2019acquitter de 13 activit\u00e9s sp\u00e9cifiques, et les travailleurs de quart \u00e9taient normalement affect\u00e9s toutes les deux heures \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 diff\u00e9rente. En raison des restrictions li\u00e9es \u00e0 sa DPP, Mme Stanger ne pouvait accomplir la majorit\u00e9 de ces activit\u00e9s, si bien que des mesures d\u2019adaptation lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consenties afin de l\u2019autoriser \u00e0 n\u2019en effectuer qu\u2019un nombre limit\u00e9 plus fr\u00e9quemment.\n[26] Mme Stanger a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mari\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019un de ses coll\u00e8gues, M. Patrick Gibbons, qui a comparu comme t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Elle s\u2019est s\u00e9par\u00e9e de lui au d\u00e9but de 2003 et ils ont officiellement divorc\u00e9 en 2004.\n[27] En 2004, Mme Stanger a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 fr\u00e9quenter le chef du quart 3 de l\u2019ETCVic, M. Patrick Stanger. \u00c0 la fin de 2004, ils vivaient ensemble; ils se sont l\u00e9galement mari\u00e9s en f\u00e9vrier 2008.\n[28] Mme Stanger a cess\u00e9 de travailler \u00e0 l\u2019ETCVic le ou vers le 22 juin 2008. Elle a pris un cong\u00e9 maladie, n\u2019a repris le travail qu\u2019en d\u00e9cembre 2008 et n\u2019est pas retourn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ETCVic. \u00c0 son retour en d\u00e9cembre 2008, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 un poste de vente ailleurs dans la r\u00e9gion, poste qu\u2019elle occupait encore au moment de l\u2019instruction de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\nVI. Questions pr\u00e9liminaires\nA. Motifs de discrimination fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial ou la situation de famille?\n[29] Dans la plainte qu\u2019elle a initialement d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 2009 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, la plaignante a invoqu\u00e9 les motifs illicites de discrimination suivants : \u00ab D\u00e9ficience, \u00e9tat matrimonial et situation de famille \u00bb. Le formulaire modifi\u00e9 de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte dat\u00e9 du 30 novembre 2011 \u00e9num\u00e8re les motifs de discrimination illicites suivants : \u00ab D\u00e9ficience et \u00e9tat matrimonial \u00bb.\n[30] Dans ses observations \u00e9crites et plaidoiries orales, le repr\u00e9sentant de la plaignante utilisait de mani\u00e8re interchangeable les expressions \u00ab \u00e9tat matrimonial \u00bb et \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb. Il m\u2019a sembl\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne faisait pas de distinction entre les deux motifs et qu\u2019il les confondait en un. Dans Waddle c. C.C.P. et al. 2016 TCDP 8, le Tribunal a conclu que lorsqu\u2019un formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9 lui est renvoy\u00e9 avec la plainte, celui-ci pouvait faire office d\u2019instrument de modification de la plainte (voir paragraphe 30).\n[31] Par cons\u00e9quent, comme le formulaire de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte modifi\u00e9 ne fait aucune mention de la \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb, j\u2019ai estim\u00e9 que les observations de la plaignante \u00e0 ce chapitre concernaient uniquement l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial.\nB. Date du d\u00e9but aux fins des all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial\n[32] Dans ses conclusions finales, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que Mme Stanger ne peut invoquer la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial qu\u2019\u00e0 partir du moment o\u00f9 elle a acquis ce nouvel \u00e9tat. En appliquant strictement le motif fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, comme le veut l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Mme Stanger ne l\u2019a acquis qu\u2019apr\u00e8s son mariage l\u00e9gal avec M. Stanger le 14 f\u00e9vrier 2008. Subsidiairement, si l\u2019\u00e9tat de conjoint de fait peut \u00eatre acquis apr\u00e8s un an de cohabitation, Mme Stanger ne peut l\u2019avoir obtenu qu\u2019\u00e0 partir du 1er novembre 2005. C\u2019est la date \u00e0 laquelle elle a confirm\u00e9 par \u00e9crit \u00e0 son employeur qu\u2019elle avait effectivement commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 vivre avec le chef Stanger dans le cadre d\u2019une relation maritale (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. une union de fait). Ce document intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Renseignements sur la personne \u00e0 charge \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis comme pi\u00e8ce : il s\u2019agit apparemment d\u2019un formulaire d\u00e9livr\u00e9 par la Great West, compagnie d\u2019assurance\u2011vie et l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par la plaignante le 8 f\u00e9vrier 2006. \u00c0 ce titre, fait valoir l\u2019intim\u00e9e, tous les incidents ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l\u2019acquisition de l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial ne peuvent donner lieu \u00e0 des plaintes valides au titre de la LCDP.\n[33] La plaignante n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune observation concernant l\u2019argument voulant qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait acquis son \u00e9tat matrimonial qu\u2019\u00e0 partir du 14 f\u00e9vrier 2008.\n[34] Les renseignements au dossier concernant la date du d\u00e9but de sa relation avec le chef, et celle du d\u00e9but de leur cohabitation, pr\u00eatent un peu \u00e0 confusion. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage direct, Mme Stanger a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019ils ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se fr\u00e9quenter \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 ou en septembre 2004. Lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019est mise en m\u00e9nage avec le chef Stanger \u00e0 la fin octobre 2004.\n[35] Cependant, dans la plainte qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission, Mme Stanger a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 fr\u00e9quenter le chef Stanger \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2005. Dans son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9, Mme Stanger pr\u00e9tend avoir commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 fr\u00e9quenter M. Stanger \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019automne 2004 \u00bb. L\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions fait \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au formulaire de changement de situation soumis par le chef Stanger \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, d\u2019apr\u00e8s lequel la plaignante [traduction] [\u2026] et M. Stanger vivent en relation maritale depuis le 11 janvier 2004 \u00bb.\n[36] La plaignante a vers\u00e9 en pi\u00e8ce le formulaire de changement de situation du chef. Ce document, \u00e9galement intitul\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab Renseignements sur la personne \u00e0 charge \u00bb, est identique \u00e0 celui d\u00e9livr\u00e9 par la Great West, compagnie d\u2019assurance\u2011vie et l\u2019intim\u00e9e : il indique que Mme Stanger est effectivement devenue son \u00e9pouse le \u00ab 11 01 2004 \u00bb. Un formulaire de soins de sant\u00e9 provincial connexe accompagnant cette pi\u00e8ce indique que l\u2019ex\u2011\u00e9pouse du chef Stanger, Elizabeth, n\u2019\u00e9tait plus \u00e0 sa charge depuis le 1er novembre 2004.\n[37] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, j\u2019ai essay\u00e9 de faire le tri dans tous ces renseignements contradictoires afin de pr\u00e9ciser les dates pour les besoins du dossier. J\u2019ai pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante des questions directes. Mme Stanger a fourni des r\u00e9ponses d\u00e9routantes et parfois contradictoires. En fin de compte, sur la base des r\u00e9ponses qu\u2019elle a fournies lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire, je conclus que la plaignante et le chef Stanger ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 cohabiter au courant du mois d\u2019octobre 2004.\n[38] La LCDP ne d\u00e9finit pas l\u2019expression \u00ab \u00e9tat matrimonial \u00bb. Ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, une abondante jurisprudence s\u2019est propos\u00e9e de clarifier la port\u00e9e de ce motif illicite. Cependant, assez peu de d\u00e9cisions abordent directement la question de savoir dans quelle mesure un couple non mari\u00e9 victime de discrimination li\u00e9e \u00e0 leur relation conjugale peut invoquer le motif de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a cit\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision Schaap c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes (\u00ab Schaap \u00bb) 1988 CanLII 4504 (TCDP), dans laquelle le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 que l\u2019expression \u00ab \u00e9tat matrimonial \u00bb au sens de la LCDP se limitait aux relations sanctionn\u00e9es par une forme l\u00e9gale de mariage, et ne pouvait s\u2019\u00e9tendre aux unions de fait. L\u2019affaire Schaap soulevait la question de savoir si les Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes (\u00ab FAC \u00bb) avaient fait preuve de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial en refusant des \u00ab logements familiaux \u00bb aux membres qui vivaient en union de fait avec leurs partenaires.\n[39] Cependant, il est important de noter que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a infirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans un jugement publi\u00e9 sous : Schaap c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes) (1988) [1989] 3 CF 172, 12 C.H.R.R. D\/451 (C.A.) (\u00ab Schaap-CAF \u00bb).\n[40] Le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Schaap-CAF est constitu\u00e9 de trois s\u00e9ries de motifs, ceux de la majorit\u00e9 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par les juges Hugessen et Pratte. Le juge Hugessen a commenc\u00e9 par noter que l\u2019union libre ne peut \u00ab entre[r] dans le cadre \u00bb de la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, un \u00e9tat et une union \u00e9tant deux choses diff\u00e9rentes. Selon lui, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial ne signifie rien de plus qu\u2019un \u00e9tat au sens de [traduction] \u00ab mari\u00e9 ou non mari\u00e9 \u00bb (C.H.R.R., paragraphe 6). Il s\u2019est ensuite pench\u00e9 sur l\u2019intention plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qu\u2019a manifest\u00e9e le l\u00e9gislateur en incluant l\u2019\u00ab \u00e9tat matrimonial \u00bb \u2014 ainsi que les autres motifs illicites de discrimination \u2014 dans la LCDP :\n[\u2026] je ne crois pas que l\u2019objet des lois sur les droits de la personne soit de favoriser l\u2019institution du mariage (pas plus, d\u2019ailleurs, que celle du c\u00e9libat). Au contraire, j\u2019estime qu\u2019en incluant l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial au nombre des motifs des [sic] distinction illicite tels la race, l\u2019origine ethnique, la couleur ou la d\u00e9ficience, la loi indique clairement qu\u2019aucun de ces motifs ne doit servir \u00e0 justifier l\u2019une quelconque des d\u00e9cisions vis\u00e9es par les articles 5 \u00e0 10 inclusivement. Ces d\u00e9cisions doivent \u00eatre fond\u00e9es sur la valeur ou les qualit\u00e9s des individus et non sur des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes de groupe [paragraphe 10].\n[41] Le juge Hugessen a reconnu l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat l\u00e9gitime des FAC \u00e0 ne fournir des logements familiaux qu\u2019aux employ\u00e9s dont les relations \u00ab [\u2026] poss\u00e8dent un haut degr\u00e9 de permanence et de stabilit\u00e9 \u00bb (paragraphe 11). En autorisant un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 cohabiter avec une personne qui semble unie \u00e0 lui par une relation sp\u00e9ciale, l\u2019employeur favorise et am\u00e9liore en fin de compte le moral des troupes (paragraphe 13). Cependant, le d\u00e9faut de la politique des FAC tenait \u00e0 ce que la valeur de la relation sp\u00e9ciale ainsi favoris\u00e9e \u00e9tait reconnue sur la foi de l\u2019\u00e9tat de ceux qui en \u00e9taient partie, et qui devaient indiquer s\u2019ils \u00e9taient mari\u00e9s l\u2019un \u00e0 l\u2019autre :\nLe programme s\u2019appuie ainsi sur un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype qu\u2019il contribue \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuer, soit que la valeur sociale de la relation entre un homme et une femme est moins grande lorsqu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas consacr\u00e9e par le mariage [paragraphe 14].\n[42] Le juge a fait remarquer que l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la stabilit\u00e9 et de la permanence des relations doit reposer sur des facteurs attestant v\u00e9ritablement leur existence, et que le mariage ou son absence n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9cisif \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard (paragraphe 15).\n[43] Enfin, le juge Hugessen a not\u00e9 que pour se faire une id\u00e9e exacte de l\u2019\u00e9tat civil d\u2019une personne, il est souvent n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner la situation d\u2019un tiers :\nPour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial des requ\u00e9rants, il importe de tenir compte de la situation dans laquelle se trouvent les personnes avec qui ils vivent comme mari et femme. Or, les requ\u00e9rants ne sont pas mari\u00e9s avec elles et c\u2019est pour cette unique raison qu\u2019ils ne peuvent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de logements familiaux [paragraphe 17].\n[44] Le juge Pratte commence par affirmer dans ses motifs que l\u2019\u00ab \u00e9tat matrimonial \u00bb au sens de la LCDP est \u00ab [\u2026] celui d\u2019une personne par rapport au mariage, savoir si elle est c\u00e9libataire, mari\u00e9e, divorc\u00e9e ou veuve \u00bb (paragraphe 2). Il ajoute que les plaignants dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Schaap\u2011CAF (demandeurs lors de la r\u00e9vision judiciaire) \u00e9taient bel et bien victimes de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur leur \u00e9tat matrimonial, \u00ab [\u2026] compte tenu qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu discrimination simplement parce que les requ\u00e9rants n\u2019\u00e9taient pas mari\u00e9s, mais plut\u00f4t parce que chacun d\u2019eux n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mari\u00e9 \u00e0 la femme avec laquelle il vivait [\u2026] \u00bb (paragraphe 3).\n[45] Comme le juge Hugessen, le juge Pratte a reconnu que l\u2019acception ordinaire de l\u2019expression \u00ab \u00e9tat matrimonial \u00bb ne semblait pas express\u00e9ment comprendre les partenaires non mari\u00e9s. Cependant, les deux juges ont fini par reconna\u00eetre la viabilit\u00e9 d\u2019un argument d\u2019[traduction] \u00ab \u00e9tat au sens relatif \u00bb, au nom duquel la victime d\u2019un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable bas\u00e9 sur une cohabitation dans le cadre d\u2019une relation conjugale hors mariage peut invoquer la protection de la LCDP. Le juge Hugessen parvient naturellement \u00e0 cette conclusion en s\u2019appuyant sur une interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique et contextuelle du motif illicite en question.\n[46] Consid\u00e9r\u00e9s ensemble, les motifs majoritaires de l\u2019arr\u00eat Schaap\u2011CAF n\u2019\u00e9tablissent pas de mani\u00e8re univoque que tout couple non mari\u00e9 victime de discrimination au titre de la LCDP peut b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019une protection en vertu du motif illicite fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00ab \u00e9tat matrimonial \u00bb. L\u2019arr\u00eat Schaap-CAF concernait surtout le refus \u00e0 des couples non mari\u00e9s d\u2019un avantage octroy\u00e9 aux couples l\u00e9galement mari\u00e9s. Cependant, les jugements majoritaires \u00e9tablissent \u00e0 tout le moins que la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial peut \u00eatre une norme relative, dans le sens o\u00f9 l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial peut \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9 au regard des conditions de vie et de la relation conjugales actuelles avec le partenaire. De plus, contrairement \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal qu\u2019il vient infirmer, l\u2019arr\u00eat Schaap\u2011CAF n\u2019exclut pas la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019un individu victime d\u2019un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable parce qu\u2019il est partie \u00e0 une relation conjugale hors mariage fasse valoir l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial au titre de la LCDP.\n[47] L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de de l\u2019arr\u00eat Schaap\u2011CAF est \u00e9tay\u00e9e par la jurisprudence subs\u00e9quente des cours de justice et des tribunaux :\n[traduction] Dans Jensen c. B.C. Report Magazine Ltd. (1993), 19 C.H.R.R. D\/495 (B.C.H.R.C.), le Tribunal devait interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019expression \u00ab \u00e9tat matrimonial \u00bb non d\u00e9finie dans la Human Rights Act de la Colombie\u2011Britannique. Il a rappel\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat O\u2019Malley, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, concernant la nature particuli\u00e8re de la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, et a not\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait rejet\u00e9 l\u2019approche selon laquelle \u00ab [\u2026] on ne peut pr\u00eater au Code un sens plus large que le sens le plus \u00e9troit que peuvent avoir les termes qui y sont employ\u00e9s \u00bb (paragraphe 32). Le Tribunal a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019en ce qui concernait les autres motifs illicites de discrimination, \u00e0 savoir la \u00ab race \u00bb, la \u00ab couleur \u00bb et la \u00ab d\u00e9ficience \u00bb, la protection contre la discrimination ne se limite pas aux caract\u00e9ristiques v\u00e9ritables, mais s\u2019\u00e9tend \u00e0 celles qui sont per\u00e7ues. Appliquant le principe \u00e0 l\u2019affaire dont il \u00e9tait saisi, le Tribunal a conclu que \u00ab [\u2026] m\u00eame si elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mari\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque en question, la plaignante \u00e9tait prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par la loi exactement comme si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mari\u00e9e, car l\u2019intim\u00e9e la percevait comme telle \u00bb (paragraphe 37).\n[48] Dans Gipaya c. Anton\u2019s Pasta Ltd. (\u00ab Gipaya \u00bb) (1996), 27 C.H.R.R. D\/326 (B.C.C.H.R.), le Tribunal de la Colombie\u2011Britannique devait \u00e0 nouveau d\u00e9terminer si la plaignante dans cette affaire \u00e9tait prot\u00e9g\u00e9e en vertu de la disposition relative \u00e0 l\u2019\u00ab \u00e9tat matrimonial \u00bb de la Human Rights Act de la Colombie\u2011Britannique. Avant de conclure qu\u2019elle l\u2019\u00e9tait, le Tribunal a not\u00e9 que le fait d\u2019\u00eatre fianc\u00e9e et bient\u00f4t mari\u00e9e se rapportait clairement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial et pouvait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9tat conjugal \u00bb (paragraphe 109). Il a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 que dans la jurisprudence de la Cour supr\u00eame (O\u2019Malley, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9; Action travail des femmes c. C.N. [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114), [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] les tribunaux des droits de la personne ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9s de ne pas rechercher les moyens d\u2019att\u00e9nuer l\u2019impact que la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne est appel\u00e9e \u00e0 avoir \u00bb. Une interpr\u00e9tation large, lib\u00e9rale et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique de la disposition en question permet plut\u00f4t [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] de conclure que l\u2019\"\u00e9tat matrimonial\" concerne \u00e0 la fois le fait d\u2019\u00eatre fianc\u00e9 et bient\u00f4t mari\u00e9 et celui de vivre une relation comparable \u00e0 un mariage \u00bb (paragraphes 112\u2011113).\n[49] Dans 502798 N.B. Inc. c. N.B. Human Rights Commission, 2008 NBQB 390 (\u00ab 502798 N.B. Inc. \u00bb) la Cour devait d\u00e9terminer si le motif fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00ab \u00e9tat matrimonial \u00bb \u2014 non d\u00e9fini dans la Loi sur les droits de la personne du Nouveau\u2011Brunswick \u2014 s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 la relation entre le plaignant et une coll\u00e8gue avec qui il cohabitait. La Cour a cit\u00e9 un extrait de l\u2019ouvrage The Law of Human Rights in Canada (par le juge Russel W. Zinn) suivant lequel, en cas d\u2019absence de d\u00e9finition pr\u00e9vue par la loi, la jurisprudence a \u00e9tabli que l\u2019\u00ab \u00e9tat matrimonial \u00bb sera interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme comprenant les relations de fait (paragraphe 39); elle a ensuite not\u00e9 que la preuve soumise par les deux concubins indiquait qu\u2019au moment du cong\u00e9diement du plaignant, \u00ab [\u2026] ils vivaient comme un couple mari\u00e9 \u00bb. Cette preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e propre \u00e0 \u00ab absolument [\u2026] dissiper tout doute \u00bb (paragraphe 41). La Cour a conclu que le plaignant vivait une relation de fait donnant lieu \u00e0 une protection sur la base de l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial (paragraphes 44 et 45).\n[50] Enfin, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Johnstone, 2014 CAF 110 (\u00ab Johnstone \u00bb), une affaire concernant la port\u00e9e du motif fond\u00e9 sur la \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb au titre de la LCDP, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a formul\u00e9 d\u2019importantes directives concernant l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la port\u00e9e d\u2019un motif illicite. Elle a rappel\u00e9 que la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne devait avoir une interpr\u00e9tation large pour veiller \u00e0 ce que ses objectifs d\u00e9clar\u00e9s soient remplis, et qu\u2019il fallait \u00e9viter une interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9troite et restrictive contraire \u00e0 la vis\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9liminer la discrimination. La Cour a ajout\u00e9 que les dispositions cl\u00e9s de la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es avec souplesse et de mani\u00e8re adapt\u00e9e aux circonstances. Enfin, la Cour a cit\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle d\u2019apr\u00e8s laquelle la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne a un caract\u00e8re quasi constitutionnel unique et doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re lib\u00e9rale et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique afin de promouvoir les grandes consid\u00e9rations politiques qui la sous\u2011tendent (paragraphes 61 \u00e0 63).\n[51] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Johnstone, la question \u00e9tait de savoir si le motif fond\u00e9 sur la \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb pouvait englober une situation familiale telle que les obligations parentales. Avant de conclure que tel \u00e9tait le cas, la Cour a examin\u00e9 la version fran\u00e7aise des articles 2 et 3 de la LCDP et not\u00e9 que la \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb avait une port\u00e9e beaucoup plus large que l\u2019\u00ab \u00e9tat matrimonial \u00bb. Cependant, cette conclusion est sans cons\u00e9quence sur notre analyse puisque la plaignante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Mme Stanger, ne fait pas valoir que la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime regarde une situation ou des obligations li\u00e9es \u00e0 sa relation. C\u2019est plut\u00f4t l\u2019identit\u00e9 de son \u00e9poux qui est \u00e0 son avis la source de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial.\n[52] S\u2019agissant maintenant de r\u00e9examiner la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la jurisprudence susmentionn\u00e9e, nous sommes forc\u00e9s de conclure que la protection contre la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial pr\u00e9vue par la LCDP ne peut \u00eatre limit\u00e9e \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode d\u00e9butant \u00e0 la date de la c\u00e9l\u00e9bration l\u00e9gale du mariage. Une interpr\u00e9tation si \u00e9troite et restrictive serait incompatible avec les objectifs de la LCDP et aurait pour effet absurde que le cong\u00e9diement d\u2019un employ\u00e9 en raison de son mariage r\u00e9cent serait susceptible de contr\u00f4le en vertu de la LCDP, mais pas celui motiv\u00e9 par son mariage imminent. La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e revient \u00e0 ignorer le fait que le mariage ne surgit pas spontan\u00e9ment sans pr\u00e9alable, et c\u2019est pourquoi la protection li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tendue aux couples fianc\u00e9s dans les d\u00e9cisions Jensen et Gipaya.\n[53] De plus, s\u2019il refusait \u00e0 la plaignante la protection dont peuvent se pr\u00e9valoir les couples mari\u00e9s au titre de la LCDP pour la seule raison que sa relation avec son partenaire non mari\u00e9 ne constituait pas un mariage l\u00e9gal, le Tribunal ne se trouverait\u2011il pas \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuer le m\u00eame type de jugements de valeur st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9s sur le m\u00e9rite, la permanence et la stabilit\u00e9 des unions libres, si clairement d\u00e9nonc\u00e9s par le juge Hugessen dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Schaap\u2011CAF? J\u2019estime que ce serait le cas et conclus par cons\u00e9quent que la protection contre la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial n\u2019est pas aussi limit\u00e9e.\n[54] La position subsidiaire de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u2014 \u00e0 savoir que la protection contre la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial n\u2019est engag\u00e9e qu\u2019apr\u00e8s un an de cohabitation \u2014 est \u00e9galement incompatible avec la jurisprudence. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 cet argument s\u2019appuie sur des d\u00e9finitions de relations conjugales \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans des lois sans lien avec le domaine des droits de la personne, il faut rappeler que la l\u00e9gislation visant d\u2019autres fins ne peut \u00eatre prise en compte dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique de la LCDP : voir Jensen, paragraphe 38; et Gipaya, paragraphe 108. De plus, aucune des d\u00e9cisions examin\u00e9es plus haut n\u2019a fait d\u00e9pendre strictement la protection fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial que du nombre de mois qu\u2019un couple a cohabit\u00e9 jusque-l\u00e0. Les p\u00e9riodes de cohabitation varient d\u2019ailleurs grandement, allant de quatre mois dans la d\u00e9cision Jensen, \u00e0 plus de deux ans pour le co-plaignant dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Schaap.\n[55] La port\u00e9e de la protection li\u00e9e au motif fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial repose plut\u00f4t sur une \u00e9valuation plus qualitative de la relation en question \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque pertinente. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Schaap\u2011CAF, le juge Hugessen a tacitement reconnu que la relation ayant donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial \u00e9tait en substance une relation \u00ab comme mari et femme \u00bb (paragraphe 17). Dans Gipaya, la plaignante, qui vivait avec son coll\u00e8gue, avait achet\u00e9 une maison avec lui et annonc\u00e9 leurs fian\u00e7ailles, \u00e9tait prot\u00e9g\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait fianc\u00e9e ou qu\u2019elle vivait en union de fait \u00bb (paragraphe 115). Dans 502798 N.B. Inc., la commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate des droits de la personne a conclu que le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante et de son coll\u00e8gue d\u2019apr\u00e8s lequel \u00ab [\u2026] ils vivaient comme un couple mari\u00e9 sans pr\u00e9ciser les d\u00e9tails de leur cohabitation [\u2026] \u00bb \u00e9tait suffisant, et la Cour a fait sienne la conclusion selon laquelle ils avaient le statut d\u2019\u00e9poux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque pertinente (paragraphes 5, 41\u201142). Dans Jensen, le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 que la plaignante \u00e9tait prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par la loi, car l\u2019intim\u00e9e pensait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait mari\u00e9e (paragraphe 37). Cet accent mis sur la perception dans la d\u00e9cision Jensen a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Qu\u00e9bec (C.D.P.D.J.) c. Montr\u00e9al 2000 CSC 27, dans lequel la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a estim\u00e9 que le motif du \u00ab handicap \u00bb pr\u00e9vu dans la Charte des droits et libert\u00e9s de la personne du Qu\u00e9bec pouvait inclure \u00e0 la fois une affection, et la perception d\u2019une telle affection (paragraphe 72).\n[56] Malheureusement, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les parties n\u2019ont pas soumis d\u2019arguments bien \u00e9toff\u00e9s en ce qui concerne le moment \u00e0 partir duquel la protection li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial pourrait \u00eatre engag\u00e9e, par exemple combien de temps apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de la cohabitation dans une relation conjugale. Les dates incompatibles dans le dossier de preuve compliquent encore davantage les choses. \u00c0 ce titre, cette affaire n\u2019est pas la plus facile pour trancher cette question de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9finitive. Cependant, aux fins de l\u2019analyse qui suit, j\u2019adopterai une interpr\u00e9tation large et conclurai que Mme Stanger a droit \u00e0 la protection li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial relativement aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements post\u00e9rieurs au 1er novembre 2004.\nC. Cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la plaignante\n[57] Dans l\u2019ensemble, Mme Stanger avait l\u2019air sinc\u00e8re lorsqu\u2019elle a livr\u00e9 sa d\u00e9position. Cependant, ses r\u00e9ponses \u00e9taient parfois obscures, \u00e9vasives ou simplement d\u00e9pourvues de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Nous avons relev\u00e9 plusieurs exemples pr\u00e9cis :\nComme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, Mme Stanger a fourni au Tribunal plusieurs dates incompatibles pour situer le d\u00e9but de sa relation avec le chef Stanger. M\u00eame lorsque je lui ai demand\u00e9 directement de pr\u00e9ciser les dates, il lui a fallu beaucoup de temps pour me donner une r\u00e9ponse claire et elle n\u2019a pas pu justifier les autres dates avanc\u00e9es.\n\u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9, Mme Stanger a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux plaintes pour atteinte aux droits de la personne et qu\u2019elle a initialement communiqu\u00e9 avec la Commission en 2004 en vue de pr\u00e9senter une plainte. Apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 plusieurs fois ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de lorsqu\u2019interrog\u00e9e au sujet de la date, elle a soudainement modifi\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir communiqu\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois avec la Commission en 2008. Elle a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission deux plaintes qui ont ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 fusionn\u00e9es, bien qu\u2019aucune preuve ne m\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nDurant son contre-interrogatoire par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Mme Stanger a \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9e de confirmer la date \u00e0 laquelle elle avait fait les r\u00e9servations en vue de ses vacances \u00e0 Hawaii, qui ont eu lieu du 9 au 26 f\u00e9vrier 2008 et durant lesquelles elle a \u00e9pous\u00e9 le chef Stanger. Le cours PPLAC \u00e0 venir (d\u00e9crit en d\u00e9tail plus loin) devait avoir lieu du 25 au 28 f\u00e9vrier 2008, ce qui co\u00efncidait avec ses pr\u00e9paratifs de mariage. La question de savoir \u00e0 quelle date elle avait planifi\u00e9 ses vacances visait \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si elle savait d\u00e9j\u00e0, en pr\u00e9sentant sa demande d\u2019inscription au cours PPLAC, qu\u2019elle ne serait pas en mesure d\u2019y assister en raison de ses projets de mariage. J\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 Mme Stanger plut\u00f4t \u00e9vasive au sujet de la date \u00e0 laquelle elle a fait ses r\u00e9servations pour son voyage \u00e0 Hawaii. Elle a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne le savait pas, et a refus\u00e9 de conc\u00e9der qu\u2019elle avait d\u00fb demander un cong\u00e9 au moins un mois ou deux \u00e0 l\u2019avance. \u00c0 cette question et \u00e0 plusieurs autres, elle a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Je ne sais pas \u00bb. J\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 que ses r\u00e9ponses n\u2019\u00e9taient pas cr\u00e9dibles \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a voulu s\u2019inscrire au cours PPLAC \u00e0 peine 17 jours avant son d\u00e9part \u00e0 Hawaii en vue de son mariage. Elle a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 que sa croisi\u00e8re de lune de miel, qui devait commencer plusieurs semaines apr\u00e8s, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9serv\u00e9e plusieurs semaines avant sa date de mariage.\nComme nous y reviendrons plus en d\u00e9tail ci\u2011apr\u00e8s, Mme Stanger a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son ex\u2011\u00e9poux, Patrick Gibbons, l\u2019avait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment suivie au travail alors qu\u2019il conduisait un chariot\u2011\u00e9l\u00e9vateur. Mme Stanger a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il l\u2019a [traduction] \u00ab poursuivie \u00bb dans son chariot\u2011\u00e9l\u00e9vateur et qu\u2019il s\u2019est montr\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab tr\u00e8s agressif \u00bb envers elle. M. Gibbons a compl\u00e8tement rejet\u00e9 cette all\u00e9gation durant son t\u00e9moignage. Mme Stanger a aussi affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait signal\u00e9 l\u2019incident \u00e0 un superviseur, Brad Harrison. Celui-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin par l\u2019intim\u00e9e et n\u2019avait aucun souvenir de l\u2019incident. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cette all\u00e9gation, si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise avec le plus grand s\u00e9rieux et qu\u2019il aurait certainement effectu\u00e9 un suivi. Aucun rapport \u00e9crit ni aucun autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience n\u2019indique que cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement s\u2019est produit ainsi que l\u2019a d\u00e9crit Mme Stanger;\nComme nous le verrons en d\u00e9tail plus loin, une des all\u00e9gations de Mme Stanger concernait un \u00e9change qu\u2019elle aurait eu avec une coll\u00e8gue d\u00e9nomm\u00e9e Pam Cromwell. Cette derni\u00e8re a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9primand\u00e9e par le chef Stanger, apr\u00e8s quoi Mme Stanger pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un acte de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de Mme Cromwell. Le chef Stanger a fini par adresser un courriel \u00e0 la directrice Sherry Aiken, dans lequel il laissait entendre que Mme Cromwell \u00e9tait li\u00e9e aux pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es repr\u00e9sailles. M\u00eame si elle vivait alors avec lui, Mme Stanger a ni\u00e9 avoir jamais \u00e9voqu\u00e9 ces repr\u00e9sailles avec le chef Stanger et lui avoir fait comprendre que Mme Cromwell \u00e9tait responsable de l\u2019acte en cause. Cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e durant le contre\u2011interrogatoire de Mme Stanger et son d\u00e9menti ne m\u2019a pas paru cr\u00e9dible.\n[58] La plupart des \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e9voqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience sont survenus il y a plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Il est possible que les souvenirs se soient estomp\u00e9s et que des erreurs aient \u00e9t\u00e9 commises. Cependant, les exemples susmentionn\u00e9s ont suscit\u00e9 dans mon esprit de telles pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la plaignante que je ne pouvais accepter sa d\u00e9position concernant certains incidents cruciaux et controvers\u00e9s sans de solides \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve corroborants (Voir Cassidy c. Postes Canada et al. 2012 TCDP 29, paragraphe 27).\n[59] Je fais ces observations en tenant d\u00fbment compte des principes d\u2019\u00e9valuation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, tels qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Faryna c.

Le crit\u00e8re doit consister \u00e0 soumettre raisonnablement sa version \u00e0 l\u2019examen de sa coh\u00e9rence selon les probabilit\u00e9s entourant les conditions actuelles. En bref, le v\u00e9ritable crit\u00e8re permettant de jauger le caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ridique d\u2019un t\u00e9moignage dans un tel cas doit tenir \u00e0 sa concordance avec la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s qu\u2019une personne inform\u00e9e et pragmatique trouverait d\u2019embl\u00e9e raisonnables en ce lieu et en ces conditions.

Refus d\u2019inscription au Programme de perfectionnement en leadership et d\u2019avancement de carri\u00e8re\n(i) Contexte et faits\n[60] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 Mme Stanger travaillait \u00e0 l\u2019ETCVic, Postes Canada offrait un programme de dotation appel\u00e9 Programme de perfectionnement en leadership et d\u2019avancement de carri\u00e8re (PPLAC). Les employ\u00e9s de Postes Canada, principalement les membres du Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses des postes (STTP), \u00e9taient souvent \u00e9valu\u00e9s par le biais de ce programme en vue d\u2019une promotion \u00e0 des postes de superviseurs. Le PPLAC a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u dans le but d\u2019introduire une certaine objectivit\u00e9 dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation des employ\u00e9s d\u00e9sireux d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 ces postes de supervision. Le programme \u00e9tait propos\u00e9 p\u00e9riodiquement, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral une \u00e0 deux fois par an dans la r\u00e9gion du Pacifique, en pr\u00e9vision des besoins en dotation. Les chefs d\u2019\u00e9quipe dont les employ\u00e9s souhaitaient participer au PPLAC devaient remplir un formulaire de recommandation et le faire signer par leur directeur local. Si le nombre de personnes inscrites \u00e0 une s\u00e9ance particuli\u00e8re du PPLAC d\u00e9passait les capacit\u00e9s d\u2019accueil, les candidats en surnombre \u00e9taient normalement inscrits sur une liste d\u2019attente en vue de la prochaine s\u00e9ance du PPLAC.\n[61] Mme Stanger a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait fait une demande d\u2019inscription \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance du PPLAC pr\u00e9vue pour la fin f\u00e9vrier 2008 \u00e0 Vancouver. La date butoir pour soumettre la demande \u00e9tait le 22 janvier 2008. La directrice de l\u2019ETCVic \u00e9tait Mme Sherri Aiken, et c\u2019est sa signature d\u2019approbation qui devait figurer sur le formulaire de recommandation de Mme Stanger.\n[62] Le formulaire de recommandation aux fins du PPLAC a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Mme Aiken a coch\u00e9 la case de refus de l\u2019approbation, sign\u00e9 et dat\u00e9 le formulaire, et \u00e9crit ce qui suit dans la section r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux commentaires :\n[traduction] Jessica serait potentiellement une bonne candidate si sa situation personnelle \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rente ou si elle travaillait dans un autre \u00e9tablissement. Son \u00e9poux est le chef des op\u00e9rations du quart #3 et le risque de conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats est \u00e9lev\u00e9. Recommande un examen avec l\u2019expertise de la GRH pour d\u00e9terminer les meilleures \u00e9tapes \u00e0 suivre pour l\u2019avancement de la carri\u00e8re de Jessica.\n[63] Mme Aiken a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a rencontr\u00e9 Mme Stanger le ou vers le 22 janvier 2008 pour lui faire part de ses pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 un \u00e9ventuel conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats. D\u2019apr\u00e8s elle, le PPLAC \u00e9tait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement propos\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il y avait des postes pr\u00e9cis \u00e0 pourvoir. Mme Aiken avait cru comprendre que le seul poste de superviseur disponible \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque \u00e0 Victoria l\u2019aurait plac\u00e9e en situation de conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats direct avec son \u00e9poux, le chef Stanger.\n[64] Les t\u00e9moignages \u00e9taient contradictoires en ce qui concerne la question de savoir si Mme Stanger a indiqu\u00e9 lors de cette rencontre qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 s\u2019installer dans une autre ville pour \u00e9viter tout conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats avec son \u00e9poux. Durant son interrogatoire principal, Mme Stanger a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Aiken, \u00e0 la rencontre du 22 janvier 2008, s\u2019il y avait des postes \u00e0 pourvoir ailleurs sur l\u2019\u00eele de Vancouver. Lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e alors \u00e0 s\u2019installer n\u2019importe o\u00f9 en Colombie\u2011Britannique, aussi loin que Fort St. John, m\u00eame si elle devait assumer le co\u00fbt de son d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement et que son mariage avec le chef Stanger devait avoir lieu juste trois semaines plus tard.\n[65] Dans son t\u00e9moignage direct, Mme Aiken s\u2019est souvenue qu\u2019elle avait inform\u00e9 Mme Stanger qu\u2019aucun autre poste de supervision n\u2019\u00e9tait alors vacant sur l\u2019\u00eele de Vancouver. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Stanger si elle \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 s\u2019installer \u00e0 Vancouver o\u00f9 plusieurs postes \u00e9taient disponibles, et que celle-ci lui avait r\u00e9pondu non. Mme Aiken a ajout\u00e9 que si Mme Stanger avait accept\u00e9 de s\u2019installer sur le continent, elle aurait approuv\u00e9 le formulaire de recommandation sans h\u00e9sitation. Mme Aiken \u00e9tait certaine de la position de Mme Stanger au sujet du d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement, puisque ses \u00e9changes subs\u00e9quents avec les agents des ressources humaines concernaient sp\u00e9cifiquement la r\u00e9ticence de cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 s\u2019\u00e9tablir ailleurs. (Dans un courriel dat\u00e9 du 4 f\u00e9vrier 2008, Mme Aiken a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 en ces termes avec Colleen McKenzie, agente responsable des ressources humaines \u00e0 Vancouver, sa conversation avec la plaignante : [traduction] \u00ab Je lui ai parl\u00e9 de mobilit\u00e9, mais un poste \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de Victoria ne l\u2019int\u00e9resse pas \u00bb.)\n[66] Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Aiken a fourni d\u2019autres indices quant \u00e0 ses motivations, puisqu\u2019elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 peu judicieux que Postes Canada envoie Mme Stanger passer l\u2019\u00e9valuation du PPLAC et la d\u00e9fraye, notamment parce que Mme Stanger ne semblait pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager pour \u00e9viter un conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats potentiel.\n[67] Apr\u00e8s que Mme Aiken a refus\u00e9 d\u2019approuver le formulaire de recommandation, Mme Stanger a directement soumis sa demande d\u2019inscription au PPLAC \u00e0 Mme Colleen McKenzie, l\u2019agente responsable des ressources humaines \u00e0 Vancouver. Dans un courriel dat\u00e9 du 28 janvier 2008, Mme McKenzie a inform\u00e9 Mme Aiken qu\u2019elle avait consult\u00e9 l\u2019agente des droits de la personne de Postes Canada, Mme Roxanne Ayers, laquelle estimait que l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de s\u2019inscrire au PPLAC ne pouvait \u00eatre refus\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Stanger en raison de son \u00e9tat matrimonial. Mme McKenzie a recommand\u00e9 que Mme Aiken approuve le formulaire de recommandation et que, en cas de r\u00e9ussite de Mme Stanger au PPLAC, son nom soit inscrit sur une liste d\u2019attente afin de pourvoir un poste qui ne rel\u00e8verait pas de la supervision de son \u00e9poux.\n[68] Le 5 f\u00e9vrier 2008, un courriel a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Aiken par M. John Scott, alors directeur int\u00e9rimaire de la gestion du rendement humain (GRH) \u2013 r\u00e9gion du Pacifique. M. Scott adressait l\u2019avis suivant \u00e0 Mme Aiken :\n[traduction] Il y a lieu de refuser une opportunit\u00e9 qui aboutirait \u00e0 un conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats au sens de notre politique.\n[69] M. Scott indiquait ce qui suit \u00e0 Mme Aiken concernant la demande d\u2019inscription au PPLAC :\n[traduction] Cela dit, je pense que si vous croyez qu\u2019elle est une bonne candidate \u00e0 un poste de superviseure (mise \u00e0 part la question du conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats) vous pouvez remplir le formulaire. Normalement, nous attribuons les places en fonction du lieu o\u00f9 se trouvent les opportunit\u00e9s. S\u2019il n\u2019y a d\u2019opportunit\u00e9 que l\u00e0 o\u00f9 existe un conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats et qu\u2019elle ait indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle refusait de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager, alors elle n\u2019obtiendra pas de place.\nLa d\u00e9cision se fonde sur notre politique en mati\u00e8re de conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats et non sur son \u00e9tat matrimonial. La jurisprudence \u00e9tayant cette interpr\u00e9tation est volumineuse.\n[70] Eu \u00e9gard aux avis qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7us, Mme Aiken est revenue sur sa d\u00e9cision. Lors d\u2019une rencontre qui a eu lieu d\u00e9but mars 2008 apr\u00e8s que Mme Stanger fut revenue d\u2019Hawaii et qu\u2019elle eut repris le travail, Mme Aiken l\u2019a inform\u00e9e qu\u2019elle avait approuv\u00e9 sa demande d\u2019inscription au PPLAC, et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait maintenant sur une liste d\u2019attente en vue de la prochaine s\u00e9ance du programme, \u00e0 la date qui serait annonc\u00e9e. Malheureusement, Postes Canada a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ensuite d\u2019annuler ce programme, si bien que la demande de Mme Stanger n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e. Postes Canada a choisi de confier en sous-traitance \u00e0 une compagnie externe le processus de recrutement des superviseurs. La s\u00e9ance du PPLAC qui a eu lieu fin f\u00e9vrier 2008 a \u00e9t\u00e9 la derni\u00e8re de ce genre \u00e0 se tenir dans la r\u00e9gion du Pacifique.\n[71] Mme Aiken a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 durant son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il ne lui a pas saut\u00e9 aux yeux que Mme Stanger \u00e9tait d\u00e9\u00e7ue de rater la s\u00e9ance du PPLAC. Mme Aiken lui a adress\u00e9 une lettre d\u2019excuses dat\u00e9e du 6 avril 2009 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Elle expliquait dans cette lettre qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait r\u00e9alis\u00e9 que son refus de lui accorder la recommandation concernant le PPLAC avait caus\u00e9 de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Stanger que lorsque celle-ci a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne. Mme Aiken a \u00e9crit la lettre pour pr\u00e9senter ses excuses \u00e0 Mme Stanger et pour lui confirmer qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait toujours sur une liste d\u2019attente au cas o\u00f9 les s\u00e9ances du PPLAC reprendraient.\n(ii) Preuve prima facie de discrimination \u00e9tablie\n[72] Quoique les t\u00e9moignages concernant la teneur exacte des propos \u00e9chang\u00e9s durant la rencontre du 22 janvier soient contradictoires, cela n\u2019influe en rien sur la question de savoir si une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. \u00c0 mon avis, Mme Stanger a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve non contredite constituant une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur son \u00e9tat matrimonial.\n[73] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, Mme Stanger a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019elle vivait depuis novembre 2004 en relation conjugale avec M. Stanger, relation prot\u00e9g\u00e9e compte tenu du motif fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial. S\u2019agissant de l\u2019all\u00e9gation actuelle, la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e s\u2019est manifest\u00e9e par le fait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait fianc\u00e9e et devait se marier quelques semaines plus tard.\n[74] Deuxi\u00e8mement, Mme Stanger a prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a subi un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel et pr\u00e9judiciable en n\u2019obtenant pas sa recommandation concernant le PPLAC. M\u00eame si je ne suis pas certain qu\u2019elle comptait effectivement assister \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance du PPLAC de fin f\u00e9vrier, puisque cela co\u00efncidait avec ses projets de mariage, il n\u2019en reste pas moins qu\u2019elle s\u2019est vu refuser une perspective d\u2019emploi importante (article 2 de la LCDP). Il est possible que lorsqu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande d\u2019inscription au PPLAC, Mme Stanger ait simplement oubli\u00e9 ou ne se soit pas rendu compte qu\u2019il y avait incompatibilit\u00e9 avec ses projets de mariage. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de s\u2019interroger sur ce qu\u2019elle aurait fait si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 admise \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance du PPLAC de f\u00e9vrier 2008. Il se trouve que ce programme n\u2019a plus jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9. \u00c0 ce titre, je conclus que le refus de l\u2019inscrire au PPLAC lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9judiciable.\n[75] Enfin, Mme Stanger a \u00e9tabli que l\u2019intim\u00e9e lui a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel et pr\u00e9judiciable en raison de son \u00e9tat matrimonial. Les motifs indiqu\u00e9s dans le formulaire de recommandation montrent que l\u2019id\u00e9e que Mme Aiken se faisait de la relation conjugale entre Mme Stanger et le chef Stanger (qu\u2019elle d\u00e9signe comme [traduction] \u00ab son \u00e9poux \u00bb) est entr\u00e9e en compte dans la d\u00e9cision de ne pas lui permettre de participer \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance du PPLAC. Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Aiken corrobore ce fait.\n[76] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, j\u2019estime que les trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments constitutifs d\u2019une discrimination prima facie ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de probabilit\u00e9 (voir Bombardier, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9.)\n(iii) Justification de la discrimination\n[77] Une fois la preuve prima facie \u00e9tablie selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de justifier les actes discriminatoires (Bombardier, paragraphes 36\u201138, 61).\n[78] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit une exception \u00e0 la discrimination lorsque l\u2019employeur \u00e9tablit que les actes contest\u00e9s \u00e9taient fond\u00e9s sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e :\nNe constituent pas des actes discriminatoires :\na) les refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de l\u2019employeur qui d\u00e9montre qu\u2019ils d\u00e9coulent d\u2019exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es;\n[\u2026]\n[79] En vertu du paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP, l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui invoque l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) est tenu de d\u00e9montrer que les mesures visant \u00e0 m\u00e9nager les besoins des individus concern\u00e9s constitueraient une \u00ab contrainte excessive \u00bb en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[80] Le paragraphe 15(2) doit \u00eatre lu en parall\u00e8le avec les conclusions de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Columbie\u2011Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, 1999 CanLII 652 (CSC), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 (\u00ab Meiorin \u00bb), dans lequel elle a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 un crit\u00e8re en trois volets permettant de d\u00e9terminer si [\u2026] une norme donn\u00e9e constitue une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. La Cour affirme, au paragraphe 54, qu\u2019un employeur peut justifier la norme contest\u00e9e en \u00e9tablissant selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s :\nqu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause;\nqu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail;\nque la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail. Pour prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, il faut d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est impossible de composer avec les employ\u00e9s qui ont les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que le demandeur sans que l\u2019employeur subisse une contrainte excessive.\n[81] L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas oppos\u00e9 officiellement une d\u00e9fense d\u2019exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e (EPJ) relativement \u00e0 l\u2019incident du PPLAC. La politique concernant les conflits d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats de Postes Canada, \u00e0 proprement parler, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en cause. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la norme contest\u00e9e est en fait le refus pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 de Mme Aiken de signer la recommandation relative au PPLAC, refus fond\u00e9 sur son impression suivant laquelle l\u2019admission de Mme Stanger au programme la placerait in\u00e9vitablement dans une situation de conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n[82] M\u00eame si les parties pensaient que la question de savoir si Mme Stanger \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager avait d\u2019importantes cons\u00e9quences, je n\u2019en suis pas si convaincu. J\u2019estime qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019EPJ autorisant \u00e0 refuser l\u2019approbation du formulaire de recommandation. La d\u00e9cision d\u2019approuver la recommandation aux fins du PPLAC n\u2019aurait pas imm\u00e9diatement donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9el ou potentiel li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial de Mme Stanger. Elle concernait seulement la capacit\u00e9 de celle-ci d\u2019assister \u00e0 une s\u00e9ance d\u2019\u00e9valuation, apr\u00e8s laquelle sa candidature \u00e0 un poste de superviseure aurait pu \u00eatre envisag\u00e9e.\n[83] Compte tenu de la preuve dont je dispose, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que le refus de Mme Aiken, dans les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, constituait une EPJ. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve indiquant qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible de composer avec les besoins de Mme Stanger en approuvant l\u2019inscription au PPLAC et en g\u00e9rant le conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats une fois survenu. Le courriel de M. Scott soumis en preuve indique clairement que l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait pu composer avec la demande d\u2019inscription au PPLAC, et c\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs ce qu\u2019il recommandait.\n[84] La participation de Mme Stanger \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance de f\u00e9vrier 2008 du cours li\u00e9 au PPLAC ne l\u2019aurait pas plac\u00e9e en situation imm\u00e9diate de conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats. \u00c0 ce titre, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, pour \u00e9viter tout conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats, de lui interdire enti\u00e8rement d\u2019assister aux s\u00e9ances du PPLAC en raison de son \u00e9tat matrimonial.\n[85] Il est compr\u00e9hensible que Mme Aiken, en tant que directrice responsable, n\u2019ait pas voulu gaspiller les ressources de la SCP s\u2019il lui paraissait impossible que la participation de Mme Stanger au PPLAC fasse avancer sa carri\u00e8re. Cependant, comme l\u2019ont fait remarquer les coll\u00e8gues de Mme Aiken, accepter de recommander l\u2019inscription \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance du PPLAC ne pla\u00e7ait pas en soi Mme Stanger en situation de conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats. Il \u00e9tait dans le domaine du possible que cette derni\u00e8re ne re\u00e7oive pas une \u00e9valuation favorable \u00e0 cette s\u00e9ance, et m\u00eame qu\u2019elle n\u2019y obtienne pas de place, comme le laissait entendre M. Scott. Si l\u2019un de ces deux sc\u00e9narios s\u2019\u00e9tait r\u00e9alis\u00e9, tout conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats potentiel aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vit\u00e9.\n[86] Il est possible que Mme Aiken ait refus\u00e9 la demande d\u2019inscription de Mme Stanger en raison de l\u2019id\u00e9e qu\u2019elle se faisait de la mise en \u0153uvre ad\u00e9quate de la politique de Postes Canada en mati\u00e8re de conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats. Cependant, comme l\u2019a fait remarquer plus haut M. Scott, il n\u2019y aurait pas eu conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats simplement en acceptant de recommander Mme Stanger aux fins du PPLAC. M. Scott avait conseill\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Aiken d\u2019approuver la recommandation relative au PPLAC et de laisser la politique en mati\u00e8re de conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats entrer en jeu plus tard.\n[87] Postes Canada doit \u00eatre f\u00e9licit\u00e9e d\u2019avoir rapidement r\u00e9alis\u00e9 son erreur et imm\u00e9diatement agi pour infirmer la d\u00e9cision de Mme Aiken de ne pas approuver le formulaire de recommandation relatif au PPLAC. Cependant, l\u2019effet de cette d\u00e9cision, une fois prise, ne pouvait pas \u00eatre annul\u00e9.\n(iv) All\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e\n[88] Mme Stanger m\u2019a convaincu que Postes Canada, bien qu\u2019elle soit revenue sur sa position, a initialement fait preuve \u00e0 son endroit de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur son \u00e9tat matrimonial, Mme Aiken ayant refus\u00e9 de signer la recommandation relative au PPLAC en raison de son mariage avec le chef Stanger. Par ailleurs, Postes Canada n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que des mesures visant \u00e0 composer en l\u2019occurrence avec l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial de Mme Stanger lui auraient caus\u00e9 des contraintes excessives.\n(v) Mesures de redressement\n[89] Comme c\u2019est la seule partie de la plainte de Mme Stanger qui soit fond\u00e9e, j\u2019examinerai la question des mesures de redressement \u00e0 ce stade de la d\u00e9cision. Lorsqu\u2019il juge la plainte ou une partie de la plainte fond\u00e9e, le Tribunal peut, en vertu de l\u2019article 53 de la LCDP, rendre \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019intim\u00e9e une ordonnance pr\u00e9voyant une indemnit\u00e9 et d\u2019autres formes de redressement. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, Mme Stanger n\u2019avait pas pr\u00e9par\u00e9 d\u2019observation ni de preuve documentaire concernant ses pr\u00e9tendues pertes financi\u00e8res. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que l\u2019audience soit disjointe et que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et observations concernant les dommages puissent \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s une fois que le Tribunal aura d\u00e9termin\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9. Les parties et le Tribunal ont accept\u00e9 la disjonction de l\u2019instance.\n[90] Le greffe du Tribunal contactera les parties pour les informer du calendrier pr\u00e9vu en vue du d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire et d\u2019arguments ayant trait \u00e0 la question du redressement. Je tiendrai d\u00fbment compte de ces documents, ainsi que de tout autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve pertinent d\u00e9j\u00e0 soumis \u00e0 l\u2019audience. La plaignante a reconnu dans son plaidoyer final que m\u00eame si elle avait particip\u00e9 au PPLAC, elle n\u2019avait aucune garantie de se voir offrir un poste de superviseure. Le PPLAC n\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019un outil servant \u00e0 \u00e9valuer les candidats int\u00e9ress\u00e9s. Au moment de r\u00e9diger leurs observations, il est important que les parties gardent \u00e0 l\u2019esprit les dispositions sp\u00e9cifiques de l\u2019article 53 et consid\u00e8rent dans quelle mesure elles exigent d\u2019\u00e9tablir un lien causal entre la pratique discriminatoire et la perte all\u00e9gu\u00e9e (voir p. ex. Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 268, (\u00ab Chopra \u00bb) paragraphe 37.)\n[91] De plus, les parties doivent aborder la question de savoir si le Tribunal doit appliquer la doctrine de l\u2019att\u00e9nuation des pertes aux demandes d\u2019indemnisation et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, dans quelle mesure (voir Chopra, paragraphe 40). Elles pourront naturellement se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 tout autre texte juridique faisant autorit\u00e9 et qu\u2019elles jugent pertinent quant \u00e0 leur demande de redressement en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nB. Retrait des t\u00e2ches Version 2\n[92] Mme Stanger a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 durant son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait vu confier des t\u00e2ches Version 2 parce qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient adapt\u00e9es aux restrictions li\u00e9es \u00e0 sa DPP. Ces t\u00e2ches supposaient plusieurs heures mensuelles de travail administratif li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019envoi postal de ch\u00e8ques d\u2019aide sociale provinciale. D\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Stanger, son superviseur, M. Michael Yaromy, l\u2019aurait inform\u00e9e au d\u00e9but de 2008 qu\u2019elle ne ferait plus ce travail, et qu\u2019elle devait former sa rempla\u00e7ante sur\u2011le\u2011champ. Elle pr\u00e9tend que d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s avaient l\u2019impression qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e aux t\u00e2ches Version 2 en raison d\u2019un avantage li\u00e9 \u00e0 sa relation conjugale avec le chef Stanger. Je lui ai sp\u00e9cifiquement demand\u00e9 si ces t\u00e2ches lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9es, et elle a r\u00e9pondu par l\u2019affirmative.\n[93] M. Yaromy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne se souvenait pas que les t\u00e2ches Version 2 aient jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Stanger. Les autres travailleurs ne se sont jamais plaints aupr\u00e8s de lui du fait que celle-ci en soit charg\u00e9e, et il n\u2019a entendu personne en parler comme d\u2019un avantage. Il a convenu que Mme Stanger avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9e de former d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s aux fins de la r\u00e9alisation des t\u00e2ches Version 2, mais seulement pour veiller \u00e0 ce que d\u2019autres travailleurs puissent s\u2019en occuper si elle \u00e9tait absente ou autrement incapable de faire son travail.\n[94] Durant son contre\u2011interrogatoire, M. Yaromy s\u2019est fait poser une question faisant valoir que Mme Stanger avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les t\u00e2ches Version 2 lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9es. Cependant, il ne lui a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 si ces t\u00e2ches lui avaient r\u00e9ellement \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9es ou s\u2019il l\u2019avait jamais avis\u00e9e qu\u2019elles le seraient. Je trouve l\u2019omission de ces deux questions \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape du contre\u2011interrogatoire assez r\u00e9v\u00e9latrice.\n[95] Je donne pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance \u00e0 la d\u00e9position de M. Yaromy parce qu\u2019elle est plus coh\u00e9rente et logique. Mme Stanger a livr\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage principal tr\u00e8s succinct, alors que M. Yaromy a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 plusieurs questions sur le sujet. De plus, lorsque j\u2019ai sp\u00e9cifiquement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Stanger si les t\u00e2ches Version 2 lui avaient r\u00e9ellement \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9es, elle a r\u00e9pondu par l\u2019affirmative, mais de mani\u00e8re plut\u00f4t vague, avant de changer de sujet. Je ne suis pas convaincu que les t\u00e2ches Version 2 aient jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Stanger. Il se peut qu\u2019on lui ait demand\u00e9 de former d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s, mais elle ne m\u2019a pas convaincu que ces t\u00e2ches lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9es d\u00e9finitivement et qu\u2019elle a donc subi un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel pr\u00e9judiciable. De plus, contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019affirme son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions, aucun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, y compris son propre t\u00e9moignage, ne laisse supposer un lien entre le pr\u00e9tendu retrait des t\u00e2ches et sa d\u00e9ficience. Son all\u00e9gation concernant les impressions des autres employ\u00e9s sugg\u00e8re plut\u00f4t un lien avec le motif fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, et c\u2019est pourquoi nous l\u2019examinons ici. Cependant, j\u2019estime que Mme Stanger n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de ces impressions en affirmant simplement qu\u2019elles existaient.\nVIII. All\u00e9gations de discrimination li\u00e9es \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience aux termes de l\u2019article 7\n[96] Mme Stanger all\u00e8gue que certaines t\u00e2ches professionnelles dont elle \u00e9tait capable de s\u2019acquitter lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9es en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. D\u2019apr\u00e8s elle, ce retrait d\u00e9coulait de plaintes de coll\u00e8gues concernant sa DPP et constituait un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel pr\u00e9judiciable aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP.\n[97] En 2004, apr\u00e8s avoir compl\u00e9t\u00e9 le programme de retour progressif au travail, Mme Stanger a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e au quart num\u00e9ro 3 dans la section Communication A de l\u2019ETCVic. Chaque section de quart comprenait environ 16 employ\u00e9s et devait s\u2019acquitter de 13 activit\u00e9s sp\u00e9cifiques. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9crire toutes ces t\u00e2ches en d\u00e9tail aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Cependant, les t\u00e2ches principales sont couramment d\u00e9sign\u00e9es ainsi : A\/O; Sans Codes; V\u00e9rification des sacs; Version 2; EFM; O\u2019Cull; et DRS.\n[98] Les travailleurs de sa section \u00e9taient affect\u00e9s \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes t\u00e2ches, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement toutes les deux heures. La rotation des t\u00e2ches \u00e9tait affich\u00e9e chaque semaine de sorte que chaque travailleur du quart savait quelles activit\u00e9s il devait accomplir tous les jours. Le superviseur de Mme Stanger, M. Yaromy, a expliqu\u00e9 durant son t\u00e9moignage que la planification d\u2019une rotation de t\u00e2ches productives \u00e0 confier \u00e0 Mme Stanger demandait beaucoup d\u2019effort en raison des restrictions li\u00e9es \u00e0 sa DPP.\n[99] Une preuve abondante a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e durant l\u2019audience au sujet de chacune des t\u00e2ches sp\u00e9cifiques et des efforts physiques qu\u2019elles demandaient. Mme Stanger a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Postes Canada a compos\u00e9 avec ses besoins de 2004 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin 2007\u2013d\u00e9but 2008. Durant cette p\u00e9riode, elle a accompli les t\u00e2ches V\u00e9rification des sacs, A\/O, O\u2019Cull, Version 2, EFM et Sans Codes. Ses limitations ne lui permettaient pas de s\u2019acquitter de certaines parties de ces t\u00e2ches, comme la d\u00e9charge des sacs pendant l\u2019op\u00e9ration O\u2019Cull.\n[100] Mme Stanger a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 partir de la fin 2007, certains coll\u00e8gues se sont plaints \u00e0 elle et \u00e0 d\u2019autres au sujet de ses limitations physiques. \u00c0 ce qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9tend, ces plaintes ont conduit M. Yaromy, son superviseur, et Mme Paula Sylvester, une autre superviseure, \u00e0 lui retirer certaines t\u00e2ches de rotation.\nA. Incidents concernant Randy Bourke et Norma Chin\n[101] Mme Stanger a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les t\u00e2ches A\/O lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9es \u00e0 deux reprises \u00e0 la fin de 2007, lorsque son quart de travail chevauchait l\u2019espace d\u2019une heure environ le quart de nuit \u00e0 l\u2019ETCVic. Un soir, alors qu\u2019elle effectuait des t\u00e2ches A\/O aux alentours du quai 3, \u00e9galement occup\u00e9 par M. Randy Bourke, un travailleur du quart de nuit, ce dernier lui aurait dit que ces t\u00e2ches n\u2019\u00e9taient r\u00e9serv\u00e9es qu\u2019\u00e0 son quart \u00e0 lui; elle est donc retourn\u00e9e voir M. Yaromy qui l\u2019a affect\u00e9e \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification des sacs. D\u2019apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage, M. Bourke \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s en col\u00e8re et lui a dit de quitter la zone du quai 3. Mme Stanger a accus\u00e9 M. Yaromy de ne pas avoir r\u00e9agi \u00e0 la situation.\n[102] Environ une semaine plus tard, Mme Stanger pr\u00e9tend \u00eatre retourn\u00e9e au quai 3 pour ex\u00e9cuter des t\u00e2ches A\/O lorsqu\u2019une autre employ\u00e9e, Mme Norma Chin, lui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ces t\u00e2ches lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9es \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient r\u00e9serv\u00e9es au quart de nuit. Mme Stanger affirme qu\u2019elle s\u2019en est plainte \u00e0 M. Yaromy et qu\u2019il lui a r\u00e9pondu de faire autre chose \u00e0 la place.\n[103] Ni M. Bourke ni Mme Chin n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Cependant, M. Yaromy a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin par l\u2019intim\u00e9e : il a livr\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage principal, a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre\u2011interrog\u00e9 puis r\u00e9interrog\u00e9 par voie d\u2019affidavit, parce qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas assister \u00e0 l\u2019audience. M. Yaromy se rappelle que Mme Stanger s\u2019\u00e9tait plainte du fait que M. Bourke lui avait demand\u00e9 de quitter la zone du quai 3. Il n\u2019avait pas le souvenir d\u2019une plainte concernant Mme Chin.\n[104] M. Yaromy affirme qu\u2019il s\u2019est adress\u00e9 au superviseur du quai 3, Dave Diertens, pour obtenir des clarifications apr\u00e8s que Mme Stanger s\u2019\u00e9tait plainte de M. Bourke. M. Diertens l\u2019a inform\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu que les op\u00e9rations A\/O soient confi\u00e9es aux travailleurs du quart de nuit du quai 3. Cette r\u00e8gle devait \u00eatre respect\u00e9e, c\u2019est pourquoi il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait probablement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Stanger de s\u2019occuper d\u2019une autre t\u00e2che dont elle pouvait s\u2019acquitter malgr\u00e9 les restrictions li\u00e9es \u00e0 sa DPP.\n[105] J\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Stanger suivant lequel ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements concernant les travailleurs du quai 3 sont survenus. Cependant, elle n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que sa r\u00e9affectation \u00e0 d\u2019autres t\u00e2ches avait le moindre rapport avec sa d\u00e9ficience. La preuve indique clairement que Mme Stanger s\u2019est fait dire de quitter la zone du quai 3 parce que les t\u00e2ches A\/O incombaient \u00e0 un autre quart charg\u00e9 de travailler dans cette zone. Par cons\u00e9quent, comme Mme Stanger n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien entre le traitement qu\u2019elle a subi et un motif de discrimination illicite, j\u2019estime que les all\u00e9gations touchant M. Bourke et Mme Chin ne sont pas fond\u00e9es.\nB. Incident concernant Joanne Cook\n[106] Mme Stanger a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les t\u00e2ches Sans Codes lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9finitive \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un incident concernant l\u2019une de ses coll\u00e8gues, Mme Joanne Cook. \u00c0 la fin de 2007, Mme Stanger a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e aux t\u00e2ches Sans Codes, qui consistaient \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier les codes postaux \u00e0 un bureau. Ayant aper\u00e7u un bureau vide contre le mur, Mme Stanger a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019aller s\u2019y asseoir pour effectuer cette rotation. \u00c0 ce qu\u2019elle affirme, Mme Cook l\u2019a approch\u00e9e et lui a dit : [traduction] \u00ab Tu dois partir \u00bb. Cette derni\u00e8re aurait alors ajout\u00e9, la voix teint\u00e9e de col\u00e8re : [traduction] \u00ab Je pourrais te faire mal si tu t\u2019assois l\u00e0 \u00bb. Mme Stanger a alors d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Et je me suis sentie menac\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019elle m\u2019a dit qu\u2019elle allait me taper. Je me suis sentie menac\u00e9e par ces paroles \u00bb. Lorsque j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Stanger : [traduction] \u00ab A\u2011t\u2011elle utilis\u00e9 ces mots? \u00bb, elle a r\u00e9pondu par l\u2019affirmative. Pour plus de clart\u00e9, je lui ai redemand\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Elle a dit qu\u2019elle allait vous taper? \u00bb Mme Stanger a alors modifi\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Cook a peut-\u00eatre dit : [traduction] \u00ab Je risque de te taper si tu t\u2019assois l\u00e0 \u00bb.\n[107] Lorsque j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Stanger de pr\u00e9ciser ce qu\u2019elle croyait que Mme Cook avait voulu dire par [traduction] \u00ab taper \u00bb, elle a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle avait compris qu\u2019elle allait la taper avec une bo\u00eete ou un autre objet lourd. \u00c0 mon avis, cela diff\u00e8re de ce qu\u2019elle disait plus t\u00f4t dans son t\u00e9moignage en insinuant par la phrase [traduction] \u00ab elle allait me taper \u00bb que Mme Cook avait menac\u00e9 de la frapper. Je pense que Mme Stanger a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment exag\u00e9r\u00e9 ces paroles pour donner cette impression.\n[108] Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, Mme Stanger a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019est sentie menac\u00e9e par les commentaires de Mme Cook, et donc qu\u2019elle s\u2019est plainte \u00e0 son superviseur, M. Yaromy : elle l\u2019a inform\u00e9 qu\u2019elle se sentait menac\u00e9e par Mme Cook et lui a demand\u00e9 de lui parler. M. Yaromy ne s\u2019est pas imm\u00e9diatement entretenu avec Mme Cook; il a dit \u00e0 Mme Stanger de faire autre chose \u00e0 la place, et du coup cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019est sentie abandonn\u00e9e. Elle affirme qu\u2019elle n\u2019a plus jamais effectu\u00e9 de t\u00e2ches Sans Codes. Mme Stanger a racont\u00e9 cette histoire comme un exemple de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa DPP, consistant \u00e0 \u00e9liminer une rotation de travail de son horaire sans lui proposer de mesures d\u2019adaptation.\n[109] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a appel\u00e9 Mme Cook comme t\u00e9moin. Cette derni\u00e8re se souvenait clairement de l\u2019interaction avec Mme Stanger parce qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019est produite qu\u2019une seule fois. Elle affirme qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en col\u00e8re et qu\u2019elle a simplement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Stanger de ne pas se mettre au bureau parce qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas assez spacieux pour que deux personnes y travaillent. Par ailleurs, c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019espace de travail habituel de Mme Cook lorsqu\u2019elle effectuait les v\u00e9rifications Sans Codes. Peu apr\u00e8s sa conversation avec Mme Stanger, le chef Stanger s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 son bureau et avant qu\u2019elle ne puisse dire quoi que ce soit, il lui a demand\u00e9 si cela lui posait un probl\u00e8me de travailler avec les autres. Mme Cook d\u00e9clare avoir expliqu\u00e9 au chef Stanger qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas assez de place pour deux personnes, qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une zone \u00ab chaussures \u00e0 embouts d\u2019acier \u00bb dans l\u2019espace de travail, ce qui la rendait plus dangereuse. Mme Cook a ni\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en col\u00e8re ou qu\u2019elle ait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Stanger qu\u2019elle pouvait lui faire du mal si elle travaillait l\u00e0\u2011bas.\n[110] M. Yaromy a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de l\u2019incident concernant Mme Cook. Il se souvenait que Mme Stanger s\u2019en \u00e9tait plainte et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait all\u00e9 voir Mme Cook directement. Cette derni\u00e8re lui a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait dit que Mme Stanger risquait de se faire mal accidentellement si elle travaillait \u00e0 ce bureau en particulier pendant qu\u2019elle et d\u2019autres coll\u00e8gues de quart s\u2019en servaient ponctuellement. M. Yaromy a remarqu\u00e9 que Mme Cook \u00e9tait l\u00e9g\u00e8rement contrari\u00e9e par cet incident, mais il n\u2019a pas reconnu qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en col\u00e8re. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s cet incident, le chef Stanger a install\u00e9 un bureau \u00e0 l\u2019autre bout de l\u2019espace r\u00e9serv\u00e9 au lecteur optique de caract\u00e8res multiligne (LOCML) et que Mme Stanger a continu\u00e9 d\u2019y effectuer les t\u00e2ches Sans Codes.\n[111] Je donne pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance aux d\u00e9positions de Mme Cook et de M. Yaromy concernant cet incident. J\u2019estime que Mme Stanger a exag\u00e9r\u00e9 le r\u00e9cit de cet \u00e9change et qu\u2019elle est revenue sur son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 mesure que je la questionnais. D\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, les t\u00e9moignages de M. Yaromy et de Mme Cook \u00e9taient plus coh\u00e9rents. Mme Cook a simplement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Stanger de travailler ailleurs. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel et pr\u00e9judiciable. Elle s\u2019est peut-\u00eatre montr\u00e9e s\u00e8che et laconique durant la conversation, mais compte tenu de la preuve, je conclus que Mme Cook n\u2019a pas menac\u00e9 Mme Stanger. Sans que cela ne soit d\u00e9cisif, rien ne prouve que Mme Cook savait d\u2019ailleurs que Mme Stanger avait des limitations du fait de sa DPP. Je conclus aussi que personne n\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9 Mme Stanger, ni sur\u2011le\u2011champ ni par la suite, d\u2019accomplir les t\u00e2ches Sans Codes. M. Yaromy a tr\u00e8s clairement indiqu\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9position que le chef Stanger avait procur\u00e9 un bureau \u00e0 Mme Stanger dans ce but pr\u00e9cis et qu\u2019elle a ensuite continu\u00e9 \u00e0 effectuer cette rotation. La plaignante n\u2019a pas \u00e9tay\u00e9 cette partie de la plainte. J\u2019ajouterais qu\u2019aucun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s quant \u00e0 cette all\u00e9gation, y compris le t\u00e9moignage m\u00eame de la plaignante, ne r\u00e9v\u00e9lait de lien entre la conduite de Mme Cook et la pr\u00e9tendue r\u00e9affectation, d\u2019une part, et la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante, de l\u2019autre.\nC. Retrait des t\u00e2ches O\u2019Cull\n[112] Mme Stanger a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e de la rotation O\u2019Cull au d\u00e9but de 2008. Cette rotation consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9charger des sacs de courrier et \u00e0 trier les articles individuels. Le Tribunal a appris que toutes les 30 minutes, les quatre employ\u00e9s affect\u00e9s \u00e0 cette rotation alternaient de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que chacun passe 30 minutes \u00e0 d\u00e9charger les sacs, ce travail \u00e9tant plus fatigant. Mme Stanger a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a effectu\u00e9 la rotation O\u2019Cull, mais qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait dispens\u00e9e de la d\u00e9charge des sacs. Elle affirme que M. Yaromy l\u2019a retir\u00e9e de cette rotation apr\u00e8s que d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s se sont plaints au sujet de sa DPP.\n[113] M. Yaromy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019au d\u00e9but de 2008 environ, la rotation O\u2019Cull a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e en ceci que le nombre d\u2019employ\u00e9s affect\u00e9s \u00e0 chaque rotation est pass\u00e9 de quatre \u00e0 trois. Cela voulait dire que des employ\u00e9s valides se relayaient plus fr\u00e9quemment au poste consistant \u00e0 d\u00e9charger les sacs de courrier sur la bande de triage. Comme Mme Stanger ne pouvait pas d\u00e9charger les sacs, elle a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9e de la rotation. Au souvenir de M. Yaromy, c\u2019est la seule fois que Mme Stanger s\u2019est vu retirer des fonctions li\u00e9es \u00e0 son emploi. En l\u2019occurrence, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le seul \u00e0 avoir pris cette d\u00e9cision qu\u2019ont \u00e9galement approuv\u00e9e deux autres superviseurs, un chef et un directeur de l\u2019installation. Celle-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par souci pour sa sant\u00e9 et sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9, et non parce que d\u2019autres coll\u00e8gues s\u2019\u00e9taient plaints de la DPP de Mme Stanger.\n[114] M. Yaromy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il a entendu une fois un employ\u00e9 se plaindre de devoir [traduction] \u00ab compenser \u00bb pour les employ\u00e9s atteints de DPP. Cependant, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un commentaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui ne visait pas Mme Stanger. M. Yaromy a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 que cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019\u00e9tait plainte une fois aupr\u00e8s de lui de ce que les coll\u00e8gues la traitaient durement. Cependant, il ne se rappelle pas avoir entendu Mme Stanger dire que cela avait un lien avec sa DPP ou son \u00e9tat matrimonial.\n[115] Mme Stanger ne m\u2019a pas convaincu que son retrait de la rotation O\u2019Cull constituait un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel pr\u00e9judiciable. Le retrait de t\u00e2ches pour des raisons li\u00e9es \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas en soi un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable. Mme Stanger n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 que ces actes \u00e9taient \u00ab pr\u00e9judiciable[s], dommageable[s] ou mauvais \u00bb au sens de l\u2019arr\u00eat Tahmourpour c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (2010 CAF 192, paragraphe 12). Par ailleurs, le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral reconna\u00eet que les mesures justifi\u00e9es prises pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ne sont pas discriminatoires (voir l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) et le paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP). La preuve suffisait \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que la rotation a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 retirer un employ\u00e9 et cr\u00e9er un fardeau physique additionnel relativement \u00e0 la d\u00e9charge des sacs.\nIX. All\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial aux termes de l\u2019article 14\n[116] Mme Stanger pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9e en milieu de travail par d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s en raison de son \u00e9tat matrimonial, \u00e0 savoir son union de fait devenue mariage l\u00e9gal avec le chef de l\u2019ETCVic, Patrick Stanger. D\u2019apr\u00e8s elle, une s\u00e9rie d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus entre 2005 et 2008 constituait du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la LCDP. Chacun de ces pr\u00e9tendus \u00e9v\u00e9nements sera examin\u00e9 ci\u2011apr\u00e8s.\nA. Grief concernant Guy Labine \u2013 Harc\u00e8lement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019horaire des pauses\n[117] Mme Stanger pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9e en milieu de travail le ou vers le 7 f\u00e9vrier 2006, par son superviseur, Guy Labine, lorsque ce dernier a parl\u00e9 de sa relation personnelle avec Patrick Stanger devant des coll\u00e8gues dans l\u2019atelier. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019est sentie g\u00ean\u00e9e et intimid\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019il a laiss\u00e9 entendre \u00e0 voix haute que les gens de l\u2019atelier avaient l\u2019impression qu\u2019elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait d\u2019un traitement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel quant \u00e0 ses pauses \u00e0 cause de sa relation. Cet incident a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un grief officiel d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par Mme Stanger le 15 f\u00e9vrier 2006.\n[118] D\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Stanger, M. Labine s\u2019est entretenu avec elle en pr\u00e9sence de deux d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9es syndicales, Sue Robinet et Betty Kristofferson, concernant l\u2019horaire de ses pauses. M. Labine lui a demand\u00e9 de s\u2019en tenir \u00e0 un horaire pour ses pauses-d\u00e9jeuner (plus t\u00f4t ou plus tard). D\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Stanger, cela lui \u00e9tait \u00e9gal, et elle \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 prendre la pause qui \u00e9tait la plus logique compte tenu des restrictions li\u00e9es \u00e0 sa DPP. Mme Stanger a eu l\u2019impression que les personnes pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 cette r\u00e9union [traduction] \u00ab se liguaient contre elle \u00bb, et elle pr\u00e9tend que les d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9es syndicales n\u2019\u00e9taient pas l\u00e0 pour repr\u00e9senter ses int\u00e9r\u00eats. Elle s\u2019est sentie en col\u00e8re et tr\u00e8s contrari\u00e9e. M. Labine lui a dit de prendre sa pause plus t\u00f4t.\n[119] M. Labine a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin par l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour d\u00e9poser au sujet de l\u2019incident et des plaintes concernant les pauses de Mme Stanger. M. Labine travaillait comme superviseur int\u00e9rimaire \u00e0 l\u2019ETCVic en 2006, il \u00e9tait alors le superviseur imm\u00e9diat de la plaignante, et relevait lui-m\u00eame du chef Stanger.\n[120] M. Labine a remis cet incident dans son contexte. Le quart de nuit \u00e9tait r\u00e9parti en deux groupes qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient chacun d\u2019une pause\u2011d\u00e9jeuner r\u00e9serv\u00e9e d\u2019une demi\u2011heure. Les pauses\u2011d\u00e9jeuner devaient \u00eatre strictement respect\u00e9es afin que les rotations puissent se poursuivre de mani\u00e8re ordonn\u00e9e. M. Labine affirme qu\u2019il est possible que Mme Stanger ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019occasion, en raison de sa DPP, de changer l\u2019heure de ses pauses. \u00c0 la fin de 2005, Mme Sue Savoy, une des coll\u00e8gues de Mme Stanger, et deux d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9es syndicales, Sue Robinet et Betty Kristofferson, se sont adress\u00e9es \u00e0 lui pour se plaindre des horaires de pause de Mme Stanger. Leur plainte comportait deux volets : Mme Stanger ne semblait pas prendre ses pauses conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019horaire de l\u2019un ou de l\u2019autre groupe; et elle prenait souvent plus que les 30 minutes allou\u00e9es pour sa pause\u2011d\u00e9jeuner. Aucune des parties n\u2019a appel\u00e9 Mme Robinet ou Mme Kristofferson comme t\u00e9moins. Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait compara\u00eetre Mme Savoy dont nous examinerons la d\u00e9position plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. De plus, M. Labine d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il a fait remarquer \u00e0 Mme Stanger que les gens avaient l\u2019impression qu\u2019elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait d\u2019un traitement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel en raison de sa relation avec le chef Stanger, et que Mme Savoy et les d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9es syndicales l\u2019en avaient inform\u00e9.\n[121] M. Labine a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il a observ\u00e9 les pauses\u2011d\u00e9jeuner de Mme Stanger pendant quelques semaines apr\u00e8s cet incident, et en a conclu que les plaintes \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es. Mme Stanger ne semblait pas suivre l\u2019horaire r\u00e9gulier de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre groupe, et elle revenait souvent de ses pauses avec 10 \u00e0 20 minutes de retard. Il a \u00e9galement remarqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle prenait plusieurs fois sa pause\u2011d\u00e9jeuner avec M. Stanger, et qu\u2019ils revenaient au travail en m\u00eame temps.\n[122] M. Labine a \u00e9galement d\u00e9crit durant son t\u00e9moignage le syst\u00e8me de cartes magn\u00e9tiques de Postes Canada, qui permettait de surveiller l\u2019assiduit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s. Tous les employ\u00e9s avaient une carte qu\u2019ils devaient passer sous un lecteur pour enregistrer l\u2019heure d\u2019arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019atelier, l\u2019heure \u00e0 laquelle ils prenaient leurs pauses et en revenaient, et l\u2019heure \u00e0 laquelle ils quittaient le travail \u00e0 la fin de leur quart. Le syst\u00e8me informatique g\u00e9n\u00e9rait un rapport bas\u00e9 sur les pointages. Cependant, si un employ\u00e9 ne passait pas sa carte \u00e0 l\u2019entr\u00e9e ou \u00e0 la sortie de l\u2019atelier, un rapport d\u2019erreur \u00e9tait g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9. Le superviseur devait alors forcer le syst\u00e8me et entrer une heure pour corriger l\u2019erreur. Il devait apporter ces corrections, si n\u00e9cessaire, \u00e0 la fin de chaque quart.\n[123] M. Labine a remarqu\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises que Mme Stanger n\u2019avait pas pass\u00e9 sa carte lorsqu\u2019elle prenait ses pauses, ce qui l\u2019obligeait \u00e0 forcer le syst\u00e8me et \u00e0 entrer une heure pour le pointage manquant, qui correspondait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement au d\u00e9but ou \u00e0 la fin de sa pause\u2011d\u00e9jeuner. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait d\u00fb saisir les pointages manquants de Mme Stanger plusieurs fois par semaine.\n[124] M. Labine a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de porter la question \u00e0 l\u2019attention de l\u2019\u00e9chelon sup\u00e9rieur, ce qui lui a paru d\u00e9licat, car cela signifiait qu\u2019il devait s\u2019adresser \u00e0 son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat, le chef Stanger. M\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise, M. Labine pensait que s\u2019il pr\u00e9sentait le probl\u00e8me \u00e0 M. Stanger, l\u2019affaire s\u2019arrangerait d\u2019elle\u2011m\u00eame. Il ne lui a pas parl\u00e9 des pauses prolong\u00e9es, mais a simplement not\u00e9 que la plaignante prenait ses pauses\u2011d\u00e9jeuner de fa\u00e7on erratique. M. Labine a demand\u00e9 au chef s\u2019il pouvait prier la plaignante de respecter l\u2019horaire de pause indiqu\u00e9 et de s\u2019assurer de passer sa carte \u00e0 chaque fois.\n[125] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, M. Labine a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il se souvenait clairement de la r\u00e9ponse de M. Stanger \u00e0 sa demande, car celui-ci a eu une r\u00e9action tout \u00e0 fait inattendue. D\u2019apr\u00e8s M. Labine, le chef lui a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il ne pensait pas que c\u2019\u00e9tait une bonne id\u00e9e de lui demander de parler avec Mme Stanger. M. Labine a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s d\u00e9contenanc\u00e9 par la r\u00e9ponse parce qu\u2019il s\u2019attendait \u00e0 ce que M. Stanger r\u00e9agisse plus amicalement.\n[126] M. Labine se souvient qu\u2019un autre superviseur, M. Bob Tischert, a relev\u00e9 le m\u00eame probl\u00e8me concernant les pauses de Mme Stanger. Avant sa conversation avec M. Stanger, M. Tischert et lui sont all\u00e9s voir Sherri Aiken, la directrice de l\u2019ETCVic. M. Labine a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il a montr\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Aiken un affichage dynamique de la liste, soit une liste des pointages des cartes des employ\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9e par ordinateur, pour lui donner la mesure du probl\u00e8me.\n[127] Deux fichiers semblables d\u2019affichage dynamique de la liste ont \u00e9t\u00e9 admis en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Le premier indique que les pointages de Mme Stanger ont \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9s par M. Stanger deux fois le 30 janvier 2006. M. Labine a qualifi\u00e9 les actes de ce dernier d\u2019[traduction] \u00ab inappropri\u00e9s \u00bb et d\u2019[traduction] \u00ab anormaux \u00bb, puisqu\u2019il incombe aux superviseurs, et non aux chefs, de corriger les erreurs dans le fichier d\u2019affichage dynamique de la liste. Le deuxi\u00e8me fichier montre que M. Stanger a modifi\u00e9 le pointage de Mme Stanger 45 fois entre 2005 et 2008.\n[128] Comme le probl\u00e8me persistait, M. Labine a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, ainsi qu\u2019il l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, d\u2019avoir une conversation avec Mme Stanger au sujet de ses pauses, d\u2019o\u00f9 la discussion \u00e0 l\u2019atelier en pr\u00e9sence des deux d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9es syndicales, Mmes Robinet et Kristofferson. M. Labine a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Stanger de choisir la pause d\u2019un groupe et de s\u2019y tenir, et l\u2019a pr\u00e9venue que sa conduite en cette mati\u00e8re avait donn\u00e9 l\u2019impression \u00e0 certains de ses coll\u00e8gues qu\u2019elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait d\u2019un traitement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel en raison de sa relation avec le chef. M. Labine a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7u une formation pour g\u00e9rer les conflits dans l\u2019atelier, et qu\u2019il lui a donc parl\u00e9 calmement et de mani\u00e8re professionnelle, en lui pr\u00e9sentant les faits tels qu\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance. M. Labine a indiqu\u00e9 que Mme Stanger a r\u00e9agi de mani\u00e8re [traduction] \u00ab tr\u00e8s agit\u00e9e et agressive \u00bb. Il a donc tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9samorcer la situation \u00e0 l\u2019atelier, cette effusion soudaine d\u2019\u00e9motions n\u2019ayant rien pour lui plaire. M. Labine a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il a imm\u00e9diatement pris la d\u00e9cision de ne plus s\u2019occuper de ce probl\u00e8me, estimant que l\u2019imposition d\u2019une mesure disciplinaire ne relevait pas de sa comp\u00e9tence. Il a r\u00e9solu de simplement signaler \u00e0 nouveau le fait \u00e0 Sherri Aiken, la directrice, et c\u2019est ce qu\u2019il a fait.\n[129] Apr\u00e8s cette conversation dans l\u2019atelier, Mme Stanger a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief syndical \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de M. Labine, au motif qu\u2019elle [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embarrass\u00e9e en pr\u00e9sence de coll\u00e8gues parce que le superviseur Guy Labine a mentionn\u00e9 plusieurs fois que la plaignante sortait avec le chef Pat Stanger et affirm\u00e9 que certains avaient l\u2019impression qu\u2019elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait d\u2019un traitement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel \u00bb.\n[130] M. Labine a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s choqu\u00e9 et contrari\u00e9 d\u2019apprendre qu\u2019un grief avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 contre lui, et que cela ne s\u2019\u00e9tait jamais produit durant sa longue carri\u00e8re dans le secteur priv\u00e9 et syndiqu\u00e9 des services de messagerie. Il \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement contrari\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait que superviseur int\u00e9rimaire, et qu\u2019il craignait que le grief compromette ses chances d\u2019avancement. En fin de compte, le diff\u00e9rend entre le syndicat et la direction a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solu par le biais d\u2019un m\u00e9moire d\u2019entente, vers\u00e9 en pi\u00e8ce. Postes Canada a accept\u00e9 de rappeler formellement aux superviseurs du local de Victoria que la vie personnelle d\u2019un employ\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un sujet de discussion appropri\u00e9 dans l\u2019atelier, ce qui a permis de r\u00e9gler enti\u00e8rement le grief.\n[131] J\u2019estime que les d\u00e9clarations de M. Labine durant la conversation qui s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e dans l\u2019atelier ne constituent pas du harc\u00e8lement au titre de la LCDP. La plaignante a \u00e9tabli que l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement s\u2019est produit et que son \u00e9tat matrimonial (sa relation avec le chef avec qui elle cohabitait alors depuis plus d\u2019un an) a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9 en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s. Cependant, j\u2019estime que la conduite de M. Labine n\u2019a pas viol\u00e9 la dignit\u00e9 de Mme Stanger de telle mani\u00e8re \u00e0 contribuer \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un environnement de travail hostile ou malsain. Il est possible que la plaignante ait trouv\u00e9 les commentaires de M. Labine malvenus et embarrassants. Cependant, compte tenu de la preuve, ces actes rel\u00e8vent d\u2019un exercice justifi\u00e9 d\u2019un pouvoir de supervision aux fins des activit\u00e9s et des objectifs op\u00e9rationnels l\u00e9gitimes de l\u2019employeur (voir Day, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 184).\n[132] Quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si l\u2019incident constituait un traitement d\u00e9gradant, humiliant ou insultant, je dois conclure que la conversation n\u2019avait rien d\u2019inappropri\u00e9 dans les circonstances, comme l\u2019\u00e9tablit la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Labine m\u2019a convaincu qu\u2019il s\u2019est adress\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de mani\u00e8re professionnelle, et qu\u2019il n\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 sa relation que dans le contexte des plaintes qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7ues des autres employ\u00e9s. M\u00eame si les d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9es syndicales \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sentes, je ne crois pas qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient l\u00e0 pour se [traduction] \u00ab liguer \u00bb avec M. Labine contre Mme Stanger. Ce sont elles qui ont initialement soumis la plainte \u00e0 M. Labine et leur pr\u00e9sence a probablement \u00e9t\u00e9 per\u00e7ue comme relevant de leurs responsabilit\u00e9s l\u00e9gitimes en mati\u00e8re de relations de travail. Rien n\u2019indique que d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s aient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sents.\nB. Incidents concernant Mme Susan Savoy\n[133] Mme Stanger a \u00e9galement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que Susan Savoy, une coll\u00e8gue, l\u2019a harcel\u00e9e en raison de son \u00e9tat matrimonial. Deux all\u00e9gations distinctes visent Mme Savoy : cette derni\u00e8re l\u2019aurait harcel\u00e9e en d\u00e9clarant, d\u2019une part, que Mme Stanger b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait d\u2019un traitement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel en mati\u00e8re de pauses, et d\u2019autres part, que la relation de Mme Stanger avec le chef n\u2019\u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab pas chr\u00e9tienne \u00bb.\n[134] Mme Savoy, qui \u00e9tait une coll\u00e8gue de la plaignante en 2006, a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e comme t\u00e9moin par l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Mme Stanger, dont le t\u00e9moignage concernant Mme Savoy n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tr\u00e8s clair, a insinu\u00e9 que les deux pr\u00e9tendus \u00e9v\u00e9nements se sont produits en m\u00eame temps. Elle n\u2019a pas bien pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 \u00e0 quelle date, mais a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Savoy lui a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 la directrice de l\u2019ETCVic, pour se plaindre de ses pauses irr\u00e9guli\u00e8res. Mme Stanger soutient que Mme Savoy \u00e9tait pr\u00e9tentieuse et qu\u2019elle l\u2019a bless\u00e9e.\n[135] La lettre dat\u00e9e du 6 f\u00e9vrier 2006 que Mme Savoy a adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Aiken, directrice de l\u2019ETCVic, a \u00e9t\u00e9 admise en pi\u00e8ce \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Comme son contenu n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Stanger qu\u2019au moment de la divulgation en pr\u00e9vision de cette audience, la lettre elle-m\u00eame n\u2019est pas vis\u00e9e par l\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement. Cependant, je l\u2019\u00e9voque comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment de contexte de la situation. La lettre cite des occurrences sp\u00e9cifiques et d\u00e9taill\u00e9es de retour tardif des pauses, et explique en quoi cela a nui aux coll\u00e8gues affect\u00e9s aux rotations dont les t\u00e2ches exigeaient la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un effectif complet. Mme Savoy d\u00e9clarait dans sa lettre :\n[traduction] \u00c0 mon avis, changer son heure de pause \u00e0 leur convenance (les Stanger), ou pour servir leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats personnels trahit un m\u00e9pris manifeste pour la politique ou les r\u00e8gles et r\u00e8glements de la SCP. Cela t\u00e9moigne aussi d\u2019un manque de respect et de consid\u00e9ration totale pour la sant\u00e9 et le bien\u2011\u00eatre de ses coll\u00e8gues, qui ont la charge suppl\u00e9mentaire de son travail (en plus du leur).\n[136] Mme Savoy affirme qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9e \u00e0 travailler aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de Mme Stanger quelque temps apr\u00e8s avoir adress\u00e9 sa lettre \u00e0 Mme Aiken. Mme Savoy n\u2019a jamais re\u00e7u de r\u00e9ponse de la part de Mme Aiken et ignorait que Mme Stanger avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief contre M. Labine. Cependant, elle voulait \u00eatre directe avec elle et lui a donc parl\u00e9 de la lettre lorsqu\u2019elles travaillaient c\u00f4te \u00e0 c\u00f4te quelques semaines plus tard. Mme Savoy a indiqu\u00e9 que la conversation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 normale et d\u00e9nu\u00e9e d\u2019hostilit\u00e9.\n[137] L\u2019autre pr\u00e9tendu \u00e9v\u00e9nement s\u2019est produit plus t\u00f4t. Mme Savoy affirme avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de la relation de Mme Stanger avec le chef en 2005 par une coll\u00e8gue de l\u2019atelier. Elle se souvient avoir eu alors une longue conversation avec cette coll\u00e8gue qui \u00e9tait contrari\u00e9e que Mme Stanger ait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 fr\u00e9quenter le chef parce qu\u2019elle estimait que celle-ci se faisait utiliser et qu\u2019elle finirait par souffrir. Mme Savoy a d\u00e9fendu Mme Stanger, et not\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait assez \u00e2g\u00e9e pour prendre ses propres d\u00e9cisions. Plus tard cette ann\u00e9e\u2011l\u00e0, Mme Stanger est venue voir Mme Savoy, apr\u00e8s avoir discut\u00e9 de sa relation avec l\u2019autre employ\u00e9e. D\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Savoy, Mme Stanger semblait contente qu\u2019elle l\u2019ait d\u00e9fendue devant l\u2019autre employ\u00e9e. Mme Savoy lui a dit alors qu\u2019elle pensait effectivement que Mme Stanger avait le droit de prendre ses propres d\u00e9cisions, mais qu\u2019\u00e0 certains \u00e9gards, elle \u00e9tait d\u2019accord avec l\u2019autre employ\u00e9e quant au caract\u00e8re inappropri\u00e9 de la relation. Mme Savoy se souvient d\u2019avoir dit soit : [traduction] \u00ab dans ma religion, c\u2019est r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible [la relation] \u00bb ou alors : [traduction] \u00ab comme chr\u00e9tienne, c\u2019est peut-\u00eatre r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible \u00bb, car d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce qu\u2019elle savait de la situation, M. Stanger \u00e9tait encore mari\u00e9.\n[138] Au dire de Mme Savoy, Mme Stanger l\u2019a alors regard\u00e9e d\u2019un dr\u00f4le de mani\u00e8re. Elle ajoute que leur relation est peut-\u00eatre devenue moins amicale par la suite, mais que, pour sa part, elle ne l\u2019a pas \u00e9vit\u00e9e ni trait\u00e9e diff\u00e9remment.\n[139] Mme Stanger a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9position que Mme Savoy avait qualifi\u00e9e sa relation de [traduction] \u00ab pas chr\u00e9tienne \u00bb. M\u00eame si Mme Savoy ne se souvenait pas d\u2019avoir employ\u00e9 cette expression exacte, je suis convaincu, compte tenu de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les deux parties, que Mme Savoy a fait part \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019une sorte de jugement sur la conformit\u00e9 de sa relation personnelle avec le chef. Je suis \u00e9galement dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 admettre que le motif fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial entre en jeu, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les Stanger cohabitaient alors depuis au moins quelques mois (m\u00eame si l\u2019impression g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e9tait encore qu\u2019ils ne faisaient [traduction] \u00ab que se fr\u00e9quenter \u00bb). Cependant, je ne pense pas que le commentaire de Mme Savoy ait viol\u00e9 la dignit\u00e9 de Mme Stanger de telle mani\u00e8re \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un environnement hostile ou malsain. Peu avant ce commentaire, Mme Savoy a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Stanger avait le droit de prendre ses propres d\u00e9cisions. Je ne pense pas, compte tenu du contexte de cette conversation, que ce commentaire f\u00fbt d\u00e9gradant, humiliant ou insultant au sens de l\u2019article 14. De plus, je ne suis pas convaincu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait totalement spontan\u00e9, car il semblerait que c\u2019est Mme Stanger qui a amorc\u00e9 la conversation.\n[140] Mme Stanger a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9e par la lettre et par le fait que Mme Savoy ait laiss\u00e9 entendre qu\u2019elle jouissait d\u2019un traitement de faveur concernant ses pauses. Cependant, je ne pense pas que la conduite de Mme Savoy li\u00e9e \u00e0 sa plainte ait pu constituer du harc\u00e8lement. Une lettre de plainte adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la direction concernant le non\u2011respect par une coll\u00e8gue de la politique de l\u2019employeur en mati\u00e8re de pauses concorde avec les activit\u00e9s et les objectifs op\u00e9rationnels l\u00e9gitimes de l\u2019employeur. Rien n\u2019indique que la lettre ait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e de mauvaise foi ou \u00e0 des fins ill\u00e9gitimes. En fait, Mme Savoy n\u2019avait aucune raison de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler l\u2019existence de la lettre \u00e0 Mme Stanger. \u00c0 mon avis, elle ne l\u2019a fait que par souci de transparence et pour manifester la bonne foi dans laquelle elle l\u2019a r\u00e9dig\u00e9e. Dans ce contexte, j\u2019estime que la conversation n\u2019\u00e9tait ni d\u00e9gradante ni insultante, et que l\u2019embarras \u00e9ventuel caus\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Stanger ne relevait pas de l\u2019article 14.\nC. Patrick Gibbons \u2013 Incident du chariot\u2011\u00e9l\u00e9vateur\n[141] Mme Stanger all\u00e8gue que le 10 mars 2005, M. Patrick Gibbons, son ex\u2011mari, l\u2019a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment poursuivie dans l\u2019atelier alors qu\u2019il conduisait un chariot\u2011\u00e9l\u00e9vateur. Mme Stanger poussait une grosse bo\u00eete, qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9crite comme un [traduction] \u00ab coffre \u00bb, lorsque M. Gibbons s\u2019est approch\u00e9 par derri\u00e8re avec le chariot\u2011\u00e9l\u00e9vateur. Selon elle, il l\u2019a [traduction] \u00ab poursuivie \u00bb dans le chariot\u2011\u00e9l\u00e9vateur et \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab tr\u00e8s agressif \u00bb envers elle. Mme Stanger pr\u00e9tend s\u2019\u00eatre retourn\u00e9e et lui avoir dit de [traduction] \u00ab reculer \u00bb, mais M. Gibbons s\u2019est content\u00e9 de lui sourire et a continu\u00e9 de s\u2019approcher avec son v\u00e9hicule. Apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e de son chemin, Mme Stanger est all\u00e9e voir son superviseur imm\u00e9diat de l\u2019\u00e9poque, Dean Iverson, pour signaler l\u2019incident. M\u00eame si elle estimait que M. Gibbons avait franchi une ligne, elle a trouv\u00e9 que M. Iverson \u00e9tait totalement indiff\u00e9rent \u00e0 ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait produit. Elle s\u2019est ensuite rendue au bureau du chef Stanger pour rapporter l\u2019incident. Elle pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019un autre chef de quart, M. Brad Harrison, \u00e9tait \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent dans le bureau et qu\u2019elle leur a d\u00e9crit les d\u00e9tails de l\u2019incident du chariot\u2011\u00e9l\u00e9vateur, et ajoute que cet incident l\u2019a effray\u00e9e, intimid\u00e9e et remplie de col\u00e8re.\n[142] Mme Stanger a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune mesure n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise concernant l\u2019incident du chariot\u2011\u00e9l\u00e9vateur. Personne n\u2019en a parl\u00e9 et elle n\u2019a eu vent d\u2019aucune tentative de r\u00e9solution du probl\u00e8me. Elle ajoute s\u2019\u00eatre aussi entretenue avec ses d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9es syndicales, Mmes Kristofferson et Robinet, \u00e0 ce sujet. Elles lui auraient dit toutes les deux qu\u2019elles ne pouvaient pas lui parler en raison d\u2019un conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats, vraisemblablement entre elle et M. Gibbons. (Il convient de noter en l\u2019occurrence qu\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit, indiquant que Mme Stanger ait exerc\u00e9 le moindre recours \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de son syndicat par rapport au pr\u00e9tendu refus des d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9es syndicales de lui parler).\n[143] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a appel\u00e9 MM. Gibbons et Harrison \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner au sujet de cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement all\u00e9gu\u00e9. M. Gibbons a \u00e9t\u00e9 mari\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Stanger pendant environ 11 ans, et ils ont cess\u00e9 de vivre ensemble en 2004. Il \u00e9tait aussi son coll\u00e8gue \u00e0 l\u2019ETCVic, et Patrick Stanger \u00e9tait \u00e9galement son chef. M. Gibbons a d\u00e9crit durant son t\u00e9moignage le choc qu\u2019il avait ressenti en apprenant que son ex\u2011\u00e9pouse fr\u00e9quentait le chef, dont lui-m\u00eame relevait. Peu apr\u00e8s avoir appris la nouvelle, il a cherch\u00e9 conseil aupr\u00e8s de son m\u00e9decin, puis a pris un cong\u00e9 professionnel de six semaines pour cause de stress. Il pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9galement consult\u00e9 un avocat en droit du travail, parce qu\u2019il craignait de retourner dans un milieu qui pouvait s\u2019av\u00e9rer hostile. M. Gibbons craignait que ses faits et gestes puissent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s comme du harc\u00e8lement et l\u2019exposer \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes. Son avocat lui a conseill\u00e9 de limiter ses interactions au travail avec son ex\u2011femme et le chef, et ses heures de travail ont \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9es pendant une p\u00e9riode de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00e9viter tout chevauchement avec leurs quarts.\n[144] M. Gibbons a livr\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage assez direct et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019incident du chariot\u2011\u00e9l\u00e9vateur n\u2019est jamais survenu. D\u2019apr\u00e8s sa d\u00e9position, il ne se souvient de rien de tel, ajoutant qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait jamais conduit son chariot\u2011\u00e9l\u00e9vateur \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de quelqu\u2019un sans s\u2019en apercevoir, et qu\u2019aucun superviseur ni personne d\u2019autre ne lui a jamais parl\u00e9 de l\u2019incident all\u00e9gu\u00e9. M\u00eame s\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre\u2011interrog\u00e9, aucune question du contre\u2011interrogatoire n\u2019a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 ce pr\u00e9tendu incident, ce que je trouve r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur. Par ailleurs, M. Gibbons a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 durant son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il craignait pour son avenir \u00e0 Postes Canada en raison de la relation de son ex\u2011femme avec le chef. Par cons\u00e9quent, il para\u00eet tr\u00e8s improbable qu\u2019il l\u2019ait menac\u00e9e ou intimid\u00e9e dangereusement avec un chariot\u2011\u00e9l\u00e9vateur.\n[145] M. Harrison n\u2019avait aucun souvenir de la plainte de Mme Stanger concernant l\u2019incident du chariot\u2011\u00e9l\u00e9vateur. Il a convenu que s\u2019il \u00e9tait survenu, il se serait agi d\u2019un \u00e9v\u00e9nement grave en milieu de travail. M. Harrison estimait \u00e9galement qu\u2019il \u00e9tait improbable qu\u2019il se soit trouv\u00e9 dans le bureau du chef en m\u00eame temps que M. Stanger, parce qu\u2019il travaillait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque durant le quart de nuit.\n[146] Durant le contre\u2011interrogatoire, M. Harrison a reconnu qu\u2019il aurait pu se trouver dans le bureau du chef s\u2019il \u00e9tait au travail durant les heures de jour pour une raison exceptionnelle, comme pour suivre une formation. Cependant, l\u2019all\u00e9gation relative au chariot\u2011\u00e9l\u00e9vateur n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e durant son contre\u2011interrogatoire, ce que je trouve r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur.\n[147] La preuve soumise au Tribunal concernant la question de savoir si cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement est survenu ou pas \u00e9tait nettement contradictoire. Je ne pense pas que la plaignante ait \u00e9tabli, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que M. Gibbons l\u2019a poursuivie avec un chariot\u2011\u00e9l\u00e9vateur, ou qu\u2019il l\u2019a suivie de trop pr\u00e8s. En plus des deux t\u00e9moins ayant ni\u00e9 avoir eu connaissance de cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement all\u00e9gu\u00e9, la version de Mme Stanger ne concorde pas avec la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s qu\u2019une personne inform\u00e9e et pragmatique reconna\u00eetrait d\u2019embl\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant raisonnable en ce lieu et en ces conditions (Croteau pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 53). Le fait qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 conduise imprudemment et agressivement un chariot\u2011\u00e9l\u00e9vateur en direction d\u2019un coll\u00e8gue constituerait un grave danger dans le milieu de travail. Il me para\u00eet difficile \u00e0 croire qu\u2019il ne reste nulle trace documentaire ponctuelle de cet incident.\n[148] L\u2019all\u00e9gation pose certainement la question de savoir pourquoi le chef lui\u2011m\u00eame, M. Stanger, n\u2019a pas pris de mesures, ou n\u2019a \u00e0 tout le moins pas signal\u00e9 l\u2019incident \u00e0 la directrice de l\u2019installation. En fait, M. Stanger a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Aiken un courriel concernant un incident beaucoup moins grave, qui sera d\u00e9crit en d\u00e9tail plus loin. Pourquoi ne signalerait\u2011il pas un \u00e9v\u00e9nement comme celui\u2011l\u00e0 concernant suppos\u00e9ment la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019un acte violent avec un v\u00e9hicule de travail? Il semble que M. Stanger lui\u2011m\u00eame aurait pu t\u00e9moigner sur ce point. Cependant, il n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. De m\u00eame, M. Iverson, ainsi que Mmes Robinet et Kristofferson n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner quant \u00e0 leur refus all\u00e9gu\u00e9 d\u2019aider la plaignante relativement \u00e0 cette affaire. Mme Stanger n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s que cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement s\u2019est produit comme elle l\u2019a d\u00e9crit. Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019analyser la question du lien avec son \u00e9tat matrimonial.\nD. Pam Cromwell \u2013 Conversation et l\u2019incident des fruits pourris\n[149] Mme Stanger a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 durant son t\u00e9moignage des \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus \u00e0 la fin de 2006 et concernant une coll\u00e8gue, une certaine Pam Cromwell. Durant un quart suppl\u00e9mentaire, Mme Stanger avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9tiqueter une bo\u00eete de tri. D\u2019apr\u00e8s elle, Mme Cromwell s\u2019est approch\u00e9e d\u2019elle en col\u00e8re, lui a demand\u00e9 ce qu\u2019elle faisait, et affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait stupide de travailler sur une bo\u00eete que personne n\u2019utilisait. D\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Stanger, Mme Cromwell a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019elle obtenait des avantages parce qu\u2019elle fr\u00e9quentait le chef, s\u2019exprimant \u00e0 voix haute, de mani\u00e8re agressive et \u00e0 port\u00e9e de voix des autres dans l\u2019atelier.\n[150] Mme Cromwell a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle se souvenait de l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement, mais sa version des faits diff\u00e9rait de celle de la plaignante. Mme Cromwell a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas proche de Mme Stanger, et qu\u2019elle lui parlait rarement. Elle se souvient qu\u2019elle et d\u2019autres coll\u00e8gues avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris de voir Mme Stanger \u00e9tiqueter une bo\u00eete de tri qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas utilis\u00e9e. Il lui paraissait \u00e9trange d\u2019ailleurs que Mme Stanger soit pay\u00e9e en heures suppl\u00e9mentaires, comme ils l\u2019\u00e9taient eux-m\u00eames ce soir\u2011l\u00e0, pour un tel travail. Mme Cromwell affirme qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait ni en col\u00e8re ni contrari\u00e9e, simplement curieuse de savoir pourquoi Mme Stanger \u00e9tiquetait cette bo\u00eete. Alors qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient en chemin pour prendre leur pause, Mme Cromwell a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir simplement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Stanger s\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu d\u2019utiliser cette bo\u00eete de tri \u00e0 l\u2019avenir. Mme Cromwell a ni\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 en col\u00e8re ou sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que Mme Stanger obtenait des avantages en raison de sa relation avec le chef. Elle a reconnu l\u2019avoir peut\u2011\u00eatre pens\u00e9, tout en ajoutant qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 vraiment peu judicieux de sa part de dire quelque chose de ce genre \u00e0 voix haute. Mme Cromwell a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab certaine \u00e0 99,9 % \u00bb des mots qu\u2019elle avait dits \u00e0 Mme Stanger ce jour\u2011l\u00e0 et qu\u2019elle avait simplement demand\u00e9 si la bo\u00eete de tri allait \u00eatre de nouveau utilis\u00e9e ou pas.\n[151] Selon Mme Cromwell, apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle eut questionn\u00e9 la plaignante au sujet de la bo\u00eete, le chef Stanger s\u2019est approch\u00e9 d\u2019elle dans l\u2019atelier imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s la pause. Elle \u00e9tait encore en train de manger une pomme qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas finie durant sa pause. M. Stanger l\u2019aurait verbalement r\u00e9primand\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle mangeait dans l\u2019atelier. Mme Cromwell a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas si inhabituel que des employ\u00e9s finissent parfois de manger ou de boire leur caf\u00e9 dans l\u2019atelier, et qu\u2019elle l\u2019avait fait plusieurs fois auparavant sans jamais \u00eatre r\u00e9primand\u00e9e. Mme Cromwell a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019est sentie attaqu\u00e9e par le chef Stanger, et qu\u2019elle n\u2019arrivait pas \u00e0 comprendre pourquoi il \u00e9tait si contrari\u00e9. Elle s\u2019est ensuite figur\u00e9 que cela pouvait s\u2019expliquer par le fait qu\u2019elle avait pos\u00e9 une question \u00e0 sa petite amie.\n[152] Mme Stanger a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 durant son t\u00e9moignage que lorsqu\u2019elle s\u2019est rendue \u00e0 son casier non verrouill\u00e9 quelques jours plus tard, un sac en plastique de [traduction] \u00ab fruits pourris \u00bb \u00e9tait suspendu \u00e0 l\u2019un des crochets. D\u2019apr\u00e8s sa description, il y avait [traduction] \u00ab des fruits pourris et quelques pommes par\u2011dessus \u00bb, mais les pommes n\u2019avaient pas l\u2019air pourries. Pour Mme Stanger, ce sac contenant des fruits pourris \u00e9tait une [traduction] \u00ab menace \u00bb, parce qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans son casier. Cependant, elle n\u2019a montr\u00e9 ce sac \u00e0 personne et l\u2019incident ne peut \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 par aucun autre t\u00e9moin.\n[153] Mme Stanger a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019est plainte \u00e0 son superviseur, Mike Yaromy, lequel lui aurait dit d\u2019aller voir le chef de service, Patrick Stanger.\n[154] Cependant, M. Yaromy a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 durant son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il \u00e9tait absent de l\u2019ETCVic au moment de cet incident, et qu\u2019il n\u2019en a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 son retour. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Mme Stanger ne m\u2019a pas approch\u00e9 au sujet de cet incident \u00bb.\n[155] Mme Stanger a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9 au chef Stanger d\u2019envoyer un courriel \u00e0 Mme Aiken au sujet de l\u2019incident des fruits pourris, courriel qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit en pi\u00e8ce. Dat\u00e9 du 11 d\u00e9cembre 2006, le courriel en question demande d\u2019abord de pr\u00e9ciser si M. Stanger devait ou non placer une lettre de r\u00e9primande dans le dossier de Mme Cromwell (parce qu\u2019elle avait mang\u00e9 une pomme dans l\u2019atelier) et indique ensuite :\n[traduction] Cependant, un \u00e9v\u00e9nement possiblement li\u00e9 \u00e0 cette affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 mon attention. Dimanche soir, lorsqu\u2019elle est entr\u00e9e au travail pour effectuer des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires, Jessica a trouv\u00e9 deux pommes et des fruits pourris dans son casier non verrouill\u00e9. Cela semble li\u00e9 \u00e0 la lettre de discipline que j\u2019ai remise \u00e0 Pam Cromwell parce qu\u2019elle avait mang\u00e9 une pomme dans l\u2019atelier. Jessica m\u2019a confi\u00e9 qu\u2019elle se sent cibl\u00e9e chaque fois que quelqu\u2019un dans l\u2019atelier n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord avec une de mes mesures.\n[156] Cependant, Mme Stanger a ni\u00e9 avoir dit au chef Stanger qu\u2019elle soup\u00e7onnait que l\u2019incident des fruits pourris \u00e9tait possiblement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la mesure disciplinaire qu\u2019il avait prise \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de Mme Cromwell. Elle nie aussi cat\u00e9goriquement avoir \u00e9voqu\u00e9 avec lui sa conversation avec Mme Cromwell concernant l\u2019\u00e9tiquetage de la bo\u00eete, m\u00eame si cela faisait presque deux ans qu\u2019elle vivait avec lui. \u00c0 la question de savoir comment le chef Stanger aurait pu, en l\u2019absence de renseignements communiqu\u00e9s par la plaignante, \u00e9tablir le lien avec Mme Cromwell au regard des fruits pourris, Mme Stanger a simplement r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il avait d\u00fb arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion par lui\u2011m\u00eame.\n[157] Mme Cromwell a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Aiken lui a parl\u00e9 du sac de fruits pourris : elle lui a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle ne savait rien \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[158] Mme Stanger n\u2019a pas produit suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour convaincre le Tribunal que l\u2019incident des fruits pourris est survenu ou, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, qu\u2019il constituait une forme de harc\u00e8lement au titre de la LCDP. Si la pr\u00e9sence de fruits pourris repr\u00e9sentait pour elle une sorte de menace, pourquoi Mme Stanger ne les a\u2011t\u2011elle montr\u00e9s \u00e0 personne? Par ailleurs, l\u2019apparence des fruits n\u2019est concluante \u00e0 aucun \u00e9gard. Comme l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 Mme Stanger, le sac en plastique ne contenait pas que des [traduction] \u00ab fruits pourris \u00bb, mais aussi au moins deux pommes fra\u00eeches par\u2011dessus. Aucune note n\u2019\u00e9tait jointe au sac. Aucune preuve ne permet au Tribunal de conclure que le sac visait Mme Stanger, ou qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment plac\u00e9 dans son casier. Il peut avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 mis l\u00e0 par accident ou pour une raison totalement innocente.\n[159] Par ailleurs, s\u2019agissant de la question de Mme Cromwell au sujet de la bo\u00eete de tri, les deux t\u00e9moins ont livr\u00e9 des versions radicalement diff\u00e9rentes de leur \u00e9change. Mme Stanger a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Cromwell a formul\u00e9 ses remarques \u00e0 voix haute et \u00e0 port\u00e9e de voix des autres employ\u00e9s pr\u00e9sents dans l\u2019atelier. Cependant, elle n\u2019a appel\u00e9 aucun t\u00e9moin pour corroborer sa version. D\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, Mme Cromwell a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 tr\u00e8s clairement et assur\u00e9 le Tribunal que les souvenirs qu\u2019elle conservait de cet \u00e9pisode \u00e9taient exacts \u00e0 99,9 %. Pour cette raison, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Cromwell et conclus qu\u2019elle n\u2019a fait aucune remarque laissant entendre que Mme Stanger obtenait des avantages en raison de son \u00e9tat matrimonial.\nE. Repr\u00e9sentante syndicale Zaria Andrews et surveillant Russell Odnokon\n[160] Mme Stanger a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9e et intimid\u00e9e par une coll\u00e8gue en raison de sa relation avec le chef. \u00c0 la fin de 2004, peu apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle eut commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 le fr\u00e9quenter, Mme Stanger a \u00e9t\u00e9 approch\u00e9e par Mme Zaria Andrews qui \u00e9tait une coll\u00e8gue et sa repr\u00e9sentante syndicale. Mme Andrews lui a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 quelques reprises de la rencontrer au bureau du syndicat, ce qui lui a sembl\u00e9 inhabituel, de telles rencontres \u00e9tant g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement organis\u00e9es apr\u00e8s un incident ou pour discuter d\u2019une affaire officielle. Estimant qu\u2019elle avait besoin d\u2019\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour traiter avec son propre syndicat, Mme Stanger a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 son superviseur d\u2019alors, Russell Odnokon, de l\u2019accompagner au bureau du syndicat. Elle a reconnu que le syndicat envoie normalement un repr\u00e9sentant pour accompagner l\u2019employ\u00e9 membre si ce dernier est convoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 une r\u00e9union avec l\u2019employeur. Les choses se d\u00e9roulaient \u00e0 l\u2019envers, et Mme Stanger a elle\u2011m\u00eame qualifi\u00e9 la situation de [traduction] \u00ab tr\u00e8s unique \u00bb.\n[161] D\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Stanger, Mme Andrews lui aurait dit \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de cette rencontre que le chef ne faisait que se servir d\u2019elle pour obtenir des renseignements sur le syndicat. Mme Andrews et les autres repr\u00e9sentants syndicaux souhaitaient qu\u2019elle rompe sa relation. Mme Stanger a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas l\u2019impression de se faire utiliser. Elle a indiqu\u00e9 que Mme Andrews \u00e9tait en col\u00e8re, qu\u2019elle lui parlait en se tenant tout pr\u00e8s d\u2019elle, ce qui l\u2019a intimid\u00e9e. Mme Stanger a conclu de cette r\u00e9union que le syndicat ne lui offrirait aucune repr\u00e9sentation ni protection \u00e0 partir de ce moment\u2011l\u00e0. Apr\u00e8s environ cinq minutes, alors que la rencontre prenait fin, M. Odnokon a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Stanger : [traduction] \u00ab Je peux partir maintenant? \u00bb et a quitt\u00e9 la pi\u00e8ce.\n[162] Aucun t\u00e9moin n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 pour corroborer ou r\u00e9futer cette version, puisque ni Mme Andrews ni M. Odnokon n\u2019ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal. Aucune preuve documentaire n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise pour \u00e9tayer les all\u00e9gations de Mme Stanger. Compte tenu des r\u00e9serves que j\u2019ai exprim\u00e9es concernant sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, j\u2019estime que cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement n\u2019est pas survenu.\n[163] M\u00eame si j\u2019\u00e9tais convaincu, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que les choses s\u2019\u00e9taient pass\u00e9es exactement comme Mme Stanger les a d\u00e9crites, j\u2019estime que cela ne constitue pas du harc\u00e8lement aux termes de la LCDP. L\u2019article 14 de cette loi n\u2019emp\u00eache pas les repr\u00e9sentants syndicaux de poursuivre des activit\u00e9s l\u00e9gitimes et des objectifs op\u00e9rationnels, pour autant qu\u2019ils agissent de bonne foi. M\u00eame s\u2019il est possible que Mme Andrews n\u2019ait pas employ\u00e9 le meilleur langage qui soit, les agents n\u00e9gociateurs ont un int\u00e9r\u00eat l\u00e9gitime \u00e0 veiller \u00e0 ce qu\u2019aucun renseignement interne ne soit communiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la direction.\n[164] Selon la seconde partie de l\u2019argument avanc\u00e9 par Mme Stanger relativement \u00e0 cet incident, M. Odnokon avait une obligation positive de prendre des mesures \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 directement t\u00e9moin de cette conversation. \u00c0 plusieurs moments de son t\u00e9moignage de m\u00eame que dans son plaidoyer final, Mme Stanger a fait valoir que Postes Canada avait une obligation positive d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur ses nombreuses plaintes de harc\u00e8lement et de discrimination, ce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas fait. J\u2019examinerai cet argument dans une section distincte de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nF. Incidents concernant Tom McMenemy, commis postal\n[165] Mme Stanger all\u00e8gue qu\u2019un coll\u00e8gue, Tom McMenemy l\u2019a harcel\u00e9e en parlant de sa relation avec le chef Stanger de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9sobligeante. \u00c0 la fin 2005, Mme Stanger est partie en vacances \u00e0 Calgary avec le chef Stanger. Le premier jour de son retour au travail, alors qu\u2019allait d\u00e9buter, avant le quart, une r\u00e9union durant laquelle tous les coll\u00e8gues \u00e9taient rassembl\u00e9s dans l\u2019atelier, M. McMenemy a questionn\u00e9 Mme Stanger au sujet de son voyage. Il voulait savoir o\u00f9 ils \u00e9taient all\u00e9s, ce qu\u2019ils avaient vu, et s\u2019ils avaient visit\u00e9 l\u2019installation de Postes Canada \u00e0 Calgary, qui semblait l\u2019int\u00e9resser. Lorsque M. McMenemy a pos\u00e9 des questions sp\u00e9cifiques sur les activit\u00e9s du chef Stanger \u00e0 Calgary, Mme Stanger lui a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de l\u2019interroger directement. D\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Stanger, M. McMenemy n\u2019\u00e9tait pas du genre \u00e0 en d\u00e9mordre; l\u2019invitation \u00e0 s\u2019adresser directement au chef Stanger n\u2019a pas eu raison de sa curiosit\u00e9, et il a fait un commentaire du genre : [traduction] \u00ab Tu vas me dire que tu couches avec lui et que tu ne sais pas? \u00bb.\n[166] Mme Stanger a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il a fait ce commentaire \u00e0 voix haute et \u00e0 port\u00e9e de voix de nombreuses autres personnes rassembl\u00e9es en vue de la r\u00e9union, y compris la d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9e syndicale Robinet et son superviseur \u00e0 elle. Toujours selon Mme Stanger, ils n\u2019ont pas du tout r\u00e9agi au commentaire de M. McMenemy.\n[167] Lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire, Mme Stanger a reconnu qu\u2019elle savait vaguement que M. McMenemy avait une fille \u00e0 Calgary, et qu\u2019il envisageait un transfert \u00e0 l\u2019installation de Postes Canada dans cette ville. M. McMenemy n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin, et aucun autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette all\u00e9gation.\n[168] Une incoh\u00e9rence relative \u00e0 cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement doit \u00eatre relev\u00e9e dans les conclusions finales \u00e9crites de la plaignante. Cette derni\u00e8re y d\u00e9clare : [traduction] \u00ab La plaignante s\u2019est adress\u00e9e plus tard dans la journ\u00e9e au chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe Yaromy et lui a dit que les commentaires de M. McMenemy lui avaient paru blessants et inappropri\u00e9s. M. Yaromy n\u2019a rien fait \u00bb. Ces affirmations n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 reprises lors du t\u00e9moignage oral de Mme Stanger lorsqu\u2019elle se trouvait \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins, et aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve documentaire n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit \u00e0 l\u2019appui. M\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de cet incident all\u00e9gu\u00e9, je note que M. Yaromy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ailleurs durant sa d\u00e9position qu\u2019il n\u2019a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 Postes Canada qu\u2019en mai 2006.\n[169] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulign\u00e9, Mme Stanger a jet\u00e9 le doute sur sa propre cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin. Comme aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve corroborant n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit, qu\u2019aucun t\u00e9moin n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 ou qu\u2019aucun document \u00e0 l\u2019appui n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, je conclus selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement ne s\u2019est pas produit comme elle l\u2019a pr\u00e9tendu.\n[170] M\u00eame si le commentaire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 de McMenemy \u00e9tait d\u00e9plac\u00e9 et impoli, j\u2019estime que ce seul \u00e9v\u00e9nement n\u2019est pas suffisamment significatif pour justifier \u00e0 lui seul une conclusion de harc\u00e8lement. Quand bien m\u00eame j\u2019aurais \u00e9t\u00e9 convaincu que l\u2019incident s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9roul\u00e9 exactement comme Mme Stanger l\u2019a d\u00e9crit, j\u2019estime que le pr\u00e9judice qui en a d\u00e9coul\u00e9 \u00e9tait fugace. D\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Stanger, les autres employ\u00e9s qui se trouvaient \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 n\u2019ont pas r\u00e9agi et \u00e0 ce titre, je conclus que l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement lui\u2011m\u00eame n\u2019a pas cr\u00e9\u00e9 d\u2019environnement de travail hostile ou malsain. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, Mme Stanger et le chef vivaient ensemble depuis environ un an et le fait qu\u2019ils voyageaient ensemble \u00e9tait connu au travail. Si le commentaire de M. McMenemy avait \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu par d\u2019autres personnes, elles n\u2019auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 surprises qu\u2019il pr\u00e9sume que la relation conjugale se poursuivait. M\u00eame si j\u2019estime qu\u2019un tel commentaire \u00e9tait de mauvais go\u00fbt, je ne pense pas qu\u2019il constitue du harc\u00e8lement aux termes de l\u2019article 14.\n[171] Dans ses conclusions finales \u00e9crites, la plaignante mentionne aussi un autre incident concernant M. McMenemy. Cependant, aucune preuve s\u2019y rapportant n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience; cet incident ne sera donc pas examin\u00e9.\nG. Incident concernant le commis postal Howard Siegrist\n[172] Mme Stanger all\u00e8gue que M. Howard Siegrist, un coll\u00e8gue, l\u2019a harcel\u00e9e en raison de son \u00e9tat matrimonial par des remarques d\u00e9nigrantes au sujet du chef Stanger, qui \u00e9tait alors son petit ami. M. Siegrist \u00e9tait un coll\u00e8gue de la plaignante pendant pr\u00e8s de trois ans. Mme Stanger all\u00e8gue qu\u2019au d\u00e9but de 2007, elle travaillait \u00e0 ses c\u00f4t\u00e9s sur la rotation O\u2019Cull, durant laquelle un travailleur d\u00e9chargeait le courrier des sacs tandis que l\u2019autre le triait. Le jour en question, M. Siegrist revenait tout juste d\u2019une r\u00e9union disciplinaire avec le chef Stanger, dont il avait re\u00e7u un [traduction] \u00ab pr\u00e9avis de 24 heures \u00bb. D\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Stanger, il \u00e9tait en col\u00e8re et jetait les sacs postaux \u00e0 4\u20115 pieds d\u2019elle. Les d\u00e9tails qu\u2019elle a fournis de sa conversation avec M. Siegrist ce jour\u2011l\u00e0 \u00e9taient vagues, mais elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 le chef Stanger comme [traduction] \u00ab ton putain de petit ami \u00bb et aussi [traduction] \u00ab un connard \u00bb. Elle pr\u00e9tend que son comportement l\u2019a effray\u00e9e, bless\u00e9e et embarrass\u00e9e.\n[173] M. Siegrist a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin par l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Je l\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 direct et il n\u2019a pas h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre les commentaires peu flatteurs qu\u2019il pourrait avoir faits. \u00c0 mon avis, cela faisait de lui un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible. M. Siegrist ne se souvenait pas sp\u00e9cifiquement de sa conversation avec Mme Stanger ce jour\u2011l\u00e0. Il pr\u00e9tend avoir particip\u00e9 \u00e0 plus de 10 r\u00e9unions avec pr\u00e9avis de 24 heures, et que pour lui, c\u2019\u00e9tait une plaisanterie. Ces r\u00e9unions ne le pr\u00e9occupaient pas du tout puisqu\u2019elles \u00e9taient de toute fa\u00e7on effac\u00e9es de son dossier tous les ans. Par ailleurs, cela ne le d\u00e9rangeait pas de quitter l\u2019atelier pendant une ou deux heures pour assister \u00e0 ces r\u00e9unions. M. Siegrist a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne se souvenait pas d\u2019avoir d\u00e9sign\u00e9 le chef Stanger comme [traduction] \u00ab ton putain de petit ami \u00bb et doutait d\u2019avoir tenu ces propos. Il n\u2019a pas exclu la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019il puisse avoir utilis\u00e9 ces mots \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, mais il pr\u00e9tendait ne pas s\u2019en souvenir. Cependant, il \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t certain de n\u2019avoir jamais trait\u00e9 M. Stanger de [traduction] \u00ab connard \u00bb, puisque ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u00e0 une expression qu\u2019il utilisait.\n[174] M. Siegrist a \u00e9galement contest\u00e9 l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle il avait jet\u00e9 les sacs de courrier avec col\u00e8re, pour effrayer Mme Stanger. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que ces sacs \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 tr\u00e8s lourds, et qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas pu avoir la force suppl\u00e9mentaire de les jeter d\u2019une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente. J\u2019accepte son t\u00e9moignage sur ce point. Par ailleurs, M. Siegrist a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 que Mme Stanger ne lui a jamais dit qu\u2019elle avait peur de lui ou qu\u2019il l\u2019intimidait.\n[175] M. Siegrist a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre\u2011interrog\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Il s\u2019est fait poser plusieurs questions sans lien avec le sujet, concernant les employ\u00e9s qui pr\u00e9sentent une DPP et d\u2019autres questions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales, mais sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 attaqu\u00e9e. Par ailleurs, aucune question pos\u00e9e lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire ne portait sur la conversation all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de d\u00e9but 2007.\n[176] La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette all\u00e9gation n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tr\u00e8s \u00e9toff\u00e9e. Cependant, M. Siegrist n\u2019ayant pas exclu la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019il ait pu faire l\u2019un des commentaires qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9s, je suis dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Stanger \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Cependant, m\u00eame si M. Siegrist avait effectivement d\u00e9sign\u00e9 le chef Stanger comme [traduction] \u00ab ton putain de petit ami \u00bb lors de sa conversation avec la plaignante, je ne pense pas que cet \u00e9pisode unique soit en lui-m\u00eame assez grave pour justifier une conclusion de harc\u00e8lement sur le lieu de travail en vertu de la LCDP. Un \u00e9v\u00e9nement unique doit \u00eatre assez grave ou s\u00e9v\u00e8re pour cr\u00e9er un environnement de travail hostile (voir Franke, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9.) L\u2019acte n\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence pas suffisamment grave pour que Mme Stanger le rapporte \u00e0 un \u00e9chelon de la direction.\nH. Incident concernant Darlene Schultz, commis postal, au sujet d\u2019une veste\n[177] Mme Stanger a avanc\u00e9 deux all\u00e9gations concernant Mme Darlene Schultz, mais relativement \u00e0 deux incidents distincts et deux motifs de discrimination diff\u00e9rents. L\u2019incident se rapportant au harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial est mentionn\u00e9 dans l\u2019\u00c9P de la plaignante et dans ses conclusions finales \u00e9crites, mais aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cet incident. L\u2019autre incident se rapporte au harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience, et sera abord\u00e9 dans la section suivante des pr\u00e9sents motifs.\n[178] Mme Schultz \u00e9tait une coll\u00e8gue de la plaignante pendant pr\u00e8s de trois ans. Dans son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions, Mme Stanger all\u00e8gue que Mme Schultz aurait fait un commentaire sur une nouvelle veste de Postes Canada qu\u2019elle portait. D\u2019apr\u00e8s elle, Mme Schultz voulait savoir si la veste \u00e9tait neuve et qui la lui avait donn\u00e9e. Mme Stanger lui a dit que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un nouveau manteau, ce \u00e0 quoi Mme Schultz lui aurait r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Oh, c\u2019est qui tu sais \u00bb, ce qui insinuait, d\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Stanger, qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7u cette veste comme un avantage li\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9tat matrimonial. L\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions de Mme Stanger pr\u00e9cise que de nombreux autres employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 et qu\u2019ils ont entendu ce commentaire.\n[179] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, aucun t\u00e9moin n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 pour \u00e9voquer l\u2019all\u00e9gation, et Mme Stanger elle\u2011m\u00eame n\u2019en a pas parl\u00e9. Aucune preuve documentaire n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite \u00e0 l\u2019appui. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne tirerai aucune conclusion \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette all\u00e9gation.\nX. All\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement li\u00e9es \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience aux termes de l\u2019article 14\nA. Incident concernant Mme Ruth Allen\n[180] L\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante \u00e9voque un incident concernant Mme Ruth Allen. Cependant, aucune preuve s\u2019y rapportant n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience, je ne l\u2019examinerai donc pas.\nB. Incident concernant Mme Corinne Jacobson\n[181] L\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante \u00e9voque un incident concernant Mme Corinne Jacobson. Cependant, aucune preuve s\u2019y rapportant n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience, je ne l\u2019examinerai donc pas.\nC. Incident concernant Mme Darlene Schultz\n[182] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, Mme Stanger a d\u00e9crit en d\u00e9tail durant son t\u00e9moignage oral une conversation qu\u2019elle a eue avec Mme Darlene Schultz lors de son dernier jour de travail \u00e0 l\u2019ETCVic, le 22 juin 2008. Mme Stanger avait soumis une demande de transfert \u00e0 un nouveau poste ailleurs \u00e0 Postes Canada. Alors qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait affect\u00e9e \u00e0 la rotation O\u2019Cull avec Mme Schultz, Mme Stanger a remarqu\u00e9 que cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait agit\u00e9e et f\u00e2ch\u00e9e contre elle. Mme Schultz s\u2019est plainte \u00e0 Mme Stanger que le chef Stanger ne g\u00e9rait pas bien le quart Communications 3A. Pour changer de sujet, Mme Stanger a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait appris que Mme Schultz s\u2019\u00e9tait plainte au syndicat au sujet de sa demande de transfert. Mme Stanger a fait remarquer que les gens comme Mme Schultz la harcelaient depuis des ann\u00e9es \u00e0 cause de sa DPP et qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient toujours pas contents maintenant qu\u2019elle essayait de s\u2019en aller.\n[183] D\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Stanger, Mme Schultz aurait dit qu\u2019elle trouvait \u00e9patant que des employ\u00e9s atteints de DPP soient tout \u00e0 coup miraculeusement gu\u00e9ris de leur d\u00e9ficience lorsqu\u2019ils pr\u00e9sentaient une demande de transfert, et que les gens comme elle [traduction] \u00ab arnaquaient la SCP \u00bb.\n[184] Apr\u00e8s ce commentaire, Mme Stanger a mis fin \u00e0 la conversation en mettant ses \u00e9couteurs. Elle a termin\u00e9 son quart et pris un cong\u00e9 maladie imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s. Elle n\u2019est jamais retourn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ETCVic.\n[185] Mme Schultz n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e comme t\u00e9moin, et cet incident n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 durant le contre\u2011interrogatoire de Mme Stanger. Aucun t\u00e9moin n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 pour corroborer ou r\u00e9futer cette preuve. En l\u2019absence d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment additionnel et compte tenu des probl\u00e8mes de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 soulev\u00e9s plus t\u00f4t, je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure que cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement s\u2019est produit tel qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit.\nXI. Effet cumulatif des incidents de harc\u00e8lement\n[186] Lorsqu\u2019elle prend la forme de remarques sarcastiques, d\u2019allusions d\u00e9sobligeantes au partenaire conjugal de l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 et de commentaires de ce type, la conduite contest\u00e9e doit \u00eatre persistante et fr\u00e9quente pour constituer du harc\u00e8lement au sens de la LCDP (voir Morin c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 TCDP 41, au paragraphe 258). Cependant, dans l\u2019analyse qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, j\u2019ai conclu que seules trois des dix all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement \u00e9taient r\u00e9ellement survenues : la plainte concernant Labine; la plainte concernant Savoy; et la plainte concernant Siegrist. L\u2019all\u00e9gation visant Labine n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que je suis convaincu que M. Labine s\u2019est conduit convenablement dans le cadre de son r\u00f4le. Pour les motifs soulign\u00e9s plus haut, je ne pense pas que le commentaire de Mme Savoy ni que la divulgation de sa lettre constitue du harc\u00e8lement au sens de la LCDP. Le commentaire qu\u2019aurait pu faire M. Siegrist concernant le petit ami de la plaignante \u00e9tait malvenu et pouvait \u00eatre per\u00e7u comme d\u00e9gradant. Cependant, comme il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un \u00e9v\u00e9nement unique et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence pas suffisamment grave pour que Mme Stanger le signale, je ne pense pas que l\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement est en soi fond\u00e9e.\n[187] Si plusieurs incidents surviennent, dont aucun n\u2019est en soi suffisant pour \u00e9tablir le harc\u00e8lement, mais dont le cumul peut cr\u00e9er un environnement de travail malsain, il est possible de parvenir \u00e0 une conclusion de harc\u00e8lement aux termes de l\u2019article 14. Cependant, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce que seuls deux incidents pertinents concernant Mme Savoy et M. Siegrist sont survenus. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019argument de l\u2019effet cumulatif est significativement affaibli. Les deux remarques se rapportaient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial de Mme Stanger. Ils \u00e9taient tous deux malvenus et pouvaient passer pour \u00eatre quelque peu d\u00e9gradants \u00e0 son endroit. Cependant, je ne pense pas que ces deux commentaires, formul\u00e9s par deux coll\u00e8gues diff\u00e9rents, peut\u2011\u00eatre \u00e0 18\u201124 mois d\u2019intervalle, ont un effet cumulatif suffisant pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un environnement de travail toxique ou malsain. Une s\u00e9rie de petits \u00e9v\u00e9nements insultants, avilissants ou d\u00e9gradants peuvent avec le temps cr\u00e9er un environnement de travail hostile et malsain. Cependant, aucun de ces commentaires n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 suffisamment grave en soi pour constituer du harc\u00e8lement. De m\u00eame, je ne pense pas, compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve soumis au Tribunal, que ces deux commentaires combin\u00e9s aient cr\u00e9\u00e9 un environnement de travail hostile ou malsain pour la plaignante.\nXII. Notification de la discrimination\/du harc\u00e8lement \u00e0 l\u2019employeur\n[188] M\u00eame si j\u2019avais estim\u00e9 que les incidents pertinents \u00e9taient suffisamment graves, persistants ou r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s pour que l\u2019environnement de travail de Mme Stanger en devienne malsain, une autre exigence l\u00e9gale doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e avant de pouvoir conclure au harc\u00e8lement. Par souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers les intim\u00e9s qui \u00e9tablissent des politiques en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement pr\u00e9voyant des m\u00e9canismes de plaintes, les employ\u00e9s sont tenus d\u2019informer d\u00fbment l\u2019employeur du harc\u00e8lement all\u00e9gu\u00e9. Cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e en d\u00e9tail par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Franke, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, dans laquelle la Cour d\u00e9clare ce qui suit \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 2d) :\nDans l\u2019arr\u00eat Janzen, la Cour supr\u00eame n\u2019a pas tenu compte de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment, mais je crois que l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 exige que l\u2019employ\u00e9 avise, si possible, l\u2019employeur de la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conduite offensante.\nAu cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, les cours de justice et les tribunaux administratifs ont insist\u00e9 pour qu\u2019un certain degr\u00e9 de vigilance soit exerc\u00e9 dans le milieu de travail, les employeurs devant assurer un milieu de travail libre de harc\u00e8lement. Par contre, pour que les politiques sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel soient efficaces, l\u2019employ\u00e9 devrait \u00e0 mon avis informer l\u2019employeur des probl\u00e8mes qui se posent, afin de donner \u00e0 celui-ci la possibilit\u00e9 de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la situation.\nCette exigence existe lorsqu\u2019il y a chez l\u2019employeur un service du personnel ainsi qu\u2019une politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et efficace en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement sexuel, y compris des m\u00e9canismes de redressement appropri\u00e9s.\nLa politique relative au harc\u00e8lement sexuel vise \u00e0 assurer un milieu de travail sain; par cons\u00e9quent, plus des mesures seront prises rapidement en vue d\u2019\u00e9liminer les actes de harc\u00e8lement, moins il sera probable que pareils actes nuisent au milieu de travail.\n[189] Le Tribunal est convaincu que Postes Canada dispose d\u2019un service du personnel, qu\u2019elle a mis en place une politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et efficace en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement sexuel et qu\u2019elle a \u00e9labor\u00e9 une politique sur la discrimination. Entre autres mesures, Postes Canada offre depuis 2005 \u00e0 tous les nouveaux employ\u00e9s une formation sur les droits de la personne. Un bulletin d\u2019information instructif sur le harc\u00e8lement et la discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 distribu\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s et pr\u00e9cise le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es de l\u2019agent interne de Postes Canada responsable des droits de la personne. Des s\u00e9minaires p\u00e9riodiques \u00e9taient \u00e9galement propos\u00e9s aux employ\u00e9s. La question est de savoir, compte tenu de cette politique, si Mme Stanger a d\u00fbment inform\u00e9 l\u2019employeur de la conduite pr\u00e9tendument offensante pour lui permettre de mener enqu\u00eate et de corriger la situation.\n[190] La premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode \u00e0 examiner est celle durant laquelle Mme Stanger travaillait \u00e0 l\u2019ETCVic et o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9e. La p\u00e9riode pertinente va du 1er novembre 2004 au 22 juin 2010. Mme Stanger a\u2011t\u2011elle inform\u00e9 son employeur qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait victime de harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail durant cette p\u00e9riode? Pour soupeser cet argument, j\u2019examinerai les cinq \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e0 l\u2019issue desquels Mme Stanger pr\u00e9tend avoir signal\u00e9 \u00e0 son employeur le harc\u00e8lement dont elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime entre novembre 2004 et juin 2008 :\nGrief de Guy Labine : Le 15 f\u00e9vrier 2006, Mme Stanger a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de son syndicat un grief \u00e9crit dans lequel elle all\u00e9guait notamment que M. Labine [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019avait harcel\u00e9e et intimid\u00e9e \u00bb. Le grief a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi d\u2019effet et un r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu entre le syndicat et l\u2019employeur. J\u2019ai conclu que la conduite de M. Labine attestait un exercice de bonne foi de ses fonctions de supervision et ne constituait pas du harc\u00e8lement.\nIncident du chariot\u2011\u00e9l\u00e9vateur : Mme Stanger all\u00e8gue s\u2019\u00eatre plainte au surveillant Brad Harrison et au chef Stanger au sujet de cet incident imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s sa survenue en mars 2005. J\u2019ai conclu que la preuve \u00e9tablissant que cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement s\u2019\u00e9tait produit tel qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit \u00e9tait insuffisante. En particulier, je suis convaincu que si de telles all\u00e9gations avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019attention de la direction, elles auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises au s\u00e9rieux. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9es.\nIncident des fruits pourris : M. Yaromy nie la preuve de Mme Stanger selon laquelle elle lui a signal\u00e9 cet incident. Cependant, nous pouvons d\u00e9duire qu\u2019elle l\u2019a rapport\u00e9 au chef Stanger, puisqu\u2019il l\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Aiken et que cette derni\u00e8re a pris des mesures pour mener une enqu\u00eate. Mme Aiken a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 durant son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019est pas entretenue avec Mme Cromwell, que le chef Stanger soup\u00e7onnait d\u2019\u00eatre la suspecte. L\u2019enqu\u00eate de Mme Aiken n\u2019a pas permis d\u2019\u00e9lucider qui \u00e9tait responsable, ni m\u00eame si l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement s\u2019\u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement produit. Mme Stanger a choisi de ne montrer le pr\u00e9tendu sac de fruits pourris \u00e0 personne. M\u00eame en pr\u00e9sumant qu\u2019un tel sac a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans son casier \u00e0 la fin de 2006, Mme Stanger n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que Mme Cromwell \u00e9tait impliqu\u00e9e dans cet incident et qu\u2019il constituait une forme de repr\u00e9sailles. Par cons\u00e9quent, il demeure possible que le sac de fruits ait \u00e9t\u00e9 innocemment plac\u00e9 par erreur dans le casier de Mme Stanger.\nIncident impliquant Zaria Andrews : Mme Stanger est la seule \u00e0 avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 que le superviseur Odnokon a assist\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union de fin 2004 avec Zaria Andrews, la repr\u00e9sentante syndicale. Mme Stanger soutient qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tenu d\u2019agir relativement \u00e0 l\u2019incident impliquant cette derni\u00e8re. Cependant, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, j\u2019estime que m\u00eame si l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement s\u2019est produit exactement comme Mme Stanger l\u2019a d\u00e9crit, il ne s\u2019agissait pas de harc\u00e8lement aux termes de la LCDP. Le syndicat a un r\u00f4le l\u00e9gitime \u00e0 jouer dans la conduite de ses activit\u00e9s, et il semblerait qu\u2019en convoquant une r\u00e9union priv\u00e9e, il servait ses objectifs de bonne foi. \u00c0 ce titre, je conclus que le surveillant Odnokon n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin de harc\u00e8lement et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait donc rien \u00e0 signaler. De plus, rien n\u2019indique que Mme Stanger ait alors express\u00e9ment indiqu\u00e9 au superviseur Odnokon qu\u2019elle consid\u00e9rait les propos et les actes de Mme Andrews comme du harc\u00e8lement. Il est compr\u00e9hensible que le surveillant Odnokon ne prenne aucune action de sa propre initiative relativement \u00e0 une conversation entre une employ\u00e9e syndiqu\u00e9e et sa d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9e syndicale.\nIncident concernant Tom McMenemy : Mme Stanger a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans ses arguments \u00e9crits avoir signal\u00e9 les remarques inappropri\u00e9es de M. McMenemy \u00e0 la fin 2005 au chef Yaromy. Cependant, elle n\u2019a pas livr\u00e9 cette preuve durant son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l\u2019audience et aucun autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve au dossier n\u2019appuie cette all\u00e9gation. Par ailleurs, M. Yaromy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 durant sa d\u00e9position qu\u2019il n\u2019a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 l\u2019ETCVic que quelques mois apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident all\u00e9gu\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que ce rapport ne lui a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis.\n[191] Lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire, Mme Stanger a reconnu qu\u2019elle n\u2019a signal\u00e9 que les trois premiers incidents pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s durant la p\u00e9riode en question allant de 2004 \u00e0 2008. Elle a aussi admis n\u2019avoir pas signal\u00e9 le harc\u00e8lement lorsqu\u2019elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de quitter l\u2019ETCVic en juin 2008. De plus, M. Yaromy a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 durant son t\u00e9moignage que Mme Stanger ne s\u2019\u00e9tait jamais plainte aupr\u00e8s de lui de ce que ses coll\u00e8gues la harcelaient en raison de son \u00e9tat matrimonial ou de sa DPP. Mme Aiken a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Stanger ne s\u2019\u00e9tait jamais plainte \u00e0 elle de harc\u00e8lement durant cette p\u00e9riode.\n[192] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019argument de la plaignante voulant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ait \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisamment inform\u00e9e du harc\u00e8lement constant dont elle \u00e9tait victime n\u2019est nullement convaincant. Au mieux, la preuve indique que Postes Canada a re\u00e7u un grief concernant la conduite de M. Labine au d\u00e9but 2006, et qu\u2019une all\u00e9gation concernant la pr\u00e9sence de fruits pourris dans son casier \u00e0 la fin 2006 a \u00e9t\u00e9 plus ou moins notifi\u00e9e et a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate qui n\u2019a pas abouti. Par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Stanger ne remplit pas l\u2019exigence en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 au titre du crit\u00e8re Franke \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas ad\u00e9quatement avis\u00e9 l\u2019employeur.\n[193] Une preuve importante a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie concernant la r\u00e9action de Postes Canada aux all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement de Mme Stanger apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9part de l\u2019ETCVic. Nonobstant ses admissions durant le contre\u2011interrogatoire, Mme Stanger a affirm\u00e9 avec insistance que Postes Canada savait tr\u00e8s bien durant la p\u00e9riode 2004\u20112008 qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9e au travail. Pri\u00e9e de produire une preuve sp\u00e9cifique, elle s\u2019est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e au proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal pris par Manulife Financial lors de la r\u00e9union sur son retour au travail, organis\u00e9e le 5 ao\u00fbt 2008, et sp\u00e9cifiquement cette observation qui y figure :\n[traduction] L\u2019employ\u00e9e a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle se sent harcel\u00e9e au travail \u00e0 cause de sa DPP et parce qu\u2019elle est mari\u00e9e \u00e0 son chef. Elle affirme que la gravit\u00e9 de ce harc\u00e8lement est telle qu\u2019elle ne se sent plus en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail.\n[194] Comme l\u2019a fait remarquer l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019observation pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e ne fait que retranscrire la d\u00e9claration int\u00e9ress\u00e9e de la plaignante. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un aveu de Postes Canada, et la preuve indique d\u2019ailleurs que le harc\u00e8lement n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 par la plaignante avant cette r\u00e9union : Mme Aiken a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019avant la r\u00e9union sur le retour au travail du 5 ao\u00fbt 2008, Mme Stanger ne s\u2019\u00e9tait jamais plainte qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait harcel\u00e9e, ou que des mesures d\u2019adaptation ne lui avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consenties \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa DPP.\n[195] L\u2019extrait pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de la r\u00e9union sur le retour au travail indique ensuite :\n[traduction] L\u2019employ\u00e9e a indiqu\u00e9 avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait part de ces pr\u00e9occupations, mais elle estime que cela a eu pour effet d\u2019intensifier le harc\u00e8lement. L\u2019employ\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne tient pas \u00e0 aborder ces questions avec un repr\u00e9sentant du service des droits de la personne.\n[196] Apr\u00e8s avoir quitt\u00e9 l\u2019ETCVic sans crier gare en juin 2008, Mme Stanger est rest\u00e9e en cong\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle commence \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 son nouveau poste en d\u00e9cembre 2008. Son cong\u00e9 de maladie a pris fin d\u00e9but septembre 2008, elle a alors pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de \u00ab cong\u00e9 sp\u00e9cial \u00bb, qui a toutefois \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e. Le 18 septembre suivant, Mme Stanger a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente de Postes Canada, Mme Moya Greene, et all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019elle travaillait \u00e0 l\u2019ETCVic.\n[197] Le bureau de la pr\u00e9sidente a promptement r\u00e9agi. Mme Greene a charg\u00e9 Lucie Manoni, directrice des affaires pr\u00e9sidentielles et commerciales, d\u2019examiner le dossier. Un courriel dat\u00e9 du 25 septembre 2008 a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Roxanne Ayers en lui donnant pour instruction de [traduction] \u00ab traiter dans l\u2019urgence \u00bb l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur les all\u00e9gations de Mme Stanger.\n[198] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a appel\u00e9 Mme Ayers comme t\u00e9moin. Cette derni\u00e8re a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 Postes Canada de 1973 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sa retraite en 2009. De 1995 \u00e0 2000, elle a notamment occup\u00e9 le poste d\u2019enqu\u00eatrice sur les droits de la personne; de 2000 \u00e0 2009, elle \u00e9tait sp\u00e9cialiste des droits de la personne, de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi et des langues officielles pour la r\u00e9gion du Pacifique et du Yukon. Mme Ayers a fourni au Tribunal une d\u00e9position tr\u00e8s utile durant son interrogatoire principal et son tr\u00e8s long contre\u2011interrogatoire.\n[199] Mme Ayers a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a inform\u00e9 Mme Stanger qu\u2019elle devait r\u00e9diger une plainte \u00e9crite contenant des d\u00e9tails sp\u00e9cifiques pertinents quant \u00e0 ses all\u00e9gations pour qu\u2019une enqu\u00eate ait lieu. Mme Stanger a insist\u00e9 pour qu\u2019elle lui fasse cette demande par \u00e9crit. Mme Ayers a trouv\u00e9 cette demande [traduction] \u00ab anormale \u00bb, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les enqu\u00eateurs sur les droits de la personne ne veulent pas donner l\u2019impression qu\u2019ils sollicitent des plaintes de la part des employ\u00e9s. \u00c0 ce qu\u2019elle affirme, la pratique courante consiste \u00e0 n\u2019intervenir qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la plainte d\u2019un employ\u00e9. Nonobstant la pratique usuelle, Mme Ayers a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Stanger, en lui pr\u00e9cisant quels renseignements devaient figurer dans sa plainte pour qu\u2019une enqu\u00eate officielle soit ouverte. Bien qu\u2019elle ait sollicit\u00e9 une telle lettre de Mme Ayers, Mme Stanger n\u2019y a pas r\u00e9pondu et n\u2019a fourni aucun autre renseignement d\u00e9taill\u00e9 sur les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement.\n[200] Compte tenu du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Ayers et de la correspondance soumise \u00e0 l\u2019audience, je suis convaincu que cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019est sinc\u00e8rement souci\u00e9e de la situation de Mme Stanger et de ses droits fondamentaux. Mme Ayers a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s surprise d\u2019\u00eatre inform\u00e9e pour la premi\u00e8re fois des all\u00e9gations de Mme Stanger par l\u2019entremise du bureau de la pr\u00e9sidente, apr\u00e8s que la plaignante eut mentionn\u00e9 le harc\u00e8lement dans la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Greene. Mme Ayers \u00e9tait aussi assez surprise que Mme Stanger ait \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 pendant pr\u00e8s de quatre mois sans la contacter.\n[201] Mme Ayers a livr\u00e9 une d\u00e9position d\u00e9taill\u00e9e sur la formation de sensibilisation en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne offerte \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s de Postes Canada. Diff\u00e9rents documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis en preuve, y compris le Code de conduite de Postes Canada, le Rapport annuel de 2008 de Postes Canada sur les droits de la personne, des copies de sa politique anti-harc\u00e8lement ainsi que des \u00e9chantillons d\u2019affiches en milieu de travail qui expliquent aux employ\u00e9s quoi faire s\u2019ils sont [traduction] \u00ab harcel\u00e9s, intimid\u00e9s ou victimes de discrimination \u00bb. Mme Ayers a soulign\u00e9 la section du rapport annuel confirmant la mise en \u0153uvre d\u2019un programme intitul\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab Droits de la personne et conflits en milieu de travail \u00bb, \u00e0 l\u2019intention de tous les nouveaux employ\u00e9s embauch\u00e9s au sein de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation du STTP. De plus, Mme Ayers a indiqu\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s actuels avaient aussi assist\u00e9 \u00e0 un module d\u2019une demi\u2011journ\u00e9e sur les droits de la personne, le harc\u00e8lement, la discrimination et la r\u00e9solution de conflits en milieu de travail.\n[202] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 25 septembre 2008, Mme Ayers a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Stanger une copie de la politique anti-harc\u00e8lement\u00bb de Postes Canada. Cette politique pr\u00e9cisait clairement que les enqu\u00eates demeuraient confidentielles dans la mesure du possible, et que les plaignants seraient prot\u00e9g\u00e9s contre les repr\u00e9sailles. Elle indiquait \u00e9galement aux employ\u00e9s \u00e0 qui s\u2019adresser pour d\u00e9poser une plainte pour harc\u00e8lement, y compris des coordonnateurs en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne comme Mme Ayers. Lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire, Mme Stanger a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u et lu ce document, qu\u2019elle a en particulier compris les sections sur les repr\u00e9sailles et saisi que les employ\u00e9s pourraient faire l\u2019objet de mesures disciplinaires, voire m\u00eame \u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9s, s\u2019ils contrevenaient \u00e0 la politique.\n[203] Bien qu\u2019elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement inform\u00e9e de la politique, Mme Stanger a continu\u00e9 de refuser de coop\u00e9rer \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Lorsque Mme Ayers a pris sa retraite en 2009, son dossier concernant Mme Stanger a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre directrice des droits de la personne \u00e0 Postes Canada, Mme Renu Srai.\n[204] Le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2009, Mme Srai a adress\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 Mme Stanger concernant ses all\u00e9gations en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Notant la r\u00e9ticence de cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 fournir des pr\u00e9cisions quant \u00e0 ses all\u00e9gations, elle d\u00e9clarait :\n[traduction] Par cons\u00e9quent, Postes Canada n\u2019a pas enqu\u00eat\u00e9 sur votre plainte pour harc\u00e8lement et ne peut ni confirmer ni nier qu\u2019il y a eu harc\u00e8lement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que des renseignements additionnels soient fournis.\n[205] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 19 mai 2009 et adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Stanger, Mme Srai r\u00e9p\u00e9tait :\n[traduction] [\u2026] votre plainte pour harc\u00e8lement par vos coll\u00e8gues, fond\u00e9e sur votre d\u00e9ficience et votre \u00e9tat matrimonial, n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate parce que vous n\u2019avez fourni aucune pr\u00e9cision ni d\u00e9crit d\u2019incident pouvant donner mati\u00e8re \u00e0 enqu\u00eate.\n[206] Le 4 mars 2009, Mme Stanger a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief par l\u2019entremise de son syndicat affirmant que [traduction] \u00ab la SCP a intentionnellement inflig\u00e9 des troubles \u00e9motionnels \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9e susnomm\u00e9e (Mme Stanger), Postes Canada n\u2019ayant pas enqu\u00eat\u00e9 ad\u00e9quatement au sujet de la plainte \u00e9crite de harc\u00e8lement et de violence en milieu de travail [\u2026] \u00bb.\n[207] Encore une fois, Mme Stanger a refus\u00e9 de fournir des pr\u00e9cisions sur ses all\u00e9gations. Le m\u00e9moire d\u2019entente se rapportant au grief stipulait qu\u2019elle devait remettre \u00e0 Postes Canada [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] une d\u00e9claration \u00e9crite d\u00e9crivant les all\u00e9gations sp\u00e9cifiques de sa plainte dans les 30 jours du pr\u00e9sent m\u00e9moire d\u2019entente, laquelle d\u00e9claration sera soumise \u00e0 l\u2019examen du service des droits de la personne \u00bb. Le d\u00e9faut de fournir la d\u00e9claration dans les 30 jours allait entra\u00eener la r\u00e9solution du grief. Mme Stanger n\u2019a pas fourni la d\u00e9claration \u00e9crite.\n[208] Cette plainte est audacieuse en ce que Mme Stanger a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e \u00e0 plusieurs reprises \u00e0 fournir de d\u00e9tails sur le harc\u00e8lement dont elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que son employeur puisse mener une enqu\u00eate. Elle a fermement refus\u00e9 de coop\u00e9rer, d\u00e9posant plut\u00f4t ensuite cette plainte devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[209] Il convient de noter que Mme Stanger a continu\u00e9 de refuser de divulguer des d\u00e9tails sur le harc\u00e8lement dont elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime alors que l\u2019instruction de ce dossier devant le Tribunal \u00e9tait bien entam\u00e9e. Tout au long de la phase de gestion de l\u2019instance pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant l\u2019audience, Mme Stanger s\u2019est montr\u00e9e r\u00e9ticente \u00e0 fournir des d\u00e9tails sp\u00e9cifiques sur ses all\u00e9gations de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement. Son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions initial concernait principalement l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination se rapportant \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance d\u2019\u00e9valuation du PPLAC. Les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement au titre de l\u2019article 14 \u00e9taient assez vagues dans l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions initial de Mme Stanger. En dehors d\u2019une mention du grief officiel contre M. Labine, les all\u00e9gations visant les autres employ\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9taient pas sp\u00e9cifiques, et ne pr\u00e9cisaient ni leurs noms, ni les dates pertinentes, ni les circonstances ayant entour\u00e9 le pr\u00e9tendu harc\u00e8lement.\n[210] Avant la premi\u00e8re semaine d\u2019audience, le Tribunal a rendu une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 Mme Stanger de fournir un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 d\u00e9crivant en d\u00e9tail les actes, mots et\/ou gestes qui constituaient \u00e0 son avis du \u00ab harc\u00e8lement \u00bb et\/ou de la \u00ab discrimination. Mme Stanger s\u2019est conform\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance et un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions de 58 pages a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 nouveau. Cet \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 ajoutait 21 incidents distincts de harc\u00e8lement all\u00e9gu\u00e9, en plus des all\u00e9gations contenues dans son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions initial. Ces 21 incidents additionnels \u00e9taient d\u00e9crits en d\u00e9tail, les dates, lieux ainsi que les noms des autres personnes impliqu\u00e9es \u00e9tant notamment fournis. \u00c0 l\u2019audience toutefois, Mme Stanger n\u2019a fourni aucune preuve quant \u00e0 neuf des incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9.\n[211] Mme Stanger a soutenu qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait auparavant peu dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 fournir ces d\u00e9tails parce qu\u2019elle estimait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne pouvait pas la \u00ab prot\u00e9ger \u00bb apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle eut avanc\u00e9 de telles all\u00e9gations. Cependant, Mme Stanger n\u2019a jamais expliqu\u00e9 contre quoi elle devait \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, et n\u2019a pas pu d\u00e9crire non plus \u00e0 quoi aurait pu ressembler une telle protection, m\u00eame lorsque je lui ai pos\u00e9 la question \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[212] Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la partie suivante, j\u2019estime que l\u2019omission ant\u00e9rieure de Mme Stanger de fournir des d\u00e9tails \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable.\nXIII. Affirmation de la plaignante concernant l\u2019obligation positive de l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019agir\n[213] Tout au long de ses observations \u00e9crites et \u00e0 divers moments de l\u2019audience, la plaignante a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que Postes Canada \u00e9tait soumise \u00e0 une obligation positive d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur les atteintes aux droits de la personne dans le milieu de travail, ce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas fait. Cet argument est tr\u00e8s faible dans les circonstances, parce qu\u2019il pr\u00e9suppose qu\u2019il y a bel et bien eu harc\u00e8lement au sens de l\u2019article 14. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, aucune conclusion de la sorte n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9e.\n[214] L\u2019obligation de l\u2019employeur d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur une all\u00e9gation ou un \u00e9pisode de discrimination en milieu de travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Cassidy c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes et al. (2012 TCDP 29) aux paragraphes 158 et 159 :\n[158] Une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intim\u00e9e (y compris un intim\u00e9 gouvernemental) peut \u00eatre tenue responsable d\u2019actes discriminatoires ou de harc\u00e8lement (similaire \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 du fait d\u2019autrui en droit de la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9lictuelle) commis par ses employ\u00e9s, ses mandataires, ses administrateurs ou ses dirigeants dans le cadre de leur emploi, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 65 de la LCDP. Il en est ainsi, \u00e0 moins que l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 puisse d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas consenti \u00e0 l\u2019acte discriminatoire, et a exerc\u00e9 \u00ab toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires \u00bb pour l\u2019emp\u00eacher et a tent\u00e9 d\u2019en att\u00e9nuer ou d\u2019en annuler l\u2019effet. Je dois ajouter que, \u00e0 mon avis, le qualificatif \u00ab toutes \u00bb pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant \u00ab mesures n\u00e9cessaires \u00bb ne n\u00e9cessite pas l\u2019application d\u2019une norme de \u00ab perfection \u00bb dans l\u2019exercice des mesures n\u00e9cessaires. Au contraire, le qualificatif exige que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intim\u00e9e ait toujours exerc\u00e9 les mesures n\u00e9cessaires raisonnables. Dans la d\u00e9cision Hinds c. Canada (Commission de l\u2019Emploi et de l\u2019Immigration) (1988), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/5683 (TCDP), au paragraphe 41611, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit en appliquant le paragraphe 48(6) de la LCDP [le paragraphe 65(2) alors en vigueur] :\nBien que la LCDP n\u2019exige pas que l\u2019employeur maintienne un milieu de travail irr\u00e9prochable, elle demande toutefois qu\u2019il prenne des mesures promptes et efficaces lorsqu\u2019il sait, ou qu\u2019il devrait savoir, que la conduite de certains employ\u00e9s dans le milieu de travail constitue du harc\u00e8lement raciste [\u2026] Pour se soustraire a la responsabilit\u00e9, l\u2019employeur doit prendre des mesures raisonnables pour att\u00e9nuer, autant qu\u2019il le peut, le malaise qui r\u00e8gne dans le milieu de travail et pour donner aux personnes int\u00e9ress\u00e9es l\u2019assurance qu\u2019il a la ferme volont\u00e9 de maintenir un milieu de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement raciste. La r\u00e9action appropri\u00e9e est donc \u00e0 la fois prompte et efficace et sa force doit \u00eatre fonction des circonstances du harc\u00e8lement, dans chaque cas. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[159] Dans cette obligation d\u2019att\u00e9nuer figure un examen des mesures prises par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intim\u00e9e pour enqu\u00eater, tirer des conclusions et imposer un m\u00e9canisme de r\u00e8glement. Dans la d\u00e9cision Sutton c. Jarvis Ryan Associates, et al., 2010 HRTO 2421 (CanLII), aux paragraphes 130 \u00e0 133, le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario a statu\u00e9 sur l\u2019obligation de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intim\u00e9e d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur une plainte de discrimination ou de harc\u00e8lement :\n[traduction]\nIl est bien \u00e9tabli dans la jurisprudence du Tribunal qu\u2019un employeur peut \u00eatre tenu responsable de la fa\u00e7on dont il r\u00e9pond \u00e0 une plainte de discrimination.\nLa raison d\u2019\u00eatre du devoir d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur une plainte de discrimination est de veiller \u00e0 ce que les droits conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le Code aient un sens. Ainsi qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Laskowska c. Marineland of Canada Inc., 2005 HRTO 30 (CanLII) (Laskowska), au paragraphe 53 :\nCe serait faire de la protection en vertu du paragraphe 5(1) visant \u00e0 permettre un milieu de travail exempt de discrimination vide de sens si un employeur pouvait rester les bras crois\u00e9s quand une plainte de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite et ne pas avoir \u00e0 mener une enqu\u00eate. Si tel \u00e9tait le cas, comment pourrait-il d\u00e9terminer si un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis ou d\u00e9terminer l\u2019existence d\u2019un milieu de travail empoisonn\u00e9? Le devoir d\u2019enqu\u00eater est un \u00ab moyen \u00bb qui permet \u00e0 l\u2019employeur de s\u2019assurer qu\u2019il atteint les \u00ab objectifs \u00bb dict\u00e9s par le Code visant \u00e0 offrir un environnement exempt de discrimination et \u00e0 fournir \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s un environnement de travail s\u00e9curitaire.\nLa jurisprudence du Tribunal a \u00e9tabli que l\u2019obligation de l\u2019employeur d\u2019enqu\u00eater s\u2019appr\u00e9cie suivant la norme du caract\u00e8re raisonnable, non pas celles de la d\u00e9cision correcte ou de la perfection. Dans la d\u00e9cision Laskowska, le Tribunal a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ainsi le crit\u00e8re pertinent dont doit tenir compte l\u2019employeur dans son devoir d\u2019enqu\u00eater :\n(1) Sensibilisation aux questions de discrimination\/harc\u00e8lement, m\u00e9canisme de plainte pr\u00e9vu par la politique et formation : \u00e9tait-on sensibilis\u00e9 au probl\u00e8me de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement dans le milieu de travail lors de l\u2019incident? Existait-il une politique anti\u2011discrimination\/harc\u00e8lement appropri\u00e9e? Existait-il un m\u00e9canisme de plainte proprement dit en place? La direction et les employ\u00e9s ont-ils b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019une formation ad\u00e9quate?\n(2) Apr\u00e8s la plainte : la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019incident, la rapidit\u00e9 d\u2019intervention, la prise en charge de son employ\u00e9, l\u2019enqu\u00eate et la mesure prise : Apr\u00e8s qu\u2019une plainte interne a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e, l\u2019employeur a-t-il trait\u00e9 le dossier s\u00e9rieusement? A-t-il r\u00e9gl\u00e9 la question rapidement et avec doigt\u00e9? A-t-il men\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate et agi de mani\u00e8re raisonnable?\n(3) R\u00e8glement de la plainte (y compris fournir au plaignant un environnement de travail sain) et communication : L\u2019employeur a\u2011t-il propos\u00e9 une solution raisonnable dans les circonstances? Si le plaignant a choisi de retourner au travail, l\u2019employeur pouvait-il lui assurer un environnement de travail sain, exempt de discrimination? A-t-il communiqu\u00e9 ses conclusions et interventions au plaignant?\nDans la d\u00e9cision Laskowska, le Tribunal a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit au paragraphe 60 :\nBien que les trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments ci-dessus soient de nature g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, leur application doit conserver une certaine souplesse pour tenir compte des faits propres \u00e0 chaque cas. La norme est celle du caract\u00e8re raisonnable, non pas celles de la d\u00e9cision correcte ou de la perfection. Il y aurait eu plusieurs options \u2013 toutes des mesures raisonnables \u2013 auxquelles aurait pu recourir l\u2019employeur. Ce dernier n\u2019est pas tenu de satisfaire \u00e0 chacun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments dans tous les cas afin d\u2019\u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant agi de fa\u00e7on raisonnable, bien que ce serait l\u2019exception plut\u00f4t que la norme. Il faut regarder chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment individuellement, puis dans l\u2019ensemble avant de porter un jugement \u00e0 savoir si l\u2019employeur a agi de mani\u00e8re raisonnable.\n[215] S\u2019agissant du crit\u00e8re en trois volets d\u00e9crit dans Laskowska, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, j\u2019examinerai la preuve concernant la politique de Postes Canada en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement. Mme Ayers a livr\u00e9 une d\u00e9position d\u00e9taill\u00e9e sur la formation de sensibilisation en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne offerte \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s de Postes Canada. Je suis convaincu que Postes Canada remplit le premier volet du crit\u00e8re Laskowska parce qu\u2019elle dispose d\u2019une politique ad\u00e9quate en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne ayant permis une sensibilisation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 ces questions dans le milieu de travail.\n[216] Concernant le deuxi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re Laskowska, je suis tout aussi convaincu que Postes Canada avait mis en place les m\u00e9canismes et r\u00e9ponses appropri\u00e9s pour faire face aux plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne. La preuve de Mme Ayers a confirm\u00e9 que l\u2019employeur prenait toutes les plaintes concernant les droits de la personne au s\u00e9rieux et qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient imm\u00e9diatement suivies d\u2019effet. Mme Stanger a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas soumettre de plainte \u00e9crite d\u00e9taillant ses all\u00e9gations, comme le lui avait demand\u00e9 Mme Ayers. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019y avait pas de plainte \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre ou sur laquelle enqu\u00eater. Cependant, Mme Ayers a pris des mesures pour enqu\u00eater sur la plainte de Mme Stanger et le dossier documentaire montre que les mesures prises \u00e9taient promptes, sensibles et raisonnables. Je suis convaincu que le deuxi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re Laskowska est rempli.\n[217] Le troisi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re Laskowska, le r\u00e8glement de la plainte et la communication s\u2019y rapportant, ne sont pas directement applicables \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire puisque Mme Stanger n\u2019a soumis aucune plainte recevable. En conclusion, je suis convaincu que Postes Canada s\u2019est effectivement acquitt\u00e9e de sa responsabilit\u00e9 sociale de mettre en place une politique et des m\u00e9canismes appropri\u00e9s pour enqu\u00eater sur les plaintes de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement. Sa politique pr\u00e9cisait clairement que le harc\u00e8lement ne serait pas tol\u00e9r\u00e9. Elle a fait preuve de la diligence voulue en prenant des mesures raisonnables pour former et informer ses employ\u00e9s quant \u00e0 la politique de pr\u00e9vention du harc\u00e8lement. Postes Canada a engag\u00e9 des experts en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, qui sont form\u00e9s pour intervenir en cas de harc\u00e8lement ou de discrimination et en att\u00e9nuer les effets. Je suis convaincu que Postes Canada aurait men\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate exhaustive sur ces plaintes si Mme Stanger avait coop\u00e9r\u00e9. Dans les circonstances, et puisqu\u2019elle a elle-m\u00eame avou\u00e9 qu\u2019elle connaissait la politique anti-harc\u00e8lement en d\u00e9tail, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable de sa part de ne pas coop\u00e9rer.\n[218] Mme Stanger s\u2019est ent\u00eat\u00e9e \u00e0 ne pas fournir de pr\u00e9cisions d\u00e9taill\u00e9es au sujet de ses all\u00e9gations jusqu\u2019\u00e0 que le Tribunal lui ordonne sp\u00e9cifiquement de le faire. Elle avait peut-\u00eatre ses raisons, mais elles m\u2019ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 obscures. Si Mme Stanger craignait des repr\u00e9sailles violentes ou redoutables, elle n\u2019a rien dit de tel lorsqu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 questionn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience sur cette \u00e9ventualit\u00e9. Aucune preuve convaincante n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite comme quoi l\u2019ETCVic est un lieu de travail peu s\u00fbr.\nXIV. Conclusion\n[219] Nonobstant les multiples all\u00e9gations de la plaignante, j\u2019estime qu\u2019un seul aspect de la plainte est fond\u00e9 : l\u2019all\u00e9gation concernant le d\u00e9ni de l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de participer au PPLAC. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, les parties et le Tribunal ont convenu de disjoindre l\u2019audience de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 n\u2019examiner les mesures de redressement que si la plainte \u00e9tait jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e. Comme cette partie de la plainte de Mme Stanger l\u2019est, les parties doivent suivre les instructions relatives aux mesures de redressement \u00e9nonc\u00e9es aux paragraphes 89\u201191.\nSign\u00e9e par\nDavid L.

Conclusion 8\nV. Autres commentaires 9\nI. La plainte et la requ\u00eate\n[1] Le 30 novembre 2012, Serge Lafreni\u00e8re (le plaignant) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP) contre Via Rail Canada Inc. (l\u2019intim\u00e9e).\n[2] Le 10 ao\u00fbt 2016, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission), apr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate, a renvoy\u00e9 pour instruction au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant en vertu de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP.\n[3] Essentiellement, le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment et qu\u2019il s\u2019est vu injustement d\u00e9cerner des points de p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 dans son dossier disciplinaire, le tout ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement le 5 octobre 2012.\n[4] Dans sa plainte originale, le plaignant all\u00e8gue comme motif de distinction illicite son orientation sexuelle.\n[5] La Commission, quant \u00e0 elle, soul\u00e8ve dans son renvoi au Tribunal et dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions deux motifs de distinction, soit l\u2019orientation sexuelle et la d\u00e9ficience.\n[6] Dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant, seul le motif de d\u00e9ficience est soulev\u00e9.\n[7] le 17 janvier 2017, une semaine avant le premier appel de gestion de cas dans ce dossier, l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e quatre requ\u00eates pr\u00e9liminaires, dont une requ\u00eate en radiation.\n[8] Le Tribunal, lors de l\u2019appel de gestion de cas tenu le 24 janvier 2017, a inform\u00e9 les parties qu\u2019il traitera la requ\u00eate en radiation en premier, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u les soumissions \u00e9crites de toutes les parties.\n[9] Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 au plaignant de clarifier, dans sa soumission \u00e9crite, les motifs de distinction illicite soulev\u00e9s dans le cadre de sa plainte.\nII. Les questions en litige\n[10] Le Tribunal rel\u00e8ve les questions suivantes suite au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la requ\u00eate en radiation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e :\na) Tout d\u2019abord, dans le but de circonscrire le d\u00e9bat, quels sont les motifs de distinction illicite qui seront entendus par le Tribunal lors de l\u2019audience?\nb) Le Tribunal peut-il rejeter une partie de la plainte avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019instruction?\nc) Le Tribunal doit-il accorder la requ\u00eate en radiation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et radier les paragraphes 4 \u00e0 53 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant, l\u2019accorder en partie et radier seulement une partie de ceux-ci, ou rejeter enti\u00e8rement la requ\u00eate?\nIII. Analyse\nA. Quels sont les motifs de distinction illicite qui seront entendus par le Tribunal lors de l\u2019audience?\n[11] Lors de l\u2019appel de gestion de cas, le Tribunal a clairement indiqu\u00e9 aux parties qu\u2019il semblait y avoir une divergence entre les motifs de distinction illicite soulev\u00e9s dans la plainte originale (orientation sexuelle), dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la Commission (la d\u00e9ficience et l\u2019orientation sexuelle), et l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant (d\u00e9ficience).\n[12] Le Tribunal a inform\u00e9 le plaignant qu\u2019il lui faudrait pr\u00e9ciser, dans le cadre de sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en radiation, les motifs li\u00e9s \u00e0 chacune des all\u00e9gations de discrimination qu\u2019il entend soulever dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[13] le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission de bien vouloir contacter la plaignant apr\u00e8s l\u2019appel afin de s\u2019assurer qu\u2019il comprend la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre en ce qui a trait aux motifs de discrimination, ce \u00e0 quoi la Commission a acquiesc\u00e9.\n[14] \u00c0 la lecture des soumissions \u00e9crites (r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en radiation) soumises par le plaignant et la Commission, il appert que seul le motif de d\u00e9ficience est maintenant soulev\u00e9 par le plaignant dans ce dossier.\n[15] Le Tribunal conclu ainsi que seul ce motif sera \u00e9tudi\u00e9 lors de l\u2019audience de ce dossier et que le d\u00e9bat est ainsi circonscrit \u00e0 ce seul motif de discrimination.\nB. Le Tribunal peut-il rejeter une partie de la plainte avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019instruction?\n[16] La jurisprudence \u00e0 cet effet est claire. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et le Tribunal ont par le pass\u00e9 clairement exprim\u00e9 l\u2019avis que le Tribunal peut rejeter en partie ou en totalit\u00e9 une plainte avant d\u2019avoir tenu une audience compl\u00e8te sur le fond, en autant que le processus soit juste, qu\u2019il respecte les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle et que les parties aient eu pleine et enti\u00e8re occasion de pr\u00e9senter les preuves n\u00e9cessaires pour que soient tranch\u00e9es les questions soulev\u00e9es par la requ\u00eate en radiation. (Voir Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Canada (procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 445; Murray c. Commission de l\u2019immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9, 2013 CDP 2 et Emmett c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2013 TCDP 12.)\n[17] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces principes, le Tribunal examinera maintenant si certaines parties de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant doivent \u00eatre radi\u00e9es.\nC. Le Tribunal doit-il accorder la requ\u00eate en radiation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et radier les paragraphes 4 \u00e0 53 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant, l\u2019accorder en partie et radier seulement une partie de ceux-ci, ou rejeter enti\u00e8rement la requ\u00eate?\n[18] La LCDP et les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal ne pr\u00e9voient pas express\u00e9ment la radiation de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Ce concept \u00e9mane du processus de litige civil devant les cours. Dans Bailie et autres c. Air Canada et l\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada, 2011 TCDP 17, le Tribunal a expliqu\u00e9 comme suit :\n[22] Le Tribunal devrait peut-\u00eatre examiner les crit\u00e8res l\u00e9gaux et les pratiques des autres tribunaux en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne du Canada avant de se fonder sur ceux des cours. Il existe des raisons politiques solides pour lesquelles les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal ne contiennent que dix articles, alors que les R\u00e8gles des cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales comptent plus de 500 articles. Notamment, il existe aussi un fondement l\u00e9gal, parce que le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que : \u00ab l\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique \u00bb. (Voir aussi l\u2019alin\u00e9a 1(1)c) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure.)\n[19] L\u2019intim\u00e9e plaide que les paragraphes 4 \u00e0 53 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant concernent des questions qui ne sont pas du ressort du Tribunal et qu\u2019ils ne sont pas pertinents. L\u2019intim\u00e9e plaide que le plaignant tente par le biais de ces paragraphes de faire la preuve de la cause de sa d\u00e9ficience et que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas juridiction, et qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas de son ressort de d\u00e9terminer la cause de la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant.\n[20] La Commission et le plaignant plaident, quant \u00e0 eux, que la requ\u00eate en radiation doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[21] La Commission plaide que la requ\u00eate est infond\u00e9e en fait et en droit et que la plainte du plaignant porte sur son cong\u00e9diement pour un motif prohib\u00e9, soit la d\u00e9ficience. Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00ab tout le dossier disciplinaire de M. Lafreni\u00e8re est donc devant le Tribunal \u00bb.\n[22] La Commission renvoie \u00e9galement le Tribunal aux motifs de sa d\u00e9cision de demander \u00e0 ce dernier d\u2019instruire la plainte du plaignant et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, cite l\u2019extrait suivant de sa d\u00e9cision :\n[S]i le mis en cause savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir que le plaignant, qui n\u2019avait aucun dossier disciplinaire pendant des ann\u00e9es, mais qui dans un court d\u00e9lai avait accumul\u00e9 soudainement plusieurs points de p\u00e9nalisation, ne souffrait pas de maladie mentale pour laquelle il avait besoin de mesures d\u2019accommodement.\n[23] La Commission explique au paragraphe 17 de sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate que \u00ab la Commission a demand\u00e9 sp\u00e9cifiquement que le Tribunal se penche sur le renvoi de M. Lafreni\u00e8re et son dossier disciplinaire \u00bb. Il est \u00e0 noter que le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u une copie des motifs de la Commission avec la demande d\u2019instruction. La port\u00e9e du renvoi au Tribunal est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par la lettre que la Commission envoie au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal, avec une copie de la plainte, et l\u2019envoi de cette lettre commence le processus d\u2019instruction de la plainte devant le Tribunal (voir Bentley c. Air Canada et l\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada, 2016 TCDP 17 au paragraphe 4). La demande d\u2019instruction au Tribunal dat\u00e9e du 22 ao\u00fbt 2016 a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019enti\u00e8ret\u00e9 de la plainte, ce qui pourrait inclure la question du dossier disciplinaire du plaignant. De toute fa\u00e7on, les motifs de la Commission \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en radiation viennent clarifier une des raisons principales pour la demande d\u2019instruction.\n[24] Le plaignant, quant \u00e0 lui, pr\u00e9tend au paragraphe 18 de ses repr\u00e9sentations sur la requ\u00eate, et non dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, \u00ab\u2026 [qu\u2019] il existe des preuves \u00e9crites de la d\u00e9ficience du Plaignant qui remontent au mois de novembre 2011 et m\u00eame avant \u00bb.\n[25] Au d\u00e9but de ses repr\u00e9sentations sur la requ\u00eate, le plaignant affirme \u00e9galement au paragraphe (d) qu\u2019il souffrait d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience mentale dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre au courant parce qu\u2019il lui en avait fait part \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises durant l\u2019ann\u00e9e qui avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 son cong\u00e9diement [mes soulign\u00e9s]. En plus, il pr\u00e9tend au paragraphe (e) que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a intentionnellement refus\u00e9 de tenir compte de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[26] Au paragraphe 19 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le plaignant affirme que sa derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e au service de l\u2019intim\u00e9e correspond \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 il souffrait de d\u00e9ficience mentale. Si on accepte que l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019ait cong\u00e9di\u00e9 le 5 octobre 2012 \u2014 selon le paragraphe 74 de son expos\u00e9 \u2014 cela veut dire qu\u2019il affirme avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience \u00e0 partir du 6 octobre 2011.\n[27] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, il y a lieu de faire une distinction parmi les paragraphes de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant vis\u00e9s par la requ\u00eate, entre :\nD\u2019une part, les paragraphes qui traitent des pr\u00e9tendues causes de sa d\u00e9ficience et o\u00f9 le plaignant tente d\u2019\u00e9tablir un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre des gestes pos\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9e et sa d\u00e9ficience ou qui traitent d\u2019un \u00e9v\u00e9nement survenu au travail qui ne semble pas avoir un lien avec la d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e (dotation avril 2011) (paragraphes 4 \u00e0 9; paragraphes 10 \u00e0 18 et 39 \u00e0 53) ; et\nD\u2019autre part, les autres paragraphes (19 \u00e0 26 et 27 \u00e0 38) qui traitent d\u2019un \u00e9v\u00e9nement ou qui traitent de mesures disciplinaires et du cumul de ces derniers \u00e0 son dossier disciplinaire durant sa derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e au service de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, durant la p\u00e9riode de sa d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e (du 6 octobre 2011 au 5 octobre 2012).\n(i) Paragraphes qui traitent des pr\u00e9tendues causes de la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant ou qui traitent d\u2019un \u00e9v\u00e8nement au travail qui ne semble pas avoir un lien avec la d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e\n[28] Tout d\u2019abord, les paragraphes 4 \u00e0 9 font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une demande d\u2019emploi en avril 2011, qui ne semble ni avoir g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 des mesures disciplinaires, ni \u00eatre survenu pendant sa p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e. La pertinence de ces all\u00e9gations est donc tr\u00e8s discutable.\n[29] L\u2019instruction des all\u00e9gations contenues aux paragraphes 4 \u00e0 9 n\u00e9cessitant l\u2019audition de preuves dans le but de tenir l\u2019intim\u00e9e responsable, et une contre-preuve par cette derni\u00e8re pour se d\u00e9fendre, ne servirait pas \u00e0 trancher la question dont le Tribunal est saisi. Si le plaignant veut en t\u00e9moigner pour situer le \u00ab contexte \u00bb et que cela pourrait l\u2019aider dans la narration de son v\u00e9cu, c\u2019est son choix ; l\u2019intim\u00e9e, quant \u00e0 elle, ne devrait pas se sentir oblig\u00e9e de r\u00e9pondre ou de r\u00e9futer chacune de ses all\u00e9gations pour \u00e9viter une conclusion de responsabilit\u00e9 de la part du Tribunal.\n[30] Quant aux paragraphes qui traitent des pr\u00e9tendues causes de la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant, le Tribunal est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas pertinent d\u2019\u00e9tablir le lien causal entre des gestes pr\u00e9tendument pos\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9e et la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant, \u00e0 moins que ces gestes soient eux-m\u00eames qualifi\u00e9s d\u2019actes discriminatoires au sens de la LCDP, ce qui ne semble pas \u00eatre le cas \u00e0 la lecture de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant.\n[31] Ce qui est pertinent pour le Tribunal, c\u2019est de d\u00e9terminer si un motif de distinction illicite pr\u00e9vu par la LCDP, en l\u2019occurrence ici la d\u00e9ficience, a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans les d\u00e9cisions (mesures disciplinaires et cong\u00e9diement) prises par l\u2019intim\u00e9e durant la p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\n[32] En d\u2019autres mots, les gestes pos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du plaignant pendant sa p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 discriminatoires parce qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas tenu compte de sa situation de d\u00e9ficience? Tout ce qui concerne la cause de cette d\u00e9ficience, telle que d\u00e9crite par le plaignant, n\u2019a pas de pertinence.\n[33] Ainsi, le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e0 faire la preuve de la cause de sa d\u00e9ficience au Tribunal. Il doit par contre faire la preuve qu\u2019il y avait effectivement d\u00e9ficience lorsque les gestes reproch\u00e9s (mesures disciplinaires et cong\u00e9diement) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9s.\n[34] Tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 au paragraphe 18 de cette d\u00e9cision, la requ\u00eate en radiation ajoute un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de formalisme aux proc\u00e9dures du Tribunal qui est plus appropri\u00e9 dans le contexte de litige civil. En raison de ceci, le Tribunal ne s\u2019objecte pas lors de l\u2019audience \u00e0 ce que le plaignant donne le contexte de sa plainte en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant aux paragraphes 10 \u00e0 18 et 39 \u00e0 53 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, et \u00e9labore ainsi sur l\u2019environnement de travail dans lequel les gestes reproch\u00e9s se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s, mais ce ne sera pas dans le but d\u2019\u00e9tablir la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et d\u2019en faire une preuve, et pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019en faire une contre-preuve.\n[35] Le Tribunal ajoute cependant qu\u2019une partie du paragraphe 18 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant est pertinent : \u00ab J\u2019ai d\u00fb prendre de nombreux m\u00e9dicaments et mon m\u00e9decin (le docteur Ben Haddad) me mit en arr\u00eat de travail pour une p\u00e9riode totale de 3 mois (du 1er mars 2012 au 7 juin 2012) \u00bb.\n(ii) Autres paragraphes\n[36] Voyons maintenant les paragraphes qui traitent d\u2019un \u00e9v\u00e9nement ou de mesures disciplinaires et du cumul de ces derniers au dossier disciplinaire du plaignant lors de sa derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e au service de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, durant la p\u00e9riode de sa d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e (du 6 octobre 2011 au 5 octobre 2012).\n[37] Les paragraphes 19 \u00e0 26 semblent, quant \u00e0 eux, d\u00e9crire un \u00e9v\u00e9nement disciplinaire survenu en novembre 2011, qui tombe dans la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la d\u00e9ficience. Ces all\u00e9gations me semblent donc pertinentes.\n[38] Les paragraphes 27 \u00e0 38 font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un incident physique ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 une mesure disciplinaire, mais qui ce serait d\u00e9roul\u00e9 avant la p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, soit avant le 6 octobre 2011. La pertinence de ces all\u00e9gations est donc discutable. Cependant, le Tribunal est r\u00e9ticent \u00e0 appliquer une interpr\u00e9tation tr\u00e8s stricte de la p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e dans ce cas-ci.\n[39] En effet, les paragraphes 27 \u00e0 38 font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus les 19 et 24 septembre 2011, soit quelques jours seulement avant la p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e qui, selon l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant, d\u00e9bute le 6 octobre 2011. Le Tribunal h\u00e9site \u00e0 remette en question la pertinence de ces paragraphes. Il ne s\u2019agit pas ici d\u2019une blessure physique, comme une cheville cass\u00e9e, mais d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience mentale pour laquelle une date exacte est beaucoup plus difficile \u00e0 fixer.\n[40] C\u2019est pourquoi le Tribunal, en respectant l\u2019esprit des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure qui sont beaucoup plus flexibles qu\u2019en litige civil, consid\u00e8re les all\u00e9gations \u00e9nonc\u00e9es \u00e0 ces paragraphes comme \u00e9tant \u00e9galement pertinentes.\nIV. Conclusion\n[41] Le Tribunal, soucieux de l\u2019importance pour le plaignant de pouvoir bien situer le contexte de ses all\u00e9gations, mais reconnaissant le manque de lien entre plusieurs de celles-ci avec un motif de distinction illicite, et dans le but d\u2019instruire la plainte de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive, rejette la requ\u00eate en radiation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, mais conclut que :\nLes paragraphes 4 \u00e0 9 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant, qui font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une demande d\u2019emploi qui n\u2019a pas eu de cons\u00e9quences disciplinaires et qui s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e avant la p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, pourront servir de bases contextuelles uniquement lors de l\u2019audience si le plaignant le d\u00e9sire et non avec l\u2019objectif d\u2019\u00e9tablir la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ;\nLes paragraphes 19 \u00e0 26 et 27 \u00e0 38, qui portent sur une mesure disciplinaire ayant eu lieu pendant ou pr\u00e8s de la p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, sont pertinents et seront entendus par le Tribunal et le plaignant devra en faire preuve et l\u2019intim\u00e9e devra en faire contre-preuve ;\nLes paragraphes 10 \u00e0 18 et 39 \u00e0 53, qui tendent \u00e0 vouloir \u00e9tablir un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre des gestes all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant, pourront servir au plaignant s\u2019il le d\u00e9sire dans le but de situer le \u00ab contexte \u00bb et non avec l\u2019objectif d\u2019\u00e9tablir la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ; et\nLa partie suivante du paragraphe 18 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant : \u00ab J\u2019ai d\u00fb prendre de nombreux m\u00e9dicaments et mon m\u00e9decin (le docteur Ben Haddad) me mit en arr\u00eat de travail pour une p\u00e9riode totale de 3 mois (du 1er mars 2012 au 7 juin 2012) \u00bb est pertinente et sera entendue par le Tribunal et le plaignant devra en faire preuve et l\u2019intim\u00e9e devra en faire contre-preuve.\nV. Autres commentaires\n[42] Le Tribunal d\u00e9sire rappeler aux parties que les documents en lien avec leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions, ou l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions des autres parties impliqu\u00e9es, doivent tous \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s (r\u00e8gle 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal). Les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure permettent d\u2019ailleurs une divulgation continue \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard (r\u00e8gle 6(5)). Par contre, s\u2019il s\u2019agit de documents qui soul\u00e8vent de nouveaux faits qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions des parties, une requ\u00eate en amendement de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions doit tout d\u2019abord \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au Tribunal.\n[43] Le Tribunal a re\u00e7u un courriel du plaignant le soir du 21 mars 2017 \u00e0 19h21, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u les soumissions \u00e9crites de toutes les parties sur la requ\u00eate en radiation et apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9but\u00e9 la r\u00e9daction de cette d\u00e9cision. Dans ce courriel, le plaignant, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui est indiqu\u00e9 dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions original, affirme, et cela pour la premi\u00e8re fois, \u00eatre atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience depuis le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2010. Le Tribunal a besoin de conna\u00eetre avec exactitude \u00e0 partir de quand le plaignant pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. S\u2019il d\u00e9roge de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions original, le plaignant doit demander officiellement la permission du Tribunal pour l\u2019amender, avant de divulguer aux autres parties des documents qui sont pertinents \u00e0 cet amendement. Si le plaignant d\u00e9pose une requ\u00eate afin de modifier son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, les autres parties auront ensuite l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de soumettre leurs positions par \u00e9crit, respectant donc les principes de justice naturelle et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[44] Une telle demande d\u2019amendement, si elle est accord\u00e9e, pourrait avoir un impact sur la d\u00e9cision de ce Tribunal sur la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en radiation. Le Tribunal r\u00e9serve sa juridiction sur les questions soulev\u00e9es par cette requ\u00eate dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 d\u2019une demande de modification de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAnie Perrault\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nLe\n30 mars 2017\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal :\nT2162\/3616\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nSerge Lafreni\u00e8re c.
