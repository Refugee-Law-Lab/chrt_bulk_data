        "unofficial_text":"Davidson v. Health Canada\nCollection\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nDate\n2012-01-16\nNeutral citation\n2012 CHRT 1\nFile number(s)\nT1495\/4110\nDecision-maker(s)\nLustig, Edward P.\nDecision type\nRuling\nDecision Content\nBetween:\nRay Davidson\nComplainant\n- and -\nCanadian Human Rights Commission\nCommission\n- and -\nHealth Canada\nRespondent\nRuling\nMember: Edward P. Lustig\nDate: January 16, 2012\nCitation: 2012 CHRT 1\n[1] This is a Ruling respecting a Motion by the Respondent for a determination by the Tribunal that documents relating to the assessment of candidates for the selection process 05-NHW-CE-CCID-047 (the \u201cselection process\u201d) with the Respondent are not relevant to the present Complaint and that the Tribunal should not receive such evidence pertaining to the Complainant\u2019s assessment for the selection process.\n[2] In his Complaint, the Complainant alleges that the Respondent discriminated against him on the basis of his race, sex and color in refusing to hire him, contrary to s. 7 (a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the \u201cAct\u201d). As part of his case the Complainant alleges that during a competition for a job with the Respondent, he was marked unreasonably hard in comparison to other candidates involved in the selection process so as to rank him fifth out of five eligible candidates; that the other four candidates were hired and he was not hired despite evidence of a need for his services and his qualifications for the job; and that the Respondent continued to seek other candidates.\n[3] In the Complainant\u2019s list of documents included with his Statement of Particulars, he has indicated that he intends to rely on records concerning questions, responses, and assessment tools that were used for the selection process in order to show that he was marked unreasonably hard.\n[4] The selection process was the subject of two appeals initiated by the Complainant to the Public Service Commission Appeal Board (the \u201cPSCAB\u201d) for which Decisions were rendered on August 17, 2006 and March 27, 2007 wherein the question of whether the Complainant was marked unreasonably hard was considered.\n[5] The Respondent\u2019s position in seeking this Ruling as set out in its letter to the Tribunal of November 23, 2011 is as follows:\nThe issue of whether or not the Complainant was properly assessed during the selection process has already been addressed twice by the Public Service Commission (PSC) Appeal Board. After the Complainant\u2019s second appeal to the PSC, the Appeal Board clearly concluded that the assessment of candidates was reasonable, and that the Complainant had not been marked unreasonably hard in comparison to other candidates. It is therefore unnecessary for the Tribunal to review the Complainant\u2019s assessments once again. Furthermore, since the PSC is a specialized appeal board tasked to review selection processes to ensure fairness, it would not be inappropriate for the Tribunal to rely on the findings of the PSC.\n[6] On August 17, 2006, the PSCAB rendered its first decision concerning the appeal of the Complainant against the appointments in the selection process. In that decision, the PSCAB examines the Complainant\u2019s allegation as follows: \u201cAllegation #1, \u201cThe marking of the interview was unreasonably hard causing loss of points on some questions\u201d. Specifically, the Complainant took issue with the marking of interview questions 1, 6, 7, 8 and 9. The PSCAB found that the Respondent\u2019s Selection Board was not unreasonable in its assessment of the Complainant\u2019s answers to questions 1, 6 and 9. With respect to question 7, the PSCAB found the opinion of the Selection Board to be unreasonable as it arbitrarily used a negative marking system for the question. For question 8, the PSCAB found that the Respondent failed to provide evidence to demonstrate that the expected answers were in concordance with the question asked and that these expected answers actually measured the sub-factors they were intended to measure. As a result of this decision, the PSCAB ordered the Respondent to implement corrective measures to address the issues identified in the appeal, including: re-assess all candidates; ensure that the defect identified for questions 7 and 8 are not repeated and that candidates who have already been appointed to these positions do not receive an unfair advantage; and, should changes be required to the eligibility list as a result of this re-assessment, issue an amended list with appropriate appeal rights.\n[7] Following the implementation of the corrective measures, a new eligibility list was issued and was added to the list as the fifth successful candidate. The Complainant appealed the implementation of the corrective measures to the PSCAB.\n[8] On March 27, 2007, the PSCAB rendered its second decision on the appeal of the Complainant against appointments in the selection process. The PSCAB examined the Complainant\u2019s allegation that \u201cCompared to the other successful candidates, I believe I was marked unreasonably hard causing loss of points on some questions.\u201d Specifically, the Complainant alleged that the Selection Board was unreasonably hard in marking questions 1, 3 and 4 of his exam compared to the other successful candidates. According to the PSCAB, it carefully reviewed the written exam of all the successful candidates, including the Complainant, and saw no reasons to intervene. The PSCAB was satisfied with the explanations provided by the Respondent regarding the way the marks were awarded to the candidates and why the Complainant did not score as well as the other candidates. From the evidence adduced at the hearing, the PSCAB was convinced that the Selection Board met its obligation to ensure that the questions assessed what they were designed to assess; that the questions and expected answers were linked to the Statement of Qualifications established for the position; and, that the Selection Board could demonstrate that the assessment of the candidates was done in a fair and equitable manner.\n[9] In common law, the doctrines of issue estoppel, abuse of process and collateral attack \u201cexist to prevent unfairness by preventing abuse of the decision-making process\u201d as stated in British Columbia (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) v. Figliola, 2011 SCC 52, at para. 34 [Figliola]. In Figliola, the issue estoppel, abuse of process and collateral attacks follows:\n\u2022 It is in the interests of the public and the parties that the finality of a decision can be relied on (Danyluk, at para. 18; Boucher, at para. 35).\n\u2022 Respect for the finality of a judicial or administrative decision increases fairness and the integrity of the courts, administrative tribunals and the administration of justice; on the other hand, relitigation of issues that have been previously decided in an appropriate forum may undermine confidence in this fairness and integrity by creating inconsistent results and unnecessarily duplicative proceedings (Toronto (City), at paras. 38 and 51).\n\u2022 The method of challenging the validity or correctness of a judicial or administrative decision should be through the appeal or judicial review mechanisms that are intended by the legislature (Boucher, at para. 35; Danyluk, at para. 74).\n\u2022 Parties should not circumvent the appropriate review mechanism by using other forums to challenge a judicial or administrative decision (TeleZone, at para. 61; Boucher, at para. 35; Garland, at para. 72).\n\u2022 Avoiding unnecessary relitigation avoids an unnecessary expenditure of resources (Toronto (City), at paras. 37 and 51).\n(Figliola at para. 34)\nBased on these principles, the Court held that a tribunal determining whether the substance of a complaint has been appropriately dealt with should ask itself the following:\n\u2022 whether there was concurrent jurisdiction to decide human rights issues;\n\u2022 whether the previously decided legal issue was essentially the same as what is being complained of to the Tribunal; and,\n\u2022 whether there was an opportunity for the complainants or their privies to know the case to be met and have the chance to meet it, regardless of how closely the previous process procedurally mirrored the one the Tribunal prefers or uses itself.\n(Figliola at para. 37)\n[10] The Supreme Court added: \u201cAt the end of the day, it is really a question of whether it makes sense to expend public and private resources on the relitigation of what is essentially the same dispute\u201d (Figliola at para. 37).\n[11] In following the application of the Figliola principles, the Federal Court of Appeal has recently set aside a decision of the Tribunal for not \u201c...considering the unfairness inherent in serial forum shopping\u201d in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canadian Transportation Agency, 2011 FCA 332, at para. 28.\n[12] In Figliola, relying on its decision in Tranchemontagne v. Ontario (Director, Disability Support Program), 2006 SCC 14, the Supreme Court stated that \u201cabsent express language to the contrary, all administrative tribunals have concurrent jurisdiction to apply human rights legislation\u201d (Figliola at para. 45). The Complainant\u2019s appeals to the PSCAB were made pursuant to section 21 of the repealed Public Service Employment Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-33 (the PSEA). Pursuant to section 7.4 of the PSEA, a board established to hear an appeal under section 21 has, in relation to the matter before it, the powers of a commissioner under Part II of the Inquiries Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. 1-11. There is no express language in either the PSEA or the Inquiries Act which removes the concurrent jurisdiction of a PSCAB to apply the Act. Therefore, in this case, the PSCAB had concurrent jurisdiction to decide human rights issues.\n[13] In the present case, the Complainant alleges that he was qualified and not hired during the selection process with the Respondent because \u201cthe Respondent marked the Complainant down in order to ensure there would be no change to the candidates already appointed\u201d. The details of this allegation relate to the assessment of candidates following the corrective measures implemented by the Respondent following the PSCAB\u2019s August 17, 2006 decision. The Complainant also contends that the March 27, 2007 decision of the PSCAB, which examined the assessment of candidates following the corrective measures implemented by the Respondent, was influenced by negative comments regarding the Complainant made by the Respondent. The Complainant\u2019s other allegations relate to the fact that shortly after the expiry of the eligibility list for the selection process with the Respondent, the Complainant continued to seek applicants with the Complainant\u2019s qualifications.\n[14] In the employment context, in cases where a Complainant alleges to have been refused employment on a prohibited ground of discrimination, a prima facie case has been described as requiring proof of the following elements:\na) that the complainant was qualified for the particular employment;\nb) that the complainant was not hired; and\nc) that someone no better qualified but lacking the distinguishing feature which is the gravamen of the human rights complaint (ie. race, color etc.) subsequently obtained the position.\n(See Shakes v. Rex Pak Limited (1982), 3 C.H.R.r. D\/1001 at p. D\/1002 [Shakes])\n[15] Applying the Shakes analysis to the Complainant\u2019s allegations regarding the selection process, there does not appear to be a dispute that the Complainant was qualified, but not hired, for the selection process. However, the Complainant must also provide proof that someone no better qualified, but lacking the distinguishing feature of race, color and sex, subsequently obtained the position. The Complainant\u2019s proof in this regard is that he was \u201cmarked down\u201d in order to ensure there would be no change to the candidates already appointed. The Complainant made essentially the same allegation in his second appeal to the PSCAB: that he was marked unreasonably hard causing loss of points on some questions. The PSCAB\u2019s March 27, 2007 decision reviewed the written exams of all the successful candidates, including the Complainant, and was satisfied that the assessment of the candidates was done in a fair and equitable manner. Although the Complainant did not allege that he was the victim of discrimination before the PSCAB, if the Tribunal were to examine the Complainant\u2019s allegations regarding the assessment of candidates during the selection process, it would have to perform essentially the same analysis that the PSCAB did in its March 27, 2007 decision: comparing the exams of all the successful candidates with that of the Complainant\u2019s to determine if the assessment was done in a fair and equitable manner. While the Complainant now claims that the PSCAB\u2019s March 27, 2007 decision was influenced by negative comments regarding the Complainant made by the Respondent, the Tribunal\u2019s role is not to \u201c ...judicially review\u201d another tribunal\u2019s decision, or to reconsider a legitimately decided issue in order to explore whether it might yield a decision, or to reconsider a legitimately decided issue in order to explore whether it might yield a different outcome\u201d (Figliola at para. 38). Before the PSCAB, the Complainant had an opportunity to present his case regarding the assessment of candidates during the selection process. Therefore, it does not make sense to expend public and private resources on the re-litigation of what is essentially the same allegation.\n[16] In the result, I hereby allow the Respondent\u2019s motion that documents relating to the assessment of candidates for the selection process are not relevant to the present Complaint and the Tribunal will not receive such evidence pertaining to the Complainant\u2019s assessment for the selection process. In short, I will not hear or receive evidence on whether or not the Complainant was marked harder than other candidates in the selection process.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

The Respondent has not established that the prima facie discriminatory conduct did not occur as alleged or was non-discriminatory. 15\nIV......... Remedies. 33\nV........... Order 39\nI. Complaint and Background [1] The Complainant, Ms. Heather Lynn Grant, filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) on January 10, 2008. The Complainant alleged that her employer, Manitoba Telecom Services Inc. (the Respondent or MTS), engaged in a discriminatory practice within the meaning of section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the CHRA) when it decided to terminate her employment, choosing to retain a more junior employee, based on the Complainant\u2019s negative performance appraisals. The Complainant alleges that the negative comments in the performance appraisals were linked to her disability, type II diabetes. After reviewing its report and submissions in response to the report, the Commission decided, pursuant to section 41(1) of the CHRA, to deal only with the alleged termination of employment, including the Complainant\u2019s February 2006 and January 2007 performance assessments. On December 30, 2009, pursuant to section 44(3)(a) of the CHRA, the Commission requested that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) inquire into the complaint.\n[2] The Commission did not participate at the hearing that took place on November 1, 2 and 5, 2010 and on February 7 to 11, 2011.\nII. Facts [3] After having carefully reviewed all of the submissions and evidence provided by the parties, including the Agreed Statement of Facts, my findings of fact are as follows.\n[4] The Complainant was employed by MTS for 26 years until she was laid off on February 19, 2007.\n[5] From 2001 to February 19, 2007, the Complainant worked for MTS as a Regional Account Support Representative (RASR). From 2003 to the date of her termination on February 19, 2007, the Complainant worked under the supervision of Ann Ukrainec. During that last period, her performance was formally evaluated by the Respondent (per Ms. Ukrainec) on an annual or semi-annual basis using a document called Partnering for Performance and Results (PP&R or Performance Appraisal). PP&Rs are used by the Respondent as a means of evaluating and recording the performance of MTS employees. Year round, an employee\u2019s immediate supervisor could add comments to the document.\n[6] During her years of service at MTS, the Complainant was a member of the Telecommunications Employees Association of Manitoba (the Union or TEAM) and was governed by a collective bargaining agreement negotiated by TEAM and MTS (the Collective Agreement).\n[7] On August 19, 2005, the Complainant was diagnosed with high blood sugar levels by her physician, Dr. Barry Van Jaarsveld of the Bethesda Hospital in Steinbach, Manitoba. Subsequently, around September 2005, the Complainant was diagnosed with type II diabetes.\n[8] The 2008 Canadian Diabetes Association Clinical Practice Guidelines define diabetes as a fasting blood sugar greater or equal to 7.0 mmol\/L or casual plasma glucose greater or equal to 11.1 mmol\/L and, symptoms of diabetes or two-hour plasma glucose in a 75mg oral glucose tolerance test greater or equal to 11.1 mmol\/L. Blood sugars are measured as instant values, present at a precise moment in time, and as average values measured over an approximate 90-day period of time. Instant values are measured in a laboratory on a venous sample. Capillary blood sugar values are taken by patients on a home blood glucose monitor. The glycosylated hemoglobin or HbA1C test provides information about blood sugars over the previous three-month period of time. Symptoms of elevated blood sugars include, but are not limited to: thirst, increased hunger, frequent urination, urinary tract infections, recurring yeast infections, blurred vision, frequent urination at night, weight loss, dry mouth, malaise, poor healing, infection, fatigue, altered mental status including agitation, unexplained irritability, inattention, extreme lethargy or confusion. Many symptoms are related to glucose loss in urine. Though the threshold for urine glucose secretion varies, on average blood sugar levels of glucose over 12 mmol\/L are associated with urine glucose loss and symptoms of hyperglycemia. Blood sugar levels can be brought into the normal range by a combination of the following treatments: following a diabetic diet, weight loss to ideal body weight, following a regular exercise program, adherence to oral medication or prescribed insulin, and changing lifestyle to reduce stressors. Blood sugar levels can sometimes spike with the influence of illness, infection or stress even if the condition is well managed. These spikes will not automatically show up on a 90 days test, such as an HbA1C.\n[9] On September 26 and on October 13, 18 and 24, 2005, the Complainant again visited her physician, Dr. Van Jaarsveld. After the October 24, 2005 visit, Dr. Van Jaarsveld advised the Respondent in writing that the Complainant was unable to work from October 25 until November 30, 2005 for medical reasons. Dr. Van Jaarsveld mentioned that the Complainant was a newly diagnosed diabetic and that, due to stress she was experiencing at work, she was unable to control her blood sugar levels. He added that there was a possibility for an extension of that time-off period.\n[10] From October 25 to November 30, 2005, the Complainant took a health leave from her employment with the Respondent. The Respondent hired an independent Return to Work Coordinator, Des Hathaway, to assist the Complainant in returning to work by serving as a liaison between the Complainant, her doctor and the Respondent, both during her time off and after she returned to work. Des Hathaway was in regular communication with the Complainant, the Complainant\u2019s doctor, and the Respondent (per Ms. Ukrainec). On December 29, 2005, Des Hathaway prepared a brief one page report for the Respondent wherein he stated Dr. Van Jaarsveld\u2019s opinion that the Complainant is capable of returning to work without restriction; at full capacity at the present time; and, without special needs or accommodations to support her recovery and safe return to work. On November 30, 2005, Des Hathaway wrote to Ann Ukrainec stating that the Complainant was returning to work on December 1; however, due to her medical condition and the condition being uncontrollable, if she were to return to the same situation she left, there would be a high risk of her condition worsening again.\n[11] The Complainant returned to work on December 1, 2005.\n[12] On March 14, 2006, Dr. Van Jaarsveld wrote again to the Respondent to communicate that he understood the Complainant was under a lot of stress in her workplace environment. He mentioned that it did not appear that the workload was affecting her condition. Dr. Van Jaarsveld wrote that stress was a serious trigger for her illness and strongly recommended transferring the Complainant to Brandon headquarters so that she could be close to her family and her friends to have a strong support network.\n[13] Although a transfer to Brandon headquarters was not granted at first by her supervisor, Ann Ukrainec, once the Complainant received the support of her union, the transfer was approved. Ann Ukrainec signed off on the Complainant\u2019s transfer to Brandon with the condition that the Complainant address potential issues of conflict in a manner that enables her to successfully support Sales Staff within a challenging team environment.\n[14] Around April 13, 2006, the Complainant was transferred from Steinbach to Brandon; both cities are in Manitoba. Despite the transfer, the Complainant remained working under the supervision of Ann Ukrainec.\n[15] In 2005 and 2006, the Complainant received negative and critical comments in her PP&Rs from her supervisor, Ann Ukrainec.\n[16] On October 2, 2006, the Respondent announced a major downsizing initiative. As part of the downsizing initiative, the Respondent offered TEAM employees a Voluntary Retirement Incentive Program (VRIP). The VRIP allowed employees the option of resigning their position in return for compensation.\n[17] Seventy-seven TEAM employees voluntarily offered to take the VRIP and 73 offers were accepted by the Respondent.\n[18] After the VRIP initiative, due to market pressures, the Respondent decided it needed to continue to reduce its Manitoba workforce. An additional 35 positions in the Corporate Sales Department were targeted for lay-off by MTS. Senior management within the Corporate Sales Department were tasked with determining how it would reduce the number of employees in the Department. For RASR positions, it was determined that up to three positions could be eliminated without detrimentally impacting service to customers. The Brandon region was oversubscribed, and had two employees working as RASRs: the Complainant and Sharon Horner. MTS decided that one of the two would be laid-off.\n[19] Article 26.03.1 of the Collective Agreement addresses how an employee in a multi-incumbent position is to be selected for lay-off:\n\u201cIn the case of multi-incumbent positions, where there are no differences between incumbents on the basis of skill, ability, performance, qualifications, and headquarters, the junior incumbent, according to Net Credited Service (NCS) date shall be laid off first.\u201d\n[20] In the Agreed Statement of Facts provided by the parties, it states that article 26.03.1 of the Collective Agreement calls for a comparison of the skill, ability, performance, qualifications and headquarters of employees in multi-incumbent positions. A selection committee (lay-off committee) composed of non-union members, Brian Arnal, Vice-President, Sales, and Larry Goerzen, Director, Sales, was charged with selecting employees for layoff. The lay-off committee proceeded in reviewing the Complainant\u2019s personal file, including performance appraisals and did the same for Sharon Horner. They compared both incumbents\u2019 skills, abilities, qualifications and performance. They also interviewed their respective immediate manager, which in the case of the Complainant was Ann Ukrainec. The lay-off committee chose to lay-off the Complainant and to retain Sharon Horner, although the Complainant was the more senior employee. The basis of the lay-off committee\u2019s decision was that Sharon Horner\u2019s performance was superior to that of the Complainant.\n[21] Upon the lay-off committee\u2019s conclusion, Don Rooney (Director of Labour Relations), requested that Martin Shelest, who then worked in MTS\u2019 Human Resources Department, conduct an independent comparison of the Complainant and Ms. Horner without speaking to anyone. Mr. Shelest completed the review and informed Don Rooney that he was of the opinion that based on the criteria outlined in article 26.03.1 of the Collective Agreement, the Complainant should be laid off before Ms. Horner.\n[22] On February 28, 2007, TEAM filed a grievance on the Complainant\u2019s behalf alleging that MTS breached article 26 of the Collective Agreement. The substance of the grievance was that the Complainant was improperly laid off in that she had greater skills, abilities and qualifications than at least one other employee who was not laid off and who held an equivalent position as the Complainant.\n[23] TEAM referred the grievance to an arbitration hearing. The grievance was withdrawn at the pre-hearing stage without prejudice to the Complainant\u2019s rights under the CHRA.\nIII. Law and Analysis [24] At the outset of this analysis, it bears mentioning that, during the hearing in this case, numerous objections were made by the Respondent and several from the Complainant. Some were dealt with in writing, others viva voce on record at the hearing and others were taken under reserve. The objections under reserve were all examined and the ones that are determinative on the outcome of this case are individually addressed in the analysis of this decision. Other objections that are not determinative on the outcome of this decision have been examined according to the probative value of the evidence that entered under reserve and will not be individually dealt with in the decision. Nevertheless, all objections were noted and taken into consideration in weighing the evidence submitted.\nA. The Complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination [25] The complainant in a proceeding before the Tribunal must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is \u201c...one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent\u201d (Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Simpsons Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at para. 28). In establishing a prima facie case, it is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue. It is sufficient that the discrimination be but one basis for the employer\u2019s actions or decisions (see Holden v. Canadian National Railway Co. (1990), 112 N.R. 395 (F.C.A.); and, Canada (Attorney General) v. Uzoaba, [1995] 2 F.C. 569). However, allegations made by a complainant have to be credible in order to support a conclusion that a prima facie case exists (see Dhanjal v. Canada (Human Rights Commission) (1997), 139 FTR 37 (F.C.)). In Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 at para. 38481 (CHRT), the Tribunal stated:\n\u201cDiscrimination is not a practice which one would expect to see displayed overtly; in fact, there are rarely cases where one can show by direct evidence that discrimination is purposely practiced.\u201d\n[26] A tribunal should therefore consider all circumstances to determine if there exists a \u201csubtle scent of discrimination\u201d. The jurisprudence recognizes the difficulty in proving allegations of discrimination by way of direct evidence.\n[27] To make a decision in this first step, the Tribunal must limit itself to analyzing only the testimonial and documentary evidence filed by the Complainant. It must disregard the evidence submitted by the Respondent (see Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204 at para. 22 [Lincoln]). Fundamentally, however, the Complainant in this case must establish a link between her disability and the employer\u2019s decision to terminate her employment (see Roopnarine v. Bank of Montreal, 2010 CHRT 5 at para. 49).\n[28] According to the Complainant, the symptoms of her disability negatively affected her performance at work. Although aware of her disability, the Respondent negatively assessed her performance in her PP&Rs without considering the effects of her disability on her performance. As her PP&Rs were used to compare her performance with that of another employee for the purpose of determining who would be laid-off, the Complainant alleges that her disability was a factor in the Respondent\u2019s decision to refuse to continue to employ her. The Complainant also alleges that she was specifically targeted for lay-off because of her disability. In this regard, she claims that the Respondent has a history of targeting disabled employees for lay-off; and, therefore, her lay-off based on performance was a pretext for discrimination. On this basis, the Complainant alleges that the Respondent has breached section 7 of the CHRA. This section provides:\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[29] The Complainant lives with a condition, type II diabetes. Disability is included amongst the prohibited grounds of discrimination set out in section 3 of the CHRA, and is defined in section 25 as \u201cany previous or existing mental or physical disability\u201d. Being a physical disability, diabetes is encompassed by the definition of disability in the CHRA. In the present case, the fact that the Complainant has a disability was not disputed. Rather, the issue at hand is about establishing a nexus between the Complainant\u2019s disability and her lay-off. In other words, was the Complainant\u2019s disability a factor that influenced the outcome of the Respondent\u2019s decision to lay her off?\n[30] When the VRIP was completed, the employer still wanted to further downsize its workforce and proceeded with a layoff process designed to eliminate a position in Brandon where the Complainant was working after she was transferred. Two employees, the Complainant and Sharon Horner, occupied RASR positions, one of which was targeted for lay off.\n[31] To decide who would be laid off in Brandon, the employer considered both the incumbents\u2019 PP&Rs to establish if there was a difference between the performances of the two incumbents. The Complainant had negative comments in her 2005 and 2006 PP&Rs, which negatively impacted the assessment of the Complainant\u2019s performance for the purpose of determining who would be laid off.\n[32] According to the Complainant, before the diagnosis of her diabetic condition, her PP&Rs were positive and the negative comments found in her 2005 and 2006 PP&Rs are linked to her disability. The Complainant\u2019s physician reports contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts mention that she was having difficulty controlling her blood glucose levels due to stress, which resulted in a health leave from October 25 until November 30, 2005. Later, on March 16, 2006, the same treating physician, Dr. Van Jaarsveld, wrote that stress was a serious trigger for the Complainant\u2019s illness and that she was experiencing stress in her workplace, especially with her boss. The two medical reports mention the negative effects of stress on the Complainant\u2019s disability and correspond to the same period when the negative PP&Rs were written. The argument made by the Respondent that the physician was not called as a witness before the Tribunal, therefore no weight should be placed on the medical reports, has no merit since the reports were incorporated in the Agreed Statement of Facts and the March 16, 2006 report also formed the basis for the Complainant\u2019s transfer to Brandon.\n[33] Lori D. Berard, Registered Nurse, (Nurse manager, Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, Health Sciences Centre Winnipeg, Diabetes research Group, Appointed staff, University of Manitoba, Department of Medicine Section of Endocrinology) provided expert testimony before the Tribunal concerning her view of the Complainant\u2019s health and the impact it had on her performance at work. Ms. Berard prepared a report at the Complainant\u2019s request for the purpose of these proceedings that mentions:\nIt is well understood that the onset of diabetes is not immediate and drastic. Type 2 diabetes is often present for 6-9 years before the diagnosis is made.\nThe diagnosis of type II diabetes can cause stress, anxiety, anger, guilt and fear. Patients can go through the stages of loss (Denial and isolation; Anger: Bargaining: Depression and Acceptance) while being encouraged to make healthy lifestyle changes, monitor blood glucose levels and begin taking medication. As reference in the Psychological Aspects of Diabetes Chapter Canadian Diabetes Association Clinical Practice guidelines 2008: \u201csignificant behavioral demands and challenging psychological factors affect nearly all aspects of diabetes management and subsequent diabetes control. Psychological issues related to the diagnosis and\/or self care demands may present anywhere on a continuum from impairment in quality of life clinically depressive and\/or anxiety disorders. Symptoms associated with dealing with a chronic illness- \u201cThe Vicious Symptom Cycle\u201d from Living a Healthy Life with Chronic conditions include; Disease-tense muscles-pain-stress\/anxiety-difficult emotions-depression-fatigue-(\u2026.) Impact factors: Stress can contribute to elevated blood glucose levels. Unhealthy lifestyle choices such as obesity, improper eating habits and lack of activity can lead to increasing blood glucose levels\u201d.\n[34] According to Ms. Berard, the Complainant has made significant efforts to improve her health to the point of becoming a very healthy individual. However, the expert stated that stress can contribute to elevated blood sugar levels. She mentioned that:\nIt is documented in medical records that the Complainant was experiencing stress during the initial phase post diagnosis of diabetes and having difficulty controlling her glucose levels which resulted in a leave of absence end of 2005.\n[35] Ms. Berard examined the Complainant\u2019s PP&R from 2005 and made the following comments:\nAppear to have lost focus on the task at hand, difficulty with relationships and work ethics could be consistent with altered mental status with uncontrolled diabetes and the stress of diabetes.\n[36] Ms. Berard also analyzed the Complainant\u2019s 2006 PP&R:\nAppears to be regaining some initiative to the job at hand-continues to have difficulty with being harsh and crewd (sic) which requires improvement and identification that seems to have mood swings that take her to a few good days to wanting isolation. While it appears her diabetes is well managed by this time it is possible that she is having difficulty coping and symptoms of depression.\n[37] There are at least three points in time where results showed that the Complainant\u2019s blood glucose levels were measured to be above 12 mmol\/L (high): on August 19 2005, September 7, 2005 and September 26, 2005. There is an HbA1C test, taken October 13, 2005, that indicates that the Complainant had average elevated blood sugars over a three month time period (July 2005 to October 2005). There are also indications that the Complainant had some elevated blood sugar levels and uncontrolled type II diabetes as of November 30, 2005 even if she was diagnosed previously and, was undergoing treatment. Moreover, Ms. Berard mentioned in her testimony that even if an HbA1C is normal, it does not mean that there was not any daily changes in the blood glucose levels because spikes in a given day will not show up on that type of test.\n[38] I find that both the treating physician, who examined and was following the Complainant\u2019s progress, and the expert, Lori Berard, established that the Complainant was under stress which affected her blood sugar levels. Lori Berard stated that symptoms of elevated blood sugar levels include fatigue, altered mental status including agitation, unexplained irritability, inattention, extreme lethargy or confusion. I find that the expert was able to show a nexus more probable than not between stress at work impacting the Complainant\u2019s blood sugar levels and the Complainant\u2019s negative behaviour described in the 2005 and 2006 PP&Rs.\n[39] At the time when the Complainant was on sick leave on the advice of her Doctor, Ann Ukrainec wrote in the Complainant\u2019s 2005 PP&R:\nin the year end review target: not met: Communication within Steinbach team is still an issue and differences have not been brought out as Heather is finding it difficult as she sees no problem. One on one sessions with the account managers did not continue through last quarter as requested by immediate manager which only delays issues that need to be addressed.\n[40] On March 8, 2006, the Complainant spoke with Ann Ukrainec in an attempt to address her performance issues and followed up the conversation with suggested changes to her PP&Rs in an email to her supervisor. The Complainant expressed that the PP&R comments should be changed to reflect her health issues. The email also states that any lack of communication with her immediate team was due to her illness and in following her doctor\u2019s instructions that she reduce stress to improve her health. Ann Ukrainec, added only the following comment concerning the Complainant that addresses the one on one sessions, which was placed at page 9 of 9 of the 2005 PP&R without any other explanation:\nHeather was away on a health leave from Oct 25th to Dec 2nd. In the beginning of 2005 Heather had a huge desire to make a move and to work in another area that she felt would help her grow and keep her busy. This lasted until mid summer and then a deterioration of Heather\u2019s overall outlook has changed to a dislike and shut down of her communication with her immediate team. Finds it difficult to communicate to her immediate team does not want to be in conflict of any kind to share her inner feelings to help others understand what is going on with the changes team is seeing in her.\n[41] This statement is consistent with how the Complainant described her interactions with people following her doctor\u2019s recommendation that she avoid stressful situations, such as conflict of any kind to share her inner feelings. This is also consistent with how the Complainant described the effects of her condition following her diagnosis and the reasons why she needed time off from work.\n[42] For the purpose of determining whether there was a nexus between the Complainant\u2019s disability and her assessed performance at work, I did not make my findings on the basis of some of the arguments made by the Complainant relating to alleged states of depression, medication and menstrual cycle for two reasons: these facts were in dispute and I did not have sufficient evidence before me to make a finding on them. I made my findings regarding the nexus between the disability and the documented performance in the Complainant\u2019s Performance Appraisals on the basis of two main pieces of evidence:\n(1) Dr. Van Jaarsveld\u2019s medical reports corroborating the information tendered by the Complainant\u2019s expert witness about stress having a negative impact on controlling blood sugar levels;\n(2) Ms. Lori Berard\u2019s testimony, which was credible, especially given the fact that she did not make any absolute statements such as always and never, but rather she used terms like \u201cmay have caused or consistent with\u201d. She was cautious and objective and appeared to possess an extensive knowledge, not only about the disability and its treatments, but on the day to day challenges faced by persons with type II diabetes. In addition, she has expertise in training people to face these challenges. The evidence adduced by the Complainant has established that it is more probable than not that at the time the Complainant received her bad performance appraisals, she was experiencing stress in the workplace, which aggravated her diabetic condition, resulting in performance issues.\n[43] Given the above, I find that the Complainant\u2019s disability, type II diabetes, was at least one of the factors that contributed to her receiving negative comments in her 2005 and 2006 PP&Rs. The manager, in writing comments in the PP&Rs, did not take into account the effect of the Complainant\u2019s disability on her performance. The 2005 and 2006 PP&Rs were used by the Respondent to compare the performance of the Complainant and Sharon Horner for the purposes of determining who would be laid off.\n[44] With regard to the Complainant\u2019s allegation that she was specifically targeted for lay-off because of her disability, she contends that after her transfer to Brandon, Ann Ukrainec was keeping track of her. To that effect, the Complainant refers to the fact that Ann Ukrainec wrote a report regarding the Complainant\u2019s negative performance and submitted it to Don Rooney on November 9, 2006. The report was requested by Larry Goerzen, just after the Respondent had announced it would be reducing staff and just after the time limit for accepting the voluntary retirement incentive package had expired. The email gives a summary of Ann Ukrainec\u2019s perspective of the Complainant\u2019s history of bad performance and communication problems. While this report may indicate that the Complainant was being targeted for layoff because of her performance, there is no indication in the report that her disability was the reason she was being targeted. If anything, the report again supports the allegation that the Respondent did not take into account the effect of the Complainant\u2019s disability on her performance.\n[45] The Complainant also relies on the testimony of Larry Trach (Business Manager for TEAM) to support her allegation that she was specifically targeted for lay-off because of her disability. Mr. Trach testified that it was the first time in MTS\u2019s history that it preceded with lay-offs after successfully meeting its staff reduction goals through a VRIP. According to Mr. Trach, it was bad faith to proceed with lay-offs, because the union convinced some of the employees who were close to retirement to use the VRIP to save jobs for younger employees. In the end, an additional nine TEAM members were laid off, including the Complainant. As a result, Mr. Trach claims that TEAM felt betrayed. While proceeding with the lay-offs after the VRIP may have been viewed by TEAM as being in bad faith, there is no sufficient indication in Mr. Trach\u2019s testimony that the Complainant was targeted for lay-off because of her disability. Rather, the bad faith conduct Mr. Trach refers to seems to be related to the labour relations between the union and the employer, as opposed to discriminatory conduct on behalf of the employer.\n[46] Mr. Trach also testified that, in determining who would be laid off between the Complainant and Ms. Horner, it was the first time MTS compared the skill, ability, performance, qualifications, and headquarters of incumbents. According to Mr. Trach, MTS\u2019 usual practice was to just lay-off the junior employee. Article 26.03.1 specifically provides for laying off the more junior incumbent. However, as the parties stated in the Agreed Statement of Facts, that is provided there are no differences between the incumbents on the basis of skill, ability, performance, qualifications, and headquarters. In this case, the employer found that there was a difference between the performance of the two incumbents chosen for lay-off. Without more, I fail to see how the employer targeted the Complainant for lay-off because of her disability simply by not choosing the more junior incumbent.\n[47] Finally, the Complainant contends that following its downsizing initiative, MTS hired 39 additional sales personnel. The Complainant contends that the Respondent was training employees in the company as new RASRs about a month after she was laid-off; and, she contends she was not recalled pursuant to the recall provision in the Collective Agreement. However, aside from making this allegation, and without limiting the type of evidence the Complainant could have led, little information was provided on the nature of the 39 hires, except that the Respondent hired them to work outside Manitoba; whether the Complainant should have been recalled; whether other employees were recalled; or, most importantly, how discrimination factored into the employer\u2019s decision. Again, without a discriminatory element, this seems to be a labour relations issue between the union and the employer, as opposed to discriminatory conduct. As a result, I find I do not have sufficient evidence before me to substantiate this allegation at the prima facie stage.\n[48] Based on the above, the Complainant has not established a prima facie case that she was targeted for lay-off because of her disability or that the Respondent\u2019s decision to lay-off employees was a pretext for discrimination. However, on a prima facie basis, the Complainant has established that her disability had an effect on her performance at work and that the Respondent, although aware of her disability, did not consider the effects of her disability in negatively reviewing her performance. As the Complainant\u2019s performance and Performance Appraisals formed the basis of the Respondent\u2019s decision to lay her off, there is a nexus between the Complainant\u2019s disability and the loss of her employment. Therefore, the Complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination pursuant to section 7(a) of the CHRA as it appears that her disability was a factor in the Respondent\u2019s decision to refuse to continue to employ her.\nB. The Respondent has not established that the prima facie discriminatory conduct did not occur as alleged or was non-discriminatory [49] Once a prima facie case is established, the Respondent has an opportunity to demonstrate that the alleged discrimination did not occur as alleged or was not a discriminatory practice under the CHRA (see Maillet v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 CHRT 48 at para. 4; and, section 15 of the CHRA).\n[50] The Respondent\u2019s position is that the prima facie discriminatory conduct did not occur as alleged. The Respondent contends that the symptoms associated with the Complainant\u2019s disability did not affect her work performance or her PP&Rs. According to the Respondent, the Complainant\u2019s PP&Rs show a history of performance issues at work that are unrelated to the symptoms of her diabetic condition. As a result, the Respondent contends it fairly assessed the Complainant in the lay-off process and was justified in laying-off the Complainant based on the superior performance record of the other incumbent considered for lay-off.\nExpert evidence\n[51] The Respondent contends that the Complainant\u2019s symptoms relating to her disability did not have an impact on her performance. In support of this contention and to respond to the Complainant\u2019s expert evidence on type II diabetes and its symptoms provided by Ms. Berard, the Respondent brought forward Dr. Elizabeth Salamon, M.D., F.R.C.P. (C), endocrinologist.\n[52] Dr. Salamon stated that blood sugars vary throughout the day, in everyone. Diabetes is not diagnosed unless blood sugar is over 11.2 mmol\/L. Dr. Salamon stated that these normal variations in blood sugar levels are not known to cause the type of symptoms attributed in the Complainant\u2019s case.\n[53] Dr. Salamon agreed on the general information provided by Ms. Berard on diabetes. However, in her report prepared on behalf of the Respondent for the purpose of this hearing, she states that mood swings, attitude issues and poor work ethics are not symptoms of elevated blood sugars. According to Dr. Salamon, although blood sugar levels can be normalized within minutes, different symptoms may take hours to days to resolve. Dr. Salamon wrote: \u201cOnce blood sugars have stabilized into the normal range there are often no symptoms of hyperglycemia. Blood sugars consistently in the normal range should not cause symptoms of hyperglycemia\u201d.\n[54] According to Dr. Salamon, the provided medical record starts from Ms. Grant\u2019s emergency room visit subsequent to the physician\u2019s office visits starting in September 2005. There is no information about her condition prior to this time. Dr. Salamon stated that based on the provided medical record, it is not possible to determine if the Complainant had symptoms of diabetes prior to her diagnosis. Dr. Salamon mentions the Complainant may have had symptoms in September and possibly in August 2005. She also mentions in her report that the Complainant was most likely asymptomatic part of October, November, and December 2005. Dr. Salamon finds there are elevated blood sugar levels in September 2005 - above 12; an HbA1C in October 2005 was elevated, suggesting that there were elevated blood sugars for three months prior. Another HbA1C by January 6, 2006 was normal at 6.2 % suggesting that most of the blood sugars in the three month period prior to January were normal. Dr. Salamon also mentions the Complainant\u2019s self-reported blood sugars were in the normal or near normal range by January 12, 2006 as stated in the record and reiterated by Ms. Berard.\n[55] On the possibility of the Complainant having spikes in her blood sugar levels, Dr. Salamon mentions in her second report (Following a line of questioning by the Complainant to her expert, an objection had been made that some of the questions were not in the expert\u2019s report. The Complainant\u2019s expert testimony was adjourned, remaining under oath. The Complainant provided an amended report and Dr. Salamon reviewed that amended report and provided her answers in a second report prior to her testimony and prior to the cross-examination of the Complainant\u2019s expert): \u201cMy review of Ms. Grant\u2019s medical record shows no \u201cspikes\u201d of blood glucose levels. Though on presentation to the emergency room she was found to have an elevated blood sugar, that sugar is the highest on the record provided\u201d.\n[56] Dr. Salamon testified that an employer can accommodate an employee with diabetes: \u201fby allowing time off to see a physician and other health care team appointments, ensure an opportunity to take regular meal breaks, and limit shift work if possible or at the very least provide a reasonable rotation of shift hours\u201d. Dr. Salamon also mentions: \u201fwhen possible, not having the diabetic work unexpected overtime hours where possible, and when possible allow the diabetic to live where outside work and family supports are available if they are deemed to be helpful. These actions would help anyone improve blood sugar levels. At the request of the patient and her physician, MTS did arrange a transfer of her to another office where she would be closer to family supports\u201d.\n[57] According to Dr. Salomon, people with type II diabetes can accomplish anything and, she listed numerous names of known people such as athletes, singers, entertainers, politicians and she listed professions such as doctors, teachers, and lawyers. She mentions they all perform their jobs well. These answers on how people live with type II diabetes and the hardship they might face are not convincing. I understand the point she is trying to make, that having diabetes does not stop an individual from living life fully; however, she did not suggest she knew these people or their medical files. Even though the people she referred to can do many things, we have no information on what happened when they were diagnosed, how they manage stress and its impacts on their condition. Even the Complainant was going to work so anyone could say she has type II diabetes, but continues to work. I find that Dr. Salamon\u2019s conclusions regarding how people live with type II diabetes and the hardships they might face are unconvincing and ignore the individual differences between people copping with a diabetic condition. Dr. Salamon even admitted that all things in diabetes are individualized. These types of answers also do not address the psychological or social impacts that type II diabetes may have on a person with that condition.\n[58] After reviewing the Complainant\u2019s PP&Rs, Dr. Salamon denied any link between the Complainant\u2019s performance at work and the symptoms of type II diabetes. Dr. Salamon finds the Complainant to have extremely good control of her blood sugar levels. She notes Dr. Van Jaarsveld describing the Complainant as a \u201fwell controlled diabetic\u201d. On the other hand, she expresses different views than Dr. Van Jaarsveld about the impacts of stress on the Complainant\u2019s condition because she did not find any specific mention about the symptoms in the report. Dr. Salamon admitted she reviewed the medical documentation provided but did not discuss with Dr. Van Jaarsveld about the reports or the Complainant`s condition. Dr. Salamon believes that the communication and relationship issues that the Complainant was having within her team, and the resulting negative comments in her PP&Rs, are not related to elevated blood sugar levels.\n[59] Dr. Salamon stated that the Complainant\u2019s poor performance evaluations on the PP&Rs occurred both when blood sugars were elevated (as per her abnormal HbA1C) and normal (as per her normal HbA1C). The evaluations do not describe a significant event that could be ascribed to one isolated spike, but recurring behaviour issues that associated with spikes would have reflected in a worsening of her blood sugar control. This is not at all reflected in the improving HbA1C. This suggests that blood sugar levels were not a factor in the poor performance as noted.\n[60] Dr. Salamon mentioned the physician\u2019s notes repeatedly mention that she is stressed by work and at work and that there is no mention of any other common symptoms of hyperglycemia. However, Dr. Salamon admitted that the medical record shows that in November 2005, the Complainant was uncontrolled and that her blood sugar levels were high at the same time she was experiencing stress. This nuances what she had written in her expert report prepared prior to her testimony:\nThough the medical record indicates that Ms. Grant experienced stress described as stress at work during office visits in the fall of 2005, Ms. Grant\u2019s HbA1C continued to fall from an elevated level of 8.6% to a near normal or normal level of 6.2% during this same period of time. The opposite would occur if the stress caused the blood sugars to rise. As there was no corresponding rise in blood sugars to stress:\nThere would be no effect on her ability to perform her duties\nThere would be no relationship to the poor performance documented in the PP&R.\n[61] Although Dr. Salamon\u2019s report states that Ms. Grant may have had symptoms of hyperglycaemia in September and possibly August 2005, she indicated that there is no medical information on which to rely to determine if the Complainant had symptoms prior to August 2005. However, she also stated that an HbA1C test taken in October 2005 was elevated, suggesting that there were elevated blood sugar levels for three months prior. Three months prior to October 2005 would include July 2005. In July 2005 is when the Complainant began receiving comments in her PP&Rs regarding a \u201cshut down\u201d in her communications. Dr. Salamon admitted that when a person experiences symptoms of high blood sugar levels there is often a feeling of being \u201cunwell\u201d that can impact the person with diabetes\u2019 daily life. She also stated that to feel unwell and not want to socialize is a reasonable connection; although this connection would have to be associated with high blood sugar levels. Dr. Salamon testified her patients would not describe the symptoms in detail to her when consulting with her but rather describe their condition as feeling unwell. Dr. Salamon later testified that although the Complainant consulted with her treating physician for feeling unwell, there is no indication in the report about the specific symptoms related to hyperglycemia.\n[62] Dr. Salamon\u2019s report indicates that there are at least three points in time where the Complainant\u2019s blood sugar levels are recorded as being high; and, given the HbA1C test in October 2005, there is an indication that she was experiencing high blood sugar levels in July 2005 as well. After considering Dr. Salamon\u2019s evidence and Ms. Berard\u2019s evidence, I find that a person with a type II diabetes condition can experience communication\/social issues due to the symptoms of their condition especially when under stress, and that the Complainant in this case was experiencing elevated blood sugar levels around the time when communication issues where identified by her employer as having a negative impact on her performance.\nPerformance Appraisals\n[63] The Respondent alleges that the Complainant was not terminated on the basis of her disability but simply because of her poor performance as evidenced by her PP&Rs, which the Respondent contends, are in no way flawed or biased as the Complainant would have us believe.\n[64] I reviewed all of the Complainant\u2019s PP&Rs from 1999 to 2006, which were filed in the Agreed Statement of Facts. Since the Respondent alleges that the Complainant has a history of poor performance, which resulted in her being laid-off, examining the contents of the PP&Rs is relevant and essential to making a proper finding in this case.\n[65] The evidence establishes that the PP&Rs considered in the comparison of the two incumbents for the purpose of lay-off were the 2003 to mid 2006 PP&Rs. Prior to that period, there are very few comments regarding the need for the Complainant to improve her work performance. The following examines in more detail the Complainant\u2019s PP&Rs during the 2003 to mid 2006 period.\n[66] The Complainant\u2019s 2003 PP&R comments, written by Ms. Ukrainec, in sum are:\nHeather is very upfront and is quite confident in her role. Seems self sufficient and demonstrated this through taking ownership of her PC when she needed it upgraded to perform the training requirements of her position.\nHas adapted to changes easily and willingly shares her knowledge and make changes quite readily where necessary.\nWould like to see a stronger work relationship between herself and immediate account manager as this would improve her day to day work environment.\n[67] Although the last comment indicates that a stronger relationship between the Complainant and her account manager would improve her work environment, overall, the comments are positive and there is no indication of performance issues.\n[68] The 2004 PP&R comments contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts state the following:\nDoes participate in meetings and has offered and indicated she can take on extra work. Has also assisted in preparing customer profiles. Has the knowledge and skill to perform her daily tasks and did take on extra projects to help assist the team and immediate manager with account lists information updates.\nHas a good strong relationship with most of the members of the team and always got involved and participated in all team meetings.\n[69] I find this statement shows the Complainant was involved and had a good relationship with most of the members of her team. There is no sufficient indication of performance issues in her 2004 PP&R.\nIs flexible and offered to take on more workload.\nHas a positive attitude towards sharing information and making decisions that effect (sic) her position and the team\u2019s direction.\n[70] In the \u201ccompetency to communicate effectively\u201d section of the Complainant\u2019s 2004 PP&R, Ann Ukrainec wrote:\nAn open, honest and direct communicator who appreciates having clear direction and a chance to interact as a team player.\nUnderstood the concept of a supportive team player to sales and helped drive of whatever she could to help assist with ensuring that sales were closed and billed for the team.\nHas adapted to a ever changing environment and has remained focused and opened to any ideas that has either improved her own skills or knowledge level.\n[71] In her final comments in the 2004 PP&R, Ann Ukrainec wrote:\nHeather is a true supporter of sales and has demonstrated that she is keenly focused on ensuring that our customers are trained and trained well.\nMakes her point and asks questions if understanding isn\u2019t clear the first time.\nAlthough she had differences amongst specific team players, not once did she show any disrespect to the individual even though there may have been disagreement.\n[72] In reviewing the Complainant\u2019s PP&Rs over the years prior to 2005-2006, I find they are positive towards the Complainant. I find that, prior to the Complainant being diagnosed with her disability and going on a health leave and a transfer, her Performance Appraisals indicate that she is positive, communicates effectively and works hard, without indication of performance issues. In 2003 and 2004, the Complainant was also given the opportunity to write her own comments in the PP&Rs, under Ann Ukrainec\u2019s supervision.\n[73] In the 2005 PP&R, under the title mid-year review, around the time the Complainant was diagnosed with type II diabetes, Ann Ukrainec wrote:\nHas had a few issues with communication within immediate team that needs to be addressed. One on one sessions will held (sic) identify and prioritize immediate needs. This is an area of risk that needs to be improved moving forward.\n[74] After the Complainant was diagnosed and went away on her health leave, under the title year-end review in the 2005 PP&R, Ann Ukrainec wrote:\nCommunication within Steinbach team is still an issue and differencies (sic) have not been brought out as Heather is finding it difficult as she sees no problem. One on one sessions with the account managers did not continue through last quarter as requested by immediate manager which only delays issues that need to be addressed. (emphasis added)\n[75] I find this comment is clearly misleading to a person reading the PP&R. The reason why the Complainant was not present at the one on one sessions was because she was on a health leave, being recently diagnosed with diabetes and needing to stabilize her condition. Ann Ukrainec testified that she did not include the fact that the Complainant was on a medical leave from October 25th to December 2nd in the PP&R because health records were kept separate from the PP&Rs. This explanation is not convincing. Not mentioning the fact that health leave was the reason why the Complainant missed the one on one sessions, reflects negatively on the Complainant\u2019s work performance. Without context, the comment appears to indicate that the Complainant is being insubordinate when that is not the case. As mentioned above, after a meeting with the union and the Complainant, Ann Ukrainec agreed to include the fact that the Complainant was on health leave from October 25 to December 2, 2005 in the 2005 PP&R. However, no context regarding the reasons for the leave and the stress the Complainant was experiencing are mentioned; nor is the health leave mentioned as the reasons why the Complainant missed the one on one sessions.\n[76] Ann Ukrainec wrote in the 2005 year-end review this negative comment:\nPuratone- customer not happy with Heather\u2019s support and Loewen Windows finds Heather non supportive at times, moving forward I have asked Loewen Windows to direct any issues to myself in Winnipeg (immediate manager).\nThe Complainant testified she was not made aware of that fact prior to the mention in the PP&R.\n[77] Ann Ukrainec in that same section wrote:\nHas trained an additional customer in December 05 Penner Building center.\nThis occurred upon the Complainant\u2019s return from her health leave.\n[78] Under the 2005 mid-year objective there is a mention: \u201con target\u201d.\n[79] The 2005 year-end objective mentions: Not met. In the second half of the year, the Complainant was absent for over a month.\n[80] In the area of \u201cteam support competency\u201d the 2005 mid-year objective mentions:\nHelped out on the Mega Link Project which resulted in improving the process and providing further insight to what was needed by the ASR\u2019s.\nParticipants and provides feedbacks in team meetings.\nNeeds Currently has a good working knowledge of her immediate position but would like to see a more proactive role to assist the immediate account managers by off loading them in a more positive approach. Target: met.\nto improve communications in direct Steinbach team.\nMoving forward a schedule of meetings need to take place to address all concerns that Heather is experiencing as she is feeling singled out by her team members and not communicating what and how she feels about the situations that are been addressed during meetings that have been held with Steinbach team and immediate manager.\n[81] In the area of \u201cjob knowledge competency\u201d, in the 2005 mid-year review, Ann Ukrainec wrote:\nCurrently has a good working knowledge of her immediate position but would like to see a more proactive role to assist the immediate account managers by off loading them in a more positive approach.\n[82] Under the 2005 year-end review Ann Ukrainec wrote:\nHeather has the knowledge and skill to do an exceptional job but seems reluctant to accommodate her immediate Steinbach team as well as she has indicated her desire not to be the first contact but the last resort with immediate ASR peers. Target: Not met.\n[83] I find this comment is consistent with the fact that the Complainant was trying to reduce stress.\n[84] Under \u201cFocus on the Customer\u201d, in the 2005 year-end review, Ann Ukrainec wrote:\nHeather has failed to remember that her main focus is on her immediate account managers which reside in Steinbach. This relationship needs to be restored and improved upon as it is a direct reflection on her own professional which could and will move into directly impact external customers.\n[85] I find the rest of the comments in the 2005 PP&R are not entered as mid-year or year-end but only as general comments for the entire year. The evidence led before the Tribunal established that the parties could not identify the precise time when comments were entered in the PP&R.\n[86] Under the heading \u201cbeing a team player\u201d, Ann Ukrainec wrote:\nHas a somewhat (sic)relationship with her immediate ASR peer group, relationship with immediate account managers needs to change dramatically in the New Year as this is not a healthy situation for all parties in the regional sales group.\n[87] Ann Ukrainec included the following comment after the Complainant requested her to do so:\n\u201cDid share some information with the rest of her peer group on a process\u201d (emphasis added).\nThe evidence established that the process was named the \u201cUnicorn account\u201d. Ann Ukrainec wrote this comment in the same section that addressed this particular competency and it gives more context and information to the comments, unlike the issue with the 2005 PP&R with regard to the Complainant\u2019s health leave.\n[88] Also in the 2005 PP&R, under the heading \u201cCommunicate effectively\u201d, Ann Ukrainec wrote:\nIn the beginning of 2005 Heather had a huge desire to make a move and to work in another area that she felt would help her grow and keep her busy. This lasted until mid summer and then a deterioration of Heather\u2019s overall outlook has changed to a dislike and shut down of her communication with her immediate team does not want to be in conflict of any kind to share her inter (sic) feelings to help others understand what is going on with the changes team is seeing in her.\n[89] This comment is consistent with the timing of the Complainant\u2019s diagnosis.\n[90] The overall comments from Ann Ukrainec at the last page of the 2005 PP&R are:\nHeather has the capabilities to be one of the strongest ASRS in the regions if she puts her mind into it. Has indicated a desire to move into BCC area which will even be more stressfull (sic) and challenging as their (sic) are 30 account managers with different work habits which maybe a challenge in itself for Heather. The complexity of our business and the workload will continue to increase which requires high performance individuals in Corporate Sales to meet those demands. Heather needs to make a concentrated effort to ensure she wants to be a part of Corporate Sales in a hugh (sic) team environment or move to an area of less demands and less interaction with account managers.\n[91] The 2005 PP&R is finalized on that note in December 2005, even though, as mentioned above, the Complainant disagreed with many comments and addressed a need to explain her disability and the impacts she felt needed to be understood by her manager.\n[92] The 2006 PP&R was reviewed up to mid-year in the lay-off process. Therefore, I will focus on the mid-year review of that PP&R. The Complainant was working the first four months from January to April in Steinbach, and then she was working in Brandon. In this regard, Ann Ukrainec wrote the following comments:\nMoving to Brandon since May 06, Heather has been extremely busy in assisting with taking on 3 account managers to assist with the new hires that have joined our team. She has also taken on an extra month of being team lead so that the new ASRS get a chance to become familiar with their own territories and the team\u2019s expectations.\n[93] There is no mention of the transfer being the result of a recommendation from the Complainant\u2019s treating physician to accommodate her disability and to reduce the effects of stress on her condition. Again, without context, the reader does not understand the extent to which the Complainant\u2019s disability has affected her work environment.\n[94] Under \u201cCustomer satisfaction\u201d in the 2006 mid-year review, Ann Ukrainec wrote:\nFeedback from team members that Heather is in direct contact with daily have indicated that she is being somewhat approachable by most members. Communication with one on one will further improve this area as there is still some concern with responsiveness.\n[95] Under \u201cteam support\u201d in the 2006 mid-year review, Ann Ukrainec wrote:\nThe ASR team has found Heather to be very receptive to their requests and willing to participate.\nIn the area of ensuring that all accounts managers are kept up todate (sic), it has been identified that this is somewhat of a concern at times. (this is a risk area)\nGrading at this time will be on target with the understanding that there will be an improvement for the identified area above.\nHer image and communication while in office need to somewhat improve as at times she is coming across very harsh and crewd with her unsolicited comments (at risk).\nHas taken on the initiative to become more involved with web\/meeting to help her further gain insight into customer one.\nGrating at this time will be on target with understanding that communication needs to improve.\n[96] Although not reviewed in the lay-off process, the 2006 year-end target is marked as \u201fnot met\u201d. However, I still find the year-end appraisal instructive since Ann Ukrainec was interviewed in the lay-off process and mentions her overall impression of the Complainant:\nCustomer service and support has been an ongoing challenge with Heather and the team as she is underperforming the level of expectation that is required by the team and Corporate Sales. She seems to have mood swings that will take her from having a few good days where she has performed to an exceptable (sic) level to many days of wanting to be in isolation of the team and those that needs to work with directly on a daily basis.\nHeather is an individual who is quite capable of performing the ASR Role but over the past year has not been consistent with her performance and continues to demonstrate a barrier between herself and most members of the team. The team has learnt to feel it\u2019s taking up too much time and energy and has impacted them negatively.\nAlthough I have tried on one on one sessions to open discussion with Heather on any issue that she wishes to discuss, she remains in isolation and provides me with one line answers to any questions that are directed to her.\nMy recommendation would be that Heather continue (sic) to seek help with outside professional help to have her talk about what needs to work on to become part of a team as she doesn\u2019t seem to want to be open and honest with her immediate team in the regions.\n[97] As evidence of further communication issues with members of her team, the Respondent also argued that the Complainant had problems with Rob Lagemodiere, a co-worker who was not allowed to be added to the witness list after the hearing had started (see Heather Lynn Grant v. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2011 CHRT 1). I find from the evidence heard from both parties that the problem existed between both individuals. Furthermore, this problem is not sufficient to make an inference that the negative comments in her 2005 and 2006 PP&Rs were indicative of an ongoing performance or communication issue. I do not find this a strong point in the Respondent\u2019s case. If it were, this would have been a major issue discussed in the PP&Rs prior to 2005-2006.\n[98] The Respondent also provided the Tribunal with the testimony of Ann Ukrainec. According to Ms. Ukrainec, she had trouble getting information from the Complainant concerning issues at work. She stated that the Complainant would only give short answers to inquiries and did not say more than: \u201cI guess I will have to change\u201d. However, I find this happened because the Complainant was not being understood by Ms. Ukrainec, and did not feel that any communication would improve the situation. Ms. Ukrainec admitted receiving and reading the email sent by Des Hathaway on November 30, 2005 prior to the Complainant\u2019s return to work on December 1, 2005. Although aware that, if the Complainant returned to work in the same situation that she left, there would be a high risk of her condition worsening again, Ann Ukrainec testified that she did not think she needed to hold back on addressing the Complainant\u2019s performance issues. According to Ann Ukrainec, the Complainant\u2019s behaviour changed and her communication shut down when she was refused a Business Communication Consultant (BCC) position. However, Ms. Ukrainec later testified that she witnessed the Complainant\u2019s communication breakdown and her behaviour change at the time of the Complainant\u2019s diagnosis. Although aware of the Complainant\u2019s condition and her resulting behavioural changes, and notified of the effects of stress on her condition, Ms. Ukrainec did not believe that the Complainant\u2019s disability was having an effect on her performance; to that effect she testified she believed it was an excuse. The fact that the Complainant had to request the help of her union to get a transfer to the Brandon location, when the transfer was recommended by her Doctor as a means of accommodation, also shows the kind of understanding she received from her employer. Before the transfer, in a letter addressed to the Complainant dated April 13 2006 and included in the Agreed Statement of Facts, Ann Ukrainec wrote:\nAs discussed, the purpose of the meeting was to ensure that all parties were of the same understanding with respect to the particulars surrounding your transfer and the company\u2019s expectations going forward. Specifically, your transfer was granted in conjunction with the medical opinion of your Healthcare Practionner, combined with your commitment to proactively address potential issues of conflict in a manner which enables you to successfully support Sales Staff within a challenging team environment. More specifically, you were encouraged and committed to, communicating openly with myself as your manager to overt\/ manage potential issues of conflict going forward.\nTo this end, I look forward to you becoming part of the Brandon sales team and wish you every success in your location.\n[99] This shows that the transfer was treated more like a favour than accommodating the Complainant\u2019s disability. Even though the circumstances of the transfer are not part of the termination of employment, I find it gives context and supports the Complainant\u2019s contention that her disability was not taken seriously by her employer. Ann Ukrainec testified she did not believe the contents of the letter of transfer would cause stress to the Complainant in indicating what their expectations were after the transfer.\n[100] Overall and for the above mentioned reasons and after reviewing the Complainant\u2019s testimony, I prefer it over that of Ann Ukrainec\u2019s.\n[101] The Respondent also argued that the Complainant should have grieved any issue with her PP&Rs and, since she did not, a negative inference should be made. When asked the question if the employer thought that grieving the contents of her PP&Rs would have been stressful for the Complainant, Don Rooney (Director of Labor Relations at MTS) testified that he did not understand why the Complainant would have found it stressful if she had grieved to correct a situation. Mr. Shelest (Human Resources Department) also testified at the hearing. According to him, if notified by a manager of performance issues with an employee, oftentimes the employer would put together an action plan to assist the employee in performing better. However, no action plan was put together to assist the Complainant in improving her performance; nor was her disability considered at this point either. Again, I find Mr. Rooney\u2019s comments and the fact that no action plan was prepared supportive of the Complainant\u2019s contention that her disability was not taken seriously by her employer in addressing her performance issues at work.\n[102] Based on the evidence presented by the Respondent, the conclusion I arrive at from reading the PP&Rs prior to 2005 is that the Complainant did not have performance issues. Although there is an indication in the 2004 PP&R that the Complainant needed a little improvement in her communication with others, nothing appears significant enough to arrive to a conclusion that she had a history of communication issues with members of her team. While communication issues become more apparent in the 2005 and 2006 PP&Rs, these issues coincide with the diagnosis of the Complainant\u2019s disability and her attempts to reduce the impact of stress on her condition. The Complainant tried to address these issues with the Respondent and have her PP&Rs changed, but to the Complainant\u2019s disability was not considered as a factor affecting her performance.\n[103] The purpose of the CHRA is to give effect to the principle that\nall individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices\u2026\n(Section 2 of the CHRA)\n[104] In the same vein with this principle, the Covenant on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, adopted on 13 December 2006 during the sixty-first session of the General Assembly by resolution A\/RES\/61\/106 signed by Canada on March 30th, 2007 and ratified by Canada on March 11, 2010, in its Preamble section h mentions:\nRecognizing also that discrimination against any person on the basis of disability is a violation of the inherent dignity and worth of the human person.\n[105] In the employment context, to ensure that all employees have an opportunity equal with other employees, an employer must take reasonable measures short of undue hardship to accommodate an employee\u2019s needs (see Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud. [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970, at para. 16 [Renaud]). Although the scope of the duty to accommodate varies according to the characteristics of each enterprise, the specific needs of each employee and the specific circumstances in which the decision is to be made, throughout the employment relationship, an employer must make an effort to accommodate the employee (see McGill University Health Centre (Montreal General Hospital) v. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l'H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, 2007 SCC 4, at para. 22). In examining whether an employer has discharged its duty to accommodate an employee, \u201cit may often be useful as a practical matter to consider separately, first, the procedure, if any, which was adopted to assess the issue of accommodation\u201d (British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. British Columbia Government and Service Employees' Union (B.C.G.S.E.U.) (Meiorin Grievance), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 66). In the case of employees with a disability, the procedural aspect of the duty to accommodate involves obtaining all relevant information about the employee\u2019s disability, including information about the employee\u2019s current medical condition, prognosis for recovery, ability to perform job duties and capabilities for alternate work (see ADGA Group Consultants Inc. v. Lane et al., 91 O.R. (3d) 649 (Ont. Sup. Ct. J., Div. Ct.), at para. 107 [Lane]). According to the Court in Lane:\nThe term undue hardship requires respondents in human rights cases to seriously consider how complainants could be accommodated. A failure to give any thought or consideration to the issue of accommodation, including what, if any, steps could be taken constitutes a failure to satisfy the \"procedural\" duty to accommodate.\n(Lane at para. 107)\n[106] Overall, a person tasked with evaluating the performance of the Complainant, based on interviewing Ann Ukrainec and reading the Complainant\u2019s PP&Rs without any context about the Complainant\u2019s behaviour and disability, would probably conclude that the Complainant was a poor performer. On the other hand, when given the whole context, the findings may be different. The Complainant was not offered any opportunity to explain her behaviour in her PP&Rs, nor to the people in charge of comparing her with Sharon Horner for the lay-off. Although the employer was made aware of the Complainant\u2019s disability and the effects of stress on her condition on various occasions, there is no sufficient evidence to suggest that the Respondent seriously considered whether the Complainant\u2019s disability was affecting her performance at work and how it could accommodate the Complainant in this regard. Rather, the Complainant\u2019s performance was evaluated without seriously considering the effects of her disability on her performance at work. As those Performance Appraisals were used as the basis for laying-off the Complainant, disability factored into the Respondent\u2019s decision to no longer employ her.\n[107] Having considered the Respondent\u2019s evidence and argument, and on the basis of the reasoning above, I find the Respondent has not provided a reasonable explanation for its prima facie discriminatory conduct. Therefore, the Respondent has violated section 7(a) of the CHRA in refusing to continue to employ the Complainant on the basis of her disability.\nIV. Remedies [108] Parties made their final arguments in writing, I reserved jurisdiction to ask any additional question that might arise from their submissions and will address this matter in each of the requested remedies that require further clarification.\n[109] When a complaint under section 7 of the CHRA has been substantiated, the Tribunal has remedial authority to make an order under the terms of sections 53(2), 53(3) and 53(4) of the CHRA.\n[110] The aim of the CHRA is remedial and is \u201c...not aimed at determining fault or punishing conduct\u201d (Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84 at para. 13 [Robichaud]). Rather, the primary focus of the legislation is to \u201c...identify and eliminate discrimination\u201d (Robichaud at para.13). The Tribunal deals with complex and emotional disputes between parties, which demands \u201c...innovation and flexibility on the part of the Tribunal in fashioning effective remedies and the Act is structured so as to encourage this flexibility\u201d (Grover v. Canada (National Research Council - NRC) (1994), 80 F.T.R. 256 (Fed. Ct. TD)). Although the Tribunal has remedial flexibility and discretion under section 53, this discretion is not unlimited. In the context of discussing the limit on the liability for compensation under the CHRA, the Federal Court of Appeal in Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 268 [Chopra], stated:\nThe first limit is that recognized by all members of the Court in Morgan, that is, there must be a causal link between the discriminatory practice and the loss claimed. The second limit is recognized in the Act itself, namely, the discretion given to the Tribunal to make an order for compensation for any or all of wages lost as a result of the discriminatory practice. This discretion must be exercised on a principled basis.\n(Chopra at para.37)\n[111] Stated more generally:\n...orders of a remedial nature must be linked or have a nexus to the lis or subject-matter of the complaint substantiated by the tribunal: the \"four corners of the complaint\" or \"the real subject matter\". The remedy must be commensurate with the breach. The orders also must be reasonable and the remedial discretion exercised in light of the evidence presented.\n(Hughes v. Elections Canada, 2010 CHRT 4 at para.50 [Hughes])\n[112] In implementing remedial orders, the Canadian Human Rights Commission or other parties may be involved in terms of consultation or monitoring. The involvement of other actors recognizes that the Tribunal has an adjudicative role that does not translate well into the technical or task-specific aspects of the implementation of orders often affecting the day-to-day operations of a governmental or corporate respondent (see Hughes at para 51). In consideration of these principles, the following are my reasons with regard to remedying the discrimination in this case.\nLiability of TEAM\n[113] The Respondent attempted to have TEAM added as a respondent to this matter on the basis that it was jointly liable for any discriminatory act. The Tribunal dismissed the Respondent\u2019s request to add TEAM as a respondent, but stated that it was free to make submissions that TEAM was jointly liable (see Heather Lynn Grant v. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2010 CHRT 26). Relying on Renaud, the Respondent argues that TEAM is jointly liable for any discriminatory act arising from the good faith application and administration of the Collective Agreement. However, in this case, the discrimination was not a result of the application of section 26.03.1 of the Collective Agreement. Rather, the finding of discrimination in this case relates to how the Respondent assessed the Complainant\u2019s performance and how those assessments factored into her lay-off. TEAM did not play a role in the assessment of the Complainant\u2019s performance and no sufficient evidence was led to suggest that TEAM was a party to the discrimination. Therefore, there is no basis to hold TEAM jointly liable for the discrimination in this case.\nCompensation for pain and suffering\n[114] The Complainant is seeking $20,000 for the pain and suffering she experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice, pursuant to section 53(2)(e) of the CHRA. The Complainant contends that she should be awarded the maximum amount under this section on the basis that the Respondent has manifestly demonstrated a lack of concern and of understanding of her situation. She experienced a lot of stress, both in the latter stages of her employment with the Respondent and in the course of pursuing this human rights complaint. Finally, the Complainant says she is entitled to the maximum amount on the basis of the deceptive manner in which the Respondent determined the Complainant\u2019s layoff and adduced evidence at the hearing of the complaint.\n[115] When someone endures pain and suffering, there is no amount of money that can remove that pain and suffering from the Complainant. Moral pain related to discrimination is subjective and varies from one individual to another. Psychological scars often take a long time to heal and can affect a person\u2019s self worth. From the point of view of the person that suffered discrimination, large amounts of money should be granted to reflect what they lived through and to provide justice. This being said, when evidence establishes pain and suffering an attempt to compensate for it must be made (See Cruden v. Canadian International Development Agency and Health Canada, 2011 CHRT 13, at para.170). However, $20,000 is the maximum amount that the Tribunal can award under section 53(2)(e) and the Tribunal only awards the maximum amount in the most egregious of circumstances.\n[116] The medical evidence contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts and the Complainant\u2019s testimony established that the Complainant did suffer from stress related to the discrimination. Her employer negatively assessed her performance at a time when she required understanding and accommodation from her employer. Instead, she had to turn to her union for help.\n[117] As a result, I order the Respondent to pay $10,000 for the pain and suffering endured by the Complainant as a result of her termination.\nCompensation for having engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly\n[118] The Complainant is seeking compensation from the Respondent in the amount of $20,000 pursuant to section 53(3) of the CHRA. The Complainant seeks the maximum amount under this section because she wants the Tribunal to send a strong message that the Respondent\u2019s conduct was wholly inappropriate.\n[119] The objective of the CHRA is to remedy discrimination, not punish it (Robichaud at para.13). In order to be wilful or reckless, \u201c\u2026some measure of intent or behaviour so devoid of caution or without regard to the consequences of that behaviour\u201d must be found (Canada (Attorney General) v. Collins, 2011 FC 1168, at para. 33). Again, the award of the maximum amount under this section should be reserved for the very worst cases.\n[120] As outlined in the analysis of the Complainant\u2019s prima facie case, there was not sufficient evidence to indicate that the Complainant was targeted for lay-off because of her disability or that the Respondent intended to discriminate against the Complainant. However, although aware of the Complainant\u2019s disability, the Respondent did not sufficiently consider the effects her disability was having on her conduct at work in evaluating her performance. Nor did it consider the Complainant\u2019s comments in response to the negative Performance Appraisals addressing the same. Essentially, the Respondent was \u201cdevoid of caution\u201d in its duty to at least consider accommodating the Complainant. Given all the circumstances of this case, this Tribunal awards Ms. Grant $10,000.00 under this heading.\nReintegration and wage loss:\n[121] The Complainant is seeking:\n(a) Reinstatement in her position in the same location or to an equivalently rated position in the same location;\n(b) Compensation for lost wages, missed pension contributions, employee share ownership plan lost benefits, variable pay plan lost benefits, group sales lost bonus;\n(c) Reinstatement of her net credited service date and pension (including the Respondent\u2019s contributions from the date of termination to the date of reinstatement).\n[122] The objective here is to place the Complainant, as close as possible, in the state she would have been in had the discrimination not occurred. I will retain jurisdiction and give the parties an opportunity to make submissions on how they wish to address this particular and complex remedy.\nSpecial damages:\n[123] The Complainant is seeking special damages for expenses she incurred in accordance with section 53(2)(c) of the CHRA. At the hearing, I retained jurisdiction if any question should arise from the hearing or after receiving the parties written submissions; therefore, I will defer my decision under this heading until the parties have made further submissions on the remedies that need clarification.\nCosts:\n[124] Prior to the release of the Supreme Court decision in Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 53, the Complainant submitted she wanted to make a submission on the issue of costs if her complaint was upheld. Since the Supreme Court decision was rendered, no legal costs can be granted. Therefore, the Complainant can make submissions on costs, but not legal costs. I will defer my decision under this heading until the parties have made further submissions on the remedies that need clarification.\nInterest:\n[125] The Complainant sought interest on any award of compensation in accordance with section 53(4) of the CHRA. I will defer my decision under this heading until the parties have made further submissions on the remedies that need clarification.\nPublic interest remedy:\n[126] Pursuant to section 53(2)(a) of the CHRA, the Complainant also seeks an order that the Respondent implement appropriate measures in consultation with the Commission, to prevent similar discriminatory practices from occurring in the future. I find the Respondent lacks some knowledge on its duty to accommodate. The evidence established that management at MTS is not familiar with the CHRA and the employer\u2019s obligations in this regard. Therefore, I order the Respondent to work with the Commission to train high level management such as Directors and heads of the labour relations department on the duty to accommodate and the CHRA. The Respondent will work with the Commission to ensure they have an appropriate policy on the duty to accommodate and if not, the Respondent is to elaborate one or amend their existing policy. The Respondent will consult with the Union in this process to consider the point of view of employees. This remedy shall be completed within a year of this decision.\nV. Order [127] Having found the present complaint to be substantiated, pursuant to section 53(2) of the CHRA the Tribunal orders as follows:\n1. The Respondent is to compensate the Complainant in the amount of $10,000 for the pain and suffering she experienced as a result of the discrimination practice.\n2. The Respondent is to compensate the Complainant in the amount of $10,000 for having engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly.\n3. The Respondent is to work with the Commission to train high level management such as Directors and heads of the labor relations department on the duty to accommodate and the CHRA. The Respondent will work with the Commission to ensure they have an appropriate policy on the duty to accommodate and if not, the Respondent is to elaborate one or amend their existing policy. The Respondent will consult with the Union in this process to consider the point of view of employees. This remedy shall be completed within a year of this decision.\n4. Within two weeks of this decision, the parties will provide the Tribunal with their availabilities for a conference call or half a day of hearing to make additional submissions and answer any questions or provide clarification on the above mentioned remedies. Parties shall have every relevant documents and information with them to proceed with the call or hearing.\n[128] The Tribunal continues to retain jurisdiction and remains seized of this matter until the parties provide their additional submissions on remedies and the Tribunal renders a decision thereon.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nApril 26, 2012\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1452\/7809\nStyle of Cause: Heather Lynn Grant v.

Disclosure of documents relating to Ms. Palm\u2019s original complaints to the Commission 7\nV........... Direction\/Order 8\nI. Complaint [1] On December 17, 2010, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act), the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) requested that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) institute an inquiry into three separate complaints filed by Ms. Leslie Palm (the Complainant) against the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500 (the ILWU or the Union), Mr. Cliff Willicome, and Mr. Richard Wilkinson, respectively (all three referred to as the Respondents). The Complainant claims the Union has discriminated against and harassed her on the basis of her sex in violation of sections 9, 10 and 14 of the Act. The Complainant also claims that Mr. Willicome and Mr. Wilkinson harassed her on the basis of her sex in contravention of section 14 of the Act.\n[2] In her complaint, the Complainant claims that the alleged discriminatory conduct affected her well-being. In this regard, she sought the medical attention of her family physician and was prescribed medication to cope with anxiety, depression and stress she experienced as a result of the discriminatory practices. Furthermore, the Complainant claims to have requested further assistance for her emotional state through the ILWU Employee Assistance Program. In this regard, she was referred to a registered psychologist, Dr. Joan Shultz. According to the Complainant, Dr. Shultz is able to provide documentation of the Complainant\u2019s account of the events and the effects of these events on her emotional state. The remedy the Complainant is seeking from the Tribunal includes: $712.64 for medication; $56,029.15 in lost wages; $28,117.98 for consultants; and, $20,000 for pain and suffering. In her list of relevant documents in support of her complaints, the Complainant claims privilege over \u201cmedical notes\u201d and \u201cfinancial notes\u201d.\nII. Motion [3] On July 18 and August 9, 2011, the Respondents filed Notices of Motion seeking four orders from the Tribunal relating to documentary disclosure:\n1. An order from the Tribunal that Ms. Palm produce a list of all health care professionals she has attended for reason of symptoms or treatment for anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia or any other health problems for which she is attributing blame to the Respondents, and that she produce to the parties any arguably relevant medical documents in her possession;\n2. Subpoena duces tecum from the Tribunal ordering each of these health care professionals to produce to counsel for the Respondents the content of all medical files, clinical study notes, opinions, consultation reports, analysis, test results, laboratory examination results, and any other information whether in hard copy or electronic format in the health care professionals\u2019 possession or control that relate to or are arguably relevant to any symptoms of or treatment for anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia or other health problem identified by the Complainant as a result of the order above.\n3. Ms. Palm produce all documents that arguably relate to her claims for wage loss, medication, consultant\u2019s expenses, or pain, suffering and mental anguish;\n4. Ms. Palm produce all documents that arguably relate to her original complaints to the Commission against the Union, the British Columbia Maritime Employers Association and Western Stevedoring.\n[4] A case management conference call was held on December 8, 2011 with regards to the Respondents\u2019 motions. The Complainant confirmed that she never replied to the Respondents\u2019 motions in writing. With regards to item number 1 of the Respondents\u2019 motion, the Complainant identified Dr. Nahid Mehraein, Dr. Joan Shultz and Dr. Kathryn Fung as the health care professionals she has attended in relation to her health issues. The Complainant also confirmed that Dr. Mehraein will produce a medical record for the period of January of 2008 until the summer of 2009; however, the Complainant indicated that she may have problems obtaining her records from the other doctors identified and that a Tribunal order may be of assistance in this regard. Both the Complainant and the Commission expressed concerns regarding the confidentiality of the Complainant\u2019s medical records should they be disclosed. Another case management conference call was scheduled for December 13, 2011.\n[5] In order to identify and respond to several issues that the Respondents anticipated being raised at the case management conference call scheduled for December 13, the Respondents wrote to the Tribunal on December 12, 2011. In that letter, the Respondents clarified that item number 4 of their motion seeks all documents in the Complainant\u2019s and the Commission\u2019s possession with regards to the complaints made against the British Columbia Maritime Employers Association and Western Stevedoring (the Employers). According to the Respondents, they addressed this disclosure request to the Commission as well in recognition that the Complainant is self-represented and as a practical method to lessen the burden on the Complainant of a potentially large disclosure.\n[6] Another case management conference call was held on December 13, 2011. During the call, the Respondents agreed to amend item number 4 of their motion to read: Ms. Palm and\/or the Commission produce all documents that are arguably related to Ms. Palm\u2019s original complainants to the Commission against the Union, the British Columbia Maritime Employers Association and Western Stevedoring. The parties also agreed that if an order for disclosure related to the former files is issued, that counsel for the Employers be provided with the list of documents before disclosure.\n[7] On February 10, 2012, the Respondents wrote to the Tribunal seeking the following additional order from the Tribunal:\n5. That the Commission must not disclose to the Employers or their counsel any documents contained in the Commission files in these matters. The Commission may disclose to counsel for the Employer a list of documents. If counsel for the Employer has concerns about the disclosure to our office of any of the listed documents, the Commission may provide those documents to counsel for the Employer.\n[8] While a further case management conference call was scheduled to address the Respondents\u2019 February 10, 2012 letter, on March 15, 2012, the Tribunal sent a letter to the parties informing them that the Tribunal had considered all correspondence received and would rule on the motions without holding a further call. None of the parties objected to the Tribunal proceeding in this manner.\nIII. Principles of Disclosure [9] The right to a fair hearing requires that \u201c...the affected person be informed of the case against him or her, and be permitted to respond to that case (Charkaoui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 SCC 9, at para. 53). In this regard, parties should be given an opportunity to address evidence prejudicial to their case and bring evidence to prove their position (see Ruby v. Canada (Solicitor General), 2002 SCC 75, at para. 40). In order to provide the parties with this opportunity, they require the full and ample disclosure of relevant information in the possession or care of the other party.\n[10] To make a determination as to whether documents should be disclosed, the Tribunal has identified the following three step process: (1) determine whether the information is \"likely to be relevant\", that is, the party seeking production of the information or documents must demonstrate a nexus between the information or documents sought and the issues in dispute; (2) without examining the documents, determine whether there is a compelling reason to maintain the privacy of the documents; and, (3) if the Tribunal is unable to resolve the matter without examining the material, then it should inspect the documents and decide whether the documents should be produced (see Day v. Canada (Dept. of National Defence), (December 6, 2002), T627\/1501 and T628\/1601 Ruling No. 3, at para. 7 (CHRT); and, Guay v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2004 CHRT 34, at para. 44 [Guay]).\n[11] The Tribunal has recognized that a complainant has a right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to his or her medical records (see Beaudry v. Canada (Attorney General), (July 24, 2002), T694\/8201, Ruling No. 1, at para. 7 (CHRT) [Beaudry]; McAvinn v. Strait Crossing Bridge Ltd., (January 3, 2001), T558\/1600, Ruling No. 3, at para. 3 (CHRT) [McAvinn]). However, the right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to medical records may cease when that person puts his or her health in issue (see McAvinn at para. 4 (CHRT); Guay at para. 45; and, Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada and Femmes-Action v. Bell Canada, 2005 CHRT 9, at paras. 9-11). In cases where the Tribunal has ordered the disclosure of medical records, it has used the following procedures to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the information:\n\u2022 Vet the documents to determine which ones are in fact related to the medical condition in issue (see Guay; McAvinn; and, Beaudry); and\/or,\n\u2022 Put conditions on who may see and copy the documents (see Shiv Chopra v. Health Canada, 2007 CHRT 10; Micheline Montreuil v. Canadian Forces, 2005 CHRT 45; and, Beaudry).\nIV. Analysis A. Disclosure of Medical Documents [12] According to the Respondents, the Complainant has put her health in issue as part of her case and, therefore, in the interests of fairness to the Respondents, Ms. Palm must disclose her medical information so the Respondents know the case they must meet and can prepare for the hearing. The Respondents add that through the material facts pled in her particulars and her remedies sought, the Complainant has waived any confidentiality or privilege over her arguably relevant medical information.\n[13] Based on the Complainant\u2019s allegations outlined above, I agree that she has put her health in issue in this case and that relevant medical information should be produced to allow the Respondents to properly respond to the allegations regarding the effects of the alleged discrimination on the Complainant\u2019s well being. That being said, during case management, the Complainant provided a list of the healthcare professionals she has attended for reasons of any health problems for which she is attributing blame to the Respondents. She has also indicated that Dr. Mehraein will produce a medical record for the period of January 2008 until the summer of 2009. Although the Complainant has indicated that she may have some problems obtaining the records of the two other doctors she has identified, she has undertaken to attempt to obtain them, but has stated that an order from the Tribunal may help in this regard. Given the above, I believe it is sufficient that the Complainant simply be directed to obtain and disclose any relevant medical documents relating to her claim. As the Respondents will then have access to any relevant medical information, I find that a subpoena duces tecum, compelling the doctors to produce documents to the Respondents, is not necessary at this stage. In order to protect the confidentiality of the Complainant\u2019s medical records, I place conditions on the access to these documents as found in the direction below.\nB. Disclosure of documents relating to claims for wage loss, medication, consultant\u2019s expenses, and pain and suffering [14] In her Statement of Particulars and request for remedy, the Complainant has provided a document that lists her wages; vacation pay; indemnity benefits received in 2008 and 2009; and, lists an amount of expenses for medication and consultants. According to the Respondents, the Complainant has failed to provide particulars for these claims and has not disclosed any documents that support the amounts she claims. The Respondents add that the Complainant has an obligation to disclose these documents and that there is no privilege attached to them.\n[15] As the Complainant has requested compensation for wage loss, medication and consultant\u2019s expenses, and pain and suffering, I agree that any relevant documents in the possession of the Complainant with regards to these claims should be disclosed. This will allow\nthe Respondents the opportunity to address the Complainant\u2019s remedial claims and may assist the Tribunal in fashioning an appropriate and fair remedy should the complaint be substantiated.While the Complainant claims privilege over \u201cfinancial notes\u201d, she did not provide reasons during the case management conference calls regarding why documents related to her requests for compensation should not be disclosed. Therefore, I direct that any relevant documents related to the Complainant\u2019s claims for wage loss, medication and consultant\u2019s expenses, and pain and suffering, be disclosed to the Respondents pursuant to the direction below.\nC. Disclosure of documents relating to Ms. Palm\u2019s original complaints to the Commission [16] According to the Respondents, Ms. Palm originally filed three complaints with the Commission: one against the British Columbia Maritime Employers Association; one against Western Stevedoring; and one against the ILWU. After these complaints were rejected by the Commission, Ms. Palm filed another five complaints: the three current complaints against the Respondents and the complaints against the Employers, which have been settled. According to the Respondents\u2019 submissions, the Complainant must produce all documents relating to her original and subsequent complaints to the Commission against the Union, and the Employers. Although the complaints against the British Columbia Maritime Employers Association and Western Stevedoring are now settled, the Respondent argues that the original and subsequent complaints are arguably relevant because the Complainant\u2019s claims against the Employers were essentially the same as her claims against the Respondents. The Respondents add that, in support of her original complaint against the Union, the Complainant expressly relied on the details of her complaint against Western Stevedoring.\n[17] In Leslie Palm v. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500 and Willicome and Wilkinson, 2011 CHRT 12 [Palm], an earlier disclosure ruling in this same matter, the Tribunal found that the Complainant\u2019s five complaints against her employer, the employer\u2019s association, the union, Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Willicome, while not identical, were strikingly similar. The Tribunal ordered that the terms of Settlement of the Complainant\u2019s settled complaint against her employer and the employer\u2019s association be disclosed. However, this disclosure was not based solely on the fact that the complaints were similar. The Tribunal found that \u201c[t]he Settlement terms relating to releases of liability may directly affect the outcome of Ms. Palm\u2019s complaints against Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Willicome\u201d (Palm at para. 17). The Tribunal also found that \u201cthe Settlement terms relating to both lost wages and non-pecuniary damages are relevant and necessary to guard against the possibility of double recovery with regard to the former, and to allow for some proportionality among these interconnected claims with regard to the latter\u201d (Palm at para. 17). Finally, the Tribunal found that \u201c[a]ny terms of Settlement relating to Ms. Palm\u2019s complaint of systemic discrimination are both relevant and necessary to achieve a just result in these circumstances\u201d (Palm at para. 18). As these passages from Palm indicate, the disclosure of the terms of Settlement was relevant \u201c...to make a just decision on the claims...\u201d (Palm at para. 17).\n[18] In the Respondents\u2019 current request for disclosure, aside from stating the Complainant\u2019s claims against the Employers are essentially the same as the current complaints, the Respondents have not indicated how any information contained in the Complainant\u2019s original and subsequent complaints to the Commission are relevant to any of the current issues in dispute. In her statement of particulars before the Tribunal, the Complainant has laid out the basis for her complaint and has provided a list of any relevant documents in her possession relating to her allegations. Apart from its request for disclosure of medical documents and other documents related to the Complainant\u2019s claims for relief, the Respondents have not indicated that they do not know the case to be met or that they have insufficient information to be able to respond to the Complainant\u2019s allegations. In addition, the Commission has provided a list of all relevant documents in its possession with regards to the referred complaints against the Respondents. In this sense, I find the Respondents\u2019 request for disclosure here to be speculative. I am not convinced that documents related to Ms. Palm\u2019s original complaints against the Union or the original and subsequent complaints against the Employer, to the Commission, are likely to be relevant to the current inquiry. As a result, it is not necessary to address item 5 of the Respondents\u2019 disclosure request.\nV. Direction\/Order [19] Pursuant to the reasons above, I issue the following order and direct as follows:\n1. Ms. Palm is to produce a list to the Respondents containing the names and addresses of all health care professionals she has attended for reason of symptoms or treatment for anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia or any other health problems for which she is attributing blame to the Respondents. Production to the Respondents shall be completed no later than 6 weeks from the date of this decision.\n2. Ms. Palm is to obtain and produce to the Respondents any medical documents, including any clinical study notes, opinions, consultation reports, analysis, test results, laboratory examination results, and any other information whether in hard copy or electronic format, in the health care professionals\u2019 possession or control, that relates to any symptoms of or treatment for anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia, or any other health problem identified by the Complainant for which she is attributing blame to the Respondents. Production to the Respondents shall be completed no later than 6 weeks from the date of this decision.\n3. To protect Ms. Palm's right to confidentiality of her medical records, the documents shall be disclosed to counsel for the Respondents and shall not be disclosed to any other individuals without prior permission from the Tribunal and notification to Ms. Palm. The documents may not be used for any purpose outside of the present inquiry and the documents must be returned to the Complainant at the conclusion of the inquiry.\n4. Ms. Palm is to produce to the Respondents any documents in her possession that relate to her claims for wage loss, medication, consultant\u2019s expenses, or pain and suffering. Production to the Respondents shall be completed no later than 6 weeks from the date of this decision.\nSigned by\nSusheel Gupta\nTribunal Vice-Chairperson\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nMay 24, 2012\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1625\/17110, T1626\/17210, T1627\/17310\nStyle of Cause: Leslie Palm v.

Background [1] This case involves three complaints of Marlo Nastiuk (Ms. Nastiuk), a residential worker employed by the Respondent Couchiching First Nation (CFN) at its Giizhikaandag Healing Centre (GHC) in Fort Frances, Ontario, under the supervision and direction of the Respondent Thomas Sinclair (Mr. Sinclair), Executive Director of GHC.\n[2] On May 1, 2009, in accordance with the provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6) (CHRA), the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) requested that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (Tribunal) institute an inquiry into complaint 20060869, received July 25, 2006, of Ms. Nastiuk against CFN and complaint 20061038 against Mr. Sinclair, alleging discrimination relating to sexual harassment in the workplace pursuant to s. 14 of the CHRA said to have occurred between March 2005 and July 2006.\n[3] On September 15, 2009, the Commission made a second request for inquiry into a third complaint (20080128), received March 31, 2008, of Ms. Nastiuk against CFN of retaliation under s. 14.1 of the CHRA, alleged to have occurred \u201cAugust, 16, 2006 and ongoing\u201d.\nA. Scope of the Inquiry [4] On March 1, 2010, Member Kerry Lynne D. Findlay Q.C. commenced an inquiry into the three complaints filed by Ms. Nastiuk. The inquiry continued March 2-5, May 31-June 4, and June 14-18 in Fort Frances, Ontario.\n[5] In discussions at the beginning of the hearing Member Findlay explained the scope of the inquiry:\nThe Chairperson: Now one further thing Ms. Nastiuk, are you clear that we\u2019re here to deal with the complaints to do with sexual harassment and retaliation and we\u2019re not dealing with disability?\nMs. Nastiuk: Yes, I guess. I understand, although to me, those \u2013 that perceived disability, perceived orientation are part of it, but, yeah, I understand.\nThe Chairperson: Okay, because there\u2019s already been a ruling of the Tribunal before today that that\u2019s what we\u2019re confining ourselves to all right?\nMs. Nastiuk: Yes.\nTranscript: page 28, lines 18-25; page 29, lines 1-6.\n[6] Ms. Nastiuk and Mr. Sinclair were without counsel during the inquiry, CFN was represented by Counsel Chantelle Bryson (Ms. Bryson). The parties\u2019 final submissions and Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s reply to the Respondents\u2019 final submissions were all received by the Tribunal by August 11, 2010.\nB. Recusal of Adjudicator [7] On July 6, 2011, following her resignation from the Tribunal due to her recent election as a Member of Parliament, Member Findlay recused herself from the case, without rendering a decision. The case was therefore reassigned to the Tribunal\u2019s Vice-Chairperson, Susheel Gupta.\n[8] Following his assignment, the Vice-Chairperson presented the parties with two options for proceeding with the file:\ni. To set dates for the holding of an entirely new hearing with the recalling of witnesses, submission of documentary evidence and presentation of both oral and written arguments. And then, to allow the Tribunal\u2019s process to proceed to a final decision. Such a Hearing would be presided over by the Vice-Chairperson.\nii. If the parties consent, without delay, to allow the Vice-Chairperson and Full-Time Member of the Tribunal to listen to all of the Hearing recordings and thoroughly review all documentary material submitted to the Tribunal that is part of the Hearing\u2019s Record of the Case and allow the Tribunal to render a final decision.\n[9] By November 15, 2011, the Tribunal had received a response from all parties who, for reasons of efficiency and cost, selected option ii. However, due to additional responsibilities at the Tribunal and personal matters at home, the Vice-Chairperson decided that for reasons of efficiency and expediency, it would be in the best interests of the parties if he resigned from the case. The Vice-Chairperson resigned from the case on March 9, 2012, and remitted the matter back to Chairperson Shirish Chotalia for reassignment. On March 13, 2012, Chairperson Shirish Chotalia assigned the case to Member Wallace Gilby Craig.\nC. Tribunal Member Wallace Gilby Craig [10] On March 13, 2012, I received a transcript of all the evidence given by all witnesses who appeared either in person or by teleconference before Member Findlay. In addition, I received copies of all exhibits that had been received into evidence, and the written arguments tendered by the parties in the aftermath of the Inquiry.\n[11] Between March 13 and April 30, 2012, I read the 3500-page transcript of the proceedings, scrutinized the relevant documentary evidence that had been received by Member Findlay, considered the written arguments submitted by the parties, and rendered this decision.\nII. Prima Facie Evidence of the Complainant [12] I refer first to the evidence of Ms. Gail Roach-Leforte, a witness for the Complainant, because her testimony describes the workplace at the GHC and the circumstances surrounding the Complainant\u2019s allegations of discrimination and retaliation by the Respondents.\n[13] Ms. Roach-Leforte testified that she had worked in child welfare for 16 years in a variety of positions with several organizations: as a case aid, residential care worker, case manager with sexually exploited youths, specialized foster care, college instructor, and that she is currently a social worker. Ms. Roach-Leforte began work at GHC (CFN\u2019s residential treatment centre) in late 2004 as an on-call casual employee doing one-on-one work with youths in residence at the treatment centre.\n[14] Douglas Broman was also called as a witness by Ms. Nastiuk, and testified that in 2005 he worked at CFN\u2019s treatment centre dealing with difficult youths on a one-to-one basis and that in early 2006 he was appointed acting case manager.\nA. The GHC Program [15] The Giizhikaandag Healing Centre (GHC) is operated by CFN, it is a residential treatment centre for adolescent sexual offenders. It provides or arranges for therapy, psychiatric treatment, medical services, educational training and referrals to community services.\n[16] In December 2004, GHC\u2019s interim executive director, Estelle Simard, informed Ms. Roach-Leforte that the treatment program was failing and that she was resigning. Having just become aware of Ms. Roach-Leforte\u2019s resume, she suggested that Ms. Roach-Leforte ask CFN\u2019s Chief to employ Ms. Roach-Leforte as manager of the programs at GHC.\n[17] When asked by Ms. Bryson, CFN\u2019s counsel, to provide details that would explain why GHC\u2019s program was on the verge of collapse in 2004 Ms. Roach-Leforte stated that the provincial ministry had cited 33 violations relating to recordkeeping, issues of health, safety, food not in accord with menus, and broken lights. With respect to work-intensive violations or non-compliance, she testified that the ministry was dissatisfied with case management, reports not being signed or with content appearing to have been cut and pasted, and that they wanted a service delivery manual developed.\n[18] Ms. Roach-Leforte and three others therefore went to the Chief and Council with the proposal that she take over the program. The Chief and Council agreed to give her a number of months to try and redevelop and turn the program around. Ms. Roach-Leforte informed them that she did not have executive director experience and would need guidance regarding the financial and executive duties of her new post.\n[19] A few weeks later, in either late December 2004, or early January 2005, Chief McPherson called Ms. Roach-Leforte and told her that she would be employed to manage the program, and that CFN had obtained the services of a consultant, Mr. Sinclair, who would work with her for six weeks to possibly three months. Ms. Roach-Leforte accepted the appointment, expecting that she would receive assistance in learning finance and executive duties. In her discussions with the Chief concerning the consultant and her role, it was agreed that Ms. Roach-Leforte would be GHC\u2019s program manager. It was her expectation that in time she would be appointed Executive Director. However, by the spring of 2005, Mr. Sinclair\u2019s role as a consultant had ended and it became apparent to all GHC employees, including Ms. Roach-Leforte and Ms. Nastiuk, that he had become the Executive Director of GHC, in charge of the entire operation and answerable only to the Band Manager, and through the Band Manager to the Chief and Council.\n[20] When asked by CFN\u2019s counsel to explain her duties and those of Mr. Sinclair, Ms. Roach-Leforte stated they were both involved in clearly defining the duties of workers at GHC, including the program manager, case manager, and team leaders. However, it is apparent that Ms. Roach-Leforte had to salvage and manage the existing program, while at the same time working with Mr. Sinclair to reorganize the program in a way that would satisfy CFN, provincial authorities and a federal funding agency.\nB. Hiring Ms. Nastiuk as a Full-Time Employee [21] On September 10th, 2004, one month after graduating from the University of Manitoba, Ms. Nastiuk began working at GHC. Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s Bachelor of Arts degree, for a minor in psychology and major in sociology and criminology, was the hard-earned result of an eight-year struggle complicated with health problems, debilitating effects fibromyalgia, narcolepsy, and a prolapsed disk. Ms. Nastiuk worked as a casual relief counselor at GHC until February 2005.\n[22] In early January 2005, Ms. Roach-Leforte called a meeting of GHC staff. As she put it, she gave them a pep-talk to boost their morale. She told them that the ministerial review was behind them, she didn\u2019t want them to lose their jobs, they were a team which needed to recommit itself, and that a consultant was coming and this would assist them in becoming a more professional organization.\n[23] Ms. Roach-Leforte suggested to Mr. Sinclair that Ms. Nastiuk be assigned to work with them in redeveloping a new program:\n\u2026Tom and I \u2026 the first week \u2026 we spent many hours, probably 10, 12-hour days \u2026I understood residential care, I have done that work for several years, but \u2013 and I knew how to operate a computer and I knew how to \u2026 do documents, but I wasn\u2019t very good at it, and I knew that you were, meaning the complainant, and so I had suggested to Tom that I really needed help there and I thought it was a -- misuse of your skill and your education, and I thought we should have you come over and assist me with a lot of those redevelopment pieces.\nTranscript: page 976, lines 12-25; page 977, line 1.\n\u2026I don\u2019t recall an interview, other than to have you (Ms. Nastiuk) come over. I think they just called you over to the building and talked to you about, you know, do you think you could do this, and you agreed that you could and I was relieved. All I remember is that I was going to get some help in a big, big task.\nTranscript: page 979, lines 3-10, 24-25; page 980, lines 1-10.\n[24] Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s full-time employment was accepted by Mr. Sinclair and Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s described it in her evidence as intense work for the first few weeks. It was Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s first social services job with a First Nation. Ms. Roach-Leforte also testified that the working hours were extremely long for the three of them.\nMs. Bryson: So what were you doing together, all of you?\nMs. Roach-Leforte: A lot of discussion. I mean, I wasn\u2019t there the long hours that I was working, I wasn\u2019t always in that building. I did have other duties.\nI had to be at the other program \u2013 like, right on site, and we met lots with the staff as well. I mean morale was just the lowest you could ever get, so I know a big part of what we did was to try to have a lot of team meetings and try to reassure them that \u2013 you know, the program was done, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\nBut I think we were trying to instill in them a hope that it was being resurrected because I think it was.\nMs. Bryson: And the program still exists, right?\nMs. Roach-Leforte: It still exists.\nTranscript: page 1119, lines 1-23.\n[25] Ms. Roach-Leforte described in particular the chaos of this early time, working 10 to 12-hour days in a boardroom:\nThroughout that period we didn\u2019t have an office, we spent most of our time -- well, we had papers all across the board table and in Mr. Sinclair\u2019s office and we -- just kept spreading out our papers and our piles of different tasks.\nTranscript: page 981, lines 14-19.\nC. Office Relocation [26] In late March 2005, after discussing the impracticability of their situation with Ms. Nastiuk, Ms. Roach-Leforte suggested to Mr. Sinclair, and claims he agreed, that she and Ms. Nastiuk be moved from the GHC\u2019s \u201ceast\u201d building to a vacant office in the \u201cmiddle\u201d building. Ms. Roach-Leforte set up an office expecting Ms. Nastiuk to be moved so they might continue to work together on the redevelopment of the GHC program. However, Ms. Nastiuk was not moved with her, but rather was assigned to Mr. Sinclair\u2019s office, where he had a table and a computer set up for her. In his testimony, Mr. Sinclair asserted that he had no computer skills and that it was critical that he have someone working with him who was skilled.\nMs. Nastiuk asked Ms. Roach-Leforte: Where did I end up located?\nYou didn\u2019t get to move over, and \u2013 but I noticed \u2013 I just noticed, you know, patterns happening for you. At one point you had come to my office and you kind of flopped on the chair and said, oh, I just need to get away from the craziness for a while or his craziness for a while. And it was really hard for us because we were \u2013 we just weren\u2019t being able to get the work done that we needed to do together.\nTranscript: page 987, lines 11-20.\n[27] Ms. Nastiuk testified that in those first weeks she began to feel uncomfortable with Mr. Sinclair because of his queries into her background:\nBut then he started making comments, like, oh, I dated his wife, when were standing outside having a cigarette, and men would pull up, or talking about different people or, oh, I dated his partner.\nAnd then he was talking about how women liked him, and it just always struck me, as I didn\u2019t really know him, I was only an on-call staff, part-time staff, and it just kind of seemed inappropriate to me. And I didn\u2019t engage \u2013 or I didn\u2019t really comment to it. I just kind of cringed back.\nTranscript: page 150, lines 5-16.\n[28] When Ms. Nastiuk described her frustration with being assigned to Mr. Sinclair\u2019s office:\nOther staff were coming and going and doing what they wanted, and I just always seemed to have to be right there and answerable most of the time during the day. Which, I mean, in any workplace, I guess that \u2013 you know, it\u2019s kind of standard, but the way everybody else could have more freedoms and not have to answer to him the same way kind of bothered me.\n\u2026\nAnd then one night he asked me to work late, and we were in the office until 10:00 that night. Now, I\u2019m thinking that was between March or April. \u2026but I\u2019m not absolutely certain about that because there were so many long days that you couldn\u2019t really look back and figure out exactly what day that was. Around 7 \u2013 between 7 and 8 in the evening \u2026I went to put a document on his desk \u2026 As I\u2019m sitting down, he said, oh, I can smell your hair. And as I was sitting down, I was just like, what was that? And I was already uncomfortable enough. And it wasn\u2019t like \u2026typical \u2026like someone trying to touch you or talk about details of their sexual life \u2013 like intimate details of their sexual life. It wasn\u2019t that kind of thing it was just \u2013 I really don\u2019t know what to make of that and how to term that.\nBut then it went on, and I just \u2013 I sat down and started working. And about 20 minutes later, it had been really quiet and I was just trying to work, and then all of a sudden he took his pen and he pitched it on the table and he said something to the effect, you know, Marlo, I\u2019ve been in this business for 20 years or so, \u2026and I\u2019ve never not been able to figure anyone out and I can\u2019t figure you out.\n\u2026I know I commented something like, well, I\u2019m pretty much -- well you can pretty much take me at face value \u2026\nTranscript: page 153, line 25; page 154, lines 1-7, 17-25; page 156, lines 14-25; page 157, lines 1-16.\nD. The \u201cM\u00ecss Me?\u201d Incident [29] Ms. Roach-Leforte recalled another occasion after moving to the middle building when Ms. Nastiuk had come to speak with her, and then Mr. Sinclair \u201cbarged\u201d into her office without knocking, startling Ms. Nastiuk, who asked Mr. Sinclair \u201cMiss me?\u201d. Shortly afterwards Ms. Nastiuk left to return to her office. Ms. Roach-Leforte testified that she was concerned that Ms. Nastiuk appeared anxious and disturbed.\n[30] Ms. Nastiuk also testified about the \u201cMiss me?\u201d incident. She explained that some time later, when Mr. Sinclair had taken her for a drive outside the town limits, he started to talk about the \u201cMiss me?\u201d comment. Ms. Nastiuk testified:\n\u2026immediately in my head, I knew where he might be going with that, or thought that I knew where he might be going with that. And I just, no, you know, it meant nothing. It\u2019s just I say that, you know to my parent\u2019s dogs, it\u2019s just something \u2013 or the girls at work. We just say that if we haven\u2019t seen each other for a while. And, you know, if you work in isolation, quite often because of separation and the location of the different office and buildings.\nThe Chairperson: Was he suggesting that it did mean something?\nWell, he referred to the miss me comment, and I\u2019m like, yeah, but it didn\u2019t mean anything. Like, from when I was in Gail\u2019s office in June.\nAnd he kept, like, no, but you\u2019re not listening to me, and I\u2019m like, it didn\u2019t mean anything and somewhere in there, he threw in a comment that he had an interest \u2013 he found me attractive and he had an interest in me as a woman or a female. But I \u2013 I really \u2013 I think \u2013 I just know I shut that down. I didn\u2019t want to hear it, I didn\u2019t want to have to deal with that, I didn\u2019t want to have to tell him directly. I am just \u2013 don\u2019t do that because I was really worried about my income.\nI believe I was still -- I wasn\u2019t a salary staff yet. \u2026\n...it just felt really horrible. It was very horrible.\nTranscript: page 179, lines 23-25; page 180, lines 1-25; page 181, lines 1-4, 15-16.\nE. Promoting Ms. Nastiuk [31] Ms. Roach-Leforte testified that case management duties at GHC had been carried out by a variety of staff, that at one time the duties were assigned to all care workers, another time they were given to team leaders. Within the redevelopment of GHC\u2019s program, the case manager was tasked with described duties. Ms. Roach-Leforte said it was her hope that GHC would have one case manager for all the youths in treatment:\n\u2026 those duties would be more of a social work type responsibility. The residential care workers would work with the kids, they would document things. They would discuss with the case manager concerns, whether they were every day concerns, whether they were behaviour concerns, the clinician should be consulting with the case manager about things that were happening in terms of the clinical work that was being done with their kids.\u201d\nTranscript: page 1010, lines 6-15.\n[32] Ms. Nastiuk and another staff member applied for the new position of Case Manager, they were interviewed by Mr. Sinclair and Barbara Delsig. Ms. Nastiuk was selected and appointed Case Manager on July 20, 2005.\n[33] Ms. Nastiuk described the nature of her work when she was formally appointed GHC\u2019s Case Manager:\nSo I just started doing a lot of research on the internet and putting the pieces together. \u2026 Mr. Sinclair asked me to develop an accountable case-management system. I met with Paula Isler (ph). She was the resident with the Ministry of Community and Social Services. She came in for a review about that time. She gave me what she called her Bible, her pieces from the Child and Family Services Act and she said this is my Bible. This is what guides what I do, this is what will guide what you do, and we had quite a discussion about that.\nTranscript: page 186, lines 13-25.\nSo based on that, that helped me develop the system that I had, and I think that Mr. Broman felt that there was a \u2013 system of case management that you could \u2013 someone else should be able to step into and follow.\nSo I struggled \u2013well, I can\u2019t say, well, I really struggled. It was exciting work, but it took a lot of time, a lot of energy. You\u2019ve got the regular case management duties, you\u2019ve got a lot of time spent with Mr. Sinclair, and Gail, bless her heart, she\u2019s a real talker too. So it was a lot of time spent listening to other people talk about work accomplishments. Or what \u2013 Gail particularly, something that she was really proud of that she dealt with during the day or issues, and so \u2013 yeah, my day was a long day, and the work was \u2013 it just seemed like I was accountable for a lot of the treatment planning also at the time.\nSo while I was having to do all the administrative, I was also having to spend enough time with the boys to kind of gauge what was going on with them, and I think I did a pretty fair job juggling all of these different tasks. And no training on case management, but I believe I learned, but there was still pieces for me that were missing that I couldn\u2019t get the help with or assistance or guidance.\nI guess a comment to make is, like, this was \u2013 it was all encompassing. I had my job and it just seemed when I went home, I still had my \u2013 something related to work. There was a lot \u2013 I felt a lot of expectation and pressure put on me. I wanted to do a good job, but basically I\u2019m pretty much a self-starter. I work along independently very well.\nTranscript: page 187, lines 1-19; page 188, lines 5-22.\n[34] Ms. Nastiuk asked Ms. Roach-Leforte what her transition \u201clooked like within the whole of GHC.\u201d\nMs. Roach-Leforte: \u2026from an administrative perspective your transition was very positive in that you had the skills to develop things like that, we were getting feedback from the ministry that that piece was coming along really well, she liked the design. She liked a lot of the changes that we were making. \u2026 In terms of the team though \u2013 there was some negative feelings about you being given the position. You were the more qualified, you had a degree, Joe had a diploma, but she had been at the program longer, so I think there was just \u2013 there was a lot of bitterness I think initially about that. But, like a lot of things, I know from my perspective I really always tried to work on building bridges and so wherever there were negative comments I would try to bring team \u2013 you know, team members together and sort through problems. One of the other problems though was because of the change to the case management style, people were really upset about that.\nTranscript: page 1013, lines 11-25; page 1014, lines 1-11.\n[35] Ms. Roach-Leforte described the work environment as being more positive during the early days of working on the development of the new program. When asked by CFN\u2019s counsel how long the staff lasted, however, she stated that by the summer of 2005, things had already begun to deteriorate.\nAnd it lasted for \u2013 well, it was just kind of up and down because I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s Mr. Sinclair\u2019s fault, but when Mr. Sinclair came that added a whole other mix, it became a change to the program, and then when Ms. Nastiuk was brought over to the case management \u2013 or to the management part, that brought another change. And just \u2013 I mean, changes started happening, but there started to be in the summertime, just this suspicion that was creeping in with people. Promises were being made about little \u2013 you know, pieces of the program and then they wouldn\u2019t happen, or they would get started and then get kiboshed or \u2013 you know, the role was, you know, really, really (inaudible) and scheduling, oh my God, what a nightmare, so things started to go downhill towards summer I think.\nTranscript: page 1136, lines 12-25; page 1137, lines 1-5.\nF. Interactions Between Ms. Nastiuk and Mr. Sinclair During the Summer of 2005 [36] Ms. Nastiuk testified to some of the tension that arose between herself and the other staff. This led Mr. Sinclair to act as an intermediary, a situation Ms. Nastiuk said she found particularly frustrating.\nOh, yes. Yeah, that \u2013 that was pretty much at the inception of case management. I was aware that there were issues with staff, but my understanding, and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m -- my assessment skills are pretty good, Mr. Sinclair used to say that, and my current boss says that. And my feeling was with staff \u2013 some of the issues with staff, there was a lot of resentment that some of the old staff like Brian, Nicky, they were resentful that some of us on-call, part-time staff was moving up and they were down on the floor. And they had kind of hoped that Jill would get the case manager job and there was just \u2013 or Krista, Brian\u2019s sister, she was really resentful that I was working upstairs with Mr. Sinclair and Gail.\nSo there \u2013 that\u2019s, to me, how a lot of that got started, and somewhere in there, I don\u2019t know how that got turned around. There might have been some thoughts on my own. I remember I used to make the comment, because it \u2013 it used to bother them so much, so I would try to say, well, it\u2019s basically a good fit because I\u2019ve gained a lot of skill and knowledge through my education.\nIt turned out that was absolutely the worst thing I could have said because it put up even more of a barrier. And between, you know, all of that that came up, that I couldn\u2019t go to front line staff, that I couldn\u2019t go to the shifter \u2013 shift supervisor or team supervisor, whatever. I had to go directly to him for reports I should have got from front line staff, from the shift supervisor or team leaders or whatever they were called at the time.\nInformation on how the progress of the boys, how the groups were doing, anything like that it had to be passed through Mr. Sinclair. Oh, another reason to have to go to his office, and it was very frustrating. \u2026That would have been the first few days in July when I was told the position was mine, July \u201905.\nTranscript: page 190, lines 24-25; page 191, lines 1-25; page 192, lines 1-13, 22-24.\n[37] Ms. Nastiuk testified with a great deal of intensity concerning her work at GHC, particularly the difficulties she experienced with Mr. Sinclair resulting from what she perceived as his infatuation with her:\nAnd the type of attention and intensity of Mr. Sinclair\u2019s focus, I had to deal with that and I -- I just knew. Like, at some point, okay, you have to take the blinders off, you have to stop minimizing, you have to stop denying, deflecting, rationalizing \u2013 well, I can\u2019t say denying but rationalizing.\nI had to do something because I started getting concerned based on the behaviours that I saw of Mr. Sinclair that he was the one in control, he was used to getting what he wanted.\nHow do I deal with that and maintain my employment and try to put up \u2013 try to get it to stop, so finally \u2013 it took me a little while. I was pretty anxious, but I finally approached Gail Roach-Laforte about it, and she was the program manager for Giizhikaandag. And, you know, I \u2013 I told her that \u2013 I told her how he just seemed to think that there was a bond of friendship, and I didn\u2019t really get where that was coming from (Inaudible) because I didn\u2019t feel it, and I just \u2013 he\u2019s stopping at my house and it \u2013 I did not want it.\nLike, it just seemed like I can\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t escape work, at home, than it was \u2013 if felt \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s the right word for it. It was frightening. It was really frightening because \u2013 and also to say \u2013 just prior to that, I had just gotten off of several years of Ontario Disability Support. I had left (Inaudible) to income housing. I felt very, very, vulnerable.\nAnd I kind of just said to Gail, like, I believe that he\u2019s interested in me \u2013 as more than an employee, and that when he realizes that that\u2019s not what I want and I \u2013 like I wasn\u2019t giving him any indication that that was what I wanted, nothing. For me that personal space \u2013 how to say it \u2013 I was afraid that if I had to tell him straight out, because it didn\u2019t seem like he was getting it otherwise that that would put my employment in jeopardy.\nSo I \u2013 you know, I just continued to put up that \u2013 cringe, try to avoid, put up the cold wall, not engage, not be emotional, respond, that he\u2019s eventually just get over it and move on.\nTranscript: page 188, lines 22-25; page 189, lines 1-25; page 190, lines 1-19.\n[38] When Ms. Nastiuk recalled the date of July 20, 2005 as the date she \u201ctechnically\u201d became a full-salaried Case Manager, she immediately made a garbled statement which may be attributed to stress and confusion on her part in giving evidence without the assistance and guidance of a competent barrister:\nIt just seemed like all of a sudden \u2013 like, I mean, it was kind of just \u2013 it just seemed like all of a sudden it was like he just \u2013 I guess the way to explain it is, like, he swooped and it was like I said this to him and not to the \u2013 just to the position.\n[39] Ms. Nastiuk then testified:\nAnd I don\u2019t mean he was asking me for sexual favours, or sexual favours or else, that type of thing, it was just like all of a sudden he just thought we were, like \u2013 like just there was a bond or \u2013 it was more than like an executive director\/supervisor\/case manager relationship.\nTranscript: page 183, lines 6-18.\n[40] During her examination of Ms. Roach-Leforte, Ms. Nastiuk asked whether she had expressed concerns to her, Ms. Roach-Leforte replied:\n\u2026Yes, you did. That was my role. I was your supervisor, or I thought I was your supervisor, and that\u2019s how I think I worked with all of the team. The team came to me all the time with concerns. \u2026Yes you did\u2026 but I expected that. I was seeing things as I stated earlier, about the incident in my office \u2026there were things that I was seeing. You see it and you kind of put it on the back burner, but then when you came to me with your concerns I did expect it. \u2026 I didn\u2019t expect necessarily the content of what you complained to me about.\nTranscript: page 1015, lines 5-24.\nThe Chairperson: And what was that content?\nWell, I know that Ms. Nastiuk was very uncomfortable even bringing this up to me and she \u2013 she really hemmed and hawed and she hinted at things at first. She kind of had asked me questions. I think she was sort of gauging maybe number one, if I was \u2013 if I was actually going to listen to her. Number two, if -- if this was just a natural thing this happened to everybody.\nFor instance she had asked if Mr. Sinclair ever asked me personal questions about things that I experienced and I said to her, yeah, and I shared things. I mean, they\u2019re nothing so personal, I would only share something with him that I would publish anyway.\nAnd, you know, those questions kind of came at me, I said why, what\u2019s going on? And again, with some hemming and hawing she talked about how uncomfortable she felt. I don\u2019t recall every little detail, but the gist of it was there were things happening to you that you were very uncomfortable with, you didn\u2019t like, you felt you didn\u2019t know what to do about. And as I hear, you know some of the details, I remember just saying to you, you know, you need to do something about this you were, I guess you were coming to me but I had suggested, I think, that you go to the Chief or Chief and Council about it.\nThe Chairperson: When was that conversation?\nThat was in the summer. In July or August of \u201805.\nThere were several discussions that took place over \u2013 we sometimes discussed them at work, we sometimes \u2013 I know that we \u2013 you and I had gone out to the lake one time to be away from the program and you had talked about some concerns \u2026\nThe Chairperson: Did she give you any specifics at that time?\nYeah, she talked about Mr. Sinclair, you know, coming to her house, she talked about, you know, the late hours. I saw a lot of things that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with.\nThe Chairperson: Like what?\nWe were having a staff meeting one day and I was in the middle building, it was in the summer, and \u2013 and Mr. Sinclair had called me over to the \u2013 to his building to review agenda notes before a staff meeting, and so when I went over, Ms. Nastiuk was in his office and she was on her knees fixing the hem on his pants and \u2013 oh man I can still see that. It was disturbing to me to see that, and \u2013\nThe Chairperson: What do you mean by \u201cfixing\u201d?\nShe was on her knees adjusting the hem, and then he kind of turned to me and laughed and said, you know, they didn\u2019t feel comfortable, they felt like they were too long. And then he made her do that again because he said, oh, now I think they\u2019re too short or something.\nAnd I didn\u2019t \u2013 I didn\u2019t say anything at the time, I just \u2013 it was very disturbing. And when I asked Marlo later, Ms. Nastiuk later, what was that? Why were you doing that? Why did you do that? And she just said I felt like I had to. So I said \u2013 I think I told her that it fits into a pattern that she\u2019s been talking about, and it was just more, you know, part of a discussion that \u2013 several discussions that we had had. And in different way I had suggested to her, you know, go to Chief and Council, this is harassment, you know, maybe you should complain to the Human Rights Commission, this isn\u2019t right, maybe you should go to the Labour Board.\nBut I also say that she was \u2013 she felt intimidated. I guess, you know, personally, I would never fudge reports and I would never get on my hands and knees to fix somebody\u2019s hem so that to me is \u2026it just wasn\u2019t okay.\nTranscript: pages 1016 to 1020.\n[41] When asked by Ms. Nastiuk about Mr. Sinclair\u2019s behaviour away from GHC, Ms. Roach-Leforte testified:\nA lot of (your) concerns were around him coming to your home unannounced in the evening for non-work related reasons. In fact, I remember driving by your home, not right by it, but on Crow Avenue and seeing his truck there, and I had asked you about it the next day, and you told me that he showed up and Tiffany, your daughter, was there and you said to her or whispered to her, you know, stay here.\nAgain, though every time you talked about things like that I said \u2013 I\u2019d ask you, you know, to do something about it, you need to do something about this. Tell him that, you know, that you don\u2019t want this happening or that it\u2019s not professional, but you were scared to do that.\nThe Chairperson: Do you remember when that was approximately?\n\u2026in the late in the summertime \u2026 of \u201905.\nTranscript: page 1027, lines 12-25; page 1028, lines 1-13.\n[42] According to Ms. Nastiuk, she asked Ms. Roach-Leforte to keep these confidences as she did not yet know how to \u2018coin\u2019 Mr. Sinclair\u2019s conduct towards her. She testified that she started to do research on the Internet on sexual harassment.\nI guess about that time, I was just like, what the heck is going on, because It wasn\u2019t like \u2013 you know, I started going to the website \u2013 the human rights website, what\u2019s the definition, what is this? Because it\u2019s not from the blatant examples of sexual harassment or those kind of behaviours on those sites, it didn\u2019t quite fit that, but it just felt \u2013 it was almost harder to deal with and more \u2013 I don\u2019t know how to \u2013 it was very intrusive. I felt very violated.\nBut you\u2019d go to the website and find out the information. It wasn\u2019t \u2013 like, other than, you know, the leering, the weight loss comments, that sort of thing, it wasn\u2019t like touching or saying you have to have sex with me or else, you have to go out for dinner with me or else, it wasn\u2019t those kinds of behaviour that you see listed on the site.\nSo what the heck is this, and it just \u2013 it wasn\u2019t \u2013 it didn\u2019t feel right. I knew it was wrong. It made me feel really bad, but by law, it didn\u2019t seem to fit that criteria that you see posted as \u2013 there were examples.\u201d\nTranscript: page 193, lines 1-25.\n[43] Ms. Nastiuk then recounted that other things started to happen, small matters: she brought an umbrella to work, then Mr. Sinclair purchased one; he knew she was a roller blade skater, he went and purchased a pair. She testified that this was a type of symbiosis and it made her feel horrible. She said that about this time, in July\/August, 2005, she developed a bald spot. She claimed that Mr. Sinclair was phoning a lot and stopping by her home frequently, always about work, but inevitably turning to personal queries that Ms. Nastiuk likened to psychoanalysis; she felt that the things he was saying didn\u2019t make sense, they weren\u2019t a reason for him to show up at her home.\n[44] During her direct testimony, Ms. Nastiuk made some very broad allegations, prompting the Chairperson to ask her to give specific examples:\nAnd I know it was about August 23rd when \u2013 he was phoning me a lot, giving me a lot of information, still stopping by frequently. It was always about work. It would turn into queries about me, but even that wasn\u2019t \u2013 that became more intense. That part of that became more intense in the fall.\nThe Chairperson: More intense, you mean more personal or more often?\nMs. Nastiuk: I wouldn\u2019t say more often but it was just like he was trying to drive his point home and it was like it kind of changed and it was more like a psychoanalysis, but that psychoanalysis is like \u2013 and he\u2019d always approach with work and then it would turn into that and I was like, what are you doing? I\u2019d be thinking, why are you doing this?\nAnd everything he was saying just didn\u2019t make sense. To me, it did not fit. I\u2019d never heard anyone say those things to me before, and it just \u2013 it did not fit.\nThe Chairperson: And when you say those things, what are those things?\nMs. Nastiuk: Those things \u2013 I don\u2019t recall exactly what those things were because they didn\u2019t fit, they infuriated me. They didn\u2019t have any place in my life for our conversations. They weren\u2019t a reason for him to show up at my house. It just \u2013 I wasn\u2019t going \u2013 it was just off the wall. Why would I retain it?\nAfter in the end, when I started finally fitting it together and just taking the blinders off and facing it, calling it more the way it was it was more like projecting. That\u2019s how it felt.\nThe Chairperson: Can you give me an example?\nMs. Nastiuk: Not really. Not \u2013 I can\u2019t really \u2013 and I know I\u2019ve tried to think about that, but, to me, they were just so off the wall, I couldn\u2019t \u2013 I couldn\u2019t retain it. \u2026\nThe Chairperson: \u2026 but I\u2019m meaning what things he said to you that \u2013 you\u2019re using strong words like horrible and inappropriate. \u2026psychoanalysis and this, but you\u2019re not giving any specific \u2026\nMs. Nastiuk: I just remember exactly the way it made me feel, and it made me mad. It made me mad that he was showing up at my house doing that. I don\u2019t even know if \u2013 after a while, like, it would just \u2013 I was just too furious and scared and the only -- like, there\u2019s one conversation the I recall or comments that he made because the others just did not fit.\u201d\nTranscript: page 196, lines 7-25; page 197, lines 1-23; page 198, lines 8-22.\n[45] Despite repeatedly testifying that she suffered in silence, and was unable to confront Mr. Sinclair and demand that he stop when he was making personal comments that she found offensive to her, Ms. Nastiuk also testified that there were occasions when she and Mr. Sinclair engaged in normal personal conversations and other occasions when she challenged him.\nG. Events Taking Place in the Fall of 2005 [46] According to Ms. Roach-Leforte, the working environment continued to deteriorate and her relationship with Ms. Nastiuk during the period of August to October 2005 suffered as a consequence.\nIn my opinion? The work environment as a whole just seemed to become very negative again. Which was \u2013 I mean, in hindsight I think I can explain it, but at the time, you know, people were getting \u2013 you know, becoming really positive about the program, we were doing things in the program that were making the work environment a good place to be, but it was becoming more negative.\nI know that Mr. Sinclair was suddenly, you know, suggesting other things to you (to Ms. Nastiuk). He was going to send you to, you know, training for this, and you had commented about how \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what it \u2013 what specific program or part of the program it was, but that he was going to have you travelling more, and on the other hand he would tell you, you know, that I was complaining about you and complaining about your work. And you would challenge me and ask, you know, did I do something wrong, and I would say no, or, you know, nothing I was aware of.\nSo I think our \u2013like, I didn\u2019t \u2013 I wasn\u2019t \u2013 I wasn\u2019t \u2013 I started becoming very suspicious about what was the truth, who was saying what? And you and I continued to discuss things, but it was \u2013 I didn\u2019t know if Mr. Sinclair, he would tell me things, and you would say no, to those things. And he would tell you things and I would say no, so we were becoming very \u2013 I don\u2019t know, poisoned I guess, just the work environment.\nTranscript: page 1029, lines 13-25; page 1030, lines 1-19.\n[47] In October 2005, Ms. Roach-Leforte and Ms. Nastiuk went to Madison, Wisconsin to participate in a week-long conference on sexual abuse and during this time were able to restore some of their relationship:\n(Ms. Roach-Leforte) \u2026 and I think just being away like that allowed you to talk more about your concerns with me. ... that you felt, you know, suffocated by the demands that he was making, the pressure of, you know, different work being assigned to you. You ... told me about a number of those incidents where he came to your home ... and again \u2026 I just said to you, you need to become more assertive, you need to put your foot down and say, you know, this is not okay.\nTranscript: page 1034, lines 20-25; page 1035, lines 1-8.\n[48] Ms. Roach-Leforte testified that Mr. Sinclair had driven them to the airport at International Falls and was there to pick them up when they returned, driving Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s car:\nWhen he picked us up I was quite impressed because Ms. Nastiuk took the keys to put our luggage in the trunk and said I\u2019m driving, and after we got over the border Mr. Sinclair said well, you can drop Gail off first, and she said no I\u2019ll drive to my house and you guys can go in your truck.\nAnd when we went to your house, put my luggage in his truck and \u2026when he got in the driver\u2019s seat he slammed the door and as we were driving away he said: what the hell is the matter with that lady?\nTranscript: page 1036, lines 6-18.\n[49] In an instance in the fall of 2005, Mr. Sinclair came to Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s home unexpectedly. Not wanting to invite him in, she immediately went outside where they spent an hour in conversation. Toward the end of this conversation, Mr. Sinclair started talking about Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s clan, and when she said it was indigenous to North America, he became insistent that she needed to do something about it:\nAnyway, so we \u2013 it was a real struggle, and I was really frustrated and I was really \u2013 I was livid. And then he finally just \u2013 he finally drove away. That evening \u2026 there was a knock on the door \u2026I knew it was him \u2026 He ended up \u2013 he just basically approached and said that he needed to apologize for the discussion that we had earlier and for his \u2013 he apologized for his behaviour.\nThere was no further conversation between him and I about that. The fall was just all about that type of \u2013 I don\u2019t know, him \u2013 well, him showing up. \u2026Not every day. I would say at \u2013 probably at least a couple times a week.\nTranscript: page 200, lines 1-7, 15-19; page 203, lines 1-4, 9-11.\nAt that very few \u2013 he did just stop by a small number of times related to a vehicle that I had. He said that he was interested in purchasing it, and I was having trouble with the other vehicle. And at some point, we had talked about him doing a little bit of work on that and I would give him a good deal on the white vehicle. But overall, like, he never \u2013 he never ended up purchasing the vehicle, but - yeah. A couple times a week average.\nTranscript: page 203, lines 18-25; page 204, lines 1-2.\n[50] Ms. Nastiuk also testified of long meetings in Mr. Sinclair\u2019s office during this period of time, often not related to work, and that he continued to show up at her home, all of which she claimed made her feel that he was attempting to manipulate her. By way of example, she recalled being at a conference in Dryden, Ontario, with others from GHC. She had arranged to get a ride back to Fort Frances with a co-worker, Mary Elder, to whom she had confided that Mr. Sinclair\u2019s behaviour toward her had made her feel uncomfortable. When Ms. Nastiuk and Ms. Elder arrived at the parking lot, Mr. Sinclair and Chief McPherson were there, and asked Ms. Nastiuk if she wanted a ride to Fort Frances. Ms. Nastiuk declined:\nI handled that in the best way that I could and I just let them know that I\u2019d already promised Mary that I would drive home with her.\nAnd Mary was somewhat aware that I was uncomfortable, but I didn\u2019t really give her a whole lot of details, because I was really unsure of how to term what was going on.\nI knew it wasn\u2019t \u2013 it wasn\u2019t appropriate, but it was still really hard to say what it was at that point \u2026\nTranscript: page 206, lines 9-21.\n[51] Ms. Nastiuk recalled another incident in the summer or fall of 2005, when she and Mr. Sinclair engaged in a conversation. Mr. Sinclair, who was from Fort Frances, began speaking about her grandmother, saying that she had a reputation for being the life of the party. Ms. Nastiuk became very angry because she found his comments to be humiliating and offensive to her:\nAnd I immediately responded. Some things I could immediately respond to and just say, you know, just that \u2013 you know, the conversation pretty much ended. I would respond like that. I responded pretty much that \u2013 that the discussion wasn\u2019t going to happen, the end of it, those things were never brought up again.\nTranscript: page 207, lines 7-13.\n[52] Ms. Nastiuk then testified about a third incident that occurred when she and Mr. Sinclair were in his truck driving towards the healing centre when he began telling her of a group training that he had participated in which they sat in a circle and everybody had to say every slang word they knew for penis and vagina:\nThat was another one I got very angry about and put the \u2013 just I \u2013 I dealt with my issues. I wouldn\u2019t deserve my bachelor of arts if I hadn\u2019t been open with that kind of stuff, and that \u2013 that was the end of that conversation. I was just like, this is so inappropriate, and it just really made me angry. And, you know, its building on to all the other things I\u2019m already feeling.\nTranscript: page 208, lines 18-25; page 209, lines 1-2.\n[53] Then Ms. Nastiuk summed up the summer\/fall of 2005, that she was having much less contact with Mr. Sinclair, that he might have lost interest in her, but this was a short-lived respite because she was told by her daughter of rumours that she was involved in a personal relationship with Mr. Sinclair. Ms. Nastiuk immediately approached Mr. Sinclair and told him about the rumours and he said he would deal with it at a staff meeting, but that he didn\u2019t want her to attend the meeting, which Ms. Nastiuk felt was wrong:\nSo I don\u2019t know really know what was said at that meeting. Nobody has ever really told me what was said at that meeting, and I just \u2013 okay, and move on.\nTranscript: page 213, lines 7-10.\nH. Events Taking Place in Winter 2005-2006 [54] Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s relationship with other staff did not improve and in December 2005, a conflict with another employee resulted in Mr. Sinclair stepping in.\nAnd then in about mid-December \u201805, Brian - Bryan Yerxa \u2013 I was working at home trying to catch up on reports because there was too many phone calls and interruptions at work, so Mr. Sinclair approved me working at home, and Brian Yerxa called me at home, and he just started kind of bellowing at me. He was angry that my office was locked and he didn\u2019t have access to a computer\u2026\nTranscript: page 213, lines 11-19.\n[55] Mr. Yerxa spoke to Mr. Sinclair who suggested that he would mediate the matter. Ms. Nastiuk told Mr. Sinclair she didn\u2019t trust that he would be able to mediate in a good way, nevertheless she reluctantly agreed to proceed. From her perspective it was a fiasco.\nI felt that I was the one that was in the wrong with those two, and I just could feel it wasn\u2019t going in a good direction. I was really angry. I was upset. I got tearful and I said, you know, I went to bed feeling totally defeated last night. It\u2019s like with the two of them combined, it just wasn\u2019t going to be good for me, and I would really hope that that portion of \u2013 that Mr. Sinclair \u2013 you know, I wasn\u2019t an issue for him anymore, and I just had the feeling that that probably wasn\u2019t the case. \u2026I said I couldn\u2019t continue. I left and \u2013 quite upset, and that was the end of that. That\u2019s usually the way everything ended.\nTranscript: page 213, lines 11-19; page 215, lines 5-15; page 217, lines 8-11.\n[56] Ms. Nastiuk testified that after the failed mediation a series of things transpired between her, Brian Yerxa, and another staff member, all similar interactions culminating in Mr. Sinclair saying the staff didn\u2019t want to work with her.\nBut I know \u2013 like, I commented to him (Mr. Sinclair) on a number of occasions that those kinds of behaviours and interactions aren\u2019t a result of me or anything that I\u2019ve got on the go with them. It\u2019s them, like, something is going on. And I think it was basically understood and probably said a number of times that those two were resentful. They wanted offices and they wanted titles and I think pretty much everybody at the centre understood that.\nTranscript: page 224, lines 7-16.\n[57] Ms. Nastiuk remembered comments by Mr. Sinclair that were disturbing to her: one relating to her differences with co-worker Brian Yerxa, whether she was an asset or too much trouble; another, whether she needed anger management; and queries about her health:\nYeah, in another telephone conversation, he \u2013 he asked me about my health issues or health concerns \u2013 health issues, and so I was like, what? I\u2019m like \u2013 I just really felt awful because after having dealt with that, having gotten past that, and going forward with life and to have that thrown at you, it was just like \u2013 I kind of responded really hotly too that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue. I\u2019m working, like 50, 60 hours a week. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any concern. And he said, no, I meant the stress. In my head, the only stress I really have is you.\nTranscript: page 230, line 4-17.\n[58] Douglas Broman, who was appointed acting case manager in early 2006, testified to the tension that existed at GHC during this period:\nTo be honest, the tension was pretty great. First of all, residential care settings are highly explosive places at times. We are working with a population of extremely angry, agitated children, so there\u2019s a lot of pressure on staff, okay. And staff cannot take it out on the children, so sometimes staff tends to \u2013 take it out on each other. I don\u2019t know any other way to say it. It\u2019s a pretty tough place to work and \u2013 there was a lot of tension, not just \u2013 there was a lot of in-fighting on the floor, you know, people with their own points of view about how a resident should be treated, and that sort of thing. So that contributed to a level of tension that made it very uncomfortable sometimes. We have to distinguish between presenting behaviours and what\u2019s really going on in a kid, and that\u2019s what the professional staff are there for, whereas on the floor itself, they\u2019re dealing with the actual behaviours of the kid as time goes on. \u2026and there was a lot of, what I would call, I guess, back stabbing, a lot of insults with just about everybody there. You know it was kind of like I would go home quite frustrated at time thinking about the atmosphere.\nTranscript: page 60, line 25; page 61, lines 1-22 and 24-25; page 62, lines 1-4.\n[59] Mr. Broman testified that he sensed between Ms. Nastiuk and the rest of the staff and with Mr. Sinclair. Mr. Broman recalled that on one occasion while he was at Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s home Mr. Sinclair arrived, unannounced, and that Ms. Nastiuk became very uncomfortable:\nYou got up, you paced, you looked for this you looked for that. You were just agitated.\nTranscript: page 52, lines 11-13.\n[60] Mr. Broman was asked whether Mr. Sinclair had commented to him regarding Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s sexual orientation and said that he had wracked his brain to remember specific instances, that there were several, half a dozen, when Sinclair had wondered whether Ms. Nastiuk was a lesbian and could Broman check it out.\n[61] Mr. Broman testified that during casual conversation Mr. Sinclair asked him whether Ms. Nastiuk might suffer from depression or have mental health problems, and that Mr. Sinclair appeared sympathetic. Mr. Broman expressed his good opinion of Mr. Sinclair and described Ms. Nastiuk as:\na person who dots the Is and crosses the Ts, a real, real good case manager because there is just so much to handle with a kid. So I learned a lot from her too, just how to be\u2014how to, you know, just handle the details with the job and create the training plans that I worked on.\nTranscript: page 66, lines 16 -24.\nI. Working on the Suicide Prevention Program [62] In early January 2006, Mr. Sinclair informed Ms. Nastiuk that funding had been approved for a suicide prevention initiative \u2013 referred to in testimony as the STAT \u2013 and that he wanted her to do research and planning for it. Ms. Nastiuk viewed Mr. Sinclair\u2019s ideas as problematic, but despite her misgivings, Ms. Nastiuk finally did agree to undertake the work and on January 21, 2006 was temporarily assigned to the program. It was a contract position, with her wages topped up for February and March. After much discussion over where she might do her work it was agreed that she would have an office in her home:\nWe purchased everything to set me up to do the work. We arranged for a fax machine, and that\u2019s how I would pass documents to him, or if we had to meet, I would go to Giizhikaandag and we\u2019d meet there to do updates on the work.\nTranscript: page 239, line 14-19.\n[63] In the last week of January Ms. Nastiuk travelled to Winnipeg to gather material for the project and also some materials for Mr. Sinclair that he needed for a ceramic program. She recalled starting work on the project in early February, that she was feeling better, less stressed, but her hopes diminished when she began asking Mr. Sinclair for program specifics and he didn\u2019t provide any. As a result Ms. Nastiuk relied on information garnered from what she referred to as the Treaty 3 description of what they required in a suicide initiative. In this period the only significant contact with Mr. Sinclair occurred on Valentine\u2019s Day when he arrived at her home with a deer feeder, some bags of deer feed and hay, and a rose from a bunch of roses that he was taking to the GHC for other staff, and then he just drove away:\nThe Chairperson: So during this time when you\u2019re working at home in February, up until Valentine\u2019s Day, did he come to your house or was he phoning you regularly or not?\nMs. Nastiuk: There really wasn\u2019t a whole lot of contact at that point that I recall specifically.\nTranscript: page 242, line 5-12.\n[64] In subsequent discussions Mr. Sinclair asked Ms. Nastiuk to become the program manager of the STAT unit. She resisted his offer on the basis of inexperience but later, in the middle of March, she felt it might be workable:\nSo, I mean there were a couple \u2013 there\u2019s first one thing. I thought it was a way that he might be using to get me to work closer with him, and I didn\u2019t want that. The other thing, on the other hand, I\u2019ve seen him before phase out jobs, and one way would be kind of \u2013 I thought that may be one way of trying to get rid of me is I accept that, the program doesn\u2019t go through, he\u2019s promised case management to someone else, I don\u2019t have a job.\nAnd, to me, any of it was likely. But just the way he was pressuring me, and you heard lot of \u2013 he just seemed to be \u2013 really be building up my confidence in myself and my competence and, I don\u2019t know something just didn\u2019t feel right about it.\nSo anyway, when he made that \u2013 I made that comment about the accountability of the staff and their ability to be honest, he turned around and he said, people lie, Marlo, that\u2019s what they do. And I was kind of, huh? My comeback was like um at work?\nAnd another comment that we had discussed, that our working \u2013 there was some tension in our working relationship, and it was me.\nWhen we\u2019re in staff meeting like, how can I work with you and you don\u2019t validate anything I say and I have to raise my voice and it\u2019s like you\u2019re ignoring me. And he said, well you know when you\u2019re involved in relationships with women, you just learn to ignore them.\nTranscript: page 244, lines 1-25; page 245, lines 1-6.\n[65] Ms. Nastiuk attended a suicide assist program in Winnipeg on March 17 to 20, 2006. During the session she was told by other attendees that they saw qualities in her that validated why Mr. Sinclair had chosen her to be the program manager. As a result Ms. Nastiuk made a note of things that she intended to discuss with Mr. Sinclair:\nJust \u2013 I was trying to word them in a way to be as gentle and non-confrontational as possible but still get my point across. Number 1, respect my space, home; Number 2, respect boundaries; Number 3, when I sense you trying to provoke me it creates ambivalence coming from you, and it makes me think you\u2019re \u2013 I can\u2019t even \u2026\nThe Chairperson: Wanting to get rid of me?\nWanting to get rid of me. Just the unprofessionalism with that. Time limited meetings, a written job description, which I kept asking for, clear leadership backing, and support of the PM (Program Manager) role.\nTranscript: page 247, lines 7-21.\nJ. Confronting Mr. Sinclair Ms. Nastiuk: So when I got back to Fort Frances, we had a meeting shortly after, and I did tell Mr. Sinclair directly that I suspected his interest in me was as more than an employee\/employer should be, that he was interested in me as a female, a relationship, and I didn\u2019t want that, that I only wanted him as a boss, someone that I could go to for guidance and support.\nThe Chairperson: Did he respond?\nMs Nastiuk: Yeah, he did. There, he said \u2013 he admitted that he did have an interest in me.\nThe Chairperson: Anything else?\nMs. Nastiuk: He talked a little bit about his \u2013 his attraction to me, his interest. And that was pretty much the end of \u2013 right at the end of the meeting. I wanted to be able to talk further about it, but I wanted to be able to talk about it with a feather in my hand and there wasn\u2019t one available that I saw, so it got left there.\n\u2026.It would be kind of like akin to swearing \u2013 like, a Bible. It\u2019s very sacred and you wouldn\u2019t \u2013 speaking dishonestly while you have a feather in your hand would be, I guess, a term could be sacrilegious. You could speak truthfully.\nTranscript: page 248, lines 6-21; page 249, lines 2-19.\n[66] Ms. Nastiuk referred to notes of a phone call from Mr. Sinclair on April 1, 2006, during which he said that he wanted to talk to her in the next week about their working relationship and that she should be very open and that it would have no impact on her work at GHC.\n[67] Then Ms. Nastiuk testified that she received a phone call from Mr. Sinclair on April 6, 2006, which he began by stating that he wanted to meet in order to discuss their relationship:\nHe started that meeting on April 6th stating that I had wanted to meet in order to discuss our working relationship that adversely \u2013 was adversely affected by the personal relationship, and I\u2019m just like, what is he talking about? He just keeps referring to a personal relationship, but I have to let that go. And then I put it back on him, no, it was you.\nAnd then he went on to say, Marlo, I believe that I represent everything that you hate about men and that, yes, he had an interest in me as a woman but, no, he wouldn\u2019t have gone out with me. And \u2013 oh, yeah, that he never found himself in this position before, and I kind of stopped and \u2013 what \u2013 what position were you talking about?\nAnd he says, having an interest in a \u2013 woman that he worked with, a female that he worked with or in the workplace \u2013 I think it was \u2013 and I don\u2019t think too much more was said on that piece at the time.\nThen, of course, he continued to say that the work relationship was my fault. He kept pushing \u2013 trying to push it on to me. I kept putting the shield up, trying to push it back on him. No, that\u2019s yours. And, again, I told him about \u2013 that it was his interest in me that was at the bottom of all of this.\nHe started talking about how it was difficult for me to talk about my personal life, and he started talking about how other staff go to him, so why can\u2019t I? And I let him know that because I believe that personal things don\u2019t belong in the workplace and I\u2019m thinking because I really don\u2019t \u2013 you know, I don\u2019t want to talk to you about my personal life. Why do I need to?\nAnd then he let me know that he wasn\u2019t sure that he was still interested in having me as the program manager of the STAT unit because I was not enthusiastic enough. He told me that he \u2013 what was that comment that day? ... Yeah, I let him know that it was not easy to tell him directly that I suspect his interest in me was of a personal nature, because what if I was wrong, particularly given the types of behaviours.\nTranscript: page 256, lines 21-25; page 257, lines 1-25; page 258, lines 1-19.\n[68] The following day, Ms. Nastiuk and Mr. Sinclair had another discussion about their relationship. Ms. Nastiuk alleges that during this conversation, Mr. Sinclair told her that he believed that she had a \u2018deep rooted fear of and abhorrence for\u2019 admitting that she was a lesbian and that she fought against it. Ms. Nastiuk stated that she was outraged by the discussion and afterwards, could not concentrate or focus on her work.\n[69] On April 14, 2006, Mr. Sinclair called Ms. Nastiuk and made, what Ms. Nastiuk described as \u2018an attempt at an apology\u2019 for his previous comments. According to Ms. Nastiuk, Mr. Sinclair also informed Ms. Nastiuk that he had discussed, in broad terms, some of the issues in their relationship with his friend Chief McPherson.\nK. Events Leading up to the Complaint [70] Ms. Nastiuk testified that after April 14, 2006, she made a number of anonymous telephone calls to obtain advice on how she might deal with Mr. Sinclair:\n\u2026because I know that First Nations people do not like to go to outside agencies to help deal with issues. I made a number of calls \u2026to Grand Council Treaty 3 for this treaty area \u2013 anonymously. Didn\u2019t tell them, other than what was kind of going on, to see if they had any suggestions. They didn\u2019t, other than that I call the female chief that has this portfolio.\nTranscript: page 270, lines 2-12.\n[71] Ms. Nastiuk had a one-hour telephone conversation with Chief Pamela Johnson who informed her that they had no resources and no real suggestions other than talking circles:\nSo I just wanted that on the record and that I\u2019d gone through a series of conversations with other people to try to keep this stuff in before it was brought here.\nTranscript: page 271, lines 2-6.\n[72] On April 20, 2006, Mr. Sinclair met with Ms. Nastiuk to discuss her work on the STAT unit. Ms. Nastiuk told Mr. Sinclair that she was struggling with the work and was having trouble staying focused and concentrating. According to Ms. Nastiuk, Mr. Sinclair suggested that she take some time off, and that she could even take a short-term disability leave, for up to a year if need be.\n[73] Following this conversation, Ms. Nastiuk took some time off, during which she consulted a counselor to help deal with her anxiety which she felt was the direct result of her conflict with Mr. Sinclair. On April 24th, 2006, she also consulted a lawyer who said to her: \u201cMarlo: It seems to me that you are not disabled but the victim of abusive behavior. Do not let anyone tell you that you are sick or require medical attention, if that is not the case\u201d.\n[74] Ms. Nastiuk therefore returned to work in May as Case Manager but claims that she continued to be distracted and was unable to stay focused. She suffered from major headaches and diarrhea, particularly when in proximity or contact with Mr. Sinclair.\n[75] On May 31st a written reprimand was placed in Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s personnel file:\nI went to a job interview the morning of May 30th. I was supposed to speak at a staff meeting about case management. The week before, I told Brian Yerxa a couple of times that they shouldn\u2019t put me on the agenda until after 11am that morning. I believe that was a Tuesday. So Monday \u2013 it would have been the day before I talked to Rick Adams, the other team leader, I\u2019m thinking just in case Brian didn\u2019t remember, to not put me on the agenda until after 11am on the May 30th staff meeting.\nThe Chairperson: But you didn\u2019t tell Mr. Sinclair and he was your immediate supervisor?\nMs. Nastiuk: Yes.\nThe Chairperson: And is that the personnel policy? Was that at the time?\nMs. Nastiuk: (Inaudible) this would be a double standard. Staff seems to come and go as they please. It didn\u2019t matter whether they were on-call or management they had freedoms and didn\u2019t have that kind of reporting requirement on them that I did. Under normal circumstances, but, yeah.\nThe Chairperson: And at this time May 30th, May 31st, were you working from home mostly or from an office?\nMs. Nastiuk: I ended up going back to the healing centre May \u2013 the beginning of May after a call I had with lawyers through the lawyer referral service, and he said to me \u2013 he read a letter, I did not read my documentation. He said, Marlo, I just get the sense that this man cares about you. Maybe he\u2019s going about it inappropriately, so I felt because of that, okay, he\u2019s not defining it. I have to go back \u2013 try to go back to the workplace. \u2026 So I was there.\nTranscript: page 272, lines 17-25; page 273, lines 1-25; page 274, lines 1-6.\nL. Meeting with Chief McPherson [76] On June 14, 2006, Ms. Nastiuk met with Chief McPherson and made a complaint against Mr. Sinclair stating that Mr. Sinclair had abused his position of authority and power over her and discriminated against her in the course of her employment. Ms. Nastiuk claimed that Mr. Sinclair, as her supervisor and the Executive Director of GHC, had engaged in:\npersistent and demeaning conduct towards myself based on sex; made demeaning comments related to my disability; spoke of and wanted to speak further regarding my sexual orientation. Mr. Sinclair\u2019s conduct has included a range of violations that were unwelcome and extended beyond the workplace that have been demeaning, persistent and abusive in nature. The result has been the creation of a negative and unacceptable psychological and emotional environment for work.\n[77] Following a number of conversations between Ms. Nastiuk and Chief McPherson, a mediation meeting was scheduled for June 22, 2006:\nAfter a number of conversations between Chief McPherson and I, this was the culmination of that, and I prepared this list of certain things that I wanted addressed at the informal mediation that he had talked to me about.\nAnd actually how that came about, we had a number of calls. We decided to go with an informal mediation. He wanted me to just go into a meeting with just him and Mr. Sinclair and myself, and I said I couldn\u2019t do that, that I would need a support person. \u2026So there were the four of us. We went through this. The underlying portions are basically what I typed up (ahead of time and took to the meeting). \u2026I got to speak a little bit, but Mr. Sinclair did most of the speaking. And he had an issue with things in here.\n\u2026At the end of the meeting, Chief McPherson told me that I had a job to go to, but that no changes would be made because that would be admitting to Tom being guilty and he wasn\u2019t prepared to do that, and he made a comment about, for example, say if I gave you $5000, that would be admitting he\u2019s guilty and I can\u2019t do that.\nOne of the last comments was I was to get back to him with what I wanted. But I walked out of there thinking, well, he just told me he\u2019s not going to do anything, so I went to the Commission.\nTranscript: page 274, lines 13-25; page 275, lines 1-25; page 276, lines 1-9.\n[78] According to Ms. Roach-Leforte, Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s complaint was not the first complaint CFN had received against Mr. Sinclair. In her testimony, Ms. Roach-Leforte stated that in May, 2006, shortly before Ms. Nastiuk met with Chief McPherson, she had filed a complaint with CFN against Mr. Sinclair pertaining to what she perceived as Mr. Sinclair\u2019s unprofessional behavior towards herself and the staff.\n[79] When asked why she had complained to Dale Morrisseau, CFN\u2019s Manager, Ms. Roach-Leforte testified that the alleged behavior was not of the same degree or as ongoing as experienced by Ms. Nastiuk, and that the complaints made by other members of the staff were not of sexual harassment but related to the power and control that Mr. Sinclair had over the GHC program.\n[80] She also stated that the reason she had not gone to Chief McPherson on the behalf of Ms. Nastiuk was that she, too, was scared for her job. (Transcript: Page 1127, line 5-25; page 1128, line 1-24).\nM. The Complaints [81] On July 25, 2006, Ms. Nastiuk filed complaint 20060869 against CFN and complaint 20061038 against Mr. Sinclair alleging sexual harassment in the workplace between March 2005 and July 2006.\n[82] Ms. Nastiuk went on sick leave from June 1, 2006 until June 4, 2006, then took three weeks of vacation time, and remained off work until January 28, 2007. In October 2006, Ms. Nastiuk met with Chief and council and produced written requests that she said weren\u2019t demands but were to serve as a basis to negotiate or mediate her complaint. Included in her request was, as a compromise, a statement that she would accept a new job with CFN, but not at GHC.\n[83] While this was transpiring, Ms. Nastiuk made a claim for employment insurance benefits on the basis that she had been constructively dismissed, which she termed as \u201cdisguised\u201d dismissal:\nMs. Bryson: So are you telling us you were constructively dismissed by Mr. Sinclair at that time?\nMs. Nastiuk: The circumstances, it was a constructive dismissal.\nMs. Bryson: By who?\nMs. Nastiuk: There were reasons why I could not go back to the healing centre, and Mr. Sinclair was a big part of that. The way the program was set up to run, it was all part of it. It was \u2013\nMs. Bryson: But I\u2019m asking you, who terminated you? That\u2019s what I\u2019m asking you?\nMs. Nastiuk: It was a constructive dismissal. I left.\nMs. Bryson: But by whom? Mr. Sinclair or Chief and Council \u2026?\nMs. Nastiuk: Well, it would be both because Couchiching was not around to practice due diligence. Mr. Sinclair was allowed to run the program, hire and fire as he saw fit.\nTranscript: page 628, lines 4-25; page 629, line 1.\n[84] Throughout this period Ms. Nastiuk made several attempts to secure other employment. On October 24, 2006, she interviewed for a position as Probation Officer at the Manitoba Department of Justice. Ms. Nastiuk was told that she had done well in the interview. However, the contact person in charge of the hiring process, Rose Bear, subsequently informed Ms. Nastiuk that she had been unable to obtain a reference from Mr. Sinclair and that this was essential to the process as he was the executive director of GHC. Ms. Nastiuk also unsuccessfully applied to the positions of Post-secondary Education Counselor, Housing Administrator, Family Service Worker and Special Education Assistant, all positions with CFN.\n[85] In December 2006, Ms. Nastiuk presented CFN\u2019s manager, Dale Morrisseau with a list of terms and conditions being the basis on which she would return to work at GHC as case manager, particularly including no direct contact with Mr. Sinclair.\nMs. Bryson: Okay. So I want to be clear. From the time in June 2006 that you brought this to Couchiching First Nation\u2019s attention, Mr. Sinclair never had independent contact with you again at your home or on your home phone, did he?\nMs. Nastiuk: During June, I believe there was \u2013\nMs. Bryson: No, I\u2019m saying after the meeting with the chief in June \u2013 late June 2006?\nMs. Nastiuk: No, I can\u2019t recall.\nMs. Bryson: So the only contact you would have had with Mr. Sinclair after that point would have been when you were back in the GHC workplace, correct?\nMs. Nastiuk: Yes.\nMs. Bryson: And that was under the terms and conditions you agreed upon with Mr. Morrisseau and Mr. Sinclair, correct?\nMs. Nastiuk: Mr. Morrisseau agreed with the terms and conditions that I drafted up at the direction of Commission or with their recommendation.\nTranscript: page 641, lines 3-25; page 642, lines 1-2.\n[86] Ms. Nastiuk then returned to work at GHC, an experience she described as traumatic. According to Ms. Nastiuk, despite the terms of the agreement for her return to work, Mr. Sinclair persisted in his invasion of her personal boundaries and CFN did nothing effective to change his actions and omissions from occurring:\nMs. Nastiuk: The reason why I left was the way that Mr. Sinclair was belittling me and totally changed the responsibilities of my \u2013 job description and I could see over the prior couple of weeks that it was escalating again and I knew I \u2013 I did not feel safe, particularly with the mediation coming up. And I figured it was just going to get worse \u2013 I knew it was going to get worse, so that is why I left.\nMs. Bryson: And how did you know that?\nMs. Nastiuk: Because it was obvious. There was a pattern. Every \u2013 when he was \u2013 it was like \u2013 when I was back during 2007, once in a while I would go outside my office and he would be sitting right \u2013 in a chair right outside my office and I thought, well, jeez, that\u2019s really totally against this agreement, and then I\u2019d later get a phone call from Krista Dezaso and find out that she had actually talked with Mr. Sinclair earlier that day. So to me, that was intimidation.\nMs. Bryson: You didn\u2019t file a grievance about that with CFN, did you?\nMs. Nastiuk: I could not file a grievance about everything, but I am sure that I discussed those kind of things, not every single time, there was so much and I couldn\u2019t always stop and call Dale and say, Dale.\nBut I quite often let Dale know, whether it was in writing or phone calls. And after a while, it was probably easier just to call than do all the documentation.\nMs. Bryson: But you didn\u2019t call \u2013\nMs. Nastiuk: Where was it going? It was going nowhere, no matter what I let Dale know about. It wasn\u2019t getting better, it was getting worse.\nTranscript: page 663, lines 14-25; page 664, 1-25; page 665, lines 102.\n[87] In August 2007, acting under his authority as band manager, Mr. Morrisseau authorized Ms. Nastiuk to be off work until a previously arranged Human Rights Commission mediation occurred. Both Mr. Morrisseau and Ms. Nastiuk had hoped to use a Commission mediation to resolve her entire complaint.\n[88] On or about August 15, 2007, Mr. Morrisseau delivered mediated terms of settlement to Chief and Council, however, to his and Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s dismay, the settlement was rejected. In the same period and coincidentally, Mr. Sinclair terminated his employment with CFN, having found more suitable employment with another First Nation.\n[89] Ms. Nastiuk did not return to the workplace and filed a constructive dismissal complaint with Human Resources Services Development Canada in November 2007.\nN. The Retaliation Complaint [90] On March 31, 2008, Ms. Nastiuk filed a complaint of retaliation against CFN under s. 14.1 of the CHRA, alleging it had occurred \u201cAugust, 16, 2006 and ongoing\u201d.\n[91] Ms. Nastiuk argues that CFN was obligated to provide a healthy and safe workplace and failed to do so. She also argues that CFN failed to prevent, or respond appropriately to her complaint even though it had knowledge of the specific details. According to Ms. Nastiuk, CFN provided no preventive measures and failed to take effective remedial action and decrease the consequences and harms to her.\nIII. Response of Mr. Sinclair [92] Mr. Sinclair is an Ojibwa, born and raised in Fort Frances, the seventh of nine children. He grew up in a family with a very good mother and an abusive father. Mr. Sinclair worked in construction for a masonry contractor, learned the trade and started his own business while still working for the contractor. By this time he was in his mid-20s, a married man, the father of two children. With physical labour wearing him down Mr. Sinclair began searching for a way to become a counsellor and succeeded:\nAnd so for the past 30 years, I\u2019ve committed my life to working with First Nations people, children and families, and to develop healing services for my people. And I\u2019ve developed many programs and services over the years.\nTranscript: page 2079, lines 22-25; page 2080, line 1.\n[93] In late 2005, Mr. Sinclair received a call from Chief McPherson\u2019s requesting his assistance in resolving a management crisis at the Band\u2019s Giizhikaandag Healing Centre in Fort Frances. Within a week Mr. Sinclair had reviewed GHC\u2019s program, its results and financial information, and developed a restructuring plan.\n[94] The restructuring plan was presented to the provincial ministry, with Chief McPherson and Ms. Roach-Leforte in attendance. GHC was given a provisional licence to continue to operate for three months, but restricted to four youths in treatment rather than its normal maximum of eight youths.\nA. Working with Ms. Nastiuk [95] Mr. Sinclair described the situation he was faced with and how he worked with Ms. Roach-Leforte and Ms. Nastiuk:\n\u2026My primary contact was Gail Roach-Leforte. \u2026So in the early days, there was Gail and myself looking at work that had to be done to improve the service to make changes to the service at Giizhikaadag Healing Centre.\nNow, I needed a person to do the word processing, typing. Now there was developmental work I had to do, but we had four boys in care and I decided that the best way to do that, to allow me to do my work, is to have Gail look after the treatment component, primarily focus on the treatment component, the existing program, and I would attend to the work, developmental work to improve the service. And that\u2019s what happened.\nA part of that is the word processing. Now, I\u2019m terrible at the computer and typing. I\u2019ve always had staff that did that work. And I informed Gail that I needed somebody, I needed to bring somebody in that can do that and do it well. She recommended Marlo Nastiuk, who was \u2013 worked at Giizhikaandag as a relief worker.\nNow, Gail and Marlo had met some time previously \u2026 Gail said she knew that Marlo would, you know, like to get more hours in, had excellent typing skills, and so I arranged to have Marlo come in to meet with myself. That happened. Talked about the work that had to be done. And \u2013 and you know, like \u2013 like, a service manual and other documents and so on that had to be improved. And that was \u2013 we \u2013 we had worked things out and she agreed that she would do that work.\nTranscript: page 2097, lines 8-25; page 2098, lines 1-7, 12-20.\n[96] Mr. Sinclair testified that there was a large room outside his office in which there was a table commonly used for staff meetings and conferencing. He said Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s first workstation was in that room at a separate table in the corner where she had her computer and other office equipment:\n\u2026 meetings would still happen in that outer area, and with her trying to do her work in the corner of that same room while some meetings were going on, she came to me and said this is impossible. This is not working. And Ms. Nastiuk suggested that in my office, if I moved a couple of pieces of the furniture, she could move her equipment into my office, in the corner of my office, and that was a suggestion of Ms. Nastiuk.\n\u2026it was a very unusual situation. I was leery of it. She talked more about it and it\u2019s actually the way my wife and I work when I am doing, from my home, developmental work. \u2026\nI agreed that her desk would come into the corner of my office and it would get her out of that place where meetings were going on and \u2013 and that\u2019s what happened.\n\u2026Marlo\u2019s office ended up being in that other building after a period of time \u2026\nTranscript: page 2108, lines 5-17; page 2109, lines 2-5, 22-23.\n[97] Mr. Sinclair testified about his working arrangement with Ms. Nastiuk in the initial three-month restructuring of GHC\u2019s program:\n\u2026I would go over the pages, make changes for this new program, give them to her, she would make the changes on the computer. And the timeframe to restructure this program was three months \u2026a tremendous amount of work had to happen because it\u2019s not just the service manual. There were changes taking place in other areas of the program.\nThere were reports, and there had not been a director for a period of time. There were reports that had to get done, that were behind. So there was catch-up work in areas; there was new development work happening at the same time \u2026it was real busy...\nBut in addition to that, there was other work that was happening. There was documents that we were behind, so sometimes we\u2019d leave that work on the service manual and do some other work that had to get done. So it was catch-up work also. \u2026\nTranscript: page 2110, lines 19-25; page 2111, lines 1-7, 21-25; page 2112, line 1.\n[98] Mr. Sinclair testified that he had personal conversations with Ms. Nastiuk during the first three months of restructuring of GHC\u2019s program:\nYou know, there were times when we\u2019d stop work, have a coffee, and chitchat, talk. And you know, it wasn\u2019t long \u2013 it didn\u2019t take long to realize that Ms. Nastiuk \u2026had some very good skills. \u2026She was committed to the work that had to get done.\nWorking all day on this stuff and having a break at supper or having a break with the boys or whatever it was for supper, going out and getting some chicken or something and bringing it back to have as supper, things like that happened and the work would continue into the \u2013 into evening. Take a break, have a coffee, and \u2013 and at times talk.\nIt didn\u2019t take long to realize that this \u2013 individual, you know, with this new degree, she was \u2013 had been seeking employment, but had not been \u2013 and she shared this with me that she had not been successful \u2026But it was evident that she had skills, and \u2026that she learned quickly.\nDuring our breaks, most of the talk was about work. Work that was being done, work that had been done, but there was times we\u2019d talk about a TV show or whatever, you know? Our coffee breaks would be ten minutes, 15 minutes, and we\u2019d get back to work. Most of the time, the work would go till 6:30 seven o\u2019clock on this manual or other documents that had to be done - completed.\nTranscript: page 2113, lines 10-25; page 2114, lines 1-17.\n[99] Mr. Sinclair returned to the subject of personal talk a little later in his direct evidence:\nDuring the coffee breaks, after a period of time \u2013 I think when Ms. Nastiuk and I got to know each other a little bit after working together for a period of time, some of the conversation could change from work-related to personal. She talked about \u2013 you know, she had a daughter and we\u2019d be able to talk about her daughter. And there was my wife and my son in Thunder Bay, and my children and my grandchildren in Sault Ste. Marie. So I think that as we, you know, worked together, there was a comfort level of getting to know each other that happened over a period of time.\nThere\u2019s times when, you know, other than taking a break for supper \u2013 run down to the gas bar and they \u2013 they had chicken meals and that you could prepare. And, you know, I\u2019d run down and get that and bring it back and supper would be right there. After supper, the work would continue for an hour or so and things like that. \u2026This arrangement went on for \u2013 geez let\u2019s see. It was into February when we hired Ms. Nastiuk. March, April \u2013 a couple of months probably I would say.\nThe Chairperson: By this arrangement you mean with her desk being in your office?\nMr. Sinclair: In my office, that\u2019s correct.\nTranscript: page 2120, lines 11-25; page 2121, lines 1-4, 9-18.\n[100] Mr. Sinclair testified that during this hectic three-month period, he would, from time to time, provide updates to a restructuring committee consisting of the Chief, Councillor Dick Bird, Ms. Roach-Leforte, and a staff member compiling minutes of the meeting.\n[101] In his evidence Mr. Sinclair described how he had reorganized the staff and their roles, filled vacancies, and arranged for professional consultants to be available, that he created a new position of Case Manager because GHC\u2019s practice of using frontline workers to create reports resulted in inconsistencies that he attributed to their differing writing skills. It is likely that he accepted the advice of Ms. Roach-Leforte in this regard. Ultimately, Ms. Nastiuk became the first case manager at GHC. Mr. Sinclair was a member of the selection committee:\nB. Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s Relations with GHC Staff [102] In response to Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s allegations that the work environment at GHC was hostile, both CFN counsel and Mr. Sinclair questioned Ms. Nastiuk about her part in this problem.\nMr. Sinclair: Ms. Nastiuk, how many times did you think you may have \u2013 you know, you come to me about issues related to your co-workers.\nMs. Nastiuk: I don\u2019t know, quite a few.\nMr. Sinclair: Okay. And were you aware that your co-workers also came to me with issues related to you?\nMs. Nastiuk: I was aware of two or three of them.\nMr. Sinclair: Okay. So you\u2019re then aware that I had to meet with your co-workers who came forward to me with issues related to yourself in the workplace?\nMs. Nastiuk: You had told me that you had met with two or thereof them, yes.\nMr. Sinclair: Okay. Did you enjoy your work as a case manager at Giizhikaandag?\nMs. Nastiuk: Yes.\nMr. Sinclair: Did you enjoy your contact with the boys at Giizhikaandag?\nMs. Nastiuk: Yes, I did.\nC. MS. Nastiuk\u2019s Health Issues - testimony of Mr. Sinclair Mr. Sinclair: During those early months of working, after hiring Ms. Nastiuk, she informed me of some medical health issues that \u2013 that she had that could affect her work. That was appreciated.\nI \u2013 I \u2013 she informed me that she had fibromyalgia, and I was not that familiar with it and she educated me as to what fibromyalgia was. And the reason I bring it up is that Ms. Gail Roach-Leforte and I were both concerned that Ms. Nastiuk \u2013 was working too much and taking too much work home and not getting proper rest, and that would further affect her health. And so we stopped her. When we\u2019d see her coming out of her building with a big armful of work for the night, and let her know that this was not a thing we wanted her to do. And that even at work, because of the fibromyalgia, she worked through lunch hours. A very committed person, for sure, to the work that had to get done, but to the point of \u2013 of neglecting her \u2013 her own health.\nAnd so, you know, we had to \u2013 I had to talk to her about not staying at the office at lunch hour, but if you \u2013 she wanted to stay at the office, it wasn\u2019t to be working. She should take a walk, and exercise is required for people with fibromyalgia. You should take \u2013 go for a walk, relax, get away from the workplace and so on.\nSo as - as her supervisor, I think that special attention had been paid to assist this employee to \u2013 and to help her to remain in the workplace by reminding her of what she was supposed to be doing to look after her health. And that happened \u2013 I know, that is at \u2013 those things happened a number of times.\nTranscript: page 2159, lines 22-25; page 2160, lines 1-25; page 2161, lines 1-6.\nD. Mr. Sinclair\u2019s Response to Particular Allegations of Harassment\n(i) Humiliation [103] In cross examination Mr. Sinclair posed very appropriate questions to the Complainant, putting to her a version of interactions between them which differed with her direct evidence. By doing this he afforded Ms. Nastiuk an opportunity in the course of her own testimony to agree or disagree with his version.\n[104] A significant point in Mr. Sinclair\u2019s cross examination occurred when he directed Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s attention to Exhibit C-2, tab 71, under the section titled \u201chumiliation\u201d, and he read a portion to her.\n\u2018Mr. Sinclair made every attempt to mentally, emotionally, spiritually and physically subjugate me by creating a dependency on him because he had succeeded in getting other staff to dislike me and to marginalize me.\u2019 Quite serious. How did I go about doing this Ms. Nastiuk?\nMs. Nastiuk: Which piece? This isn\u2019t very \u2013\nMr. Sinclair: Because he had succeeded in getting other staff to dislike me, that portion of that section. This is in relation to \u2013\n\u2026\nMs. Nastiuk: Okay. Where do I start with that? We\u2019ve moved upstairs to work with you and Gail, staff perceived I was getting special treatment that other staff would \u2013 should have been more likely the choice, as they had been there longer. Special treatment? Bringing me coffee and cookies, keeping me in your office for long hours, and you knew that on the floor, staff were having a lot if issues with it, these types of things. When I asked you to address some of these you refused to. And later on, as time went on there was a type of \u2013 I don\u2019t know whether triangulation is the right word, pitting us against each other.\nThe Chairperson: Who is \u201cus\u201d?\nMs. Nastiuk: Various staff. I mean, that \u2013 that didn\u2019t happen that to just me, it happened to other staff, and that staff would be ticked off and you would go through that process, but in this case, I guess pointing to just me, Mr. Sinclair pointed out that staff did not like me, so therefore when I started case management he directed me to go directly to him for reports, information that I needed for the boys for my plan of cares to him. I couldn\u2019t go directly to staff. There were \u2013 an example would be one day I went to work and my case management \u2013 case manager file cabinet was gone. Like I didn\u2019t know where it was, the record cabinet, which is supposed to be locked at all times.\nThe Chairperson: Is it like a file cabinet?\nMs. Nastiuk: Like a metal cabinet. Like, there was two drawers (inaudible) a couple of shelves that the boys kept records and underneath there was some drawers. I was looking around, trying to figure out where the case records were. Diane Bart (ph) came out and she talked to me about that and asked me how that made me feel? And I told her that \u2013 I guess at that point I said, okay, just another \u2013 another slam against me.\nMr. Sinclair: Where was the cabinet?\nMs. Nastiuk: Well, once I went downstairs I saw that it was in front staff office. Diane and \u2013 Diane Morrison and Georgina (inaudible) at the time, and Mike Henderson was present also, and I asked who had moved the case record cabinet. And they didn\u2019t really say a whole lot, but as I was walking away they made a \u2013 or Georgina made a comment about why would we have to bother getting her permission or something to that effect, who is she to decide whether or not we take the case record cabinet. And I turned around, walked back in, Mike was right there and I said since when does staff just go into \u2013 an office building and remove furniture? And that was never addressed and there were a number of things like that that never addressed.\nStaff got to see that I could be disrespected, it was never addressed. Even when you\u2019d ask Mr. Sinclair directly, that never happened. His answer to that was just get me a new case record cabinet. I\u2019m not saying that my difficulties with staff were all Mr. Sinclair\u2019s doing, and I talked about that yesterday, I believe, or in the last couple of days when I referred to talking about my education, trying to \u2013 thinking it would be helpful and realized it wasn\u2019t it was harmful.\nMr. Sinclair: The example that you provided doesn\u2019t go very far in answering the question, the file cabinet scenario.\nThe Chairperson: That\u2019s fair.\nMs. Nastiuk: Well, I don\u2019t know what was going on behind the scene, but they\u2019re definitely problems. I mean, I can\u2019t speak to those because nobody ever \u2013 like, all of them \u2013 I can speak to \u2013\nThe Chairperson: Well, I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m trying to help the flow of this, not get in the way, but when your were asked the question \u2013\nMs Nastiuk: Okay.\nThe Chairperson: - you gave some examples. You said when you were moved upstairs or you moved upstairs it was perceived as special treatment, you were kept in the office long hours, he would bring you coffee or tea and cookies. When you asked that he deal with these things, then other things like the cabinet, he refused or it just did not happen, that he engaged in triangulation, pitting you against other staff members, and this happened with staff members other than yourself as well. Do you have anything to add to that?\nMs. Nastiuk: Um \u2013\nThe Chairperson: And you also said your problems with staff were not all his doing, but you\u2019re saying he did those things?\nMs. Nastiuk: Yes. I don\u2019t know, like, I can\u2019t say for sure, but I know that there was the effect after contact with Mr. Sinclair, particularly Brian, Diane and Ida, it was like they all thought that they could have my job, and they all treated me \u2013 they were very rude, disrespectful. Their behaviour went unhampered, in fact over time it got worse, until Dale intervened with at least Ida and he would dismiss me and Barb from meetings. It was like the disrespect just got bigger and bigger and bigger. Treat us disrespectful, without dignity, humiliate us, and that was okay.\nTranscript: page 920, lines 15-25; page 921, lines 1-3, 8-25; page 922, lines 1-25; page 923, lines 1-25; page 924, lines 1-25; page 925, lines 1-25.\n(ii) Sexual Comments [105] Toward the end of his cross examination of Ms. Nastiuk, Mr. Sinclair became very specific and dealt with Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s allegations that he had made a number of sexual comments to her.\nMr. Sinclair: Throughout your documentation, Ms. Nastiuk, you refer to sexual comments made by myself. Can you give me an example of that?\nMs. Nastiuk: Sexual comments? Oh, I dated his wife, I dated his partner, women like me, the non-native women.\nMr. Sinclair: What does that have to do with sex?\nMs. Nastiuk: Well, like, it wasn\u2019t appropriate. To me it was like you were kind of telling something about yourself then, it just didn\u2019t feel right. It \u2013\nMr. Sinclair: In what \u2013\nMs. Nastiuk: -- made me uncomfortable.\nMr. Sinclair: Okay. In what context, those things that you mentioned, in what context and where did this happen?\nMs. Nastiuk: I happened typically in your office while we were standing outside.\nMr. Sinclair: No, those comments you just made is what I\u2019m referring to. Where did that happen? Where did that take place?\nMs. Nastiuk: Oh, I dated his wife, oh, I dated his partner, women like me, those comments?\nMr. Sinclair: In a conversation you and I had? The context is important, Ms Nastiuk.\nMs. Nastiuk: The context?\nMr. Sinclair: To say something like that is a harmful thing, okay, can be a very harmful thing. So it\u2019s clear, in what conversation and where did the conversation take place that that is crystal clear?\nMs. Nastiuk: When we were standing outside your office at the top of the stairs. You had made that comment I remember at least one guy coming into the centre that had a kid there, saying, oh, I dated his wife. I don\u2019t recall any context.\nMr. Sinclair: Who was that individual, do you know that?\nMs. Nastiuk: Dick Spencer. Dick Spencer.\nMr. Sinclair: And what was my response as to when I dated his wife?\nMs. Nastiuk: That\u2019s what you said.\nMr. Sinclair: Was he married? Was she married?\nMs. Nastiuk: I have no idea.\nMr. Sinclair: Were we teenagers?\nMs. Nastiuk: I have no idea. All you said was I dated his wife.\nMr. Sinclair: You don\u2019t recall a response on my part to that?\nMs Nastiuk: A response to what? You made the comment, why would you respond? I didn\u2019t respond. I kind of just stepped back.\nMr. Sinclair: Are you saying everything about that comment, or are you omitting something Ms. Nastiuk? Are you leaving some out of what I said?\nMs. Nastiuk: Those comments about I dated his wife, or oh, I dated his partner, those kind of just came out of the blue as far as I recall. Sometimes you might have been talking about when you were younger and enjoying the (inaudible).\nMr. Sinclair: In this particular time is that what I was talking about?\n...\nMs. Nastiuk: The context of the overall \u2013 or not conversations, because it was just you talking and telling me, you were referring to I think the \u201860s, so when you were younger, with some of those comments. And you really enjoyed the freedom from the \u201860s. I didn\u2019t ask you to clarify, I didn\u2019t comment back you just talked and told me that.\nMr. Sinclair: Ms. Nastiuk, you\u2019re talking about the truth there, okay. And where did that conversation take place? Your memory is coming back, where did that conversation \u2013\nMs. Nastiuk: Your office.\nMr. Sinclair: - take place?\nMs. Nastiuk: Your office or sometimes the comments \u2013 it\u2019s mostly your office, but, like, the oh, I dated his wife partner, I remember those more \u2013 it happened in your office, but more outside, when we were standing having a cigarette at the top of the stairs. And then one time you had made the comment that women like you, non-native women too, when we were in your vehicle on April 7, 2006, in front of my house. That was at the end of telling me all about my lesbianism and relationships with men, sexual activity with men.\nMr. Sinclair: April 7th, what year?\nMs. Nastiuk: April 7th, it was a Friday, 2006. That was the day that you told STAT unit (inaudible) people were going to be there. That was the day I had an appointment with the eye specialist at Dr. Ludke\u2019s. That date can be verified. That (inaudible) but you made that comment prior.\nMr. Sinclair: And I gave you a ride home that day, did I?\nMs. Nastiuk: You did.\nMr. Sinclair: And how did that come out? Were you \u2013 you had a vehicle?\nMs. Nastiuk: I had told you at least a month prior that I had an appointment with an eye specialist or \u2013 it was at least a couple weeks prior I had let you know that I had an appointment with the eye specialist because you said there would be a \u2013 maybe it was just a couple of days prior, but I knew that you knew before that day that I had an appointment with the eye specialist, and then the day or two before you told me that you were meeting Treaty 3 April 7th to present the STAT unit, so I had to e-mail everything to you on the 6th. And I was kind of surprised at that because I knew that I was going to have drops in my eyes so I wouldn\u2019t be able to drive, so Tiffany drove me to the centre because I said, well, I could make myself available to fill in any information or gaps of information that you don\u2019t have while presenting.\nSo I got there, there were no Treaty 3 people there, you were in a case conference I believe, and I didn\u2019t know what to do because Tiffany was, it was (inaudible) and Tiff had my vehicle, I did not know how to get ahold of her, you volunteered to drive me home.\nMr. Sinclair: You were there for a meeting \u2013 is this right, you \u2013\nMs. Nastiuk: I kind of invited myself to that STAT unit presentation. You agreed that I could show up.\n...\nMr. Sinclair: Okay. Throughout what you have written you talk and refer to sexualized comments on numerous occasions. You didn\u2019t talk about the context though of which \u2013 and where that happened: is that correct?\nMs. Nastiuk: I don\u2019t recall what\u2019s specifically in my documentation. I don\u2019t know why I would have. I don\u2019t recall any real discussion, I just remember you always telling me.\n\u2026\nMr. Sinclair: (to the Chairperson) Her response, you heard it, and it didn\u2019t clarify in what context that was \u2013that was made or what conversation \u2013 where the conversation took place, she didn\u2019t respond to that.\nMs. Nastiuk: Yes, I did; your office, or outside at the top of the stairs, outside your \u2013upstairs in your building.\nMr. Sinclair: Well, there were conversations that took there \u2013 certainly place there, certainly, Ms. Nastiuk, but this particular conversation is the one that we\u2019re dealing with.\nMs. Nastiuk: Which conversation, sorry?\nMr. Sinclair: About in your mind comments that were made by myself that were sexualized comments. And to get out on the table where this took place and what kind of conversation this took place is very important. So we worked in a facility that treated sex offenders; is that correct?\nMs. Nastiuk: That treated youth with inappropriate sexual behaviours or who had been charged.\nMr. Sinclair: For inappropriate \u2013\nMs. Nastiuk: Sexual \u2013 inappropriate sexual behaviours.\nMr. Sinclair: Okay. So it was common around this workplace to talk about sex and sex offending; is that correct?\nMs. Nastiuk: Not sex.\nMr. Sinclair: That these young men were having \u2013 or had, pardon me, or had, prior to attending the treatment centre?\nMs. Nastiuk: It would be typical during the interview phase, somewhat through the process of the treatment planning, basically through those two processes. It might not always have been right at intake, but, like, that phase, when, you know, we\u2019re trying to gather the information to see what had occurred, to get the background information on what was going on with them.\nMr. Sinclair: Ms. Nastiuk, as case manager you are often the first contact in terms of social workers and\/or family members; it that not correct?\nMs. Nastiuk: It\u2019s correct.\nMr. Sinclair: And you\u2019re often the first one hearing this from these individuals and the sex offences that were committed?\nMs. Nastiuk: Not always. Like, I remember you and I being in Canora and you met with the boy and I met with the worker, and you came back with some of that information or that information from the boy on his behaviours, what he had told you.\nMr. Sinclair: So this kind of conversation was very common around this workplace was it not, Ms Nastiuk?\nMs. Nastiuk: Regarding boys, I mean, like, in certain context. It wasn\u2019t something I just went around and \u2013 or even recall talking to other staff about just randomly. There\u2019s usually a place and setting for that.\nMr. Sinclair: Do you recall a conversation that took place on an evening when I was invited to your hours, Ms. Nastiuk, and to fix your furnace, and after \u2013 your furnace was out of oil, and after I came in you had a pot of coffee on and invited me to stay? Do you recall that, Ms. Nastiuk?\nMs. Nastiuk: No.\nMr. Sinclair: You don\u2019t recall this at all, Ms. Nastiuk?\nMs. Nastiuk: No. ...\nMr. Sinclair: Look at me Ms. Nastiuk, if you would, please? The particular evening that I\u2019m referring to, Ms. Nastiuk, and going back to a previous comment about sexual discussion, that evening is so important that you can recall at this point in time because the context of the conversation is clear once that is dealt with.\nMs. Nastiuk: We never had discussions about any type of sexualized comments while in my house, and I don\u2019t even really remember that occurring outside of my house other than April 7th when you started talking about me being a lesbian and my sexual activities with men and relationships with men. \u2026\nMr. Sinclair: Ms. Nastiuk, if a person makes a comment and the whole picture is not given, and that comment that was made, could that be a harmful thing? \u2026Harmful to me\u2026in this particular case?\nMs. Nastiuk: I don\u2019t know how to answer that. In other \u2013 in other situations, other people, I mean \u2013 variables, depending on a lot of different variables.\nMr. Sinclair: Well in this particular case I\u2019m (inaudible) here charged with sexual harassment, and to me it\u2019s very important that these issues are made clear. The context in which the comments were made, just stating that this was what was said relating to sexual comments or sexual talk, without giving other information to clarify that, don\u2019t you believe that would be harmful \u2013 that could be harmful, Ms. Nastiuk?\nMs. Nastiuk: I guess I would go back to when I was sitting alone in your office and you would start talking and \u2013 talking about yourself and making these comments, and totally disregarding how uncomfortable I was and how inappropriate it was for you to be making those comments to me, and the whole thing of just totally ignoring my reaction or lack of reaction.\nMr. Sinclair: Did you ever say, Tom, don\u2019t say that? Don\u2019t talk about that? Did you ever say that to myself, Ms. Nastiuk?\nMs. Nastiuk: Not until \u2013 I did say that to you but not until late summer, fall.\nMr. Sinclair: Of what year would that be Ms. Nastiuk?\nMs. Nastiuk: 2005.\nMr. Sinclair: And how many times did I say that \u2013 did I go ahead and say something where you never said anything to me? \u2026 Was that a common occurrence?\nMs. Nastiuk: I think that was common, that staff \u2013 that they \u2013 knew that look on your face and they knew not to react, respond, speak up. That was common.\nMr. Sinclair: The look on my face? Well, Ms. Nastiuk, you know attempts are being made to try to clarify in what context you have made comments about me stating sexualized or making sexualized remarks.\nMs. Nastiuk: I think I stated that. That we were in your office and you would make those kinds of comments. Or we would be standing outside at the top of the stairs of your building and you would make comments. I don\u2019t - and then other than April 7th, and there was the drive, I think we were heading back to the centre and you quickly changed \u2013 I don\u2019t know what was \u2013 what was being said, just \u2013 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real context for you all of a sudden starting \u2013 you said to me that you had participated in a training group somewhere and you all had to sit in a circle and say every slang word you knew for penis and vagina, and I got very mad instantly. That was inappropriate. Someone that\u2019s been in Social Services for 20, 25 years, if you think that supervision, training, one-to-one in a vehicle after forcing your attentions on me all that time, I \u2013 there\u2019s no context for that. Talking about my grandmother having a reputation, where is the context for that?\nMr. Sinclair: You mentioned that this was something where I had attended training, is that not correct? Is that not your comment just now, Ms. Nastiuk? \u2026You mentioned just now that \u2013 that it was in context, you put that in context, you see, that I had attended training, and in the training it was on professionals helping people who have been sexually abused, you left that out, but you put part of that in context when you said I was in training when that happened, when \u2013 you see what I mean?\nMs. Nastiuk: I recall saying that, yes.\nMr. Sinclair: You see what I mean?\nMs. Nastiuk: And that came out of the blue. Like, there was \u2013 that\u2019s the context you want, but my context was I was alone in the vehicle with you and you made that comment. It was inappropriate. We weren\u2019t discussing sexual issues. I never talked sexual issues with you and all of a sudden you start making that kind of comment, especially with everything else. Like yeah, I was very \u2013 I was very pissed about it.\nMr. Sinclair: Okay, Ms. Nastiuk. Did you and I ever share any information as two native First Nation people that have had, you know, harmful things happen in childhood? Did you and I ever share information like that with each other openly and voluntarily?\nMs. Nastiuk: I did not openly and voluntarily share that stuff with you. It was always you asking about my family background or fibromyalgia. You would openly share \u2013 I think I have already kind of covered what you had talked about, that women liked you and you liked the \u201860s, the freedom of the \u201860s, you talked about your \u2013 you tried to talk about your relationships and it wasn\u2019t a voluntary thing, it was me having to sit and listen to you or you pulling the information out of me to the point where I would just to get you to stop I\u2019d get mad and just give you something and then pull back. There might have been some conversations that \u2013 when things were more amicable, but, I mean, not getting to \u2013 any history of abuse or personal information.\nMr. Sinclair: Is it common for First Nation people to sit down these days, with all the healing that is taking place in our First Nations and our communities, to talk about healing issues? Is that a common thing, fairly common thing these days, Ms. Nastiuk?\nMs. Nastiuk: In groups I hear it\u2019s common, sharing circles.\nMr. Sinclair: Do you believe that\u2019s the only place that stuff happens? That sharing?\nMs. Nastiuk: Sweat lodges. It has \u2013 I mean, I was involved \u2013 I mean present at a couple of talking circles, sharing circles that Nicky and Marty had been in with the boys, but you weren\u2019t present. \u2026\nMr. Sinclair: Did you ever share information about your family and your childhood with yourself, Ms. Nastiuk?\nMs. Nastiuk: Yes, we were driving \u2013 I think I talked about this drive out to the elk farm, et cetera, and you kept pushing and I finally gave you one comment. And there was another time you were talking about, oh, yeah, I remember seeing parents \u2013 (inaudible) parents with five little children in tow. And days I saw you years ago and \u2013 and \u2013 oh, what else? I \u2013 somewhere in there when it was amicable, and it could have been that same conversation, you were asking me about my relationships with my parents, I\u2019d tell you it was better with my father than with my mother.\nThe Chairperson: I can\u2019t hear you.\nMs Nastiuk: I did tell Mr. Sinclair that my relationship with my father was better than with my mother, but I never volunteered that. That was just a constant attempt to get me to talk about myself.\nMr. Sinclair: Ms. Nastiuk, the context of where conversations took place is so important otherwise it can sound like just sexual talk. It it\u2019s talked about in the context of healing of First nation people, then \u2013 did those, a conversation like that happen with you and I. Do you recall that, Ms. Nastiuk, where information was shared?\nMs. Nastiuk: No.\nTranscript: page 1276, lines 12-25; page 1277, lines 1-25; page 1278, lines 1-25, page 1279, lines 1-12, 21-25; page 1280, lines 1-25; page 1281, lines 1-25; page 1282, lines 1-16; page 1284, lines 4-14, page 1285, lines 4-25; page 1286, line 1-25; page 1287, lines 1-25; page 1288, lines 1-5, 9-23; page 1289, lines 18-21; page 1290, lines 10-11, 14-25; page 1291, lines 1-25; page 1292, lines 2-25; page 1293, lines 1-13, 15-25; page 1294, lines 1-25; page 1295, lines 1-18, 23-25; page 1296, lines 1-5, 17-25; page 1297, lines 1-23.\n(iii) Phone calls: [106] Mr. Sinclair testified that on matters related to GHC, he had telephoned Ms. Nastiuk many times and that she had called him somewhat regularly; that Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s calls would begin with work-related matters but would, on occasion, turn to personal matters. Some of the calls were to him at his home in Thunder Bay, but most were when he was living at his mother\u2019s house in Fort Frances.\nThe Chairperson: Okay. And are you saying these calls happened right from when she first started working with you or ... when she became more comfortable later.\nMr. Sinclair: Not the beginning. After \u2013 after she became more comfortable, you know, and we had time to just talk about \u2013 she\u2019d talk about her daughter and I\u2019d talk about my kids. And I think there was a comfort level in \u2013 in talking that \u2013 that had to be there first for both of us.\nTranscript: page 2135, lines 10-12, 15-22.\n(iv) Visits to Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s home: Mr. Sinclair: And that evening, after looking at the furnace, when I came upstairs Ms. Nastiuk had a pot of coffee on and invited me to stay for coffee. And so I went to her living room and just \u2013 there was a couch and there was a chair across from the couch and there was a television and a coffee table in-between the chair and the couch. And \u2013 and I\u2019m not sure what other furniture was there, but I sat on the edge of the couch, on the corner of the couch, and Ms. Nastiuk brought the coffee and sat on the chair across. And I think there was a coffee table in-between. And I sat down in the wrong spot on that couch because she had this cat that was very hefty, overweight cat, and I ended up sitting in the spot where the cat laid down and the cat came around and let me know that I shouldn\u2019t be sitting \u2013 sitting there. And it was humorous and ...I think I may have moved for the cat. Anyway, that evening was when it was, like it was only from the workplace. There had been a reason why I had been at her \u2013 at her home. Coffee was offered. We sat and we talked and we talked like two First Nation people, and \u2013 because of things that were talked \u2013 talked about. It was personal and personal sharing of some of the \u2013 of what it was like to grow up in my home and she shared what it was like to grow up in her \u2013 her home.\nTranscript: page 2151, lines 8-24; page 2152, lines 2-3, 5-13.\nSo what I want to do is\u2014is to refer to that and to put that into context. Information shared by myself of \u2013 of childhood abuses that \u2013 that I experienced. And \u2013 and the reason I wanted to do that is that throughout information submitted by Ms. Nastiuk, she refers to talk of \u2013 of a sexual nature. Well, when that is put into the proper context, like \u2013 like I\u2019m attempting to do here \u2013 that offers an explanation of two people sitting down and talking. It\u2019s not \u2013 it is not myself making sexualized comments that are derogatory or \u2013 or aimed at \u2013 at her, okay.\nTranscript: page 2152, lines 24-25; page 2153, lines 1-10.\n(v) Repairing Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s automobile: Mr. Sinclair: \u201cIn working at Giizhikaandag, I would be away from my family for two weeks at time for the most part. And there were a number of staff members, female staff members, with vehicles and I \u2013 I offered to fix the vehicles of three staff members. Ms. Nastiuk was one, Ms. Gail Roach-Leforte was the second, and Ms. Barb Dalsig was the third.\nAnd to fix Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s car, it was at her property. The car sat on the road, main road in front of her house. And I looked at it and tried to fix it and I couldn\u2019t fix it. Parts were needed. And with Ms. Gail Roach-Leforte, her vehicle, I left my vehicle with her. I took her vehicle and I went to my nephew\u2019s place, and I had her vehicle for the full day. She was travelling back, apparently, from Winnipeg, stopped to service her vehicle in Winnipeg, put \u2013 it needed oil, but instead of oil in the engine, she put oil in \u2013 where the radiator fluid goes and it was all through the engine. And I \u2013 it took me a day to take it apart and flood it out and \u2013 and get her car back to her. With Ms. Dalsig, her vehicle was just in the parking lot. There was a light that had to be changed and those are my recollections of that.\nSo it\u2019s not just Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s vehicle. I offered help and assistance to other staff members \u2013 female staff members.\nTranscript: page 2158, lines 18-25; page 2159, lines 1-20.\n(vi) Assisting Ms. Nastiuk with her purchase of an automobile: Mr. Sinclair: \u201cShe was off that particular day. And she phoned me \u2026She said, where are you? And I told her I was in the west end of town. And I asked, why? She said, well, I\u2019m at the Ford dealership. I found a vehicle and I would like you to take a look at it and try it out. And I said, okay.\nWent to the Ford dealership, was introduced to the salesman. Put the plates on the vehicle and I was behind the wheel and the three of us took the vehicle for a drive \u2026turned around and came back to the garage.\nAnd I told Ms. Nastiuk that I thought it was a good vehicle. It was a small SUV. And she ended up purchasing it.\nAnd I used that as one example that she felt, you know, free to call and ask for some help\u2026\nTranscript: page 2902, lines 1-20.\n(vii) The alleged sexual \u201clesbian\u201d comment: Mr. Sinclair: It was an afternoon in \u2013 late in the fall. It was an afternoon where there was a mixture of rain and snow. Ms. Nastiuk had to go to the Health Access Centre, which is on the reserve where people can receive medical services.\nIt\u2019s also a place where boys from our program would be taken for their \u2013 their medicals and so on.\nAnd that afternoon, Ms. Nastiuk went to Health Access Centre. She returned about three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and that afternoon, when she returned, Fern and I had gone outside to have a cigarette. And it was at that time that - that - we were just finishing the cigarette \u2026 when Marlo arrived \u2026and asked if she could speak with me. And so Fern left, went back into the building, and Ms. Nastiuk and I remained outside on the top of the landing of the stairs there. She stood against the inside of the stairs and I was against \u2013 standing against the other side\u2026. And she looked very meek and she just came out and asked, and what she asked me is what would I do if she was a lesbian? Just \u2013 those are the exact words. And I stood there and \u2013 and I really didn\u2019t say anything at first. And then I went onto \u2013 I didn\u2019t question her. I didn\u2019t question the statement she had just made. It certainly took me by surprise and I needed a little bit of time to collect my thoughts and give a response. And my response was that there is legislation that protects individuals against discrimination based on sexual orientation, and that their employment cannot be terminated because of sexual orientation. And that was my response to her question.\nTranscript: page 2171, lines 3-25; page 2172, lines 1-13.\n[107] Mr. Sinclair testified that Ms. Nastiuk repeated the comment on two occasions when she came into his office and stated that Doug (Mr. Broman) had been over to her house and tried to convince her she was a lesbian.\n(viii) The alleged sexual comment about Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s hair fragrance: Mr. Sinclair: And one time she came in \u2013 my wife had bought me \u2013 we all went and got our hair done in Thunder Bay. We go to the same salon, so Delores, Cote and I all got our hair done at the same time. One after the other, and she bought me new \u2013 I had problems with dandruff in the spring and my hair was (inaudible), so she bought me this new shampoo.\nAnd I was using this new shampoo. Ms. Nastiuk walked into the office one morning. I was at my desk. Her hair was still damp and she came in and I could smell the shampoo. And I said I could smell your hair. Well, I just said more than that. Okay. She commented on hair smelling. I said I could smell your hair. It smells like the shampoo that I\u2019m using. That was the full text of my comment.\nTranscript: page 2900, lines 4-19.\nE. Meeting with Chief McPherson [108] In response to questions by Ms. Bryson, counsel for CFN, Mr. Sinclair explained that he was called to attend a meeting at GHC with Chief McPherson, Ms. Nastiuk and George Emes on June 14, 2006.\nMs. Bryson: \u2026There seems to be a lot of dispute about what Chief McPherson said. Do you recall him ever saying to Ms. Nastiuk that there will be no accommodations put in place for you (Ms. Nastiuk) regarding the workplace, full stop?\nMr. Sinclair: Not at all. \u2026\nTranscript: page 3068, lines 12-17.\nMr. Sinclair: \u2026And so the chief asked the \u2013 her what \u2013 how she wanted to proceed with things. And she stated that she wanted her concerns and letters addressed.\nI know that as time was nearing the end of the meeting, Chief McPherson asked her what could be done to resolve the matter and she was about to leave and he asked that she get back to him with how she wanted to continue to, you know, get the matter resolved internally. And her and Mr. Emes left the room.\nMs. Bryson: Do you recall if she put any suggestions forward at that meeting.\nMr. Sinclair: No, I don\u2019t recall her putting any suggestions forward. \u2026Oh, I do recall one comment she made. She wanted me removed as the director of the centre.\nTranscript: page 3070, lines 7-20, 23-25.\n\u2026\nAnd so I think Chief McPherson gave Ms. Nastiuk the opportunity to talk about her letter and she did. I was given the opportunity to speak after she concluded with the comments that she wanted to make and there were things that she had said and or written that I disagreed with. And I \u2013 I did that , so it was clear from the beginning that what she was saying and what I was saying were very different.\nTranscript: page 3069, lines 8-15.\nF. Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s Medical Treatment [109] With respect to the symptoms or effects that Ms. Nastiuk claimed she suffered as a result of Mr. Sinclair\u2019s conduct, that is the alleged harassment during the period stated in her Complaints, Counsel and Ms. Nastiuk engaged in a merry-go-round of questions and uncertain answers that ended with Ms. Nastiuk saying: \u201cI do not recall at the moment exactly what treatment I got when.\u201d Transcript: page 683, lines 20-21.\n[110] Later in cross examination, Ms. Bryson returned the subject of medical treatment.\nMs. Bryson: So in this paragraph, you say you have trouble sleeping, that you began to suffer lower \u2013 low back pain, headaches, and gastrointestinal disorders, a bald spot developed and on (your) scalp because of the stress and several situations that were created by Tom Sinclair. (You) experienced panic and anxiety.\nIs it fair to say the time period for this would be 2005, 2006.\nMs. Nastiuk: Not all of 2005.\nMs. Bryson: Okay. Isn\u2019t it true that you didn\u2019t receive any treatment for any of those items during that time?\nMs. Nastiuk: There were medications.\nMs. Bryson: And what were those for?\nMs. Nastiuk: The headaches, the gastrointestinal. Those two in 2006. But, I mean, I have those, but they\u2019re typically more under control, and I go for long periods of time, months, over a year length of time without requiring that stuff, sometimes longer, but stressors will flare all of that up, but not \u2013 stresses will flare that up.\nMs. Bryson: So are you telling me that these conditions predate the time period of your complaints, and that they flare up from time to time thereafter?\nMs. Nastiuk: They can be under control for great lengths of period.\nTranscript: page 716, lines 11-24.\nThe Chairperson: Sorry, what you\u2019re being asked, and it\u2019s really just a yes or no answer, did you experience any of these thing before the problems with Mr. Sinclair that you\u2019ve talked about?\nMs. Nastiuk: Yes.\nThe Chairperson: Okay, that\u2019s what she means by predate. So you experienced them before, and then I believe your evidence is that they flare up with stress, even though you go for long periods where they don\u2019t bother you; is that right?\nMs. Nastiuk: Yes.\nTranscript: page 718, lines 5-16.\n[111] This leads to an inference of fact that other than the medical leave authorized by her physician, Ms. Nastiuk did not seek or receive any extenuating medical treatment during the period March 2005 to March 2008 for negative physical and mental difficulties that she attributed to Mr. Sinclair.\nG. Remarks by Mr. Sinclair at the End of his Direct Evidence [112] I have selected several portions to Mr. Sinclair\u2019s soliloquy to illustrate his emotions.\nThese binders \u2013 binder after binder after binder and you\u2019re flipping through and looking at this section, looking at that section, and I get all mixed up looking at sections. No lawyer. I don\u2019t have the support people helping me. I have a wife that helped me a bit. I didn\u2019t produce all kinds of documents. I seen other people producing it. I seen what Ms. Nastiuk produced and she took a couple of hours to do that. She produced a lot. She put a lot of effort into this. She did a lot of work. I had nobody with me, no lawyer, no court people. I\u2019m here by myself. I\u2019m here by myself representing myself.\nI learned as a little boy, don\u2019t lie. My mom taught me that. Be truthful. Lies hurt people. All I can do is come here and don\u2019t lie.\nIt\u2019s all I can do. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to win or I\u2019m going to lose. I don\u2019t know if I did a good job of representing myself or not. I know at times I didn\u2019t know what the hell to do.\nTranscript: page 2188, lines 10-25; page 2189, lines 1-3.\nYou know, yesterday Mr. Yerxa sat in this chair and said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do things \u2013 why didn\u2019t you people do things the Indian way?\u201d I knew exactly what he was saying.\nIt\u2019s four o\u2019clock. I\u2019ve got to drive to Thunder Bay tonight. You\u2019d asked that I be done by quarter after; well, I\u2019m going to be done by four o\u2019clock. And it\u2019s been \u2013 it\u2019s been a long week and I\u2019m looking forward to going home.\u201d\nTranscript: page 2190, lines 14-22.\nIV. Response of CN [113] Chief McPherson explained that CFN has approximately 2000 members, about 750 of them live on reserve along with a number of members from other communities. In general terms he said that, depending on the time of the year, CFN employs between 130 and 150 members.\n[114] Chief McPherson then testified that he had known Mr. Sinclair for a long time, probably 40 years, and in all that time he had never been made aware of any allegations of a sexual impropriety against Mr. Sinclair. He further explained that when CFN\u2019s healing centre was in a management crisis that would require CFN to either to close it down, to have another agency run it, or redesign it.\nA. Knowledge of Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s Complaint [115] Ms. Bryson, counsel for CFN, asked when Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s complaints first came to his attention.\nChief McPherson: Initially I got a phone call from her requesting a \u2013 if I had time to see her in June of 2006 I believe it was. And she came to my office to meet with me. \u2026I think it was, you know, a day or two later. \u2026She asked me to read some papers that she had written up. She presented them and asked me if I would take the time to read them then and there.\nMs. Bryson: And did you read them.\nChief McPherson: Yes. They were about, I guess, some inferred allegations regarding Mr. Sinclair, but primarily focused on her feelings. Every page alluded to her feelings. How she felt at a specific time. How she felt because of this, how she felt because of that, so forth.\nAnd like I said, it \u2013 that was the primary output of the documentation was how she felt at different times. \u2026It was against - against Mr. Sinclair. There was an inference that there was some improprieties promoted by himself against her.\nMs. Bryson: Of what nature?\nChief McPherson: Sexual.\n\u2026\nMs. Bryson: Do you recall what happened \u2013 like, how did that meeting end after you read the documentation?\nChief McPherson: Well, I think I was being placed in a position where I was being asked to be somewhat of a judge and I said why don\u2019t we sit down, air the allegations? Try and get some responses to it and come to a resolution and that triggered a meeting with Mr. Sinclair, Ms. Nastiuk, myself and I believe a gentleman by the name of George Emes, a former town police officer.\n\u2026\nChief McPherson: And we approached Tom with those (options) to see if (he) could make a determination or recommendation as to the best use of the facility.\nTranscript: page 2926, line 25; page 2927, lines 1-3, 6-7, 10-25; page 2928, lines 1, 7-11; page 2930, lines 14-24; page 2933, lines 10-12.\nB. Meeting with Ms. Nastiuk, Mr. Emes and Mr. Sinclair Ms. Bryson: Okay. Now, jumping back, I want to go to the meeting between you, Ms. Nastiuk, Mr. Emes and Mr. Sinclair.\nChief McPherson: Well, we met at the Healing Centre up I \u2013 I believe it was Tom\u2019s office. A roundtable discussion and I think I spoke first. You know, just citing the reason we were there and tried to come to some \u2013 you know, if there was a conflict, how do we resolve that conflict? And air the allegations, air any concerns, comments, you know.\n\u2026\nMs. Bryson: Did Ms. Nastiuk and Mr. Sinclair agree on any version of events or -\nChief McPherson: No, there was no solution to it. They had to \u2013 varying thoughts as to what had transpired.\n\u2026\nMs. Bryson: Yeah. So, yeah, my question was, do you recall stating that, that to give you $5000 would admit Mr. Sinclair\u2019s wrongdoing?\nChief McPherson: I don\u2019t recall specifying $5000, but that position is consistent with the way I operate, offering money to Ms. Nastiuk would be making an admission of guilt from me on Mr. Sinclair and I wasn\u2019t prepared to do that.\nMs. Bryson: Do you recall if Ms. Nastiuk requested anything from you in that meeting?\nChief McPherson: No, she was going to get back to me.\u201d\nTranscript: page 2933, lines 13-24; page 2936, lines 21-25; page 2937, lines 1-7.\n[116] In her cross-examination of Chief McPherson, Ms. Nastiuk asked a series of questions and I have selected several pertaining to the first meeting arranged by Chief McPherson, attended by Ms. Nastiuk, Mr. Emes and Mr. Sinclair.\nMs. Nastiuk: Okay. I\u2019ll put it to you the way I recall it. Is that at the end of that after making the statement about the $5000, you \u2013 and the other comments that to \u2013 I had a job to go back to and that no accommodations or changes in the workplace would be made because to do so would be admitting that Mr. Sinclair was guilty and that you were not prepared to do that. And then you commented to get back to you with what I wanted. Do you recall that?\nChief McPherson: I recall asking you what it would take to resolve this issue and you were going to get back to me on that. ...\nMs. Nastiuk: I don\u2019t recall \u201cWhat it would take to resolve\u201d because you had already told me that no accommodations or changes would be made because to do so would be admitting Tom was guilty and you were not prepared to do that.\nThe Chairperson: You can\u2019t just throw statements out there. Did you say that no accommodation or change to the workplace would be made because that would be an admission of Tom Sinclair\u2019s guilt and you weren\u2019t prepared to do that? Did you make that statement in that meeting?\nChief McPherson: I recall saying I wasn\u2019t prepared to be the judge, okay. The judge and jury on this particular issue and I did ask you to get back to me on what you thought was a palatable resolution to this matter.\n\u2026\nMs. Nastiuk: Do you recall me saying anything that did not indicate that I did not want to go back to work, but I wanted to go back to work and all I got from that meeting was that Mr. Sinclair still had a job and you weren\u2019t going to do anything to assist me getting back into the workplace safely and addressing any of these at that time, so\u2014\nThe Chairperson: Is that correct? Was her take on the meeting correct, that you did not view it just as her trying to get back to work in a safe environment?\nChief McPherson: No, like I said, I can just reiterate that I had asked Ms. Nastiuk what she saw as a palatable resolution to this problem? And please get back to me as soon as possible.\nMs. Nastiuk: Okay, with the comment that I recall that no changes would be made, there would be no accommodations because to do so would be admitting that Tom was guilty and then stating that I was to get back \u2013 you wanted me to get back to you with what I wanted. Can you see how that would create a really difficult situation for me? Like, what could I ask for?\nChief McPherson: Well, if, in fact, the allegations were true, I could see how it would be \u2013 create a situation for you, but at that point and to this day we don\u2019t know if the allegations are true, so it would be a hypothetical answer on my part. ...You\u2019d be asking me to speculate and I can\u2019t do that.\nMs. Nastiuk: Okay. As the employer, did you not see that there was a duty to take me seriously?\nChief McPherson: If I reconvened the meeting \u2013 that\u2019s why I asked you, what a resolution to the situation would be from your perspective. I thought I was taking you seriously by agreeing to a meeting to try and flesh out a resolution to it and asking you to get back to me.\n\u2026\nMs. Nastiuk: Okay. After that meeting, Mr. Sinclair testified that you two remained there and had some discussion. Do you recall what that discussion was?\nChief McPherson: I posed the same question to him, how do we resolve this? What do you see as a resolution?\nMs. Nastiuk: Do you recall what his response was?\nChief McPherson: He said that he was innocent of all allegations and he wanted to \u2013 you know, the air cleared.\u201d\nTranscript: Page 2998, lines 21-25; page 2999, lines 1-12, 15-25; page 3000, lines 12-25 ; page 3001, lines 1-16, 18-25; page 3002, lines 1-3, 8-19.\nC. Hiring Dale Morrisseau [117] Chief McPherson took Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s complaint to the Band Council, and shortly afterward Dale Morrisseau was hired as band manager and given the task of investigating Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s complaints. It was Chief McPherson\u2019s belief that at the time Ms. Nastiuk made her complaint CFN had a personnel policy which included provisions relating to sexual harassment.\nMs. Bryson: Do you recall Dale Morrisseau coming to chief and council and say that Ms. Nastiuk wanted to come back to work at GHC around this time of the fall \u201906?\nChief McPherson: Well, she had some concerns, like I said, about it being unsafe. And, like I said, at that period of time there was a number of things going on at Couchiching. And I think Mr. Morrisseau granted Ms. Nastiuk just about every concession possible to \u2013 provide her with employment.\nMs. Bryson: And did chief and council approve that he do that?\nChief McPherson: Well, like I said, we wanted to be aware of it. We gave him a lot of latitude and subsequently with her a lot of latitude.\u201d\nTranscript: page 2943, lines 2-17.\nD. Dale Morrisseau\u2019s Investigation [118] In early August 2006 Dale Morrisseau received a copy of Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s complaint against Mr. Sinclair. He had no prior acquaintance or dealings with either of them and considered himself to be a neutral and objective person with respect to the complaint.\n[119] Mr. Morrisseau explained that Chief McPherson told him that he had already had a meeting with Ms. Nastiuk and Mr. Sinclair and he requested that Mr. Morrisseau investigate the matter.\nMr. Morrisseau: Well, to start the investigation, I endeavoured to speak with Marlo Nastiuk and Tom Sinclair \u2013 separately, of course \u2013 to try to get to the issue of the complaint.\nMs. Bryson: And did you speak to them?\nMr. Morrisseau: Yes.\n\u2026\nMs. Bryson: Okay. Do you recall what Ms. Nastiuk said to you?\nMr. Morrisseau: She went over the details of the complaint, indicating that she was sexually harassed by Tom Sinclair \u2026we spoke at length.\n\u2026\nMs. Bryson: And did you put Ms. Nastiuk\u2019 allegations to him for a response?\nMr. Morrisseau: I\u2019m sure we discussed the details of the allegations, and he was adamant in stating that they were not true.\nTranscript: page 2520, lines 15-21; page 2521, lines 3-7, 13-14; page 2522, lines 5-9.\n[120] When asked by counsel if any specific allegations concerned him more than others, Mr. Morrisseau said that there seemed to be no specific incident of sexual harassment, rather what Ms. Nastiuk had indicated to him was an overall occurrence, recurring in one form or other. He went on to say that he interviewed other persons and that, in further meetings with Ms. Nastiuk and Mr. Sinclair, he never divulged to either of them the results of any interviews but rather condensed interviews into a written document and submitted it to the Chief and Council. In due course he was instructed to let the complaint \u201cplay out through the proper legal channels.\u201d\n[121] Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s cross examination of Mr. Morrisseau yielded more of these same conclusions.\nMs. Nastiuk: You have several female staff making comments about how Mr. Sinclair made them uncomfortable; a couple of comments about viewing his view toward me as inappropriate. And did you see that as being based on being female, which \u2013 and as \u2013 okay, based on being female?\nMr. Morrisseau: \u2026I don\u2019t understand her question.\nThe Chairperson: The question you\u2019re trying to get at that \u2013 are you asking him if he felt from his interviews and discussions with staff that Mr. Sinclair treated female staff differently than male staff?\nMs. Nastiuk: Yes. ...\nThe Chairperson: Did you feel that?\nMr. Morrisseau: I didn\u2019t come out of those interviews with that. I mean I \u2013 I mean even the male staff had some issues of his management style, so I don\u2019t think it was just wholly indicative of female perception of the staff \u2013 at the healing centre.\nMs. Nastiuk: So the males\u2019 comment about his management style, but the female\u2019s commented about feeling uncomfortable and it being inappropriate sexual behaviour?\nMr. Morrisseau: She never specified anything about inappropriate sexual behaviour in this interview here.\nMs. Nastiuk: Inappropriate behaviour based on they\u2019re being female.\nMr. Morrisseau: And the question is?\nMs. Nastiuk: Was there a difference \u2013 did you \u2013\nMr. Morrisseau: I think I answered that, I didn\u2019t believe there was.\u201d\nTranscript: page 2823, lines 7-12, 18-25; page 2824, lines 4-25.\n[122] Ms. Nastiuk also pressed Mr. Morrisseau regarding what she described as a hostile work environment the responsibility of which she imputed to Mr. Sinclair and CFN.\nMs. Nastiuk: Do you recall us discussing the hostile work environment?\nMr. Morrisseau: I remember you referring to it as a hostile work environment and I looked into it and it seemed from the investigation that you were just as responsible as everybody else for creating the hostile work environment.\n\u2026\nMs Nastiuk: You testified that staff said their interactions \u2013 or my interactions with them were strictly professional, but I was difficult to deal with. Can you explain what \u2018difficult to deal with\u2019 was?\nMr. Morrisseau: You kept to yourself according to them. You were very demanding. ... Not a very pleasant person.\nTranscript: page 2756, lines 12-18; page 2757, lines 9-15, 17-18.\n[123] Toward the end of Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s cross examination of Mr. Morrisseau she naively asked for his opinion on the validity of her complaints.\nMs. Nastiuk: Did you get any indication during your staff interviews at the end of October into November, December 2006 that there were \u2013 oh, God, there were possible \u2013 there were \u2013 there might be some validity to my complaints, enough \u2013 okay, stop there.\nMr. Morrisseau: So did I get any indication there might be some validity to your complaints?\nMs. Nastiuk: Yes.\nMr. Morrisseau: Is that the question?\nMs. Nastiuk: Yes\nMr. Morrisseau: It was still unclear.\nMs. Nastiuk It was unclear?\nMr. Morrisseau: Because no one had given me any kind of specific instance where they witnessed an instance of sexual harassment towards you.\nTranscript: page 2837, lines 8-25; page 2838, lines 1-2.\nE. Alleged Prior Knowledge of Allegations Against Mr. Sinclair [124] A contentious issue in this inquiry was whether Ms. Roach-Leforte told Chief McPherson about Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s allegations in December 2005 at a meeting with him and Mr. Sinclair. When asked if he recalled being told that by Ms. Roach-Leforte, Mr. Morrison had no recollection of being told but said that if he had been told so he would not have forgotten to write it down.\n[125] In the same line of questioning Counsel asked Mr. Morrisseau about his interview with Barb Smith:\nM. Bryson: During your interview with Ms. Smith, if she had told you, \u2018Tom Sinclair told me he was interested in Ms. Nastiuk in a romantic or sexual way,\u2019 would you have written that down?\nMr. Morrisseau: Yes\nMs. Bryson: Okay. Do you recall her saying anything like that to you?\nMr. Morrisseau: No.\nMs. Bryson: And would that stand out in your memory in the context of this complaint?\nMr. Morrisseau: If she said something like that, I would have put a dot beside it. I would\u2019ve (inaudible) it, I would\u2019ve underlined it in my notes.\nTranscript: page 2548, lines 4-17.\nF. Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s Return to Work [126] With respect to Ms. Nastiuk speaking to him in October 2006 about returning to work at GHC, Mr. Morrisseau stated that the only time he remembered was in the period December 2006 \/ January 2007, that she wanted to return to work on express conditions and gave him a letter with back to work stipulations.\nMs. Bryson: So we\u2019re still \u2013 we talked about number one and number two. We\u2019re at tab18 of C-1 on the letter to you from Ms. Nastiuk on page 1 of 4. \u2026So let\u2019s turn to the next page, terms and conditions for return to work. Did you agree that Mr. Sinclair and Ms. Nastiuk would communicate in writing only? That\u2019s how I\u2019m interpreting the first one.\nMr. Morrisseau: Yes.\nMrs. Bryson: Did you have any concerns about that?\nMr.: Morrisseau: No. I preferred it, actually, because everything would be in writing.\nMr. Bryson: Did Mr. Sinclair have any concerns about that that he raised to you?\nMr. Morrisseau: No, not at that moment.\nMs. Bryson: Okay. Did you have any issue with Ms. Nastiuk not going over to the other building where Mr. Sinclair\u2019s office was except for staff or GHC meetings.\nMr. Morrisseau: No issues with that. Her office was in the other building and she was capable of performing her duties in her office.\nMs. Bryson: And did Mr. Sinclair have any issues that he \u2013 with that that he raised to you?\nMr. Morrisseau: No.\nMs. Bryson: Just to clarify, did you go over these terms and conditions with Mr. Sinclair at some point?\nMr. Morrisseau: Yes.\nMs. Bryson: Yeah, okay. Okay. And did everyone \u2013 and by everyone, I mean you, Ms. Nastiuk, and Mr. Sinclair agree \u2013 or agree no same out of town trips?\nMr. Morrisseau: Yes.\nMs. Bryson: Yes, okay. That Mr. Sinclair was to avoid Ms. Nastiuk and not wilfully seek her out?\nMr. Morrisseau: With that one, I think we just keep the interactions professional according to the terms that we were trying to establish here.\nMs. Bryson: And by professional, do you mean any interaction or that they were only to interact on business?\nMr. Morrisseau: Yes. Business related, and encouraged to having a third party present if there was such interaction.\nTranscript: page 2581, lines 5-25; page2582, lines 1-25; page 2583, lines 1-2.\n[127] In the foregoing process of working out return to work conditions Mr. Sinclair was opposed to Ms. Nastiuk having contact with the provincial ministry and Mr. Morrisseau agreed because Mr. Sinclair was the spokesman for GHC in dealings with the Ministry of Community and Social Services. Finally, Mr. Morrisseau stated that the conditions that were put in place for Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s return to work were not signed by the parties, but rather only verbal.\nG. Alleged Failure of CFN to Protect Ms. Nastiuk [128] Mr. Morrisseau rejected Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s claim that CFN had failed to provide her a healthy and safe workplace and failed to respond appropriately to her complaint with effective remedial action all of which she claimed would have decreased the consequences and harms she claimed to have suffered.\nMs. Bryson: Do you feel you took appropriate action ...once this matter was in your hands?\nMr. Morrisseau: Oh, Yes. \u2026In all the documentation, I have never seen one instance of sexual harassment.\nTranscript: page 2685, lines 9-13, 21-23.\n\u2026\nMs. Bryson: And are the matters, the grievances she brought to you or wrote to you between January 2007 and August 2007 or the one we went through yesterday, were those the only grievances she brought to your attention during that time?\nMr. Morrisseau: Yes.\nMs. Bryson: And do you feel that you responded to each of those appropriately?\nMr. Morrisseau: I thought I did. I mean \u2013 again, I mean \u2013 I think Marlo should have taken a lot of the responsibility for the interactions of staff that is there. I mean, it\u2019s a two-way street when you\u2019re dealing in a work environment and \u2013 and I mean seeing from the documentation that I received from some of the other staffers, it was their opinion that she was a difficult person to work with. I mean if I have 90 percent of the staffers saying that over there and one person she isn\u2019t who am I to believe?\nTranscript: page 2686, lines 10-25; page 2687, lines 1-4.\n[129] In her cross examination, Ms. Bryson also questioned Ms. Nastiuk about (Document 71) as well as other documents that she had affirmed as being indicative that CFN \u201c\u2026took absolutely no preventive measures to prevent Mr. Sinclair from harassing you or from continuing to harass you.\u201d\nMs. Nastiuk: Preventive measures the first time, I didn\u2019t see any, and the second time, Dale was assigned, but it wasn\u2019t effective.\nMs. Bryson: Okay, But didn\u2019t you testify earlier today that you had no independent contact with Mr. Sinclair from the time you brought this to the notice of CFN forward, right, that he didn\u2019t come by your home, and that aside from some phone calls you participated in when you were back at work, that you had no one-on-one contact with him whatsoever. Isn\u2019t that correct?\nMs. Nastiuk: We did talk once a month, yes, we did.\nMs. Bryson: And you did that voluntarily, correct?\nMs. Nastiuk: There was so much going on at work that you couldn\u2019t just stop and yank someone all the time. We tried to minimize it, so it was a forced situation. \u2026But it wasn\u2019t me going to his office.\nMs. Bryson: No, I didn\u2019t say that, I\u2019m just saying that the terms of your return to work were that you did not have to have any one-on-one contact with Mr. Sinclair, that things were to be in writing isn\u2019t that correct?\nMs. Nastiuk: Yes.\nMs. Bryson: Or in the presence of a third party, right?\nMs. Nastiuk: Yes.\nMs. Bryson: You were located in a different building from Mr. Sinclair, weren\u2019t you?\nMs. Nastiuk: I always was located in a different building ...after June \u201905.\nMs. Bryson: Right. And we already established today, you said that he didn\u2019t come by your home, he didn\u2019t call you after you brought notice of this complaint to CFN in June 2006, right?\nMs. Nastiuk: Other than a couple of calls for meetings in June \u201906.\nMs. Bryson: No, I\u2019m saying after you brought this to the attention of the Band, they you\u2019re gone from work, you\u2019re not at work, right, from that June \u201906 to January \u201907.\nMs. Nastiuk: There would have been no contact between us.\nMs. Bryson: Right. Then you\u2019re back at work and you testified this morning that he didn\u2019t come to your home or have any contact with you outside of work; isn\u2019t that correct?\nMs. Nastiuk: Yes somewhat.\nMs. Bryson: Okay. And now we\u2019ve established that you did not have to have any one-on-one contact with him at work, right, and if you did, you did that voluntarily, didn\u2019t you?\nMs. Nastiuk: There were times when I had to call about something, yes. ...Work related in the office.\nMs. Bryson: That you did call? Because wasn\u2019t it a term of your return to work that you did not have to have any one-on-one contact with him except in writing?\nMs. Nastiuk: Mr. Sinclair had already been making one-on-one contact with me in the \u2013 in the workplace moment by moment and, yeah, some of that barrier got kind of crumbled.\nMs. Bryson: And you didn\u2019t issue any grievances to Couchiching First Nation about that did you?\nMs. Nastiuk: I know Dale and I had discussed it.\nMs. Bryson: But you didn\u2019t put anything in writing and say, I don\u2019t want \u2013 this isn\u2019t supposed to happen, I don\u2019t want this to happen, did you?\nMs. Nastiuk: I didn\u2019t. I brought it to Dale\u2019s attention that this was occurring, so, no, I didn\u2019t do anything with it and he didn\u2019t either.\n\u2026\nThe Chairperson: But he didn\u2019t come around your home and he didn\u2019t phone your home; is that right?\nMs. Nastiuk: That\u2019s right.\nTranscript: page 746, lines 18-25; page 747, lines 1-3, 16-25; page 748, lines 1-6, 8-16, 22-25; page 749, lines 1-15, 17-25; page 750, lines 1-14; page 751, lines 9-12.\nH. Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s Retaliation Complaint [130] That Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s return to work was fraught with difficulties for her, her co-workers, Mr. Sinclair and Mr. Morrisseau, is evidenced by a GHC staff meeting that Mr. Morrisseau was called to assist on March 28, 2007.\nMr. Morrisseau: When I got there, the people in attendance were already sitting around the conference table. I kind of said, what\u2019s going on? You want to have a session about issues relating to the healing centre.\nMs. Bryson: And who said that?\nMr. Morrisseau: Tom\n\u2026\nMs. Bryson: And did this \u2013 staff members express concerns to you?\n\u2026\nMr. Morrisseau: I mean, they just had concerns about their professional interactions with Marlo. \u2026 Brian keeps his distance from her. Rick, when she wants him, she wants him right now. Very demanding. Very unapproachable.\nTranscript: page 2617, lines 11-17, 23-25; page 2618, lines 4-6, 12-14.\n\u2026\nMs. Bryson: So what did you do following that meeting about their concerns?\nMr. Morrisseau: ...I didn\u2019t do anything proactively outside of the meeting. I basically indicated that, you know, work-related issues, performance issues are Tom\u2019s concern; that we\u2019d all do better to try to be civil and more professional in our interactions with other staffers. Basically saying you don\u2019t have to like them, just have to work with them.\nTranscript: page 2623, lines 23-24; page 2624, lines 2-9.\n\u2026\nMs. Bryson: On or about \u2013 did Ms. Nastiuk contact you in early August \u201907 about leaving the staff meeting.\nMr. Morrisseau: Yes. ...She indicated to me that she felt that she was being retaliated against in her complaint \u2013 for lodging a complaint, and she would be lodging a second complaint for retaliation.\nMs. Bryson: And \u2013 and who did she allege was doing the retaliation.\nMr. Morrisseau: Tom Sinclair.\nTranscript: page 2629, lines 6-9, 12-18.\nI. The Underwear Incident [131] Ms. Nastiuk testified to the fact that, on the same day that she left the workplace after the staff meeting, she was going to take a youth to a court attendance and that Mr. Sinclair had approved her purchase of female underwear for a client in treatment for sexual dysfunction issues. Mr. Sinclair however, testified that he approved Ms. Nastiuk to purchase male underwear for the above-mentioned youth, which were of a material that he may like. Ms. Bryson questioned Mr. Morrisseau regarding this incident:\nMs. Bryson: And during your conversation with Ms. Nastiuk about her leaving the workplace, did she discuss an issue of purchasing female underwear for a male youth in care and \u2013 and a dispute about that?\nMr. Morrisseau: There \u2013 that was a contentious dispute. She said she had the authority of Tom Sinclair to go and purchase these panties for the youth in question. I talked to Tom about this because I thought, well, this seems wholly inappropriate. These are sexual offenders. And I talked to Tom about it and he said that he absolutely did not give her authority to go out and do this. And I certainly did not give her authority to do this.\n\u2026\nShe understood that it was an ongoing concern, not only for her but for the healing centre. The issue of who was responsible for \u2013 for authorizing those \u2013 the purchase of the female underwear for the client.\nMs. Bryson: So did you reach any conclusion on \u2013 on this underwear issue.\nMr. Morrisseau: Well, only my own decisions. I can\u2019t \u2013 I mean, based on \u2013 I mean, it was \u2013 It\u2019s another he said\/she said issue \u2026 Tom vehemently saying that he did not authorize this, and Marlo saying that she was given authority by Tom to do this. To me, personally, I just don\u2019t see how this could benefit a person that\u2019s a sexual offender.\nMs. Bryson: Did you talk to anyone else, any of the other GHC staff about that particular issue?\nMr. Morrisseau: I think I talked to Nicky Morrisseau about it because she\u2019d sent me the letter of \u2013 basically it was a letter of complaint. She was concerned about this \u2013 that Marlo had went out and did this, and she didn\u2019t know if it was beneficial to the client and (inaudible). My only comments to Nicky were that I would \u2013 I would investigate this issue.\nTranscript: page 2632, lines 8-21; page 2633, lines 11-15; page 2634, lines 2-22.\nJ. Abandonment of Position by Ms. Nastiuk [132] On August 17th, 2007, Mr. Sinclair left GHC for another opportunity in a different community. Despite Mr. Sinclair\u2019s departure, Ms. Nastiuk did not return to work. Mr. Morrisseau\u2019s testified that he saw no reason for her absence, nor had he authorized her absence after Chief and Council had rejected the Commission-mediated proposal for settlement of her complaint.\n[133] Mr. Morrisseau testified that Chief and Council dealt with Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s absence from GHC in October or November 2007 by concluding that she had abandoned her post. This left Mr. Morrisseau in a state of confusion because \u201c\u2026it was a difficult position to be in, being in the middle of this fight. I had no vested interest in it at all.\u201d Transcript: page 2678, lines 11-14.\n[134] However Mr. Morrisseau stated that once Chief and Council had decided that Ms. Nastiuk had abandoned her position he had no authority to tell Ms. Nastiuk that she still had a job to go back to.\n[135] Ms. Bryson asked a number of questions concerning the chief-and-council decision that Ms. Nastiuk had abandoned her employment with GHC.\nMs. Bryson: And if an employee was off for a long period of time \u2026 would that require chief and council\u2019s approval or just Dale\u2019s?\nChief McPherson: He would approve it, but we could be cognizant of it.\nMs. Bryson: Do you recall after \u2013 or do you recall Dale Morrisseau coming to chief and council after they had considered that she abandoned her position and saying Ms. Nastiuk wanted to come back to work again? It would have been about November 2007.\nChief McPherson: I can\u2019t recall because at this time, like I said, our position was that she had abandoned her employment. \u2026 Well, the \u2013 like I said, (inaudible) issues are in the realm of the Band manager. The position of abandoning the position, we concurred with Mr. Morrisseau that she just wasn\u2019t there, so that the position wasn\u2019t being filled, so in respect to the abandonment, we were all in agreement there that she had to have abandoned it. If you don\u2019t show up for work, you don\u2019t show up for work.\nTranscript: page 2947, lines 12-25; page 2948, lines 1, 9-16.\n[136] In cross-examination of the complainant, CFN\u2019s counsel pressed Ms. Nastiuk to provide any evidence, not just an unsubstantiated belief, that Mr. Sinclair or CFN had interfered in her attempts to gain alternative employment, her answer was \u201cI was told otherwise\u201d. When asked \u201cBy whom?\u201d Ms. Nastiuk asked \u201cDo I have to answer that?\u201d the Chairperson said \u201cYes\u201d. This simple question and answer exchange at page 687 of the transcript began a series of some 35 questions most of which resulted in unresponsive answers or simple evasions of the questions. It culminated at page 695:\nMs. Bryson: Well, you alleged that you could not obtain employment in the entire Treaty 3 area because of rumours spread by Couchiching First Nation about you, Isn\u2019t that true.\nMs. Nastiuk: Yes.\nMs. Bryson: And you\u2019ve said you had to go and take a job where you now have to pay employment taxes because of that. Isn\u2019t that true?\nMs. Nastiuk: Yeah.\nMs. Bryson: So don\u2019t you think it\u2019s reasonable to bring evidence that this in fact happened?\nMs. Nastiuk: I don\u2019t know how I would bring evidence \u2013 people have said it and I\u2019m not going to bring those people into court.\nMs. Bryson: Okay. So you\u2019re asking us to accept these things are true without anyone coming and testifying under oath that they\u2019re true, and you want to receive $160,000 for that, correct.\nMs. Nastiuk: Yes.\nTranscript: page 695, lines 11-25; page 696, lines 1-7.\n[137] Then Ms. Bryson and Ms. Nastiuk continued to wrestle through another series of at least 50 questions concerning Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s allegation that the Respondent CFN spread rumours that negated her opportunity to gain employment, and that she perceived it to be a pattern traceable back to the \u201cpeople in power\u201d.\nMs. Nastiuk: I\u2019m not really raising the issue, I\u2019m not making an issue, it\u2019s a general overall issue that goes back to the people in power at Couchiching. I don\u2019t think you can point the finger at one person because the people in power \u2013 it\u2019s an accepted norm that you don\u2019t \u2013 I mean, what\u2019s going to get done? Who\u2019s going to \u2013 like, what \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I feel like I\u2019ve raised the issue. Specifying Dan and Chuck, I wasn\u2019t going to make an absolute allegation against two individuals. I was raising an allegation against Couchiching, the people in power, because the people in power that weren\u2019t doing this should have and could have taken the responsibility and stood up against this and said enough.\nTranscript: page 710, lines 8-25.\nMs. Bryson: Okay. I don\u2019t want to belabour this much longer, so I\u2019m just going to summarize here. So from our discussion, isn\u2019t it correct that you have no direct evidence of anyone on Chief and Council saying anything negative about you that you heard directly or that you have any witnesses to say that precluded you from getting alternative employment? Isn\u2019t that true?\nThe Chairperson: I think she\u2019s answered that several times. She has no direct evidence.\nTranscript: page 712, lines 18-25; page 713, lines 1-4.\nV. Standard of Proof [138] In F.H. v. McDougall, 2008 SCC 53, the Supreme Court of Canada clarified the law with respect to the standard of proof in civil cases: nothing more, nothing less than a balance of probabilities.\n[139] Evidence must always be clear, convincing and cogent in order to satisfy the balance of probabilities test.\n[140] The Court also affirmed that a trial judge must not consider a witness\u2019 evidence in isolation, but should consider the totality of evidence in the case, and assess the impact of any inconsistencies on questions of credibility and reliability pertaining to the core issues in the case.\n[141] The remarks of the Supreme Court of Canada in the McDougall case are consistent with what has already been detailed in the context of human rights law. Discrimination and the Law (W. Tarnopolsky, Thomson Carswell 2006), refers to the example of Van Berkel v. MPI Security Ltd. (1997) 28 C.H.R.R. D\/504 (B.C.H.R.C.), in which Member Designate Kenneth Attafuah states:\nIn accordance with these judicial guidelines, the testimony of each witness has been examined for consistency with the preponderance of probabilities which surround the existing circumstances of the complainant\u2019s employment with [the corporate respondent] and her interactions with [the individual respondent]. I have also scrutinized the evidence for plausibility under the circumstances and weighed also the witnesses\u2019 motives. In addition, I have paid attention to their powers of observation, memory and recall, as well as their attitude and demeanour under oath, and the manner in which they testified. Finally, I have checked their testimony for lack of internal coherence or any significant inconsistencies and contradictions. (at p. 15-17)\n[142] Discrimination and the Law, referring to Zarankin v. Johnstone (1984), 5 C.H.R.R. D\/2274 (B.C.Bc. Inq.) at D\/2280, sets the standard of proof in sexual harassment cases:\nThe Complainant must prove, on a balance of probabilities that there was a contravention\u2026of the Human Rights Code. This involves two parts: (1) proof that the alleged conduct by the Respondent occurred; [and] (2) proof that it constituted sexual harassment in the circumstances (for example, that it took place without the complainant\u2019s willing consent). If the Complainant leads evidence which could satisfy these requirements, then the Respondent has an evidentiary burden to respond with some evidence that the acts did not occur or that they did not constitute sexual harassment. (at p. 15-57)\n[143] Once the complainant in a sexual harassment case makes out a prima facie case, the evidentiary burden shifts to the respondent, but the overall burden of proving the allegations on a balance of probabilities remains that of the complainant.\n[144] Section 14 and 14.1 of the CHRA provide:\n14 (1) It is a discriminatory practice,\na) in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public,\nb) in the provision of commercial premises or residential accommodation, or\nc) in matters related to employment,\nd) to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n(2) Without limiting the generality of sub-section (1), sexual harassment shall, for the purposes of that subsection, be deemed to be harassment on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n14.1 It is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n[145] Sexual harassment in the workplace has been broadly defined as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse job-related consequences for the victim of the harassment: Janzen v. Platy Enterprises Ltd., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252 at 1285 (S.C.C.). The first element to be established is that the conduct was unwelcome. An assessment of the complainant\u2019s reaction at the time of the incident or incidents will determine whether the conduct was unwelcome. If the complainant, either expressly or through her behaviour, demonstrates that the conduct was unwelcome, the first element is established. If the evidence shows that the complainant welcomed the conduct, however, the complaint will fail. The second element of sexual harassment requires that the conduct be sexual in nature. Both the Supreme Court of Canada in Janzen, supra, and human rights tribunals have recognized that a broad range of conduct, including gender-based insults, sexist remarks, comments about a person\u2019s looks, dress, appearance or sexual habits, will fall within the ambit of \u201csexual in nature\u201d, and should be determined on a case-by-case basis, based on the test of the reasonable person in the circumstances.: Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces) (re Franke) [1999] F.C.J. No. 757 at paragraphs 32 to 40 (F.C.)\n[146] In certain circumstances, a single incident may be enough to create a hostile work environment, but harassment often requires that an element of persistence or repetition be established. In assessing whether the conduct is sufficiently severe or persistent to create a poisoned workplace, the objective \u201creasonable person standard\u201d applies: Franke, supra at paragraphs 43-46.\n[147] In circumstances where an employer has a comprehensive effective sexual harassment policy in place, the employee should notify the employer of the alleged offensive conduct in order to give the employer the opportunity to remedy it: Franke, supra at paragraphs 47-50.\n[148] In circumstances where the alleged discriminatory practice has been committed by an employee, section 65 of the CHRA is also pertinent:\nSubject to subsection (2), any act or omission committed by an officer, a director, an employee or an agent of any person, association or organization in the course of the employment of that officer, director, employee or agent shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be an act or omission committed by that person, association or organization.\nAn act or omission shall not, by virtue of subsection (1) be deemed to be an act or omission committed by a person, association or organization if it is established that the person, association or organization did not consent to the commission of the act or omission and exercised all due diligence to prevent the act or omission from being committed and subsequently, to mitigate or avoid the effect thereof.\n[149] In order to avail itself of the exculpation provisions in section 65(2), an employer must establish on a balance of probabilities that it did not consent to the acts of its employee, and that it exercised all due diligence to prevent the acts from being committed and, subsequently, to mitigate or avoid their effects.\nVI. Assessing Credibility [150] In R. v. R.E.M., 2008 SCC 51 released at the same time as McDougall, supra, Chief Justice McLachlin commented that findings of fact on credibility may involve factors that are difficult to explain:\nWhile it is useful for a judge to attempt to articulate the reasons for believing a witness and disbelieving another in general or on a particular point, the fact remains that the exercise may not be purely intellectual and may involve factors that are difficult to verbalize. Furthermore, embellishing why a particular witness\u2019 evidence is rejected may involve the judge in saying unflattering things about the witness; judges may wish to spare the accused who takes the stand to deny the crime, for example, the indignity of not only rejecting his evidence in convicting him, but adding negative comments about his demeanour. In short, assessing credibility is a difficult and delicate matter that does not always lend itself to precise and complete verbalization. (paragraph 49)\nA. Credibility of Ms. Nastiuk [151] In assessing the credibility of the Complainant, Ms. Nastiuk, I have analyzed and scrutinized her testimony for its plausibility, I have considered whether her testimony contains any significant inconsistencies and contradictions, I have weighed her testimony against the preponderance of probabilities and surrounding circumstances in existence at the workplace of the GHC during the time she worked there, and, in particular, I have considered her relationship with GHC\u2019s Executive Director, the Respondent, Mr. Sinclair, her dealings with band manager, Dale Morrisseau, and her interactions with other GHC employees.\n[152] Mr. Broman, a former employee at GHC, was called as a witness by the complainant and testified that there was tension in the workplace at GHC: \u201cFirst of all, residential care settings are highly explosive places at times. We are working with \u2026 extremely angry, agitated children, so there\u2019s a lot of pressure on staff. And staff cannot take it out on the children, so sometimes staff tend to take it out on each other\u2026It\u2019s a pretty tough place to work \u2026there was a lot of in-fighting on the floor\u2026people with their own points of view about how a resident should be treated .. (and) that contributed to the level of tension and made it very uncomfortable sometimes. \u2026 there was a lot of back-stabbing, a lot of insults with just about everybody there. You know it was kind of like I would go home quite frustrated at times thinking about the atmosphere.\u201d\n[153] Another significant circumstance surrounding the Complainant\u2019s allegations of sexual harassment is the breakdown of a working relationship between the Complainant and the Respondent, Mr. Sinclair, culminating in her deep-seated aversion to him. From Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s perspective, the deterioration in their relationship started soon after she began to work with Mr. Sinclair in developing a new program for GHC, and had its origin in things said to Ms. Nastiuk in casual conversation between them, comments that made her feel \u201cuncomfortable\u201d. I conclude that this aversion toward Mr. Sinclair distorted her objectivity and ability to testify factually each time she described incidents of perceived \u201cinappropriate\u201d behaviour as sexual harassment.\n[154] In the beginning, Ms. Nastiuk worked in close proximity to Mr. Sinclair and for a time shared his office. I conclude that this created a serious emotional problem for her, leading her to believe that she was at his beck and call to the extent that it denied her the normal work-place freedoms enjoyed by all her co-workers. She also began to feel her work was all-encompassing, driven by the pressure of high expectations and compounded by \u201cthe type of attention and intensity of Mr. Sinclair\u2019s focus \u2026I had to do something because I started getting concerned based on the behaviours that I saw of Mr. Sinclair that he was the one in control, he was used to getting what he wanted.\u201d\n[155] Ms. Nastiuk did not tell Mr. Sinclair to stop his anecdotal comments about himself or his inquiries into her private life, and claimed that if she had done so it might have jeopardized her employment. Even when she was officially employed as case manager at GHC and working in a different building, Ms. Nastiuk still felt he was infatuated with her: \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean he was asking me for sexual favours, or sexual favours or else, that type of thing, it was just like all of a sudden he just thought we were, like \u2013 like just there was a bond or \u2013 it was more than like an executive director \/supervisor\/case manager relationship.\u201d\n[156] In the course of her testimony, and somewhat repeatedly, Ms. Nastiuk revealed a propensity to view herself as blameless, not with respect to her allegations of discrimination, but in the matter of the workplace and interactions with other staff. When questioned about the staff not liking her she answered:\n\u2026some of the issues with staff, there was a lot of resentment that some of the old staff \u2026they were resentful that some of us on-call, part-time staff was moving up and they were down on the floor.\u2026So there \u2013 that\u2019s to me how a lot of that got started, and somewhere in there, I don\u2019t know how that got turned around. There might have been some thoughts on my own. I remember I used to make the comment, because I \u2013 it used to bother them so much, so I would say, well, it\u2019s basically a good fit because I gained a lot of skill and knowledge through my education. It turned out that was absolutely the worst thing I could have said because it put up even more of a barrier.\n[157] Later in her testimony concerning Mr. Sinclair telling her that the staff didn\u2019t want to work with her, Ms. Nastiuk said \u201c\u2026those kinds of behaviours and interactions aren\u2019t the result of me or anything that I\u2019ve got on the go with them. It\u2019s them, like, something is going on \u2026 two were resentful. They wanted offices and they wanted titles and I think pretty much everybody at the centre understood that.\u201d\n[158] Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s poor relations with staff resulted in an arrangement whereby information she required from workers dealing with youths had to be being transmitted to her through Mr. Sinclair, a fact she lamented as \u201canother reason to have to go to his office, and it was very frustrating.\u201d\n[159] At this stage in her employment with GHC, Ms. Nastiuk began searching human rights websites to determine how to define what she was experiencing. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not from the blatant examples of sexual harassment or those kind of behaviours on those sites, it didn\u2019t quite fit that, but it just felt \u2013 it was almost harder to deal with and more \u2013 I don\u2019t know how to \u2013 it was very intrusive . I felt very violated\u2026 So what the heck is this \u2026 it just \u2013 it wasn\u2019t \u2013 it didn\u2019t feel right. I knew it was wrong. It made me feel bad, but by law, it didn\u2019t seem to fit that criteria that you see posted as \u2013 there were examples.\u201d\n[160] In some instances during her direct testimony, Ms. Nastiuk made very broad allegations, prompting the Chairperson to ask her to give specific examples:\nMs. Nastiuk: \u2026 I\u2019d never heard anyone say those things to me before, and it just \u2013 it did not fit.\nThe Chairperson: And when you say those things, what are those things?\nMs. Nastiuk: Those things \u2013 I don\u2019t recall exactly what those things were because they didn\u2019t fit, they infuriated me. ...Why should I retain it? After in the end, when I started finally fitting it together and just taking the blinders off and facing it, calling it more the way it was it was more like projecting. That\u2019s how it felt.\nThe Chairperson: Can you give me an example?\nMs. Nastiuk: Not really. Not \u2013 I can\u2019t really \u2013 and I know I\u2019ve tried to think about that, but, to me, they were just so off the wall, I couldn\u2019t \u2013 I couldn\u2019t retain it. \u2026\nThe Chairperson: \u2026but I\u2019m meaning what things he said to you that \u2013 you\u2019re using strong words like horrible and inappropriate. \u2026psychoanalysis and this, but you\u2019re not giving any specific \u2026\nMs. Nastiuk: I just remember exactly the way it made me feel, and it made me mad.\nTranscript: page 196, line 25; page 197, lines 1-7, 11-23; page 198, lines 8-10, 13-17.\n[161] Despite repeatedly testifying that she suffered in silence, unable to confront Mr. Sinclair and demand he stop making personal comments to her that she found offensive, Ms. Nastiuk acknowledged occasions when she did engage in normal personal conversations with him, and other occasions when she challenged him. These included an incident in the fall of 2005, outside her home, when Mr. Sinclair started talking about her clan, and after Ms. Nastiuk became angry and stopped him, he drove away and later returned and apologized for his behaviour. Ms. Nastiuk also agreed that she engaged in discussions with Mr. Sinclair concerning a possible purchase of one of her automobiles. Ms. Nastiuk related another conversation with Mr. Sinclair in the fall of 2005 when he began talking about her grandmother\u2019s reputation as being the life of the party. She immediately responded and stopped the conversation.\n[162] Early in Ms. Bryson\u2019s cross-examination of Ms. Nastiuk, it was established that after the unsuccessful meeting with Chief McPherson in June 2006, Ms. Nastiuk went on sick leave from June 19, 2006 until October 4, 2006. During that period Ms. Nastiuk provided written requests to the Respondents, intended to serve as a basis to negotiate or mediate her complaints. Contemporaneously, Ms. Nastiuk made a claim for employment insurance benefits on the basis of constructive dismissal that she referred to as \u201cdisguised\u201d dismissal. When questioned by Ms. Bryson to identify the circumstances of her constructive dismissal, Ms. Nastiuk said \u201cthere were reasons why I could not go back to the healing centre, and Mr. Sinclair was a big part of that. The way the program was set up to run it was all part of it.\u201d When pressed by Ms. Bryson to disclose whether it was Mr. Sinclair or the Chief and Council that had terminated her employment, Ms. Nastiuk answered, \u201c it would be both because Couchiching was not around to practice due diligence, Mr. Sinclair was allowed to run the program, hire and fire as he saw fit.\u201d\n[163] At another point in cross-examination, Ms. Nastiuk asserted that she began feeling uncomfortable with Mr. Sinclair in March 2005, right after he started at GHC. Counsel then asked whether during that period Ms. Nastiuk had gone for multiple car rides with Mr. Sinclair, whether he had been to her house for dinner and lunch, whether she had given him the keys to her car and had discussed selling a car to him, whether she kept gifts she received from him (as had all other staff, simultaneously), and whether she let him fix her car, her oil furnace and air conditioner:\nMs. Bryson: And was that because he was your boss or because you wanted him to do those things for you?\nMs. Nastiuk: I did not want him to do those things for me. He volunteered to do those things for me and that \u2013 those thing were right at a point I hadn\u2019t been at GHC for part of April \u2013 or part of April, part of May and things weren\u2019t totally - they weren\u2019t real bad at that point.\nTranscript: page 660, lines 2-11.\nB. Cross-Examination of Ms. Nastiuk by Mr. Sinclair [164] Mr. Sinclair posed a number of questions to Ms. Nastiuk, putting to her a version of interactions between them which differed from her direct evidence. Mr. Sinclair ended his cross-examination of Ms. Nastiuk with a lengthy series of precise questions including the following exchange:\nMr. Sinclair: Well in this particular case I\u2019m here charged with sexual harassment, and to me it\u2019s very important that these issues are made clear. The context in which comments were made, (not) just stating that this was what was said relating to sexual comments or sexual talk, without giving other information to clarify that, don\u2019t you believe that would be harmful \u2013 that could be harmful, Ms. Nastiuk?\nMs. Nastiuk: I guess I would go back to when I was sitting alone in your office and you would start talking and \u2013 talking about yourself and making these comment, and totally disregarding how uncomfortable I was and how inappropriate it was for you to be making those comments to me and the whole thing of just totally ignoring my reaction or lack of reaction.\nMr. Sinclair: Did you ever say, Tom, don\u2019t say that? Don\u2019t talk about that? Did you ever say that to myself Ms. Nastiuk?\nMs. Nastiuk: Not until \u2013 I did say that to you but not until late summer, fall.\nMr. Sinclair: Of what year would that be Ms. Nastiuk?\nMs Nastiuk: 2005.\nMr. Sinclair: And how many times did I say that \u2013 did I go ahead and say something where you never said anything to me? \u2026Was that a common occurrence?\nMs. Nastiuk: I think it was common, that staff \u2013 that the \u2013 knew that look on your face and they knew not to react, respond, speak up. That was common.\nTranscript: page 1290, lines 20-25; page 1291, lines 1-25; page 1292, lines 2-7.\nVII. Complainant Must Establish a Prima Facie Case A. Determination: Credibility of Ms. Nastiuk [165] Once the Tribunal Inquiry commenced, it became the responsibility of the Complainant to present testimony worthy of belief which would establish a prima facie case of sexual harassment against Mr. Sinclair, and retaliation on the part of CFN. She was obliged to prove, on a balance of probabilities, through clear, convincing and cogent evidence, that she had been sexually harassed by the Respondent , Mr. Sinclair, and that CFN had denied her employment opportunities by way of retaliation, after she made her human rights complaints with the Commission.\n[166] This initial evidentiary burden required the Complainant to introduce credible evidence on each constituent element of the alleged discriminatory practice which, if believed, would be sufficient to justify a verdict in the Complainant\u2019s favour; absent an answer from the Respondent.\n[167] When a prima face case is established, the evidentiary burden shifts to the Respondent to present evidence constituting a reasonable explanation.\n[168] However, before a determination is made whether or not the Complainant has established a prima facie case, it is absolutely essential that the adjudicator begin with a finding of fact on the primary issue of the credibility of the Complainant. This finding of fact is fundamental to all other findings of fact on the adduced evidence.\n[169] Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s assertion that Mr. Sinclair\u2019s conduct was ongoing and increasing in intensity is belied by her evidence of the many interactions between them that were normal activities that she willingly engaged in, such as Mr. Sinclair repairing her car, fixing her air conditioning, and her furnace.\n[170] Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s assertion that it was Mr. Sinclair who created a hostile work place in which she worked was shown to be untrue, as she revealed in her own direct evidence and answers in cross-examination, and also by the information that band manager, Dale Morrisseau, received from her co-workers. It was Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s irascibility with and condescension to co-workers that created hostility towards her.\n[171] Ms. Nastiuk testified that she searched human rights websites to determine whether what she described as Mr. Sinclair\u2019s unwelcome and inappropriate behaviour towards her constituted sexual harassment. Despite testifying that Mr. Sinclair\u2019s behaviour did not fit any of the descriptions of sexual harassment that she found while researching the websites, Ms. Nastiuk continues to allege that a pattern of inappropriate behaviour by Mr. Sinclair equates to sexual harassment.\n[172] Having analyzed and scrutinized the testimony of Ms. Nastiuk, I conclude that she was not a believable witness. First, she failed to inform Mr. Sinclair in a timely way that his non-work related contact with her and his personal queries were unwelcome, and second, she failed to establish that such matters were sexual in nature and therefore constituted sexual harassment. Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s testimony was inconsistent and often suppositional rather than objective. Most importantly, her direct testimony failed the test of cross -examination.\n[173] When Ms. Nastiuk was asked in cross-examination by counsel for CFN and Mr. Sinclair, and in questions from the Chairperson, to provide details and examples of the alleged sexual harassment by Mr. Sinclair, she was unable to describe a single example.\n[174] I adopt the submission of counsel for the Respondent CFN concerning Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s complaint of retaliation, as it is an accurate characterization of her evidence:\nDespite repeated attempts in cross examination, CFN could not elucidate one example from Ms. Nastiuk as to how it failed to protect her in the workplace from the alleged effects of Mr. Sinclair\u2019s alleged harassment. Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s issues with CFN focused on her perceived problems with the administration of GHC, which must be viewed in light of her recent education and limited experience in the field as well as the recent resurrection of the GHC program. Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s subsequent retaliation and HRSDC Complaints against CFN inaccurately claim that CFN totally failed to address her concerns and to protect her from effects of harassment by Mr. Sinclair. She does not provide the CHRT with one example of this alleged failure and her statement is at odds with the steps taken by CFN to return her to work after an authorized absence. GHC was not willing to either discipline Mr. Sinclair or to compensate Ms. Nastiuk without definitive evidence of probabilities. Mr. Morrisseau testified that he was confused and uncertain as to the nature of the relationship between the Complainant and Respondent Sinclair and as to the truth of the allegations, so he accommodated and monitored the situation.\n[175] I find as a fact that Ms. Nastiuk was not a credible witness, and that her testimony in support of her allegations of sexual harassment and retaliation is not believable.\nB. Determination: Credibility of Mr. Sinclair [176] The Respondent\u2019s assertions in direct testimony were tested in cross-examination and remained largely intact. I have considered his testimony against the unique surrounding circumstances and stressful atmosphere of CFN\u2019s GHC, and conclude that he is a credible witness who provided believable testimony. Mr. Sinclair denied, or gave reasonable explanations for all of Ms. Nastiuk\u2019s accusations and allegations of inappropriate behaviour and emphatically denied having sexually harassed the Complainant.\nC. Determination: Credibility of Dale Morrisseau [177] Mr. Morrisseau stands apart from all other witnesses in this case. Neutral, objective and dispassionate, he provided cogent and pertinent testimony. He felt that neither Ms. Nastiuk or Mr. Sinclair had revealed to him the full extent of their working\/personal relationship, leaving him with a \u201cshe said\/ he said\u201d conundrum that he could not resolve.\nVIII. Decision [178] On the basis of the foregoing determinations, I dismiss all allegations of discriminatory practices and retaliation made by the Complainant, Ms. Nastiuk, against the Respondent, Mr. Sinclair, and the Respondent, CFN.\nSigned by\nWallace G.

BACKGROUND [1] Mr. Greg Morrison Blain (Complainant) filed a complaint June 20, 2008, with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) alleging that Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Respondent) discriminated against him contrary to sections 7, 10 and 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA). The Complainant alleges that he was denied his right to choose which posting to apply for based on discriminatory and stereotypical attitudes by his Superintendent about his Aboriginal status, which he also believes to constitute harassment. The Complainant also alleges that the numerous Code of Conduct investigations about his role in the Ashcroft Indian Band constitute discrimination and harassment on the basis of his Aboriginal heritage.\n[2] On March 30, 2012, the Commission requested that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (Tribunal) inquire into the complaint pursuant to section 44(3) of the CHRA. The Commission is participating at the hearing representing the public interest in the proceedings.\n[3] The Respondent has filed a judicial review application with the Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, challenging the validity of the Commission's decision to refer the complaint to the Tribunal and requesting an order prohibiting the Tribunal from inquiring into the complaint. The application was issued on April 27, 2012 and has been served on the Complainant and the Commission. In a letter dated May 7, 2012, the Respondent has requested that the Tribunal stays its proceedings towards a hearing into the complaint until the Federal Court of Canada has ruled on its judicial review application, as the general issue before the Federal Court is to determine whether the Commission properly referred the human rights complaint to the Tribunal.\n[4] On May 16, Mr. Susheel Gupta, Acting Chairman, assigned the undersigned to rule on this request. The Respondent did not file a notice of motion, nor did he file a formal motion in accordance with Rule 3 of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure. After all the parties have had an opportunity to present their submissions, I ruled on the request based on the documentation provided.\nII. POSITION OF THE PARTIES [5] The Respondent did not make any other submission or raise any other issue in support of its request for a stay of the Tribunal\u2019s proceedings until the Federal Court has ruled on the Commission\u2019s decision to refer the complaint to the Tribunal.\n[6] Further to the Respondent\u2019s request for a stay of the above-noted matter pending its judicial review application, the Complainant submits that the Respondent\u2019s request should be dismissed. The Complainant contends that the CHRA provides, under s. 48.9 (1), that \u201cproceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow\u201d. To stay this proceeding based on the bare fact that the Respondent has applied for judicial review would not be in accordance with s. 48.9 (1) of the Act, as it would prevent the expeditious resolution of this dispute. This complaint originated in June 2008 and it has already taken almost four years to reach this phase of the process. Further delay pending the Respondent\u2019s judicial review application would be prejudicial to the Complainant.\n[7] In addition, the Complainant contends that the Respondent has requested a stay but has not actually provided any reasons in support of that request, aside from the bare fact of its judicial review application. Therefore, the Complainant submits that it is an insufficient basis to support a stay under the Tribunal\u2019s jurisprudence.\n[8] The Complainant relies on a recent decision by the Tribunal in Marshall v. Cerescorp Co., 2011 CHRT 5, to support its submissions and argues that the Respondent in that case had also applied for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision to refer the matter to the Tribunal, and did not wish to proceed in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s process while the judicial review application was pending.\n[9] The Complainant submits that when the judicial review application in the Marshall case was made, their case was more advanced at the Tribunal stage than this case when the Respondent applied for an adjournment. However, in the Marshall case, even with dates set for the judicial review hearing, the Tribunal did not accede to the Respondent\u2019s adjournment request, as the Respondent had not demonstrated that the continuation of the Tribunal\u2019s proceedings would result in a denial of natural justice.\n[10] Moreover, the Complainant submits that the Respondent has not made any allegations that it would be denied natural justice and procedural fairness if the adjournment request is not granted. The Complainant also alleges that such an allegation could not be established in this case and submits that the Respondent will have a full opportunity to present evidence and make submissions to the Tribunal. Thus, the Complainant contends that the timing and eventual outcome of the Respondent\u2019s judicial review application are presently unknown and that the Complainant should not be compelled to await the results of that application before the Tribunal proceeds to inquire into his complaint.\n[11] The Commission submits that the granting of a stay pending a judicial review application is a matter of public interest and that the request should thus be dismissed. The Commission contends that the request by the Respondent for a stay of proceedings is based on the fact that a judicial review application of the Commission\u2019s decision to refer the complaint to the Tribunal has been initiated and that this mere fact is insufficient in law to justify a stay, notably, in light of s. 48.9 of the CHRA, as well as the case law. Moreover, the Commission contends that no issue of natural justice has been raised to justify this request.\nIII. ANALYSIS [12] In pondering the request for a stay, consideration must be given to s. 48.9(1) of the CHRA, which states that \u201c[p]roceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\u201d\n[13] It is well established that this Tribunal is the master of its own procedure and that deciding on an adjournment of proceedings is very much within its discretion. I find the principles reasoned in Baltruweit, 2004 CHRT 14 (CanLII), to be applicable in this case:\n[15] It is well established that administrative tribunals are the masters of their own proceedings. As such, they possess significant discretion in deciding requests for adjournments. This principle was discussed in some detail by the Supreme Court of Canada in Prassad v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1989] 1. S.C.R. 560. In this case, the appellant sought an adjournment of her immigration inquiry pending a decision on her application to the Minister to permit her to remain in Canada. The adjudicator refused the adjournment.\n[16] In dealing with her appeal, the Supreme Court stated that administrative tribunals, in the absence of specific statutory rules or regulations, are masters of and control their own proceedings. But when tribunals exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions, they must comply with the rules of natural justice. [See also Re Cedarvale Tree Services Ltd. and Labourers' International Union of North America, (1971), 22 D.L.R. (3d) 40, 50 (Ont. C.A.), Pierre v. Manpower and Immigration, [1978] 2 F.C. 849, 851 (FC.T.D.)].\n[14] This said, the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion is subject to the rules of procedural fairness and natural justice, and the regime of the Act. The Act requires the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint when requested by the Commission and also requires that the Tribunal give the parties a full and ample opportunity to present their case and make representations. Section 2 of the Act expresses an overriding public interest in the elimination of discriminatory practices. Pursuant to section 2 of the Act, allegations of discrimination are to be dealt with expeditiously and in a timely fashion.\n[15] In a recent decision I find applicable in this case and that was already cited by the Complainant, Marshall v. Cerescorp Co, the Tribunal member Edward P. Lustig reasoned, at paras. 11-12:\nAccording to section 48.9(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, proceedings before the Tribunal are to be conducted as informally and, of particular relevance to this motion, as expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow. However, as master of its own procedure, the Tribunal may, nonetheless, adjourn its proceedings where appropriate in its discretion (See L\u00e9ger v. Canadian Railways (1999) C.H.R.D. No. 6 (CHRT), at para. 4; Baltruweit v. Canadian Security Intelligence Service, 2004 CHRT 14 at para. 15). The Tribunal must exercise this discretion having regard to principles of natural justice (Baltruweit, at para. 17). Some examples of natural justice concerns to which the Tribunal could respond would include the unavailability of evidence, the need to adjourn to obtain counsel, or late disclosure by an opposite party.\n(\u2026) In order for the Respondent to obtain an adjournment, it must establish that allowing the proceedings before the Tribunal to follow their normal course will result in a denial to the Respondent of natural justice. The Respondent has not persuaded me that any such prejudice would necessarily result if an adjournment were not granted.\n[16] It is my conclusion that the Respondent has not demonstrated that it will be denied procedural fairness or natural justice, or a full and ample opportunity to present evidence and make representations if it is not granted an adjournment. Accordingly, the Respondent's request for an adjournment is denied.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOttawa, Ontario\nJune 12, 2012\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1808\/3812\nStyle of Cause: Greg Morrison Blain v.

Canadian International Development Agency & Health Canada, 2011 CHRT 13 [Cruden].\n[2] On November 24, 2011, counsel on behalf of Ms. Bronwyn Cruden (the Complainant) requested clarification with regards to the implementation of the remedy ordered by the Tribunal at paragraph 176 of its decision in Cruden. Specifically, the order provides:\n\u2026pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(b) of the CHRA, I order CIDA to deploy the complainant in the GPB Branch at the PM06 level and to work with the complainant to post her in a friendly country within her top three choices where there are appropriate medical facilities and no medical restrictions she will face. (Cruden at para. 176)\n[3] In an order made pursuant to subsection 53(2)(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the Act], the person found to have engaged in the discriminatory practice, in this case the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA or the Respondent), is to make available to the victim of discrimination, on the first reasonable occasion, the opportunities that were denied to the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice. The issue currently requiring clarification is the timing of the requirement that the Complainant be posted to a friendly country, namely, what the first reasonable occasion to do so is.\n[4] On December 5, 2011, the Tribunal determined that it was not functus officio and retained jurisdiction with regards to the implementation of the order in issue (Bronwyn Cruden v. Canadian International Development Agency & Health Canada, 2011 CHRT 21). However, the Tribunal requested further submissions from the parties to determine the matter.\n[5] After having reviewed the additional submissions provided by the parties, the Tribunal required further explanation regarding the information contained therein. Due to the technical and factual nature of the parties\u2019 dispute, the Tribunal convened a hearing to receive viva voce evidence from the parties. The hearing was held on January 16, 2012.\n[6] On March 1, 2012 the Tribunal issued a ruling, 2012 CHRT 5, and found that the first reasonable occasion for the Complainant to be posted was in 2013 and, that clarification of its order was required to facilitate its implementation and to ensure that the remedy ordered by the Tribunal is forthcoming to the Complainant. In this regard, the Tribunal directed as follows:\n1. Within seven days of the issuance of this ruling, CIDA must place Ms. Cruden in a PM-06 position in the GPB branch.\n2. Within 15 days of the issuance of this ruling, CIDA is to identify to Ms. Cruden 2013 postings in foreign countries that are or will be available where there are appropriate medical facilities and no medical restrictions that she will face.\n3. Within 21 days of Ms. Cruden indicating to CIDA in writing her top three choices for posting among those identified by CIDA (whether it be three choices for posting in different countries; in the same country; or, two choices in one country and one in another), CIDA is to prepare a customized learning plan, in consultation with Ms. Cruden, outlining any training and\/or experience Ms. Cruden needs to complete and\/or acquire in order for her to succeed in one of the field postings chosen for 2013.\n4. The customized learning plan must specify how CIDA will provide the required training and\/or experience to Ms. Cruden and must also include a schedule, with dates, as to when the training and\/or experience will be provided to Ms. Cruden before the posting date.\n5. Once Ms. Cruden has completed the required training and\/or experience identified by the learning plan; CIDA is to post Ms. Cruden to the field assignment for which the learning plan was developed.\n[7] The Tribunal remained seized of this matter in order to be available in the event any further clarification is required and until the parties confirm that the terms of the Tribunal\u2019s order have been implemented.\n[8] The Tribunal received a letter from the Respondent dated April 25 2012 seeking to amend a portion of the order that states as follows:\nWithin 15 days of the issuance of this ruling, CIDA is to identify to Ms. Cruden 2013 postings in foreign countries that are or will be available where there are appropriate medical facilities and no medical restrictions that she will face.\n[9] The Tribunal received submissions from all parties on their positions on the proposed amendment. The Respondent\u2019s reply was filed June 1, 2012.\n[10] In support of his proposed amendment, The Respondent contends:\nWe propose that the wording of part 2 be amended to reflect the fact that CIDA will not be able to offer Ms. Cruden a 2013 posting until October 2012. This is due to the fact that the 2012 process is ongoing and positions available for 2013 will not be identified until the 2012 process is complete. CIDA anticipates knowing which positions will be available for 2013 posting cycle in October of 2012 and is willing to commit to identifying the possible positions to Ms. Cruden as soon as the information is available.\nOf course, if the information becomes available before October 2012, CIDA will identify the postings to Ms. Cruden before.\n[11] The respondent contends that pursuant to part 1 of the March 1 order, Ms. Cruden is currently occupying a PM-06 position in the GPB Branch at CIDA. Pursuant to Part 4 of March 1 order, Ms. Cruden and CIDA have worked together to create a customized Learning Plan. CIDA is committed to honoring part 5 of the March 1 order, once Ms. Cruden\u2019s training is completed.\n[12] According to the field postings, the Respondent submits that they typically have a duration of 2 years with an option to extend by 1 year. The follow-up with in-place field staff to assess their interest in pursuing an extension (or not) and management\u2019s concurrence therein is undertaken in the summer. If there is agreement that an employee will extend, then the position is clearly not included in the offering of field postings. If an incumbent opts not to extend and\/or management does not concur with extension, then the position becomes part of the annual Field Posting Exercise (FPE) for that additional year. Typically, the Respondent knows this is in the months of September\/October, in advance of launching the formal FPE process in October.\n[13] And provides assurances such as the following:\n(1) the available options will be provided to Ms. Cruden at the earliest opportunity, and in any event, before the launch of the formal posting processes;\n(2) varying the schedule in this manner will not affect Ms. Cruden\u2019s learning plan, which is designed to provide her with skills that will be required, regardless of what country options become available; and\n(3) Ms. Cruden will have time to acquire country-specific skills in the period between September\/October of 2012, and the summer of 2013 since the training plan the Respondent has developed with the Complainant aims to develop the skills, and provide the experience and knowledge required, to conduct development work in the field generally, and not in a particular country.\nI. The Commission\u2019s position [14] The Commission accepts that the Tribunal has authority to vary the deadline in the circumstances of this case. In the Commission\u2019s view, this step could be taken as a further exercise of the jurisdiction it retained to oversee implementation of remedies, and \/or as a matter of affording procedural fairness to CIDA, which to my knowledge was previously unaware that a 15 day deadline might be attached to any requirement to advise of available posting opportunities.\n[15] With respect to the substance of CIDA\u2019s request, the Commission agrees with CIDA that Ms. Cruden should be informed of the posting options for 2013 as soon as the information is available. The Commission also notes that CIDA, has said it is not possible to comply with the deadline in the Ruling, or to disclose available opportunities before September or October of 2012\n[16] The Commission also notes that CIDA has said it is not possible to comply with the deadline in the Ruling, or to disclose available opportunities before September or October of 2012.\n[17] In the circumstances, and based on the assurances described above by the Respondent, the Commission consents to CIDA\u2019s request to vary the Ruling.\nII. The Complainant\u2019s position (reproduced in its entirety) [18] Ms. Cruden is concerned that, if the Tribunal grants CIDA\u2019S request without putting a number of safeguards in place, this will have a negative impact on her.\nA. The Learning Plan [19] Ms. Cruden's Learning Plan is a critical aspect of the preparation for a posting and in order to illustrate Ms. Cruden's concerns, it is important to understand how the Learning Plan was developed, its implementation and the impact of CIDA\u2019s proposed new timeline on posting selection. We have enclosed a copy of the Learning Plan.\nB. Learning Plan Development [20] When Ms. Cruden returned to work in February 2012 she was tasked with developing her Learning Plan.\n[21] Ms. Cruden was unsure where to begin. She completed the first column in the plan - the learning objectives - by identifying those experiences that CIDA had identified in the Asia posting exercise of 2012 that she was lacking.\n[22] This Learning Plan was developed with the operational requirements of an Asia posting as its focus. While Ms. Cruden\u2019s Learning Plan should cover the operational requirements of other postings, they do not necessarily reflect the requirements of postings outside of Asia. For example, in South American countries, the working language is Spanish, a language Ms. Cruden does not speak, and this is not contained within her Learning Plan at present.\n[23] Furthermore, the activities chosen for Experience in formulating and delivering strategic advice and recommendations for senior managers, at Row 5, were determined as a result of discussions with Ms. Cruden\u2019s director. Ms. Cruden\u2019s director thought that she should use the opportunity for learning to attend the International Program for Development Evaluation Training (IPDET), and requested that she work that into her Learning Plan.\n[24] Ms. Cruden\u2019s director recognized that this learning objective would build on her extensive experience in the development of the Benchmarking Memorandum to Cabinet and the Results and Risk Management Accountability Framework approved by the Treasury Board Secretariat among others, and suggested this learning objective would allow her the opportunity to gain evaluation training and experience. This learning objective is designed to allow for a thorough understanding of evaluation work, which will strengthen Ms. Cruden\u2019s ability to manage programs.\n[25] Lastly, it is important to note that in Column 4 of the Learning Plan, \u201cop\u201d denotes those objectives derived from Asia postings, whereas \u201cperf\u201d denotes those objectives that were added by Ms. Cruden\u2019s director in order to assist her with her development. For example, it was recommended by the second in command to the Asia Regional Director General that Ms. Cruden take the \u201cPreparing Treasury Board Submissions\u201d drafting course (Row 6) as it may prove useful in the future to assist the Asia directorate achieve its objectives.\nC. Implementation of the Learning Plan [26] A review of Ms. Cruden\u2019s Learning Plan reveals that many of the key competencies are still to be determined (TBD). The following explains in more detail the impact of the failure to determine these key competencies on Ms. Cruden\u2019s ability to succeed.\nRows 1 and 2 - Experience in liaising with local, national or international stakeholders\/collaborating with government representatives or IOs (two separate learning objectives).\nRow 3 - These objectives will not be achieved until Ms. Cruden is assigned an active project. The first three projects she has been assigned are two closing projects, which do not require liaison with stakeholders, and the Program Support Facility, which is a project that Ms. Cruden has previously managed.\n[27] CIDA\u2019s assessment of Ms. Cruden\u2019s prior experience in the field (the seven weeks in Kabul and Kandahar in 2007 and 2008) was that it was not sufficient for a spent posting in 2012. The plan was that she would be provided with an opportunity to gain the requisite knowledge and field experience during the period she is working at headquarters before she obtains a posting in 2013. At this time, there is no timeline to obtain the additional two weeks of field experience deemed necessary to attain the required field experience.\nRow 4 - This row contains all of the experience required for project management. The first two projects assigned to Ms. Cruden were both closing projects and the third is one that she has previously managed on the Afghanistan Program. As such, the CIDA deemed essential for posting to be successful has yet to be planned or implemented.\n[28] Furthermore, CIDA has yet to assign Ms. Cruden with an appropriate mentor to guide her development. Instead she has been advised to direct any questions to the Chief of Operations for Indonesia, whom according to the Complainant, only has a few years of operational experience. While Ms. Cruden has no Issue with the Chief of Operation's efforts to assist her, she was been told by the Chief of Operations that, to date, she has to seek answers to all of Ms. Cruden\u2019s questions from others, which means that they have not always been answered.\n[29] As a result Ms. Cruden spends a great deal of time trying to figure out what she needs to know and then has to go through a circuitous route to obtain answers. The assignment of an appropriate mentor who has a wealth of experience in program management and who could actively guide her through the program management process is critical if Ms. Cruden is to meet the objectives in her Learning Plan. For example, Lawrence Peck of the Afghanistan Program would be ideal given his wealth of experience in the program management in CIDA.\nRow 5 - Shadowing the Program Evaluation is not experience within the control of the Geographic Programs Branch, but with the Policy Branch at CIDA. Time is not only required for negotiations between branches, but Ms. Cruden\u2019s participation needs to be included in the Terms of Reference of the eventual contracting of the evaluator. Although the evaluation is planned for September, to date, there has been no discussion between branches on this objective\nD. Timeline Impact on Posting Selection [30] The original ruling ensured that Ms. Cruden was not forced to compete with others for the eventual posting. Should you revise the ruling as requested by CIDA, Ms. Cruden will be providing her list of postings to CIDA when others are competing for the postings of their choosing. As such, CIDA will be able to choose which posting to provide Ms. Cruden after assessing who is competing for the same postings. Moreover, it will be unfair to all staff to compete for a posting that may not be available for competition.\n[31] Furthermore, the Learning Plan in place is supposed to be completed by April 2013. If the extension is granted, Ms. Cruden will be provided with a list of postings at a time when only six months of her Learning Plan will have been completed, and some of the key experiences identified in the plan will not have been achieved.\n[32] As well, should Ms. Cruden\u2019s posting be in a country outside of the Asia program, due to the fact that the options are limited given budgetary restrictions, it will provide her with only six to nine months for language training.\n[33] Given the above, Ms. Cruden is proposing a revision to CIDA\u2019s request for an extension as follows:\n1. CIDA will provide Ms. Cruden the list of postings in 2013, two weeks prior to advertising the postings to CIDA employees.\n2. Ms. Cruden will provide CIDA with her choice of three positions within one week of receipt of the list in item 1. CIDA will choose the final posting. After communication of this decision to Ms. Cruden, they will then post the list of countries to all employees as per normal process.\n3. Completion of the Learning Plan should not be a factor in proceeding with the posting in 2013.\n4. Should Ms. Cruden not be able to provide CIDA with three positions as stipulated in the order, she will identify one or two postings, with the understanding that this would enable CIDA, should it decide not to provide Ms. Cruden with one of countries identified, to defer the posting to 2014. This will account for the fact that there will likely be fewer positions in 2013 than any previous year given the budget reductions, and as such, likely fewer suitable positions that Ms. Cruden can request in family-friendly countries.\nExamples of how the budget has affected the number of postings are as follows:\n\u2022 This year, postings to Mozambique, Rwanda and South Africa were cancelled (confirmed by the attached minutes from staff meeting).\n\u2022 CIDA has closed programs in eight countries (three in Asia and five in Africa, see enclosed news article).\n[34] Positions in Asia that Ms. Cruden will be eligible to apply for will be greatly reduced in 2013. There are three fewer countries available, plus she is not able to take on a position in Bangladesh as the Head of Mission is her sister. This would mean that Ms. Cruden could not replace her supervisor, the Head of Aid, during her absence as she would have to report directly to her sister.\n[35] Furthermore, given that two positions were filled in Vietnam in 2012, the only position she could apply for in Vietnam in 2013 would likely be an EX-1 position. The only way that this would be possible, as an EX-1 position is not contemplated in the order, is if Ms. Cruden actually met the competencies, or if the PM-06 going on posting in 2012 in Vietnam, who was has been acting as an EX-1 for a number of years, would consider taking on the EX-1 role enabling Ms. Cruden to take over the PM-06 role.\n[36] Vietnam was Ms. Cruden\u2019s second choice of postings after Afghanistan. As a result, if she cannot find suitable positions in other regions, Ms. Cruden would prefer have CIDA postpone her posting to 2014 rather than provide a country in the list of three that she would not feel comfortable living for three years. The current ruling does not provide for a way forward should Ms. Cruden not be able to provide three positions.\nIII. The Respondent\u2019s reply to the Complainant\u2019s submissions [37] The Respondent already advised that the Complainant would be alerted about the available positions in advance of the launch of the formal process. The Respondent expects to provide this information in October 2012, which is expected to be more than two weeks before the launch of the formal process.\n[38] The Complainant\u2019s concerns have been relayed to the Respondent, which remains available to discuss and work through any of her concerns.\n[39] The Respondent reiterates that the Complainant\u2019s Learning Plan will not be affected by the requested amendment.\n[40] Finally the Respondent responds to the request made by the Complainant to be allowed to postpone her posting until 2014 if she is not satisfied with the choice of available postings. The Respondent contends that this request contradicts the intent of the Order, as recognized in the Ruling dated March 1, 2012, which was to make available, at the first reasonable opportunity, the opportunities that were denied to the Complainant. The Respondent further contends that the original order specifically provided that the Respondent would retain some discretion as to which country the Complainant would be posted. According to the Respondent this last request from the Complainant is inappropriate as it entails a significant and prejudicial amendment of the Order, and it prolongs the fulfillment of the terms of the Order. The Respondent asks the Tribunal not to consider this last request or at the very least not in the context of the Respondent\u2019s amendment request.\n[41] The Respondent suggests that if the Complainant is dissatisfied with the opportunities that will be made available to her, she could always bring a motion at that time and the Tribunal\u2019s ruling would not be made in an evidentiary vacuum.\nIV. Analysis [42] In Cruden, and in its March 1, 2012 ruling in this matter, the Tribunal retained jurisdiction to oversee the implementation of the remedies ordered in this case. Pursuant to that jurisdiction, the Respondent makes a request that the Tribunal vary the timeline for implementation of the order outlined in its March 1, 2012 ruling. The Commission consents to the Respondent\u2019s request and the Complainant, in the event the timeline for the implementation of the order is extended, requests appropriate safeguards be put in place to ensure that the order is implemented. I accept the Respondent\u2019s contention that 2013 postings cannot be identified until the 2012 process is complete and that the Respondent will only have this information in or around October of 2012. Therefore, the Tribunal\u2019s March 1, 2012 will be amended accordingly, pursuant to the terms below.\n[43] That being said, in response to the Respondent\u2019s current request, the Complainant raised concerns regarding the development and implementation of the Learning Plan. In this regard, it is instructive to understand why a clarification of the Cruden Order was required and, to understand the reasons that led to the March 1, 2012 ruling regarding the issue of the first reasonable occasion to post the Complainant. A portion of those reasons is reproduced below:\n[14] However, aside from making this statement, there is no indication that a defined learning plan has been developed. There is no indication that the Respondent has worked with the Complainant to identify satisfactory postings; what additional training and\/or experience is required for her to succeed in a posting; how the Respondent proposes she gain the required training and\/or experience to succeed in a posting; and, when, as a result, will be the first reasonable opportunity to post her abroad.\n[15] Even though the Complainant identified her preferred posting choices to CIDA early on in the posting process, a defined learning plan was not established at that time. Nor was a learning plan in place by the time the Tribunal conducted its hearing in this matter on January 16, 2012. At the hearing, CIDA\u2019s witness was not able to identify any concrete steps CIDA has taken in considering how it will implement the Tribunal\u2019s order because she was not involved in the implementation of the order. According to the Respondent, it sent a letter to the Complainant and her counsel inviting her to communicate with them about the way to implement the order and the Complainant did not respond. The Respondent contends communications were interrupted between the parties when the Complainant made its request for clarification to the Tribunal in November 2011. I find this explanation is not credible. In early November, the Complainant was told by the Respondent that CIDA was not going to post her in 2012, but that she could apply to the posting process anyways. She then applied for the two Vietnam postings and was screened out. At any moment after the Complainant made her posting choices, CIDA could have planned a meeting with her to start the discussions on how to implement the Tribunal`s order. The Complainant was available for such discussions.\n[16] Pursuant to section 53(2)(b) of the Act, the obligation is on the Respondent to make available to the Complainant the opportunities that were denied to her as a result of the discriminatory practice. To determine when the first reasonable occasion to post the Complainant is, the Respondent must first seriously consider how it will implement the order. While the Tribunal\u2019s order was meant as a guideline in order to allow the parties to work out between themselves the details of the implementation of the order, this may have resulted in the Complainant losing the opportunity to be posted to the positions in Vietnam. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that clarification of its order is required to facilitate its implementation and to ensure that the remedy ordered by the Tribunal is forthcoming to the complainant.\n(Cruden at paras. 14-16)\n[44] In light of these reasons, I added requirements to the Order to assist the parties in taking steps towards developing and implementing an effective Learning Plan and to ensure the Complainant would be trained in time for a 2013 posting. Having considered the parties\u2019 most recent submissions, there still seems to be issues between the parties regarding the development and implementation of the Learning Plan. While the Respondent states that it has worked with the Complainant to develop a Learning Plan and that going forward it will work with the Complainant to address her concerns regarding the Learning Plan, the Complainant submits that she was left on her own to design her Learning Plan. The Respondent states that varying the timeline for implementing the Order will not affect Ms. Cruden\u2019s Learning Plan and that Ms. Cruden will have time to acquire country-specific skills in the period between September\/October of 2012 and the summer of 2013. While the order below covers these issues, I believe a further conference call following the issuance of this ruling would be beneficial to ensure that the parties understand their obligations under the order going forward and to provide any further clarification that may be needed. A further conference call will also be an opportunity to discuss the issues raised by the parties regarding the implementation of the order beyond the 2013 posting cycle.\nV. Order [45] Pursuant to the reasons above, the Tribunal orders as follows:\n1. At least 2 weeks prior to advertising 2013 postings to other CIDA employees, CIDA is to provide Ms. Cruden with a list of the 2013 postings in foreign countries that are or will be available where there are appropriate medical facilities and no medical restrictions that she will face.\n2. Within one week following receipt of the list in item 1 above, Ms. Cruden will provide CIDA with her top three choices for posting among those postings identified by CIDA.\n3. Among the three posting choices identified by Ms. Cruden, CIDA will choose the final posting and communicate that choice to Ms. Cruden prior to advertising any postings to other CIDA employees.\n4. Following CIDA\u2019s choice of Ms. Cruden\u2019s posting location for 2013, CIDA is to finalize a customized Learning Plan, in consultation with Ms. Cruden, outlining any training and\/or experience Ms. Cruden needs to complete and\/or acquire in order for her to succeed in the 2013 posting.\n5. The customized Learning Plan must specify how CIDA will provide the required training and\/or experience to Ms. Cruden and must also include a schedule, with dates, as to when the training and\/or experience will be provided to Ms. Cruden before the 2013 posting date.\n6. Once Ms. Cruden has completed the required training and\/or experience identified by the Learning Plan; CIDA is to post Ms. Cruden to the 2013 field assignment for which the Learning Plan was developed.\n[46] The Tribunal shall continue to remain seized of this matter in order to be available in the event any further clarification is required and until the parties confirm that the terms of the Tribunal\u2019s order have been implemented.\n[47] The parties are asked to provide the Registry by August 7, 2012 their availabilities for a conference call to take place during the weeks of August 13, 2012 or August 20, 2012.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nJuly 6, 2012\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1466\/1210\nStyle of Cause: Bronwyn Cruden v.

Motion. 1\nII....... Background. 1\nIII..... Positions of the parties. 2\nIV..... Analysis. 4\nV....... Ruling. 8\nI. Motion [1] The co-complainant in this matter, the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), makes a motion for \u201c...an order that Susheel Gupta, Vice-Chairperson, Acting Chairperson appoint a panel of three members [as opposed to a single member] to hear the within complaint\u201d.\nII. Background [2] This motion is raised in the context of a complaint, pursuant to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the Act), made by the AFN and the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada (FNCFCS). The Complainants allege that the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (the Respondent), now known as the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, provides inequitable levels of child welfare funding to First Nations children living on reserve. According to the Complainants, this amounts to discrimination on the grounds of race and national or ethnic origin.\n[3] On March 14, 2011, following a motion by the Respondent, the Tribunal had dismissed the complaint (see First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada, 2011 CHRT 4 [FNCFCS et al.]).\n[4] Subsequently, three applications for judicial review of the Tribunal\u2019s March 2011 ruling were filed with the Federal Court. In Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FC 445, dated April 18, 2012, the Federal Court granted the applications for judicial review and set aside the Tribunal\u2019s ruling. The matter was remitted back to a differently constituted panel of the Tribunal for re-determination.\n[5] Pursuant to the Federal Court\u2019s order in 2012 FC 445 and section 49(2) of the Act, on May 7, 2012, I, as Acting Chairperson, assigned Member Sophie Marchildon to inquire into the complaint.\n[6] On May 23, 2012, counsel for the FNCFCS sent a letter to the Tribunal stating, among other things, that it had canvassed the views of the AFN and the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) on the assignment of a new member to hear the case and that it was their collective position that the Tribunal should assign a panel of three members to inquire into the matter.\n[7] On May 31, 2012, I advised the parties that Member Marchildon was assigned to inquire into the complaint on May 7, 2012.\n[8] On June 5, 2012, the AFN wrote to the Tribunal urging me to reconsider the decision to assign the case to a single member and instead assign a panel of three members. The AFN requested an opportunity to discuss the matter in a case conference call or to make representations to the Tribunal on the issue.\n[9] In response to the AFN\u2019s letter, on June 8, 2012, I indicated that I would consider a motion submitted by the AFN in support of its request that I reconsider my May 7, 2012 assignment decision.\n[10] On June 15, 2012, the AFN filed the current motion requesting that I appoint a panel of three members to inquire into its complaint.\nIII. Positions of the parties [11] According to the AFN, section 49(2) of the Act grants broad discretion to the Chairperson to govern the Tribunal\u2019s procedure and the Chairperson retains the discretion to revisit any assignment decisions as long as there is no breach of the principles of fairness and there is no prejudice to any party before it.\n[12] Based on previous case management discussions held on December 14, 2009, the AFN submits that it had a reasonable expectation that best efforts would be made to appoint a three member panel. The AFN also claims that it had a legitimate expectation that there would be an opportunity to further set out its concerns in an open, transparent process akin to that of a case management meeting. In this regard, the AFN submits that the failure to provide an opportunity to participate and to state the reasons for the shift in commitment from a three member panel to a single member panel may constitute a reviewable error.\n[13] The AFN also submits that it is in the interests of justice and expediency for me to revisit the assignment decision in this case. According to the AFN, in deciding whether to appoint a three member panel, consideration must be given to the impact the decision to appoint a panel may have on the conduct of the hearing and the deliberative process. It submits that the complaint raises complex issues that will have far-reaching consequences both in terms of the impact on First Nations children, as well as on human rights jurisprudence in general. The evidence will be extensive and detailed, and the Tribunal will likely be called upon to make numerous rulings on procedural objections. Further, they submit that as competent as a single member may be, there is an advantage in complex cases to having the insight and contribution to the deliberative process of two additional members. In this regard, the AFN adds that the high level of scrutiny which this case will be under merits consideration of the increased confidence that may result from knowledge by the parties and the broader public that a more nuanced result has been obtained due to the contribution and reflection of a three member panel.\n[14] The FNCFCS submits that, for several years, it was the practice of the Tribunal to reconsider assignment decisions if it was in the interests of efficiency, expediency and justice. According to the FNCFCS, an assignment decision pursuant to section 49(2) of the Act affects the interests of parties and, therefore, parties should generally be canvassed if they have a view on the matter. Given the history of the present matter, and the complexity of the legal and factual issues raised, the FNCFCS claims that prior to making its assignment decision, it would have been appropriate for the Tribunal to canvass the parties on whether a panel ought to be appointed.\n[15] The Commission adopted the submissions filed by the FNCFCS.\n[16] The Attorney General took no position on the motion.\nIV. Analysis [17] Section 48.4(3) of the Act provides that the Vice-Chairperson shall perform the functions of the Chairperson if the Chairperson is absent or unable to act or the office of Chairperson is vacant.\n[18] In this regard, section 49(1) and 49(2) of the Act provide:\n49. (1) At any stage after the filing of a complaint, the Commission may request the Chairperson of the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint if the Commission is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry is warranted.\n49. (1) La Commission peut, \u00e0 toute \u00e9tape post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte, si elle est convaincue, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 celle-ci, que l\u2019instruction est justifi\u00e9e.\n(2) On receipt of a request, the Chairperson shall institute an inquiry by assigning a member of the Tribunal to inquire into the complaint, but the Chairperson may assign a panel of three members if he or she considers that the complexity of the complaint requires the inquiry to be conducted by three members.\n(2) Sur r\u00e9ception de la demande, le pr\u00e9sident d\u00e9signe un membre pour instruire la plainte. Il peut, s\u2019il estime que la difficult\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire le justifie, d\u00e9signer trois membres, auxquels d\u00e8s lors les articles 50 \u00e0 58 s\u2019appliquent.\n[19] The power to assign a member or a panel of three members is vested exclusively in the Chairperson (see Brink\u2019s Canada Ltd. v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1996] 2 FC 113 (QL) at para. 28 [Brink\u2019s]). In making this determination, section 49(2) provides that the Chairperson consider the complexity of the complaint.\n[20] Complexity must be assessed on a case-by-case basis and some of the factors to consider can include the nature and scope of the complaint, the specific facts giving rise to the complaint, the legal issues raised, and the potential nature and volume of documentary and witness evidence.\n[21] Section 48.9(1) of the Act directs that proceedings should be conducted as expeditiously as possible. The Act also provides that the Chairperson is the Chief Executive Officer of the Tribunal and has supervision over and direction of the Tribunal\u2019s work, including the allocation of work among the members and the management of the Tribunal\u2019s internal affairs (see section 48.4(2)). As a steward of public funds, the Chairperson has a responsibility to manage the Tribunal\u2019s resources to effectively and efficiently fulfill its mandate to the public. This responsibility includes considering the institutions resources when deciding the assignment of cases in order to allow the Tribunal to deal with all complaints that are referred to it.\n[22] Therefore, given the scheme and wording of the Act, the decision to assign a member or a panel of three members to an inquiry is one based on the Chairperson\u2019s consideration of not only the complexity of the complaint, but also the management of the Tribunal. Subject to the analysis below, the parties have not demonstrated that submissions are generally required prior to making a decision regarding the assignment of a case pursuant to section 49(2) of the Act.\n[23] In this case, the Tribunal appointed a single member to inquire into this complaint on May 7, 2012. That said, the authority of the Chairperson to assign members to an inquiry is not subject to the principle of functus officio where circumstances require the authority to be exercised more than once for the purposes of the Act to be served (see Brink\u2019s at para. 28). However, the authority to alter an assignment decision does not permit making such changes in circumstances where doing so breaches the principles of fairness or causes prejudice to any party before the Tribunal (see Brink\u2019s at para. 29). On this motion, none of the parties raised any fairness issues or claimed there would be prejudice if the May 7, 2012 assignment of a single member was replaced by the assignment of a three member panel. Rather, aside from the Attorney General who took no position on the motion, the other parties advocate for the Tribunal to assign a three member panel to this inquiry. I am therefore free to reconsider my May 7, 2012 assignment decision.\n[24] The AFN submits that it had a reasonable expectation that best efforts would be made to appoint a three member panel. Its position is based on a case management meeting held on December 14, 2009 between the Tribunal and the parties, which was summarized in a letter from the Tribunal sent to the parties on December 23, 2009. In that letter, under the heading \u201cPanel\u201d, it states: \u201cThe Chair indicated that she is willing to make her best efforts to constitute a panel\u201d.\n[25] In Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 SCR 817 [Baker], the Supreme Court of Canada stated that the doctrine of legitimate expectation\n\u2026is based on the principle that the \u201ccircumstances\u201d affecting procedural fairness take into account the promises or regular practices of administrative decision-makers, and that it will generally be unfair for them to act in contravention of representations as to procedure, or to backtrack on substantive promises without according significant procedural rights.\n(Baker at para. 26)\n[26] While the doctrine of legitimate expectation can give rise to a right to make representations, a right to be consulted or more extensive procedural rights, it does not create substantive rights and does not fetter the discretion of a statutory decision-maker (see Moreau-B\u00e9rub\u00e9 v. New Brunswick (Judicial Council), 2002 SCC 11 at para. 78).\n[27] Given that the doctrine of legitimate expectation does not create substantive rights and does not fetter the discretion of a statutory decision-maker, I find that there could not have been a legitimate expectation that a three member panel would absolutely be assigned to this case. However, given that the Chairperson was actively consulting the parties through case management, and given her statement that best efforts would be made to constitute a panel, this may have created an expectation that the parties would be consulted prior to an assignment decision being made. While the parties were not afforded this opportunity before my May 7, 2012 assignment decision, this current motion has provided the parties with a forum to express their views on the matter. Therefore, in my view, if there was an expectation of being consulted before assigning the case, that expectation has been addressed by the parties\u2019 ability to make representations on the issue in the current motion.\n[28] The AFN also submits that it is in the interests of justice and expediency to revisit the assignment decision in this case. Specifically, the AFN suggests there is an advantage in complex cases to having the insight and contribution to the deliberative process of two additional members, which also increases confidence in the decision rendered. The complexity and importance of the issues raised in this complaint have been acknowledged by both the Tribunal and the Federal Court. As the AFN points out, the complexity of the complaint will require extensive and detailed evidence, resulting in numerous rulings on procedural objections and several weeks of hearing. In this regard, whether a single member or a three member panel is assigned to this case, the parties and the Tribunal have and will continue to have to expend significant time and resources on adjudicating this complaint. As Acting Chairperson and CEO, and pursuant to section 48.4(2) of the Act, as previously discussed, I must effectively manage the limited resources of the Tribunal, including the allocation of work among the members. In weighing the needs of this case and the management of the Tribunal, I must facilitate a fair and expeditious process not only for the adjudication of this complaint, but for all complaints referred to the Tribunal. As the Complainants have indicated, most recently in the FNCFCS\u2019 May 23, 2012 letter to the Tribunal, the expeditious resolution of this complaint is of great consequence to them:\nAs stated in previous letters to the Tribunal, expeditiousness is of upmost importance to our clients. [\u2026] Every delay that occurs in this matter causes thousands of First Nations children to be further isolated from their families and communities and deprived of adequate and culturally relevant care. Any further delays would bring the administration of justice into disrepute and cause significant prejudice to the victims of discrimination.\n[29] Given the Tribunal\u2019s current workload and the availability of members, assigning a three member panel to this particular matter may impact the scheduling of case management conference calls, the hearing of motions and the ultimate dates for the hearing, as compared to continuing with a single member. That being said, if the parties remain cognizant of and flexible with regards to the challenges of coordinating member availability, and work together to move this matter forward with the management and assistance of the Tribunal, I find that assigning a three member panel to inquire into this complaint may not significantly affect the management of the Tribunal\u2019s workload, internal affairs, or the expeditious inquiry into this complaint. With this in mind, I note the parties\u2019 openness and agreement to having Member Marchildon case manage this matter while this motion was being considered. On this basis, a three member panel shall be assigned to inquire into this complaint.\nV. Ruling [30] For the reasons stated above, this ruling serves to advise the parties that a three member panel is assigned to inquire into this complaint. In addition to Member Marchildon, the two additional members assigned to inquire into this complaint and form the panel are Member B\u00e9langer and Member Lustig. Pursuant to section 49(3) of the Act, I designate Member Marchildon as the chair of the inquiry.\nSigned by\nSusheel Gupta\nVice-Chairperson, Acting Chairperson and CEO\nOttawa, Ontario\nJuly 10, 2012\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1340\/7008\nStyle of Cause: First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v.

Lustig\nDate: August 23, 2012\nCitation: 2012 CHRT 17\nI. Context [1] The Complainants filed a human rights complaint alleging that the inequitable funding of child welfare services on First Nations reserves amounted to discrimination on the basis of race and national ethnic origin, contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RCS 1985, c. H-6 (the Act). In a decision dated March 14, 2011, reported at 2011 CHRT 4, the Tribunal granted a motion brought by the Respondent for the dismissal of the complaint on the ground that the issues raised in the complaint were beyond the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction: the \u201cjurisdictional motion\u201d. The Tribunal determined that it did not possess jurisdiction pursuant to section 5(b) of the Act to hear the complaint as there could be no finding of adverse differential treatment on the part of the Government of Canada in absence of a proper comparator group. This decision was subsequently the subject of an application for judicial review before the Federal Court.\n[2] On April 18, 2012, the Federal Court rendered its decision, reported at 2012 FC 445, setting aside the Tribunal\u2019s decision and remitting the matter to a differently constituted panel of the Tribunal for re-determination in accordance with its reasons.\n[3] In the Case Management Conference Call held on June 25th, 2012 and later summarized by the Tribunal in a letter dated June 29th, 2012, the parties requested that Member Marchildon issue a directive on the interpretation of the Federal Court\u2019s remittance order in its decision 2012 FC 445. More specifically, the parties sought guidance as to whether the order, remitting the matter back to the Tribunal for re-determination in accordance with its reasons, required that the Tribunal rehear the motion to dismiss that had been the subject of the judicial review before the Federal Court. Member Marchildon requested that parties make submissions on this issue, setting deadlines for initial submissions and replies for the upcoming two weeks.\n[4] On July 10th, 2012, Vice-Chairperson and Acting Chairperson Gupta revised his initial one-member appointment to this matter and appointed a panel of three members composed of Members Marchildon, Lustig and B\u00e9langer (2012 CHRT 16). Consequently, the present ruling has been decided upon by all members of the panel.\nII. Analysis [5] It is to be noted that in each of the their submissions regarding this issue, the parties have requested that the Tribunal proceed to a hearing on the merits of the complaint subject to the hearing of outstanding preliminary motions.\n[6] With this in mind and having carefully examined the parties\u2019 submissions on this issue, along with the Federal Court\u2019s reasons in its decision 2012 FC 445, the panel is of the view that in reversing the Tribunal\u2019s determination that it did not possess jurisdiction to hear the complaint, the Federal Court has definitively determined the jurisdictional issue. Indeed, in remitting the matter back to the Tribunal, the Federal Court did not suggest that re-determination should take the form of another hearing and, more importantly, it provided specific reasons which compel the Tribunal to reach the conclusion that the jurisdictional motion must be dismissed: See Turanskaya v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1997] F.C.J. No. 254 at para. 6 and Marsh v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2006 FC 1466 at para. 45. Another hearing on this motion would defeat the purpose of the judicial review process.\n[7] Accordingly, as it is bound by the Federal Court\u2019s decision and the reasons contained therein, the Tribunal must now, subject to other outstanding preliminary motions, proceed with the complaint on its merits.\nIII.

Context [1] The Complainants filed a human rights complaint alleging that the inequitable funding of child welfare services on First Nations reserves amounted to discrimination on the basis of race and national ethnic origin, contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RCS 1985, c. H-6 (the Act). In light of the uniqueness and importance of this case and the aboriginal community\u2019s interest in being able to observe the proceedings, the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (the \u201cAPTN\u201d) requested, in a letter dated October 22, 2009, permission from the Tribunal to film the complaint proceedings including opening and closing statements, testimony of witnesses, questions, objections and arguments. The Tribunal denied this request in a decision dated May 28, 2010, (2012 CHRT 16) on the basis that allowing camera access would be detrimental to the fairness of the hearing and could undermine the integrity of the proceedings. APTN subsequently filed an application for judicial review of this decision.\n[2] On March 14, 2011, the Tribunal rendered a decision (2011 CHRT 4) granting a motion brought by the Respondent for the dismissal of the complaint on the ground that the issues raised in the complaint were beyond the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction (the \u201cjurisdictional motion\u201d). This decision was also subsequently the subject of an application for judicial review before the Federal Court.\n[3] On June 3, 2011, the Federal Court rendered its decision on the issue of APTN\u2019s request for camera access to the Tribunal proceedings (2011 FC 810). The Court found that the Tribunal\u2019s decision 2012 CHRT 16 was made without regard to the material before it and was unreasonable when measured against the available record. The Court concluded that the decision fell short of the standard of justification, transparency and intelligibility required by Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, 2008 SCC 9, and allowed APTN\u2019s application for judicial review. However, in light of the Tribunal\u2019s decision 2011 CHRT 4 in which it was held that it had no jurisdiction to consider the underlying complaint, the matter of the re-determination of the decision not to grant camera access was deferred until the judicial determination of the jurisdictional motion was resolved.\n[4] On April 18, 2012, the Federal Court rendered its decision, reported at 2012 FC 445, setting aside the Tribunal\u2019s 2011 CHRT 4 decision and remitting the matter to a differently constituted panel of the Tribunal for re-determination in accordance with its reasons. On July 10, 2012, Vice-Chairperson and Acting Chairperson Gupta appointed a panel of three members to hear the complaint.\n[5] In light of the Federal Court\u2019s decision 2012 FC 445, which has resolved the jurisdictional motion, the panel must now proceed with the re-determination of the motion to grant camera access in accordance with the Federal Court\u2019s reasons in its decision 2011 FC 810.\nII. Analysis [6] The panel has examined the submissions made by the parties in 2009 following APTN\u2019s initial request for camera access and the Respondent\u2019s recent request in a letter dated August 21, 2012, for an opportunity to submit additional submissions on the question of camera access. However, in light of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons in its decision 2011 FC 810, the panel is of the view that while the question of the operating guidelines for the camera access remains to be determined, the Federal Court\u2019s reasons definitively reject the Tribunal\u2019s reasons in support of a total ban on broadcasting. Indeed, these reasons compel the panel to conclude that camera access must be allowed during the proceedings and that, therefore, additional submissions on this issue would only delay the present matter unnecessarily.\n[7] Camera access will, however, have to be allowed in accordance with operating guidelines that have yet to be defined. These guidelines will strive to balance any potential negative impacts of filming with the interest of people living on reserve to observe the proceedings at issue. In this regard, the panel is committed to engaging with the parties in discussions to establish operating guidelines that will be suitable to all. The panel aims to schedule a date for these discussions in the near future and will be canvassing the parties\u2019 availabilities in this regard shortly.\nIII. Ruling [8] The Tribunal grants APTN\u2019s motion for camera access, subject to the operating guidelines that will be determined by the Tribunal forthwith.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nPanel Chairperson\nSigned by\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nTribunal Member\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Lustig\nDate: September 6, 2012\nCitation: 2012 CHRT 19\nI. Motion [1] This is a Ruling on the Motion of the Respondent dated July 30, 2012 for an Order striking out the whole of the Complainants\u2019 Notice of Constitutional Question (\u201cNCQ\u201d) dated January 19, 2012.\n[2] The Complainants\u2019 NCQ seeks to challenge the constitutional validity of section 6 of the Indian Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. I-5, under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11 [the Charter]. The basis of the Charter challenge is that section 6 of the Indian Act is \u201c\u2026in contravention of (a) Sections 2 & 3 of the Canadian Human Rights Act; and (b) Sections 1, 15(1) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and should be struck down and declared to be of no force and effect.\u201d Section 6 of the Indian Act deals with the registration of persons as Indians under the Indian Act.\nII. Background [3] The Complainants are siblings who are the grandchildren of an Indian woman who married a non-Indian man prior to 1985. The Complainants filed virtually identical complaints under the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the CHRA] that allege that the registration provisions in section 6 of the Indian Act discriminate against them based on sex and\/or family status in that it does not entitle their children to registration, in contrast to their hypothetical counterparts descended from an Indian grandfather who married a non-Indian woman.\n[4] The Respondent\u2019s Notice of Motion which includes its Written Submissions says that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cCHRT\u2019) does not have jurisdiction to entertain a Charter challenge to the Indian Act and the NCQ ought to be struck.\n[5] The Canadian Human Rights Commission\u2019s (the \u201cCommission\u201d) Written Submissions dated August 9, 2012 say that the Commission agrees with the Respondent that the CHRT should decline to consider the Charter issues raised by the NCQ in this proceeding.\n[6] The Complainants\u2019 Written Submissions dated August 9, 2012 say that the CHRT has the jurisdiction to hear and determine its NCQ.\n[7] The Respondent\u2019s Reply Submissions dated August 23, 2012 say that the Complainants\u2019 Submissions are without merit.\nIII. Relevant Statutory Provisions [8] The relevant statutory provisions in this motion are as follows:\nFrom the Charter:\n15. (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\n1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\nFrom the CHRA:\n2. The purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.\n39. For the purposes of this Part, a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d means any practice that is a discriminatory practice within the meaning of Sections 5 to 14.1.\n40. (1) Subject to subsections (5) and (7), any individual or group of individuals having reasonable grounds for believing that a person is engaging or has engaged in a discriminatory practice may file with the Commission a complaint in a form acceptable to the Commission.\n49. (1) At any stage after the filing of a complaint, the Commission may request the Chairperson of the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint if the Commission is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry is warranted.\n50. (2) In the course of hearing and determining any matter under inquiry, the member or panel may decide all questions of law or fact necessary to determining the matter.\n53. (2) If at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may, subject to section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice\u2026\n67. Nothing in this Act affects any provision of the Indian Act or any provision made under or pursuant to that Act. [Repealed, 2008, c. 30, s. 1]\nFrom the CHRT Rules of Procedure (03-05-04)\n9. (7) Where a party intends to challenge the constitutional validity, applicability or operability of a statute or regulation before the Panel, it shall serve notice in accordance with Section 57 of the Federal Court Act and Form 69 of the Federal Court Rules, 1998.\nFrom the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. F-7\n57. (1) If the constitutional validity, applicability or operability of an Act of Parliament ... or of a regulation made under such an Act, is in question before ... a federal board, commission or other tribunal..., the Act or regulation shall not be judged to be invalid, inapplicable or inoperable unless notice has been served on the Attorney General of Canada and the attorney general of each province in accordance with subsection (2).\nIV. The Parties\u2019 Submissions [9] The Respondent\u2019s Submissions can be summarized as follows:\ni) The CHRT is empowered by virtue of Section 50(2) of the CHRA to decide questions of law, constitutional or otherwise, necessary to determining whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that a particular practice constitutes a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d within the meaning of sections 5-14.1 of the CHRA. There is no jurisdiction to consider questions of law that are unnecessary to the performance of this task, such as whether section 6 of the Indian Act violates section 15 of the Charter; and, if so, whether it is saved by section 1 of the Charter; and\nii) The jurisdiction to determine questions of law encompasses any constitutional question that arises in the course of the CHRT fulfilling its statutory mandate. As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada in Nova Scotia (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) v. Martin, 2003 SCC 54 at para. 34, \u201cthe question becomes whether the tribunal\u2019s mandate includes jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of the challenged provision.\u201d The jurisdiction provided in Section 50(2) of the CHRA does not include a challenge to Section 6 of the Indian Act under Section 15 of the Charter as set out in the NCQ; and\niii) The fact that section 15 of the Charter also protects against discrimination does not give the CHRT free-standing jurisdiction to entertain constitutional discrimination challenges to any legislation, any more than the CHRT is empowered to determine whether a particular statute violates sections 2 or 7-12 of the Charter. The CHRT can perform its statutorily mandated role of determining whether the impugned provisions constitute a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d under the CHRA without reference to the Charter. As a result, the Charter question is beyond the scope of the CHRT\u2019s mandate as set out in the CHRA. Accordingly, the NCQ should be struck as in Neubauer v. British Columbia (Ministry of Human Resources), 2004 BCHRT 34 and Hendershott v. Ontario (Community and Social Services), 2011 HRTO 482; and\niv) The repeal of section 67 of the CHRA is unrelated to the issue in this motion. Section 67 has no effect on Charter - based equality rights raised in court proceedings. Charter - based equality rights claims could be brought before the repeal of section 67 and can still be brought after the repeal of section 67. However, the repeal of section 67 did not authorize the CHRT to decide those cases.\n[10] The Commission\u2019s Submissions can be summarized as follows:\ni) Section 50(2) of the CHRA says that in the course of inquiring into a complaint, the CHRT has the power to decide questions of law, including constitutional questions that are necessary to determining the matter under inquiry. In the present case, the CHRT can examine the alleged violations of the CHRA without having to decide the Charter issues that the Complainants raise in their NCQ. In other words, tracking the language of Section 50(2) of the CHRA, it is not necessary to resolve the proposed Charter issues in order to determine the matter under inquiry. As a result, the CHRT should decline to consider the proposed Charter issues; and\nii) The ultimate matter under inquiry in a CHRT proceeding must always be whether a respondent has engaged in a discriminatory practice, as defined in the CHRA. The CHRT does not have jurisdiction to conduct stand-alone inquiries into whether a legislative provision does or does not infringe the Charter; and\niii) Even where a tribunal finds a Charter infringement, it does not have the power to issue a general declaration of invalidity. As a result, the CHRT lacks the authority to grant the Charter remedy that the Complainants seek, namely a declaration that Section 6 of the Indian Act is struck down and of no force or effect.\n[11] The Complainants\u2019 Submissions can be summarized as follows:\ni) The CHRT has the jurisdiction to hear the NCQ of section 6 of the Indian Act and there is nothing in the CHRA that narrows or restricts its authority to do so; and\nii) Section 50(2) of the CHRA provides the CHRT with the jurisdiction to decide all questions of law, without restriction, including constitutional matters so long as the proper NCQ has been given; and\niii) The repeal of section 67 of the CHRA was intended to expose the Indian Act and its provisions to the scrutiny of the CHRA, without restriction, including whether provisions of the Indian Act violate the constitution and Charter as well as the CHRA.\nV. Analysis [12] Administrative tribunals with the power to decide questions of law, and from whom constitutional jurisdiction has not been clearly withdrawn, have the authority to resolve constitutional questions that are linked to matters properly before them (R. v. Conway, 2010 SCC 22 at para. 78 [Conway]). If an administrative tribunal has jurisdiction to decide questions of law, the remaining question is whether the tribunal can grant the particular remedy sought, given the relevant statutory scheme (see Conway at paras. 81-82).\n[13] Section 50(2) of the CHRA provides the CHRT with the power to decide all questions of law \u201cnecessary to determining the matter\u201d. As indicated in sections 2, 39, 40(1), and 49(1) of the CHRA, the matter the CHRT has to determine in any given case is whether a discriminatory practice has occurred within the meaning of sections 5 to 14.1 of the CHRA. The Complainants\u2019 NCQ attempts to adjudicate the same facts alleged to be in contravention of the CHRA under the Charter. In this regard, the constitutional question raised by the Complainants is not linked to determining whether a discriminatory practice has occurred within the meaning of the CHRA. It is a separate question of law altogether, unrelated to the CHRT\u2019s statutory mandate in this case.\n[14] The fact that the CHRT\u2019s Rules of Procedure asks parties to serve a notice of constitutional question in accordance with section 57 of the Federal Courts Act does not alter the constitutional jurisdiction granted to the CHRT under the CHRA. Nor does the repeal of section 67 of the CHRA grant the CHRT jurisdiction to entertain stand-alone Charter challenges to the Indian Act unrelated to determining whether a discriminatory practice has occurred within the meaning of the CHRA.\n[15] The Complainants\u2019 NCQ also asks the CHRT to strike down and declare section 6 of the Indian Act to be of no force or effect. As indicated in section 53(2) of the CHRA, the CHRT\u2019s remedial jurisdiction is linked to a finding that a discriminatory practice has occurred within the meaning of the CHRA and any order made to remedy the discriminatory practice is made \u201c\u2026against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice\u201d (see sections 53(2)(a)-(e), 53(3), 54, and 54.1 of the CHRA). There is no indication in the CHRA, or otherwise, that the CHRT has the power to strike down legislation or make general declarations of constitutional invalidity.\n[16] Having carefully reviewed and considered the Parties\u2019 submissions and the authorities in this matter, I agree with the Respondent and the Commission that the Respondent\u2019s motion to strike out the whole of the Complainants\u2019 NCQ should be allowed. In the circumstances of this case, the CHRT does not have the constitutional jurisdiction to entertain the Complainants\u2019 NCQ.\nVI. Ruling [17] On the basis of the reasons above, the Respondent\u2019s motion is allowed and I hereby order the whole of the Complainants\u2019 NCQ to be struck out.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Background [1] In the period July 19 to 22, 2010, the Tribunal conducted an inquiry into allegations of the Complainants, James Louie and Joyce Beattie, that officials of the Respondent, presently named Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, formerly Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC), had engaged in discriminatory practices in dealing with the Complainants\u2019 applications for a lease under s. 58(3) of the Indian Act (the \u201cAct\u201d).\n[2] Section 58(3) of the Act provides:\nThe Minister may lease for the benefit of any Indian, on application of that Indian for that purpose, the land of which the Indian is lawfully in possession without the land being designated.\n[3] Section 3(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) provides:\nFor all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for which a pardon has been granted.\n[4] Section 5 of the CHRA provides:\nIt is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facility or accommodation customarily available to the general public,\n(a) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\n(b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual, on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[5] The Complainants had formed a business association to prepare and submit an Application for Use of Land within an Indian Reserve and a Locatee Application to the Minister of INAC pursuant to s. 58(3) of the Act. They sought a long term and pre-paid residential lease of lands belonging to the locatee (Complainant Louie) to the developer (Complainant Beattie), with the intention of eventually marketing and assigning the lease to a third party. The Respondent, unsatisfied with the Complainant Louie\u2019s self-declaration that the transaction was for his benefit, declined to process the Complainants\u2019 applications unless they demonstrated that the locatee would receive consideration that reflected fair market value. The Complainants allege that this policy and interpretation of the Act discriminates against individual Indian land holders.\nA. Tribunal Decision [6] On January 26, 2011, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal rendered a decision (the \u201cTribunal decision\u201d) that, by denying the Complainant Louie the right to determine for himself the anticipated benefits to be derived from leasing his land, and by refusing to process the locatee lease applied for by the Complainants, the Respondent had denied services customarily available to the general public and had therefore engaged in a discriminatory practice in contravention of s. 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cCHRA\u201d).\n[7] Several of the conclusions in the Tribunal decision are relevant in this clarification of the remedial orders:\n52. In processing the Complainants\u2019 request for a locatee lease, INAC relied on criteria and procedures in its Land Management manual in its attempt to determine if Mr. Louie\u2019s proposed transaction was viable and to his benefit. As part of this process, INAC demanded an independent appraisal to determine fair market value, without regard to the entrepreneurial joint venture agreement between the Complainants, and in November 2008, INAC demanded that Mr. Louie establish to INAC\u2019s satisfaction, proof of his \u2018ability and competence to enter into the proposed transaction.\u2019\n53. INAC attempted to impose unilateral authority over every aspect of the Complainants\u2019 proposal for a locatee lease. Throughout the processing of Mr. Louie\u2019s application, INAC officials took the position that it was their \u2018duty\u2019 to intervene to protect Mr. Louie\u2019s interests as a status Indian, and dictate the nature and terms of the sought-after locatee lease. In doing so, they demonstrated how the Act has become an anachronism that is out of harmony with the guaranteed individual liberty, freedom, and human rights enjoyed by all Canadians.\n54. INAC\u2019s paternalistic conduct toward Mr. Louie was unequivocally endorsed and supported by then Hon. Minister Chuck Strahl in his letter to Mr. Louie on May 18, 2008. The Minister bluntly pronounced that Mr. Louie could not dictate the terms of his sought-after locatee lease, and claimed that \u2018a fiduciary relationship is created \u2026 when Canada enters into Certificate of Possession leases. \u2026Under the Indian Act, the authority to establish the rent lies with Canada and cannot be extinguished by any means except legislative change. This authority extends beyond the setting of the rent and a release will not alter Canada\u2019s unilateral authority to establish the lease terms, which would also include but is not limited to environmental provisions.\u2019 (emphasis added)\n55. The Hon. Minister was mistaken. There is no fiduciary obligation involved in the exercise of ministerial discretion under s. 58(3). Moreover, a unilateral exercise of discretion would be injudicious and negate the purpose of s. 58(3), which is intended to facilitate the leasing of land by individual Indian land owners who envision a benefit for themselves (See Boyer, infra).\n56. The Complainants\u2019 application for a ministerial lease was based upon a joint venture agreement under which Ms. Beattie would construct a single family home on the leased land and then sell it at a price and on terms acceptable to Mr. Louie and divide the net sale proceeds. The stipulated rent of $1 was not based on the actual value of the land, and was not the benefit that Mr. Louie sought to achieve through the joint venture. The benefit that both Mr. Louie and Ms. Beattie sought to achieve was by way of the development of a single family home on the leased property, and its eventual sale. Rather than focussing on the application for a lease in the broader context of the joint venture agreement, and the benefit therein to Mr. Louie, INAC officials insisted that they would draw up a lease in compliance with all applicable Land Management Manual requirements, including a beneficial rental return over a 49-year period based on an appraisal of the land in its prospective improved state.\n57. INAC\u2019s refusal to accept that Mr. Louie had the right to determine the benefit that might accrue to him from the commercial enterprise that he and Ms. Beattie had undertaken brought the application process to a standstill. For all practical purposes the Complainants\u2019 application for a ministerial lease on the terms that they had agreed upon was rejected by the Minister in his May 15, 2008 letter to Mr. Louie. The Minister\u2019s letter exacerbated INAC\u2019s discriminatory treatment of the Complainants.\nB. Remedial Orders [8] Pursuant to s. 53(2) of the CHRA, the Tribunal decision required the Respondent to remedy its discriminatory conduct by complying with the following five orders:\n1. The Respondent shall reconsider the applications of the Complainants for a locatee lease in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s decision and order;\n2. The Respondent shall cease its discriminatory practices and take measures, in consultation with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, to redress the practices or to prevent the same or similar practices from occurring;\n3. The Respondent shall amend its Land Management Manual and other policies to provide that where individual locatees (other than those determined to be mentally incompetent or under the age of majority) have determined for themselves that a transaction is for their individual benefit, INAC will accept that determination and conduct the processing of a requested lease on that basis;\n4. The Respondent shall comply with the foregoing orders within six months of the date of the Tribunal\u2019s decision in these proceedings;\n5. The Tribunal shall retain jurisdiction and remain seized of the matter for nine months from the date of its decision in this proceeding, in order to receive further evidence, hear additional arguments and\/or make additional orders in the event that the parties disagree regarding the interpretation or implementation of the relief ordered.\u201d\n[9] Paragraph 59 of the Tribunal decision is an integral component of the remedial orders:\n59. Since the Act is now subject to the CHRA, I conclude that the application process under s. 58(3) must become an enabling administrative function that recognizes and accepts status Indians (other than those who are minors or mentally incompetent) as personally responsible Canadians capable of making their own determinations of anticipated benefits to be derived from leasing their land, and that ministerial discretion must not be exercised unilaterally.\nII. Events since the Tribunal Decision [10] In accordance with the Tribunal decision, INAC officials and the Complainants began a process of reconsideration of the Complainants\u2019 application for a s. 58(3) lease.\n[11] On March 8, 2011, the Complainants provided the Respondent with a proposed lease, designating Her Majesty in Right of Canada as the lessor, but contemplating no ongoing role or responsibilities for the lessor. The proposal was not acceptable to the Respondent, however, and on March 18, 2011, the Respondent provided the Complainants with a draft lease and claimed that it incorporated the terms of the Complainants\u2019 proposed lease into its standard residential lease, where those terms reflected the information set out in the joint venture agreement. This proposed lease was not acceptable to the Complainants.\n[12] On June 20, 2011, the Respondent sent an email informing the Complainants\u2019 representative that \u201c\u2026the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs has reconsidered the application for a locatee lease on Lot 170-1, Block 4, CLSR Plan # 93082, Okanagan Indian Reserve #1.\u201d A document titled \u201cLease\u201d (\u201cJune 20\/11 lease\u201d) was attached to the email with a request that the Complainants sign it and return it for signature by the Minister\u2019s delegate. The June 20\/11 lease provided for an ongoing role for Her Majesty in Right of Canada as the \u201clandlord\u201d, stating, amongst other things, that the tenant must obtain the landlord\u2019s consent for assignments, subleases, and development plans for proposed works. This proposed lease was not acceptable to the Complainants.\n[13] In a letter dated July 8, 2011, the Respondent\u2019s counsel informed the Complainants\u2019 representative that the June 20\/11 lease was the result of the remedially ordered process of reconsideration of the Complainants\u2019 application for a s. 58(3) lease. Respondent\u2019s counsel added that, while INAC was open to negotiating the lease,\n\u2026such discussions have nothing to do with the Tribunal decision which was limited to the assessment of the locatee\u2019s benefit by the Respondent during the lease application process. I am open to discussing the lease with you next week. In any event, let there be no doubt that the Respondent is fully compliant with the above-noted paragraph. (a reference to remedial order one).\n[14] During further communication which took place on July 12, 2011, Respondent\u2019s counsel again stated he was available to discuss the June 20\/11 lease, but that\nif this involves importing ideas from your lease, my client will consider same if this has merit. However, as I have already stated my client is compliant with the decision of the Tribunal and these discussions are not part of the decision.\n[15] On July 26, 2011, the Complainants provided a lease to the Respondent, similar to the March 8, 2011 lease. The following day, the Complainants attempted to register the lease at the Indian Land Registry. To date, the Respondent has not approved the lease under s. 58(3) of the Act, nor has it registered the lease at the Registry.\n[16] As for the remaining remedial orders directing the Respondent to redress the discriminatory practices and amend its Land Management Manual, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) and the Respondent entered into an Implementation Agreement on May 26, 2011, with a view to complying with these orders.\n[17] Conflicting interpretations of the remedial orders has stalemated the compliance process. On September 20, 2011, the parties presented written submissions and oral argument seeking clarification of the Tribunal decision and remedial orders.\nIII. Analysis and Clarification A. Minister\u2019s Discretion Must Not Be Exercised Unilaterally [18] The Tribunal decision requires INAC officials to facilitate the particular leasing needs of each Indian applicant, even if the sought-after lease is extraordinary or anomalous.\n[19] To administer lease applications appropriately and judiciously involves engagement with the public rights of Indians as discussed in Boyer v. R. [1986] 2 F.C. 393. C.A.\n17. \u2026But in any event, I simply do not think that the Crown, when acting under subsection 58(3), is under any fiduciary obligation to the Band. The Guerin case was concerned with unallotted reserve lands which had been surrendered to the Crown for the purpose of a long term lease or a sale under favourable conditions to the Band, and as I read the judgment it is because of all of these circumstances that a duty, in the nature of a fiduciary duty, could be said to have arisen: indeed, it was the very interest of the Band with which the Minister had been entrusted as a result of the surrender and it was that interest he was dealing with in alienating the lands. When a lease is entered into pursuant to subsection 58(3), the circumstances are different altogether: no alienation is contemplated, the right to be transferred temporarily is the right to use which belongs to the individual Indian in possession and no interest of the Band can be affected (I repeat that of course I am talking about interest in a technical and legal sense; it is obvious that morally speaking the Band may always be concerned by the behaviour and attitude of its members). In my view, when he acts under subsection 58(3), the duty of the minister is, so to speak, only toward the law; he cannot go beyond the power granted to him, which he would do if, under the guise of a lease, he was to proceed to what would be, for all practical purposes, an alienation of the land (certainly not the case here, the lease being for a term of 21 years with no special renewal clause); and he cannot let extraneous consideration enter into the exercise of his discretion, which would be the case if he was to take into account anything other than the benefit of the Indian in lawful possession of the [page406] land and at whose request he is acting. The duty of the Minister is simply not toward the Band.\n18. The conclusion to me is clear. Bearing in mind the structure of the Indian Act and the clear wording of subsection 58(3) thereof, there is no basis for thinking that the Minister is required to secure the consent of the Band or the Band council before executing a lease such as the one here in question. It seems that the Act which has been so much criticized for its paternalistic spirit has nevertheless seen fit to give the individual member of a Band a certain autonomy, a relative independence from the dicta of his Band council, when it comes to the exercise of his entrepreneurship and the development of his land.\n[20] Furthermore, judiciousness on the part of the Minister and INAC officials in the exercise of discretion under s. 58(3) of the Act entails actualizing the purpose of the CHRA expressed in section 2 of the CHRA:\nThe purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.\n[21] Pertinent to the exercise of ministerial discretion in the granting of a s. 58(3) lease is the fact that the lease does not result in a conveyance of ownership from the lessor (the \u201cCP holder\u201d) to the lessee. The lessor\u2019s ownership of the land remains uninterrupted during the term of the lease, subject only to the lessee\u2019s right to possess and use the land until the termination of the lease. The termination of the lease then triggers the lessor\u2019s reversionary right to resume possession of the land.\n[22] INAC\u2019s claim that it has reconsidered the Complainants\u2019 application requires a careful examination of the processing of the Complainants\u2019 application for a CP lease to determine whether it was carried out as an enabling administrative function or whether it was done \u201cby the book\u201d, and without regard to the rights described in Boyer and enshrined in the CHRA.\n[23] A \u201cby the book\u201d approach by INAC officials, and their insistence on a rental lease, is incompatible with the Complainants\u2019 requirements and is a vexatious exercise of discretion under s. 58(3). The term \u201cby the book\u201d surfaced in an exchange between Ken McDonald, Acting Director, Lands and Trust Services, BC Region and Sheila Craig, Acting Director, Lands and Economic Development, INAC, and was described in the Tribunal decision:\nParagraph 29\nOn February 8, 2008, Mr. McDonald emailed Mr. Beattie and sent copies to Ms. Craig, Mr. Adam and several other INAC officials explaining his recollection of a phone call to Mr. Adam: \u2018We had a short discussion about the nature of this transaction, and that this was an emerging issue. Locatees are increasingly looking for ways in which to use their CP lands to lever financing for housing purposes. We also discussed that this is \u2018cutting edge\u2019 and as such we will endeavour to work with you to find a lease model that meets Mr. Louie\u2019s needs and will also satisfy INAC\u2019s requirements.\u2019\nParagraph 36\nOn November 7, 2008, when discussions between Mr. Beattie on behalf the complainants and INAC officials became deadlocked, Ms. Craig emailed Mr. McDonald instructing him to \u2018Send it all back to him with a suggested meeting date, and then close the file if we are still at an impasse\u2026\u2019\nParagraph 37\nOn November 11, 2008, Mr. McDonald emailed Ms. Craig: \u2018Sounds good Sheila. By the way at the time I was in contact with him he was told by me to keep a low profile and I would do what I could. You will recall the two releases etc. When he started his letter writing he was told that we had no option but to go by the book.\u2019\nB. INAC\u2019s Claim That It Has Complied with Remedial Order One [24] INAC argues that the remedial order requiring reconsideration of the Complainants\u2019 application for a s. 58(3) lease was \u201ceffectively addressed\u201d by the June 20\/11 lease.\n[25] INAC\u2019s Land Management Manual includes general guidelines for drafting leases. One guideline concerns the importance of recital paragraphs and informs INAC officials that recital paragraphs ought to constitute a detailed statement of the facts which are relevant to the agreement between the parties, appearing after the identification of the parties and before the legal clauses of a lease. This admonition was not complied with in the case of the June 20\/11 lease. Instead, it contains a \u201cBackground\u201d consisting of four sentences which make no reference to the complainants\u2019 joint venture.\nTitle to the land is held by the landlord for the use and benefit of the First Nation.\nThe landholder, a member of the First Nation, has lawful possession of the land, as evidenced by Certificate of Possession No. 159390.\nThere were no improvements on the land at the start date.\nThis lease is made under subsection 58(3) of the Indian Act.\n[26] The \u201cBackground\u201d fails to name James Louie as the lawful possessor of his allocated land, consigning him to an appended schedule of definitions: \u201cLandholder: means James (Jimmie) Louie and any heirs, executors, administrators, successors, assigns, and other legal representatives.\u201d\n[27] The June 20\/11 lease is a basic boiler-plate rental lease containing provisions that conflict with the Complainants\u2019 joint venture agreement. It is not a genuine effort to comply with the remedial orders of the Tribunal decision, and reflects a close-minded and intransigent response to the Tribunal decision.\n[28] Notwithstanding INAC\u2019s oral and written argument presented on September 20, 2011 in support of its claim of compliance with the Tribunal\u2019s decision, I find that INAC has continued, in defiance of the Tribunal decision, to engage in an arbitrary and vexing reconsideration of the Complainants\u2019 application for a locatee lease.\n[29] This finding is based, in part, on the letter accompanying the Respondent\u2019s March 18, 2011 draft lease, sent by the Respondent to the Complainants\u2019 representative, which stated:\nWe have reviewed your lease and have incorporated your terms into our standard residential lease where they reflect the information set out in the Joint Venture Agreement and the Tribunal hearing. We attach a draft for your review and to form the basis for our discussion.\nYou will appreciate that we require details of the use of the property so that we may assess and discuss with you any remaining mandatory statutory and regulatory requirements for the granting of the lease. \u2026 (emphasis added)\n[30] The reference to \u201cmandatory statutory and regulatory requirements\u201d is discussed in the next section of this clarification decision.\n[31] While there is some reference to the Complainants\u2019 joint venture in the Respondent\u2019s March 18, 2011 draft lease, the assertion that it incorporates the terms of the Complainants\u2019 joint venture is inaccurate and misleading.\n[32] I also conclude that the March 18, 2011 draft lease served as a template for the June 20\/11 lease. Both versions may be suitable in long-term landlord and tenant situations in which the sought-after benefit to the Indian land owner is the security of regular-interval rental income. However, neither of them is compatible with the Complainants\u2019 business venture.\n[33] The June 20\/11 lease does not constitute compliance with the Tribunal decision and the remedially ordered process of reconsideration of the Complainants\u2019 application for a locatee lease. Rather, it signals intractability and a resumption of the discriminatory conduct engaged in by INAC officials in their initial dealings with the Complainants\u2019 application for a locatee lease. The Respondent\u2019s contradictory courses of conduct are troubling: on the one hand, affirming its intention to implement the Tribunal decision to reduce discriminatory practices of the kind experienced by the Complainants by means of the implementation agreement with the Commission, while on the other hand, permitting its British Columbia lands officials to engage in a continuation of the initial act of discrimination.\nC. INAC\u2019s Compliance with Remedial Orders Two, Three and Four [34] This incongruity debases the May 26, 2011 implementation agreement between the Respondent and the Commission. Several paragraphs are particularly relevant to this clarification, and to the resumption of the process of reconsideration of the Complainants\u2019 application for a s. 58(3) lease:\n2.1 Lands and the Commission recognize that reducing discrimination requires a proactive and systematic approach, and that it is in the best interest of all parties to work together to resolve allegations of discrimination as early as possible.\n2.2 It is recognized that this agreement has been entered into in response to the decision by Tribunal Member Craig in that this Agreement provides for compliance with his decision.\n3. Responsibilities\nA. Compliance with the Order\n3.1 Lands shall, within thirty (30) days of the date of this agreement, issue an interim directive to all Lands staff that section 58(3) locatee lease applications shall be processed in accordance with paragraph 64 subparagraph 3 of the decision of Tribunal member Craig of January 26, 2010, which provides that \u2018[t]he Respondent shall amend its Land Management manual and other policies to provide that where individual locatees (other than those determined to be mentally incompetent or under the age of majority) have determined for themselves that a transaction is for their individual benefit, INAC will accept that determination and conduct the processing of the requested lease on that basis.\u2019 It is understood by the parties that \u2018individual benefit\u2019 means financial compensation, if any, in respect of the transaction. The Parties also agree and acknowledge that this shall not delay or restrict the necessity of engagement with First Nations on amendments to the Land Management Manual.\n3.5 Both the Commission and Lands agree that nothing contained herein shall affect Lands\u2019 obligation to reconsider the applications of the complainants for a locatee lease in accordance with paragraph 64, subparagraph 2 of the decision.\n[35] To satisfy remedial order one, INAC officials must craft a ministerial lease that dovetails with the Complainants\u2019 joint venture agreement, resulting in a harmonious whole constrained only by Band bylaws, and in which the Complainant Louie is the Lessor, enabling him to protect both his interest in the joint venture as it goes forward, and his reversionary right to take possession of his land on the termination of the lease.\n[36] This brings into question Section 2.7 of Directive 7 \u2013 1 in the Respondent\u2019s Land Management Manual, and the designation of the Crown as the lessor in the June 20\/11 lease:\n2.7 Mandatory Provisions: Most leases contain many provisions dealing with every aspect of the landlord and tenant relationship, because it is in the interest of both parties to know precisely what their obligations are. However, at the very least, every agreement for the leasing of land must include the following elements:\na) a lessor (landlord) and lessee (tenant). Because legal title to all reserve lands is vested in the Crown, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada must be the \u2018lessor\u2019 in every lease of reserve land, except in the case of a sublease. This provision applies even when the Crown has delegated control and management of lands to a particular First Nation under sections 53 or 60 of the Indian Act. In these cases, the delegated authority must sign the lease on behalf of the Minister, who represents the Crown. A sub-lease, by its nature, is made between the head lease lessee and a third party sub-lessee and consequently, the Crown is not a party to the sub-lease instrument; \u2026 (emphasis in original)\n[37] The authors of the Manual misconstrued the purpose that was achieved when title to lands reserved for Indians was vested in the Crown simpliciter, namely that it vested only title in the Crown. The vesting of title did not include ownership. Neither the Crown nor the Government of Canada has any legal estate or reversionary interest in lands reserved for Indians.\n[38] In Mitchell v. Pequis Indian Band [1990] 2 S.C.R. 85 (S.C.C), Mr. Justice La Forest described Indian entitlement to \u201cland reserved for Indians\u201d as an absolute and just right, \u201ca plenary entitlement\u201d:\nIf, then, an Indian band enters into a normal business transaction, be it with a provincial Crown, or a private corporation, and acquires personal property, be it in the form of chattels or debt obligations, how is one to characterize the property concerned? To my mind, it makes no sense to compare it with the property that enures to Indians pursuant to treaties and their ancillary agreements. Indians have a plenary entitlement to their treaty property; it is owed to them qua Indians. (emphasis added)\n[39] Sheltered by this plenary entitlement is land allocated by bands to band members by way of Certificates of Possession, with all the ownership rights that flow from them, including the right to lease possession of their allocated lands. A locatee lease does not impinge on the ultimate and perpetual communal Indian ownership of these allocated lands, or the title to these lands which is vested in the Crown in trust for Indians.\n[40] While the Government of Canada has exclusive legislative authority over \u201cIndians and lands reserved for Indians,\u201d it must exercise this jurisdiction within the constraints of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[41] When the parties appeared before the Tribunal on September 22, 2011, the process for implementing changes to the Land Management Manual had not been completed within the six month implementation period. On application by the parties, the period was extended to May 26, 2012, with the Tribunal retaining jurisdiction until August 25, 2012.\nIV. Decision [42] A Status Indian in hand of a Certificate of Possession is entitled to build a home on his or her land, or to subdivide and develop it, without any involvement with INAC, unless and until application is made to the Minister for a s. 58(3) lease. In the process for granting such a lease, INAC\u2019s land management officials must be attentive to the purpose of the CHRA to ensure that the discretionary decision whether to grant or refuse a lease is a result of an enabling administrative function. Indians must not be treated as supplicants. They are applicants having a just entitlement to lease their lands and, in doing so, to maintain control over their interest in a leasehold transaction by being designated as the lessor.\n[43] In this case, INAC\u2019s insistence that the Crown, in actuality the Government of Canada, must be the lessor, abrogates the Complainant Louie\u2019s right, as the lawful owner of his CP land, to manage his continuing interest in the joint-venture development of his land.\n[44] INAC\u2019s claim, that it has engaged in a meaningful reconsideration of the Complainants\u2019 application for a locatee lease, and that it has complied with the Tribunal\u2019s decision and remedial order, is without merit.\n[45] INAC\u2019s claim that the remedial order does not contemplate an examination by the Tribunal of various clauses in leases exchanged by the parties during their continuing discussions to settle the terms of a suitable lease is also without merit.\n[46] The Tribunal decision stipulates that the Tribunal retains jurisdiction and remains seized of the matter in order to deal with the eventuality of disagreement over implementation of the remedial orders. This ability was expressly recognized as part of the Tribunal\u2019s wide remedial powers set out in the CHRA by the Federal Court in Grover v. Canada (National Research Council) (1994), 80 F.T.R. 256 (F.C.) (para. 33).\n[47] It is incumbent on the Respondent to comply with the Tribunal decision and begin again the processing of the Complainants\u2019 application for a s. 58(3) lease, and to do so in accordance with the directions and dictates of the Tribunal\u2019s 2011 decision and this Decision.\nSigned by\nWallace G.

Interest 10\nIII......... Order 10\nI. Background [1] In Heather Lynn Grant v. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2012 CHRT 10 [Grant], the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) found the complaint of Ms. Grant, the Complainant, against Manitoba Telecom Services Inc. (the Respondent or MTS), pursuant to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the Act], to be substantiated. Pursuant to section 53(2) of the Act, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to compensate the Complainant in the amount of $10,000 for the pain and suffering she experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice; and, to compensate the Complainant in the amount of $10,000 for having engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly (see Grant at paras. 132-133). The Tribunal also ordered the Respondent to work with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) to train high level management on the duty to accommodate and to develop appropriate policies in this regard (see Grant at paras.130 and 134).\n[2] The Complainant has also requested remedies with regards to the reinstatement of her employment with the Respondent, lost wages, lost pension contributions, the loss of other benefits, expenses and costs she incurred, and interest. In Grant, the Tribunal requested further submissions and clarifications from the parties on these remedies and remained seized of the matter pending those additional submissions and clarifications (see Grant at paras. 135-136).\n[3] On July 10, 2012 a hearing was held by way of conference call to receive additional clarification from the parties regarding their submissions on the outstanding remedies.\n[4] The following is the Tribunal\u2019s decision with regards to the outstanding remedies from Grant.\nII. Outstanding Remedies A. Reinstatement [5] The Complainant seeks reinstatement in her position in the same location or to an equivalently rated position in the same location.\n[6] Pursuant to the reasoning in McAvinn v. Strait Crossing Bridge Ltd. T.D. 13\/01 (CHRT), the Complainant suggests that if there exists a serious possibility that she would have retained her job, then the Tribunal should order that she be reinstated. However, while the \u201cserious possibility\u201d of the Complainant retaining her job may be a consideration in determining the appropriate remedy in this case, it is not the only one. Such a narrow approach would remove the Tribunal\u2019s remedial discretion to fashion appropriate remedies under section 53(2) of the Act. Having found the complaint to be substantiated, the objective in making an order under section 53(2) of the Act is to, as much as possible, make the Complainant whole. To accomplish this, the Tribunal\u2019s remedial discretion must be exercised on a principled basis, considering the link between the discriminatory practice and the loss claimed (see Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 268 at para. 37 [Chopra]). In other words, the Tribunal\u2019s remedial discretion must be exercised reasonably, in consideration of the particular circumstances of the case and the evidence presented (Hughes v. Elections Canada, 2010 CHRT 4 at para.50).\n[7] In Grant, the Tribunal found that the Complainant\u2019s performance at work was evaluated without seriously considering the effects of her disability on her performance. The Complainant\u2019s Performance Appraisals were used by the Respondent to compare the Complainant with another employee, Sharon Horner, for the purpose of determining which of the two employees would be laid off. On this basis, the Tribunal found that the Complainant\u2019s disability factored into the Respondent\u2019s decision to no longer employ her. However, while the Tribunal found that there was a link between the Complainant\u2019s negatively assessed performance, her disability, and her lay off, sufficient evidence was not led upon which the Tribunal can now go back and assess what the Complainant\u2019s performance actually would have been had her disability been taken into account. Nor was sufficient evidence led before the Tribunal regarding the performance of Sharon Horner. In comparing the two employees prior to lay-off, the Respondent not only used the performance appraisals but also interviewed the employee`s managers. Sharon Horner`s manager did not testify before the Tribunal neither did Sharon Horner. Without this information, the Tribunal is also not in a position to reassess the two candidates for layoff and determine who should have been laid off; nor would this be appropriate given section 54(2)(a) of the Act and the Tribunal\u2019s finding that there was no prima facie case of a discriminatory animus in the Respondent\u2019s decision to lay off employees (see Grant at paras. 44-47). Rather, in my view, what the Tribunal is attempting to remedy in the circumstances of this case is the opportunity the Complainant lost to have her performance assessed in a non-discriminatory manner and, consequently, the possibility she shared with one other candidate of retaining her job with the Respondent. The difficulty in fashioning an appropriate remedy in this case lies in the fact that, regardless of the discriminatory practice, there was at least a 50% possibility that the Complainant would have been laid off anyways. This is an important consideration in determining whether reinstatement is appropriate in the circumstances of this case; and, along with the other reasons stated above, leads me to believe that it is not reasonable to order reinstatement in this case.\nB. Wage Loss [8] The Complainant seeks compensation for lost wages. The Complainant received severance pay at the time of her lay off. She received two weeks pay for every year of service with the Respondent, totalling $62,000.00. After having been laid off in February 2007, the Complainant was off work for a few months. She started a new job in October of 2007, and has had regular employment ever since. The Tribunal was provided with the Complainant\u2019s income tax statements for 2006 to 2009. Those statements indicate that the Complainant\u2019s income increased for the years after she was laid off by the Respondent.\n[9] The Complainant claims she had to work more hours to earn the same income she would have made at MTS. In this regard, the Complainant did not retain her pay studs, but presented the Tribunal with a table she prepared with her union outlining the difference, on an hourly basis, between what she earned at her new jobs and what she would have earned at MTS for the years 2007 to 2010. The table does not indicate dates, nor does it document her hours of work, but generalizes her earnings on a yearly basis. In her testimony, the Complainant attempted to explain the reasoning behind the calculations contained in the table, but had no other evidence to support those calculations. On the basis of the table, and her statement that she worked more hours, the Complainant asks the Tribunal to conclude that she suffered a wage loss. At the July 10, 2012 hearing, the Tribunal asked the Complainant to clarify her claim to wage loss on the basis that she worked more hours to earn the same pay, and to support her claim with authorities, and the terms of the Act. The Complainant`s response was that, while the usual practice is to determine wage loss based on gross annual income, rather than on an hourly basis, the Tribunal should accept the Complainant\u2019s calculations of her wage loss based upon a broad and liberal approach to the interpretation of the Act and even within the parameters of a literal approach to interpreting the terms of section 53(2)(c). While I accept that section 53(2)(c) does not specify how wage loss is to be calculated, this does not change the fact that the Tribunal must make this determination to the best of its ability based on the evidence presented. The Complainant`s hourly based calculations of wage loss, and explanation thereof, were vague and not supported by sufficient evidence to allow the Tribunal to conclude that she suffered a wage loss or was not able to mitigate her damages in this regard. I would add that the doctrine of mitigation is based on the premise that\n\u201cSociety has an interest in promoting economic efficiency by requiring those who have suffered a loss to take steps to minimize that loss as it is not in the public interest to allow some members of society to maximize their loss at the expense of others, even if those others are the authors of the loss\u201d.\n(See Chopra at para. 40).\n[10] When weighed against her official tax returns, and the doctrine of mitigation, it is difficult to accept the Complainant\u2019s argument that she suffered a wage loss. As a result, I find that the severance pay the Complainant received from the Respondent more than covers the wages she lost during her period of her unemployment, and her tax returns for the years after she was laid off from MTS indicate that she did not suffer a loss in her earnings compared to what she may have been earning with MTS. For these reasons, I do not think it is reasonable to order compensation for lost wages in this case.\n[11] The Complainant also claims losses with regards to the Respondent\u2019s Variable Pay Plan and Groups Sales Bonus. However, after having examined the information provided by the parties regarding these plans, I agree with the Respondent that the Variable Pay Plan and the Group Sales Bonus fall under the Complainant\u2019s lost wages. They are bonus payments that would be included in the Complainant\u2019s income. Having found the Complainant to have mitigated her wage losses, I do not award compensation for the Variable Pay Plan or the Group Sales Bonus.\nC. Pension [12] The Complainant seeks compensation for missed pension contributions. Given her age and years of service at the time of her lay off, the Complainant contends that the loss of her pension was of great consequence to her. The parties acknowledged that the Complainant no longer receives the benefit of a pension plan with her new employer. According to the Complainant, she will now have to work many more years than she would have at MTS to support herself going forward and in retirement.\n[13] The Respondent suggests that any loss claimed with regards to her pension should be viewed together with her wage loss. I disagree. Section 53(2)(c) provides the Tribunal with the authority to compensate victims of discrimination for any wage loss. Section 53(2)(b) provides the Tribunal with the authority to make available to the victim of discrimination any \u201cprivileges\u201d that are being or were denied the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice. A pension is a retirement benefit that, while often times calculated or contributed to based on an employee\u2019s salary, does not form part of an employee\u2019s wages. A pension program is not offered by every employer and can be a significant incentive to employment. In this sense, I believe it is more appropriately categorized as a \u201cprivilege\u201d as opposed to being included in an employee\u2019s wages. The Tribunal has taken a similar approach to determining pension remedies in Levac v. Canadian Armed Forces, T.D.2\/95 (CHRT), where wage loss was also not awarded.\n[14] As mentioned above, the discriminatory practice of the Respondent resulted in the Complainant losing at least a 50% possibility of her retaining her job with the Respondent and her resulting pension benefits. Pursuant to section 53(2)(b) of the Act, the Complainant was denied a possibility of retaining the privilege of her pension benefits as result of the discriminatory practice. On this basis, some of the Complainant\u2019s lost pension benefits should now be made available to her. Similar to the reasoning in Shiv Chopra v. Health Canada, 2004 CHRT 27, where the compensation for wage loss was divided by three to reflect the number of interested candidates for the position that the Tribunal found was denied to the victim of discrimination, I believe it is also appropriate in this case to reduce the lost pension contributions in the period following her lay off by 50% to reflect the fact that the Complainant did not lose her job as a result of discrimination, but lost a possibility of retaining her job against one other candidate.\n[15] Given the above reasons, and in an effort not to punish the Respondent but to, as much as possible, make the Complainant whole pursuant to section 53(2)(b) of the Act, I order the Respondent to restore the Complainant\u2019s pension benefits to the position they were in at the time of her layoff. For the period from her lay off to the date when the terms of this order are implemented, the Respondent is to contribute to her pension plan half of the pension contributions it would have made during this period had the Complainant remained in its employ. If it is not possible to restore the previous pension plan, arrangements should be made to restore the lost pension benefits as described above in a comparable plan or arrangement, ensuring that the Complainant can receive retirement benefits comparable to those she would have received through MTS. Given the complexities and considerations that may be involved in determining the functionality of this order; given the lack of evidence permitting the Tribunal to best determine the functionality of this order; given the parties\u2019 acknowledgement that an actuary may need to be involved in making these pension calculations; and given that insufficient evidence was led before me to make such calculations, therefore, I will first leave it to the parties to work out the details of the Complainant\u2019s lost pension benefits pursuant to the parameters outlined above. I will retain jurisdiction in the event the parties are unable to reach an agreement in this regard.\nD. Employee Share Ownership Plan [16] The Complainant testified that she participated in the Employee Share Ownership Plan. MTS is a publicly owned company and provided a plan in which employees could contribute 4 to 6% of their income in investing in shares of the company. The Complainant testified that she would contribute 4% of her income and MTS would match this with an equivalent 1% of her income. If the Complainant had continued to work with the Respondent, the Complainant estimates that the Respondent\u2019s contributions would have been approximately $2,441.06. The Respondent does not dispute this calculation, but again argues that this amount is more properly classified as earnings and that the Complainant has mitigated her lost earnings. Like a pension, I believe the share ownership plan is more appropriately categorized as a \u201cprivilege\u201d pursuant to section 53(2)(b) of the Act as opposed to being included in an employee\u2019s wages. It is an investment fund, provided by the employer, that the employees contribute to during their employment and benefit from at some later point. Applying the same reasoning that I followed for calculating the Complainant\u2019s pension losses, that she had a 50% chance of retaining her position, I order the Respondent to restore the Complainant\u2019s share ownership plan to the position it was in at the time of her layoff. For the period from her lay off to the date when the terms of this order are implemented, the Respondent is to contribute to her share ownership plan half of the contributions it would have made during this period had the Complainant remained in its employ. If it is not possible to restore the previous share ownership plan, arrangements should be made to restore the lost benefits as described above in a comparable plan or arrangement, ensuring that the Complainant can receive the benefits of the plan in a fashion comparable to what she would have received through MTS. Given the complexities and considerations that may be involved in determining the functionality of this order; given the lack of evidence permitting the Tribunal to best determine the functionality of this order, therefore, I will first leave it to the parties to work out the details of the Complainant\u2019s lost share ownership plan benefits pursuant to the parameters outlined above. I will retain jurisdiction in the event the parties are unable to reach an agreement in this regard.\nE. Other Expenses [17] According to MTS\u2019 benefits plan, the Complainant seeks to be reimbursed for various expenses that she was not able to recover following her lay off and during the time that this complaint was being adjudicated. The Complainant incurred drug costs in the amount of $282.61; dental work in the amount of $147.40; and, orthodontic work of $4,500.00. Under MTS\u2019 dental plan, routine dental treatment is covered at 100% to a maximum of $1,250.00, on an annual basis, and orthodontic treatment is covered at 50% to a maximum of $1,000, on an annual basis. The Complainant claims she would have claimed the orthodontic work expense over a period of two years, for a total claim of $1,000.00 each year. The Respondent did not dispute this amount. Applying the same reasoning that I followed for calculating the Complainant\u2019s pension benefits, that she had a 50% chance of retaining her position, I order the Respondent to pay $1000.00 for reimbursement of half of the orthodontic work expense and $73.70 for half of the dental work expense. I was not presented with sufficient evidence to determine what the insurance coverage would have been for the drug costs, however, the Respondent also did not dispute the amount claimed. Therefore, I order the Respondent to pay $141.31 for half of the drug costs.\n[18] The Complainant also seeks compensation for incurring the expense of having to take a class 1 truck driving training course. While the course cost $4,800.00, she is only claiming $1,200.00, as the balance was paid by a governmental program. I am satisfied that this expense was incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice. Following her lay off, the Complainant took this class in order to gain the skills necessary for employment in another field. Applying the same reasoning that I followed for calculating the Complainant\u2019s pension losses, that she had a 50% chance of retaining her position, I order the Respondent to pay $600.00 to reimburse half of the training course expense.\n[19] In sum, pursuant to section 53(2)(c), I order the Respondent to compensate the Complainant a total of $1815.01 for expenses she incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice.\nF. Costs [20] The Complainant seeks compensation with regards to the expenses she incurred related to the hearing of this matter, and filed an expense chart in this regard at the July 10, 2012 hearing. The Complainant seeks $2,000.00 for lodging, meals, parking, and travel. In Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 53 [Mowat], the Supreme Court of Canada found that the text, context and purpose of the Act clearly showed that there was no authority in the Tribunal to award legal costs. According to the same reasoning in Mowat, and considering there is no link between the particular types of compensation described in section 53 and the costs claimed by the Complainant here, I fail to see any authority in the Act that would allow the Tribunal to award compensation for the expenses that the Complainant incurred in relation to the hearing of this matter. Therefore, no compensation can be provided for these costs.\nG. Interest [21] Pursuant to section 53(4) of the Act, the Complainant seeks interest on any award of compensation made by the Tribunal. As such, I grant interest on the compensation awarded, at the current Bank of Canada rate, as follows:\n\u2022 The compensation for pain and suffering and special compensation will include an award of interest from the date of the Complainant\u2019s lay off, to the date of this decision.\n\u2022 The compensation for the orthodontic work will include an award of interest from October 2010, the date the Complainant made the last payment for this expense, to the date of this decision.\n\u2022 The compensation for the dental work will include an award of interest from February 2008, the date the Complainant made the last payment for this expense, to the date of this decision.\n\u2022 The compensation for drug expenses will include an award of interest from April 2008, the date the Complainant made the last payment for this expense, to the date of this decision.\n\u2022 The compensation for the training course will include an award of interest from July 2007, the date the Complainant paid the expense, to the date of this decision.\nI note that the remedies related to the Complainant\u2019s pension and share ownership plan were not awards of compensation, as they were made to restore a privilege pursuant to section 53(2)(b) of the Act.\nIII. Order [22] Having found the complaint in Grant to be substantiated, and given the Tribunal\u2019s reasons on the outstanding remedies as indicated above, pursuant to section 53(2) of the Act the Tribunal\u2019s order against the Respondent includes all of the following:\n\u2022 The Respondent shall restore the Complainant\u2019s pension benefits to the position they were in at the time of her layoff. For the period from her lay off to the date when the terms of this order are implemented, the Respondent is to contribute to her pension plan half of the pension contributions it would have made during this period had the Complainant remained in its employ. If it is not possible to restore the previous pension plan, arrangements should be made to restore the lost pension benefits as described above in a comparable plan or arrangement, ensuring that the Complainant can receive retirement benefits comparable to those she would have received through MTS. I will first leave it to the parties to work out the details of the Complainant\u2019s lost pension benefits pursuant to the parameters outlined in my reasons.\n\u2022 The Respondent shall restore the Complainant\u2019s share ownership plan to the position it was in at the time of her layoff. For the period from her lay off to the date when the terms of this order are implemented, the Respondent is to contribute to her share ownership plan half of the contributions it would have made during this period had the Complainant remained in its employ. If it is not possible to restore the previous share ownership plan, arrangements should be made to restore the lost benefits as described above in a comparable plan or arrangement, ensuring that the Complainant can receive the benefits of the plan in a fashion comparable to what she would have received through MTS. I will first leave it to the parties to work out the details of the Complainant\u2019s lost employee ownership plan benefits pursuant to the parameters outlined in my reasons.\n\u2022 The Respondent shall compensate the Complainant a total of $1815.01 for expenses she incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice. The Respondent shall pay interest on this amount pursuant to the terms outlined in the reasons above.\n\u2022 The Respondent shall compensate the Complainant in the amount of $10,000 for the pain and suffering she experienced as a result of the discrimination practice. The Respondent shall pay interest on this amount from the date of the Complainant\u2019s lay off to the date of this decision.\n\u2022 The Respondent shall compensate the Complainant in the amount of $10,000 for having engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly. The Respondent shall pay interest on this amount from the date of the Complainant\u2019s lay off to the date of this decision.\n\u2022 The Respondent shall work with the Commission to train high level management such as directors and heads of the labour relations department on the duty to accommodate and the CHRA. The Respondent will work with the Commission to ensure they have an appropriate policy on the duty to accommodate and if not, the Respondent is to elaborate one or amend their existing policy. The Respondent will consult with the Unions in this process to consider the point of view of employees. This remedy shall be completed within a year of this decision.\n[23] I retain jurisdiction should the parties not be able to reach an agreement with regards to restoring the Complainant\u2019s pension plan and share ownership plan, and should the parties require any further clarification with regards to the training and policy development remedy.Signed by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nSeptember 20, 2012\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1452\/7809\nStyle of Cause: Heather Lynn Grant v.

Decision. 18\nIn accordance with the provisions in sections 5 and 6 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, the complainant, Anne Marsden, submitted three (3) complaints in the following file:\n(1) File T-1701\/5611 against Public Works and Government Services Canada (investigation number 20090991 at the Canadian Human Rights Commission): this complaint relates to the fact that accommodation measures at the Federal Court located at 180 Queen Street West in Toronto are inadequate in light of the complainant\u2019s disabilities, namely, myelopathy, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, and that this lack of accommodation prevents the complainant from having access to the Federal Court\u2019s facilities in Toronto;\n(2) File T1702\/5711 against the Courts Administration Service (investigation number 20090989 at the Canadian Human Rights Commission): the complainant makes the same criticisms in regard to her above disabilities, but against the respondent, the Courts Administration Service, the legal entity in charge of the administrative services of four (4) federal courts, namely, the Federal Court of Appeal, the Federal Court, the Court Martial Appeal Court and the Tax Court of Canada;\n(3) And a third complaint bearing number 20101136 against Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC), a complaint currently under review by the Canadian Human Rights Commission: this last complaint also refers to the lack of accommodation measures, which denies the complainant adequate access to the Federal Court. The complainant alleges that she was subjected to differential treatment compared to persons without disabilities.\nI. The Motion [1] On January 18, 2012, two pre-hearing conferences were held between the Tribunal and the parties in the aforementioned files, namely, T1701\/5611 and T1702\/5711. During these pre-hearing conferences, the complainant indicated that she wished to file a motion to amend her complaint in order to ask the Tribunal to consider the following elements:\n(1) The achievement of efficiencies in terms of cost for all parties and the physical and emotional resources of the complainant by having all matters related to the complaint originally submitted to the Commission into three complaints heard consecutively and\n(2) Set out for the parties the complete scope of the three separated complaints related to the differential treatment of the complainant, due to disability, that affected the complainant\u2019s access to the Federal Court of Canada in her personal capacity, as the Estate Trustee of Eva Bourgoin-Deceased and as 50% beneficiary of the Estate of Eva Bourgoin-Deceased;\n[2] Lastly, the complainant is seeking the following orders from the Tribunal:\n(1) That the matters before the Tribunal T1701\/5611 and T1702\/5711 and the matter before the Commission 20101136 be heard consecutively by the Tribunal as there components of one complaint.\n(2) All respondent parties be granted standing at the hearing of all matters heard consecutively where they are not the respondent party.\n(3) The Tribunal after considering the written submissions of all parties including the Reply of the complainant, if any, sets out the scope of each component of the complaint that is to be considered by the Tribunal.\n(4) The Commission, in the interest of efficiencies, the public interest and the best interests of all parties be requested by the Tribunal to expedite the investigation and consideration by the Commission of 20101136 Anne Marsden vs. Human Resources and Skills Development Canada. This complaint was formalized December 23, 2010 to respond to paragraph 74 of the investigation report of Commission 20090989 to properly cover the scope of the complaint identified as Commission File No. 20090989 and paragraph 56 of investigation report 20090991 that are now the Tribunal files T1701\/5611 and T1702\/5711 Anne Marsden vs. Court Administration Service and Anne Marsden vs. Public Works and Government Services Canada.\nII. The Parties\u2019 Positions [3] After a careful review of the complainant\u2019s motion, the Tribunal summarizes the parties\u2019 positions in the following manner.\nA. Position of the Complainant, Anne Marsden [4] In support of her motion to amend, the complainant states in her memorandum of fact the various circumstances of her complaints on the lack of accommodations, which denies her adequate access to the hearings with respect to her files against the respondents, Public Works and Government Services Canada and Courts Administration Services.\n[5] In particular, at paragraph 33 of her affidavit, the complainant stated the following:\n33. After discussion at the teleconference held on January 18, 2012 of the two complaints before the Tribunal it became obvious that I needed to serve a motion to have the Tribunal rule on the following issues:\na. My complaints are before the Tribunal in three capacities:\ni) personal ii) as the Estate Trustee for the Estate of Eva Bourgouin \u2013 Deceased and iii) as 50% beneficiary of the Estate.\nb. The scope of the complaint submitted to the Commission need to be properly defined and to include the HRSDC complaint, stalled at the Commission, referred to in paragraph 74 in the CAS investigation report and paragraph 56 of the PWGS investigation report a true copy of which is attached hereto as part of Exhibit 3:\ni. the deficiency of the Ottawa Registry access\/accommodation issues\nii. the issue of CAS refusing service that involved a requested order for CAS and the respondent HRSDC to comply with accommodation needs in relation to service of documents that was denying access to the court by the Estate of Eva Bourgoin \u2013 Deceased. (covered in paragraph 26 of the CAS investigation report \u2013 Exhibit 3)\niii. the issue of CAS Registry Officers refusing to meet my accommodation needs in relation to service of documents.\niv. the issues covered in the complaint formalized December 23, 2010 related to paragraph 74 of the CAS investigation report and 56 of the PWGSC investigation report that remains stalled at the Commission a true copy of which, along with Section 40 and 41 arguments is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.\nc. All matters, including the HRSDC\/Justice Department complaint need to be heard consecutively by the Tribunal with all parties given standing for any matter where they are not a party \u2013 e.g. CAS would have standing at the PWGSC\/HRSDC matter.\nB. Respondents\u2019 Position: Public Works and Government Services Canada T1701\/5611 and Courts Administration Service T1702\/5711 [6] In their joint memorandum of fact, counsel for the respondents, Public Works and Government Services Canada and the Courts Administration Service, argued the respondents\u2019 position in the following manner:\nOverview\n1. It seems that the complainant is attempting to introduce three allegations for inquiry by the Tribunal: a) a complaint against Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC), which is before the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission); b) allegations against the Federal Courts Registry in Ottawa; and c) allegation that a motion record was not accepted for filing.[1]\n2. The complaint against HRSDC[2] is at a very preliminary stage; the Commission did not make a decision on whether or not to deal with it. Since this complaint has not been referred to the Tribunal, it cannot be considered with files T1701\/5611 and T1702\/5711.\n3. Second, it is clear that the complainant\u2019s allegations regarding the Federal Courts Registry in Ottawa were not before the Commission and were not investigated. Thus, these allegations were note referred to the Tribunal and cannot be considered with files T1701\/5611 and T1702\/5711.\n4. Not only is the last allegation beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, the complainant was informed that the reason her motion record was not accepted for filing was because it was out of time pursuant to the Federal Courts Rules.\n(see Respondent\u2019s record, dated February 6, 2012, page 3 Overview 1, 2, 3 and 4)\n[7] In short, the respondents\u2019 position is that the complainant\u2019s complaint against Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) is at a preliminary stage and that the Canadian Human Rights Commission has not had enough time to thoroughly review the complaint and, therefore, it has not yet been referred to the Tribunal.\n[8] Consequently, the respondents indicate that the Tribunal would therefore not have jurisdiction to review a complaint against Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC).\n[9] In addition, the respondents submit that it would cause them prejudice if the complaints in files T1701\/5611 and T1702\/5711 were consolidated with the file in which the complainant filed a complaint against HRSDC, which is still under review by the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\n[10] Further, the respondents argue that if the complaint against HRSDC was to be heard consecutively with the two files T1701\/5611 and T1702\/5711, it would be premature, given that no decision has been made pursuant to the provisions of sections 40 and 41 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[11] The respondents further argue that the complainant\u2019s allegations with respect to the access issues at the Federal Courts Registry in Ottawa were not before the Commission and were not investigated by it.\n[12] Thus, the respondents submit that the complaint filed by the complainant against HRSDC cannot be added to the two other complaints before the Tribunal, namely, against PWGSC (file number T1701\/5611) and against the Courts Administration Service (file number T1702\/5711), given that the Canadian Human Rights Commission has not completed its investigation into this new complaint and, consequently, the respondents are of the view that they were not given the opportunity to avail themselves of all of the procedures provided for under the Act.\n[13] Lastly, the respondents argue the following with respect to the allegation against the Courts Administration Service:\n24. Third, the allegation that CAS discriminated against the complainant when it did not accept a motion for filing should not be investigated by the Tribunal for three reasons:\n1. This allegation was not investigated by the Commission;\n2. The respondent did not accept the complainant\u2019s motion for filing as it was out of time; it was explained to the complainant that pursuant to Rule 362 of the Federal Courts Rules, two clear days are required when filing a motion to be heard on general sittings,23 and\n3. The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to inquire into the processes of the Federal Court, which are authorized by the Federal Courts Act and the Federal Courts Rules.\n(paragraph 24 of the respondents\u2019 submission)\nC. Canadian Human Rights Commission\u2019s Position [14] In its submission in response to the motion to amend filed by the complainant, the Commission stated the following:\nOverview\n1. This is in response to the Complainant\u2019s motion to determine the scope of her complaints and have her three complaints heard consecutively.\n2. The Commission consents that the complaint number 20090991 against Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) and the complaint number 20090989 against Courts Administration Service (CAS) be heard consecutively or consolidated.\n3. Ms. Marsden\u2019s complaint number 20101136 against Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) has not been referred to the Tribunal. Therefore, the Complainant\u2019s request to have this complaint heard at the same time as her other complaints is premature and immaterial to the present matters.\n4. The allegation regarding the adverse differential treatment on the provision of services by CAS including the refusal to take a motion regarding her request for accommodation, is clearly indicated in Ms. Marsden\u2019s complaint against CAS and therefore is before the Tribunal for inquiry.\n5. The Commission does not object to the proposed amendment by\nMs. Marsden to include the allegation of discrimination with respect to the Federal Court Registry in Ottawa unless the Respondents can prove that doing so will cause them a prejudice.\u201d\n(Commission Index A - Overview 1 to 5)\n[15] Essentially, the Commission consents to complaint number 20090991 against Public Works and Government Service Canada (PWGSC) and complaint number 20090989 against the Courts Administration Service (CAS) being heard consecutively or consolidated.\n[16] As for complaint number 20101136 against Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC), given that this complaint has not yet been referred to the Tribunal, the Commission considers the review of this complaint to be premature and immaterial to these matters.\n[17] The Commission notes that it has no objection to the proposed amendment by\nMs. Marsden \u201cto include the allegation of discrimination with respect to the Federal Court Registry in Ottawa, unless the Respondents can demonstrate that doing so will prejudice their defence.\u201d\n[18] Further, the Commission notes in its finding that it has no objection to the following order: \u201cin the alternative, the parties could agree that depending on the outcome on the Toronto location, they agree to adopt the same conclusion for the Ottawa office\u201d.\nIII. Analysis of the Law and Facts Issues and conclusions\n[19] After reviewing the parties\u2019 positions in the documentation submitted to it, the Tribunal will make its determination in turn on each of the orders sought by the complainant.\n[20] Can the matters in files T1701\/5611 and T1702\/572 and the matters before the Commission in file number 20101136 be heard consecutively by the Tribunal as three components of one complaint?\n[21] The Tribunal partially consents to this question. In fact, the Tribunal finds that the matters T1701\/5611 and T1702\/57711 before it can be consolidated and heard consecutively based on how the Tribunal Member, at the time the said matters are heard, decides which procedures are the most practical and acceptable for disposing of these matters.\n[22] With respect to the complaint submitted before the Commission and bearing the number 20101136 against Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC), this last complaint cannot be referred to the Tribunal, given that it is still under review by the Canadian Human Rights Commission. As long as the Canadian Human Rights Commission has not ruled on whether the complaint may be referred to the Tribunal, no decision can be rendered at this time.\n[23] As for the allegation regarding the complainant\u2019s adverse differential treatment with respect to the provision of services by the CAS, this complaint can be heard by the Tribunal, given that it is part of the complaint already filed by the complainant in files T-1701\/57711 and T-1701-\/5611. In fact, these allegations appear in the investigation reports on the first two complaints (in report number 20090989, see paragraph 74, and in investigation report 20090991, see paragraph 56).\n[24] In fact, the allegations that appear in the investigation reports with respect to the first two complaints, in reports 20090989 (see paragraph 74) and 20090991 (see paragraph 56), are essentially the same and refer to complaints of deficiencies in the physical facilities of the Federal Court in Toronto to the detriment of her known disabling condition and these same deficiencies were noted in the Office of the Registrar of the Federal Court in Ottawa (see paragraph 26 and following of the affidavit by Anne Marsden dated January 19, 2012 appearing in her motion).\n[25] In support of this decision, the Tribunal referred to four Federal Court decisions, Canada (Attorney General) v Brown, 2008 FC 734, Canada (Attorney General) v Parent, 2006 FC 1313 (CanLII) and the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation v Public Service Alliance of Canada, 2006 FC 704, and the Canada (Human Rights Commission) v Canadian Telephone Employees Association, [2002] FCT 776.\n[26] In these decisions, the Tribunal was able to find the principles that apply to the complainant\u2019s amendment application.\n[27] Therefore, the Honourable Justice Blanchard, in Canada (Attorney General) v Parent, in respect of an application for the judicial review of a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decision rendered in this matter, noted the following in paragraph 19:\n[19] Under subsection 48.9(2) of the Act, the Tribunal enjoys considerable discretion with respect to the conduct of proceedings. The exercise of this discretion for the purpose of granting a motion to amend a complaint is dependent not only on the Act but on an assessment of the facts. It is therefore a question of mixed law and fact.\n[28] Also, in his decision, Blanchard J. referred to Cook v Onion Lake First Nation, [2002] CHRR No 12, and referring to Member Groarke, wrote:\n[33] The rule of practice is accordingly that issues arising out of the same set of factual circumstances should normally be heard together.\n[29] Also, Blanchard J., in referring to a decision of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in IMP Group Ltd v Dillman [1995] N.S.J. No. 326:\n[35] To raise a new complaint at the hearing stage would circumvent the whole legislative process that is designed to provide for attempts at conciliation and settlement. This matter did not go through the preliminary stages of investigation, conciliation and referral by the Commission to an inquiry pursuant to s. 32(a) of the Act. The Board dealt with a matter which had never been referred to it.\n[30] And further in the decision, Blanchard J. summarized his thinking as follows in regard to the facts of this matter:\n[39] It would have been preferable for the respondent Alain Parent to seek the amendment of the complaint at the time he was discharged, since it would have enabled the question to be investigated at the preliminary stage. Be that as it may, I believe that the Tribunal did not abuse its discretion by allowing the amendment, which does not constitute a new complaint in my opinion because the two alleged discriminatory acts are founded essentially upon the same factual circumstances.\n[31] And a little further, he added:\n[41] The Tribunal enjoys a wide discretion under the Act in terms of decision-making at this stage. Given the circumstances in this case, where the same factor\u2014the health of Alain Parent\u2014is being advanced as the motive for the two alleged discriminatory acts, and given the fact that Alain Parent\u2019s discharge was raised in the investigation report, I find that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to render its decision and did not abuse its discretion. Thus, I find that the Tribunal was entitled to determine that the new facts alleged do not constitute a complaint distinct from the one referred to the Commission in 2002.\n[44] Accordingly, while one may speak of a new alleged discriminatory act,\ni.e., discharging the respondent, the act is the result of the same circumstances and, strictly speaking, one cannot call this a new complaint. In the absence of a prejudice to the applicant, the Tribunal was entitled to grant the amendment and, as I determined above, did not abuse its discretion.\n[45] Finally, I also reject the applicant's arguments with respect to the absence of evidence to allow the motion. I concur with what the Tribunal wrote on that subject:\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure are not as formal as those of a court. Motions are not required to be supported by an affidavit (see Rule 3). Indeed, they need not follow any particular format. It is common for the Tribunal to receive motions by way of letters and even email messages. The main objective is to ensure that each party be given full and ample opportunity to be heard by the Tribunal.\n[46] It should be noted that allegations made in an amended complaint must be proven at the Tribunal hearing stage.\n[32] The Tribunal has also noted that, in Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v Canadian Telephone Employees Association, [2002] FCT 776, a decision rendered before the Honourable Justice Kelen, in relation to an application for judicial review of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decision setting aside a motion to amend two wage disparity complaints, read as follows:\n[30] The jurisprudence is clear that the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to amend complaints of discrimination. In Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970, as per Sopinka J. at pages 978 and 996, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that a Human Rights Commission can amend a deficient complaint to bring the complaint into conformity with the nature of the proceedings before the Tribunal. This can be done at any time during the proceedings.\n[31] This jurisprudence is echoed in the decisions of the Federal Court with respect to amendments to pleadings under Rule 75 of the Federal Court Rules, 1998. I refer to the case of Rolls Royce plc v Fitzwilliam 2000 CanLII 16748 (FC), (2000), 10 C.P.R. (4th) 1 (F.C.T.D.), where Blanchard J. set out as a general rule that proposed amendments should be allowed where they do not result in prejudice to the opposing party:\n10 Although leave is discretionary, as a general rule a proposed amendment should be allowed in the absence of prejudice to the opposing party. As stated by D\u00e9cary J.A., speaking for the Federal Court of Appeal, in Canderel Ltd v Canada, 1993 CanLII 2990 (FCA), [1994] 1 FC 3 (FCA) at p 10:\n\"\u2026 the general rule is that an amendment should be allowed at any stage of an action for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties, provided, notably, that the allowance would not result in an injustice to the other party not capable of being compensated by an award of costs and that it would serve the interests of justice.\"\n\u2026\n[37] I find that the motion to amend was an attempt to correct an obvious error, and bring the Tribunal proceedings in line with the relevant evidence. It was not an attempt to bring wholly new complaints into a proceeding already in progress.\nIV. Summary of Orders Sought A. Consolidation of files T1701 and T1702 [33] The Tribunal reviewed investigation reports 20090989 and 20090991, which supported files T1701\/5611 and T1702\/5711.\n[34] As the Tribunal noted above, the facts appearing in the complainant\u2019s complaints referred to the lack of accommodations at the Federal Court at 180 Queen Street West in Toronto, facts that seem to be the same as the lack of accommodations at the Federal Court in Ottawa (see paragraph 74 of the investigation report 20090989).\n[35] Similarly, in investigation report 20090991, at paragraph 56, the same allegations of facts reappear in regard to the lack of accommodation measures at the Federal Court in Toronto and in Ottawa (see paragraph 56).\n[36] It is clear that the Tribunal must agree with the consolidation of these files for the purpose of the hearing, which would only increase efficiency in relation to the hearing of these complaints, out of concern for better administration of justice (Wheatcroft v Canadian International Development Agency, 2010 CHRT 32; Schuyler v Oneida Nation of the Thames, 2005 CHRT 10).\n[37] Therefore, it is certainly appropriate that the two files T1701\/5611 and T1702\/5711 should be consolidated for the purposes of a joint and\/or consecutive hearing based on what will be decided by the presiding Tribunal Member to achieve the proper management of the hearing for these files.\nB. Consolidation of complaint in file 20101136 against Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) [38] The Tribunal considers that it cannot allow the motion of the complainant,\nAnne Marsden, as drafted.\n[39] In fact, complaint number 20101136 is still under review before the Canada Human Rights Commission and the Commission has not referred said complaint to the Tribunal, under the provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[40] To act otherwise would go against the provisions of the Act, which provides for an inquiry mechanism under the authority of the Canada Human Rights Commission and which could deny the parties a inquiry process and advance every argument before the Commission (see reference by Blanchard J. to a decision of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in IMP Group LTD v. Dillman, [1995] NSJ No 326, at paragraph 35).\n[41] The Tribunal also notes that it cannot grant the consolidation of complaint number 20101136 against Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) because in doing so it would be introducing a new party to the dispute which would be viewed as overstepping its jurisdiction as stated by the Honourable Justice Simon No\u00ebl in Attorney General of Canada v. Brown, 2008 FC 734 (CanLII) (see paragraphs 27, 28, 38, 39, 40 and 41).\n[42] The Tribunal also states that the joinder of a party within the meaning of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure must be made by way of a motion by the persons referred to therein and not by the Tribunal on its own motion. The Tribunal notes, however, that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure were never published in the Canada Gazette and do not constitute rules of procedure within the meaning of section 48.9 of the CHRA.\nC. Allegation regarding the alleged differential treatment by CAS is before the Tribunal [43] With respect to the allegation of \u201cthe alleged differential of treatment by CAS of the Commission\u2019s submissions in response to the complaint\u2019s motion,\u201d the Tribunal notes that the complainant made reference to the fact that the CAS discriminated against her with respect to delivery of documents:\n[20] \u2026 in the delivery of documents and in the provision of other services by failing to accommodate her disabilities. She asserts that the Respondent further discriminated against her by failing to accept the filing of a motion dealing with her request for accommodation in the delivery of services.\u201d\nSaikali's Affidavit, Exhibit 2, complaint number 20090989, para. 9.\n[44] The Tribunal considers that the Commission\u2019s submissions in that respect are relevant and would certainly allow the Tribunal to investigate the allegation as it is not a new complaint. In this regard, the Commission consents to this allegation being heard by the Tribunal.\n[45] Again, in the best interests of justice and the parties, and under the case law cited above, it appears to the Tribunal that seeing as the facts were alleged in the original complaints in files T1701\/5611 and T1702\/5711, the Tribunal therefore has authority to investigate these facts.\n[46] Further, the Tribunal notes in respect of the allegation that it is an additional element in the complaints filed by the complainant and that relate to issues of accessibility at the offices of the Federal Court in both Toronto and Ottawa.\n[47] Consequently, the submission of an allegation of discrimination:\n[24] we submit the allegation of discrimination in the provision of services by CAS, namely, the delivery of documents and the refusal to accept the complainant's motion for accommodation is before the Tribunal for determination.\nmay be heard by the Tribunal.\n[48] In support of that decision, the Tribunal refers to Attorney General of Canada v Parent, 2006 FC 1313 (CanLII) (see above citations with respect to that decision).\n[49] The respondents argue in their responses that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to investigate the allegation of discrimination described (see paragraph 13 above).\n[50] The Tribunal considers that the allegation is part of the complaints of discrimination filed before the Canadian Human Rights Commission and in respect of which the Commission asked the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to deal with its response to the complainant\u2019s motion to amend (see para 15 of this decision).\n[51] The Tribunal notes that the respondents did not submit any authority or case law pertaining to that argument. Also, they did not indicate how they would suffer harm from the hearing of this allegation.\n[52] Moreover, the Tribunal referred to the provisions of subsection 49(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which reads as follows:\nAt any stage after the filing of a complaint, the Commission may request the Chairperson of the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint if the Commission is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry is warranted.\n[53] The Tribunal notes that the provisions of subsection 49(1) suggest that the investigation of the Canadian Human Rights Commission is not a mandatory stage prior to inquiry before the Tribunal. Seeing as the allegation is mentioned in the complaint itself, the fact that the Canadian Human Rights Commission did not investigate this particular point does not appear to be fatal to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to examine at the time of the inquiry, especially since the Commission agrees that the Tribunal should proceed with its examination of the allegation.\n[54] In referring to the case law cited by the Tribunal earlier in this decision, the Tribunal considers that this issue is validly before it and, accordingly, the Tribunal will therefore proceed with hearing the allegation. However, the Tribunal grants the respondents the right to present before the Tribunal Member an argument on the merits of the issue at the time inquiry.\nV. Other Requests Required Second order required by the complainant:\nii. All respondent parties be granted standing at the hearing of all matters heard consecutively where they are not the respondent party.\n[55] Considering that the complaints filed by the complainant against the respondents, Public Works and Government Services Canada and Courts Administration Service, are essentially based on the same facts and that the respondents are represented by the Attorney General of Canada, it would therefore be appropriate to grant the parties the possibility to intervene in each of the complaints in the files if they wish to do so in order to make any relevant argument.\n[56] Moreover, for obvious practical reasons, and taking into account that the respondents have the same counsel, it is undeniable that the respondents could make their arguments in each of the complaints filed.\n[57] Third order required by the complainant:\niii. The Tribunal after considering the written submissions of all parties including the Reply of the complainant, if any, sets out the scope of each component of the complaint that is to be considered by the Tribunal.\n[58] The Tribunal considers that it cannot grant this order at the stage of the motion filed by the complainant as it considers that it would be an encroachment on the discretion of the Tribunal Member presiding over this matter to rule on such issues. Accordingly, the issue will remain under the jurisdiction of the Tribunal Member at the time of inquiry into these complaints.\niv. The Commission, in the interests of efficiencies, the public interest and the best interests of all parties be requested by the Tribunal to expedite the investigation and consideration by the Commission of 20101136 Anne Marsden vs Human Resources and Skills Development Canada this complaint was formalized December 23, 2010 to respond to paragraph 74 of the investigation report of Commission No,20090989 to properly cover the scope of the complaint identified as Commission File No. 20090989 and paragraph 56 of investigation report 20090991 that are now Tribunal Files T1701\/5611 andT1702\/5711 Anne Marsden vs. Courts Administration Service and Anne Marsden vs. Public Works and Government Services Canada.\n[59] The Tribunal answered in the negative the question considering, with respect for the contrary opinion, that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to order the Commission to proceed with an investigation into the complaint and to rule within timelines that could be set by the Tribunal (Tweten v RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd, 2004 CHRT 8, at para 17.\n[60] In that regard, the Tribunal refers to the wording of the Canadian Human Rights Act and more particularly the provisions of sections 48.9, 49 and 50 of the Act, which do not include any provisions allowing the Tribunal to issue such an order against the Canada Human Rights Commission.\n[61] Consequently, the Tribunal cannot issue an order required by the complainant against the Commission to force it to proceed with the investigation into complaint number 200101136, Anne Marsden v Human Resources and Skills Development Canada.\nVI. Decision For these reasons, the Tribunal:\nOrders that complaint numbers T1701\/5611 v PWGSC and T1702\/5711 v Courts Administration Service be heard as part of the same hearing to be set as these complaints essentially involve the same issues of facts and law;\nOrders that:\n- the allegation regarding the adverse differential treatment in the provision by CAS to comply with accommodations needs in relation to service of documents that was denied in access to the Court by the estate of Eva Bourgouin deceased (covered in para. 26 of the CAS investigation report, exhibit 3, notice of motion of complainant);\n- the issue of CAS Registry officer refusing to meet the accommodations needs in relation to service of documents;\n- the allegation of discrimination with respect to the Federal Court Registry in Ottawa.\nshall all be before the Tribunal for investigation and hearing;\nGrants the respondents the possibility to intervene in each of the complaints in the files if they wish to do so in order to make any relevant argument.\nDismisses all the other orders by the complainant.\nSigned by\nRobert Malo\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nSeptember 28, 2012\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal Files: T1701\/5611 and T1702\/5711\nStyle of Cause: Anne Marsden v.

Complaints [1] In January 2008 and June 2009, Chris Hughes filed complaints under the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) against Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC). The Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) investigated the complaints and referred them to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (Tribunal) for inquiry on June 24, 2011.\n[2] Member Wallace Craig conducted an inquiry into the complaints in Victoria B.C. from May 23 to 25, May 28 to June 1 and on June 13 and 14, 2012.\n[3] In his first complaint, Exhibit C-1, filed with the Commission on January 27, 2008, Mr. Hughes claimed that, between March 2006 and January 2008, he was subjected to a discriminatory practice contrary to s. 7 of the CHRA. Mr. Hughes claimed that HRSDC refused to employ him because he suffered from the disability of depression.\n[4] In his second complaint, Exhibit C-2, filed with the Commission on June 11, 2009, Mr. Hughes alleged that he had been subjected to retaliation since early 2008 contrary to s. 14.1 of the CHRA, and also that discrimination under s. 7 was ongoing.\nB. Relevant sections of the CHRA [5] Section 3 reads as follows:\n3. (1) For all the purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for which a pardon has been granted.\n[6] Section 7 reads as follows:\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n\u2026\nOn a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[7] Section 14.1 reads as follows:\n14.1 It is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\nC. Standard of Proof and assessing credibility [8] In F.H. v. McDougall, 2008 SCC 53, the Supreme Court of Canada clarified the law with respect to the standard of proof in civil cases: nothing more, nothing less than a balance of probabilities.\n[9] Evidence must be clear, convincing and cogent in order to satisfy the balance of probabilities test.\n[10] The Court also affirmed that a trial judge must not consider a witness\u2019 evidence in isolation, but should consider the totality of the evidence in the case, and assess the impact of any inconsistencies on questions of credibility and reliability pertaining to the core issues in the case.\n[11] In R. v. R.E.M .2008 SCC 51 at p. 56, released at the same time as McDougall, supra, Chief Justice McLachlin commented that findings of fact on credibility may involve factors that are difficult to explain:\nWhile it is useful for a judge to attempt to articulate the reasons for believing a witness and disbelieving another in general or on a particular point, the fact remains that the exercise may not be purely intellectual and may involve factors that are difficult to verbalize. Furthermore, embellishing why a particular witness\u2019 evidence is rejected may involve the judge in saying unflattering things about the witness; ... In short, assessing credibility is a difficult and delicate matter that does not always lend itself to precise and complete verbalization.\nIn the end, believing the testimony of one witness and not the other is a matter of judgement. (paragraph 76 \u2013 McDougall)\n[12] The Supreme Court\u2019s clarification of the standard of proof and assessment of credibility is consistent with what had already been stated in William Pentney, Discrimination and the Law (Thomson Carswell 2006) and the case of Van Berkel v. MPI Security Ltd. (1997) 28 C.H.R.R. D\/504 (.C.H.R.C.) at p. 15-57:\nIn accordance with these judicial guidelines, the testimony of each witness has been examined for consistency with the preponderance of probabilities which surround the existing circumstances of the complainants employment with [the corporate respondent] and her interactions with [the individual respondent]. I have also scrutinized the evidence for plausibility under the circumstances and weighed the witnesses\u2019 motives. In addition, I have paid attention to their powers of observation, memory and recall, as well as their attitude and demeanour under oath, and the manner in which they testified. Finally, I have checked their testimony for lack of internal coherence or any significant inconsistencies and contradictions.\n[13] The complainant and the respondent each have an evidentiary burden. Initially Mr. Hughes must present a prima face case of contravention by HRSDC of sections 7 and 14.1 of the CHRA. If a prima facie case is made out by the complainant then the evidentiary burden shifts to the respondent to establish that the conduct complained of either didn\u2019t occur or doesn\u2019t constitute a discriminatory practice: Ont. Human Rights Comm. v. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 SCR 536.\nD. Background [14] From 1995 to 2005 Mr. Hughes was employed as a term employee by Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, the predecessor to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), and worked in three capacities which are particularized in Exhibit C-4 Tab 16: as a Business Window Agent, Customs Inspector, and Collections Officer.\n[15] Mr. Hughes graduated from Middlesex District High School in Ontario. While working at the CRA, he augmented his high-school education with level-one financial accounting courses at Camosun College and various training courses at the CRA involving tax law and legal remedies. Mr. Hughes also later took a number of training courses in law enforcement while working at the CBSA (Exhibit C-4, tab 16).\n[16] Mr. Hughes testified that in these initial years of employment he publicly disclosed an incident in which a taxpayer was subjected to improper attachment proceeding by other employees of the CRA. Mr. Hughes testified that he was labelled a whistleblower, that he engaged the CRA in litigation, resulting in a confidential settlement and payment to him of an amount of money that cannot be disclosed. Mr. Hughes revealed that during this turbulent period he suffered anxiety and stress requiring medical leaves of absence from work.\n[17] In his first period of employment with CRA, Mr. Hughes remained a term employee unable to earn sought-after indeterminate employment.\nII. The Case Presented by Mr. Hughes A. Circumstances surrounding Mr. Hughes\u2019 complaints of discrimination and retaliation [18] At the beginning of his testimony Mr. Hughes identified Exhibit C-1 as his January 27, 2008 complaint of discrimination and he stated under oath that all averments in it were true. The complaint establishes that in the spring of 2006 Mr. Hughes had applied as an external candidate and was accepted in a staffing pool (section process number 2006-REH-EA-BC-SC-587) with respect to a CR-05 Service Delivery Agent 11 position at HRSDC in Victoria. Mr. Hughes claimed that he was interviewed on August 23, 2006, and passed.\n[19] The following excerpts from Exhibit C-1 are relevant to the issue of disability:\nOn October 17 2006 I received an email stating that I was placed in a partially assessed pool. I phoned HRSDC and I was told the email was poorly worded and that I met all essential qualifications and I was in a fully qualified hiring pool (this would have been since August 23, 2006).\nOn December 19, 2006, I was phoned by a K. Porter and asked for references to finish the process. This made no sense as it contradicted what I was told earlier. She said I had passed all the essential qualifications and the reference was just used to confirm the results.\nI told Ms. Porter there would be problems with references as I was a government whistleblower. I had left an Internal Affairs summary with the board at the interview in August. I reiterated that I had very good performance reviews in the past and that copies were handed in to the Board in August. I mentioned my health issues, stress, depression and retaliation by CBSA in regard to references. I asked for accommodation under the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[20] Following his acceptance in the CR-05 pool, a national reclassification of staffing took place bringing with it a change in the education requisite to two years of post-secondary education. Mr. Hughes acknowledged that this reclassification of staffing rendered him technically unqualified as a CR-05 candidate for employment. Mr. Hughes was never hired from the CR-05 staffing pool.\n[21] Mr. Hughes testified that notwithstanding the change in education requirement, the CR-05 pool in which he was qualified could have been used to staff at equivalent positions such as PM-02 Service Benefits Canada Officer, PM-01 Citizen Service Agent, PM-01 Payment Services Agent and CR-04 Service Delivery Agent. In his complaint of discrimination Mr. Hughes provided the names of six persons employed on one-year assignments; two on September 14, 2006, two on November 6, 2006, one on November 11, 2006, one on January 2, 2007 (nine months), and he asserted that he should have been considered for these positions.\n[22] Mr. Hughes also listed four persons who were hired on May 22, 2007, through a non-advertised process as PM-01, and he asserted that the job poster and qualifications were almost identical to the CR-05 pool he was in. \u201cHRSDC should have used the CR-05 pool I was in but did not due to discrimination.\u201d\n[23] Lastly, Mr. Hughes identified a person in a CR-04 pool who was appointed May 22, 2007, for one year as an acting PM-02. \u201cAgain, I should have been considered for this position as I had recently shown I had the qualifications for this job and I had 10 years experience as a PM-01 and PM-02.\u201d\n[24] Mr. Hughes tendered Exhibit C-5, Tab 23; it includes a completed \u201cAssessment Guide\u201d for Chris Hughes, which ends with a hand-printed endorsement \u201cThis Candidate Meets All Qualifications\u201d, referring to the CR-05 competition 2006-REH-CSD-EA-BC-SC-587. Also forming part of Exhibit C-5, Tab 23 is a \u201cReference Check\u201d which includes a pertinent question and answer: \u201c(Q16) Would you rehire...? Can you tell me why (or why not)?\u201d and a handwritten answer \u2013 \u201ccurrently not working, \u2018medical issues\u2019 last few years. (Quote from Mr. Hughes).\u201d\n[25] In the course of this inquiry into Mr. Hughes\u2019 human rights complaints, the thrust of his evidence revealed an incorrect assumption: that acceptance into a staffing pool, particularly the CR-05 pool, carried with it a guarantee of employment.\n[26] Nevertheless, (a) refusal or neglect on the part of HRSDC to recognize Mr. Hughes\u2019 qualifications, and (b) failure to re-hire him from the CR-05 pool while aware that Mr. Hughes was disabled, is a discriminatory practice. That conclusion is reinforced by the circumstances of HRSDC\u2019s subsequent hiring of Mr. Hughes as a term CR-04 employee, employment that was \u201cnon-extended\u201d, i.e. terminated, while Mr. Hughes was suffering an episode of depression.\nB. Insurance Processing \u2013 CEP Processing Centre \u2013 SCC Victoria [27] In the summer of 2007, Mr. Hughes applied to a CR-04 competition with the respondent. On August 31, 2007, Mr. Hughes was hired from CR-04 pool referenced # 2007-CSD-EA-BC-SC-425 as a Service Delivery Agent 1 to do \u201cInsurance Processing \u2013 CEP [Common Experience Payment] Processing Centre \u2013 SCC Victoria.\u201d Mr. Hughes testified that he was not known to the panel members, that he did not disclose his whistle-blowing past or that he occasionally suffered from depression. Mr. Hughes claimed that his non-disclosure resulted in his being hired and demonstrated there was a stigma over him that discredited his work record and qualifications.\n[28] Mr. Hughes produced a copy of a letter (Exhibit C-4, Tab 12) dated August 31, 2007, sent to him by HRSDC, offering term employment for the period September 13, 2007, to March 7, 2008. On September 5, 2007, Mr. Hughes accepted the offer. Similar letters from HRSDC dated November 22, 2007, and February 28, 2008, (Exhibits R-3 and R-4) extended Mr. Hughes\u2019 term employment to March 28, 2008, and finally to June 27, 2008.\n[29] Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC), (formerly Indian and Northern Affairs Canada), provides an Information Update on its website which explains the Common Experience Payment (CEP) stating, in part:\nThe Common Experience Payment (CEP) is one element of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement. The court-approved Settlement Agreement was implemented on September 19, 2007, and was negotiated by representatives from various Aboriginal organizations, church entities, legal representatives for former students, and the Government of Canada. The CEP is paid to eligible former students who resided at a listed Indian Residential School. Eligible former students receive $10,000 for their first year (or part thereof) of their attendance at a listed Indian Residential School plus $3,000 for each additional year (or part thereof).\n[30] It was the responsibility of Mr. Hughes (and all other newly employed Service Delivery Agents at HRSDC\u2019s CEP processing unit in Victoria) to process applications, determine eligibility, and to expedite a one-time CEP payment to former students of Indian Residential Schools. A significant part of Mr. Hughes\u2019 work was receiving phone calls from applicants who often spoke of the trauma to which they had been subjected, causing him increasing levels of distress.\nC. Mr. Hughes\u2019 performance as a CEP employee [31] Mr. Hughes explained the manner in which CEP applications were processed in HRSDC\u2019s Victoria office at 595 Pandora Street. Mr. Hughes claimed that he processed the most CEP applications earning the nickname Rock Star and go-to-guy of his team.\n[32] Mr. Hughes testified that he willingly worked a great deal of overtime during the first few months of the CEP, illustrated in part in Exhibit C-4 Tab 24, email exchanges with his team leader Jacky Smith, \u201cSubject: OT production\u201d and \u201cweekend OT production\u201d:\n[33] October 22, 2007:\nHughes: I worked five hours Saturday and three hours Sunday. I entered 35 applications and D .E. R. 30 applications.\nSmith: That\u2019s excellent Chris. Really appreciate your productive efforts.\n[34] October 28 and 30, 2007:\nHughes: I entered 39 applications and Data Entry Reviewed 132\nSmith: You have consistently had excellent productivity results Chris. Your hard work is appreciated.\n[35] Exhibit C-4, Tab 25 consists of two emails which reveal that Mr. Hughes was a conscientious worker.\n[36] First, on November 7, 2007, from Lorraine Lewis, an acting Project Officer, an email to Mr. Hughes and Ms. Shelley Spears, cc Jacky Smith: \u201cThank you to both of you for coming up with an example of a paid client to assist with the training.\u201d\n[37] Second, on November 22, 2007, an HRSDC manager, Liz Klempner, alerted CEP employees to two websites, an INAC database website and the Aboriginal Canada website on which they might establish band contact information and the legitimacy of other essential facts. Ms. Klempner: \u201cThanks to Chris Hughes and others who provided this useful information.\u201d\n[38] Aware his CEP term employment was time-limited, Mr. Hughes engaged in an email exchange with team leader Jacky Smith on January 8, 2008, asking how he might request work as an acting PM-02 (or PM-01) in the CPP\/OAS area, and stating \u201cI hope that I have shown that I am a reliable, productive employee during my time with the CEP program.\u201d Ms. Smith\u2019s response is significant:\nNot sure if you applied on the recent PM01 processed for the CSA position. That position is for the front-end position working downstairs with the clients. I don\u2019t think the CPP\/OAS has any PM01 positions any longer, but not positive on that. If you are not in an active pool, I would suggest you submit a deployment request to the manager(s) there.\nHere is the official form, the request can be sent via email, memo, or letter to the hiring manager. It is up to that unit to decide whether or not they would accept the request. I do not know all the managers there but the Director is Kim Bergh and the managers would be listed in the electronic directory.\nI do think that you have been a reliable, productive and pro-active member of this team and would not have a problem if you wanted to give my name as a reference. (Emphasis added)\n[39] On January 30, 2008, Mr. Hughes emailed a request to Kim Bergh, (copied to Mr. Quinn), for deployment, and supported his request with a resume detailing experience in various positions with HRSDC\u2019s predecessors.\n[40] In early February 2008, a co-worker embarrassed Mr. Hughes in front of other employees by heatedly and falsely accusing him of incorrectly processing certain CEP applications. Mr. Hughes was unnerved by this verbal attack and went directly to team leader Ms. Smith\u2019s office. Not finding her there, he went to the local union president who contacted Ms. Smith and asked her to meet with Mr. Hughes. Ms. Smith discussed the matter with Mr. Hughes but made it clear that in her opinion, Mr. Hughes should not have gone so hastily to the union for assistance. Thereafter Ms. Smith met with the co-worker but did not sanction her for what Mr. Hughes perceived as harassment. This incident soured their relationship and resulted in Ms. Smith being reluctant thereafter to fully endorse Mr. Hughes\u2019 employment potential.\n[41] In a reference check dated August 6, 2008, Exhibit C-5, Tab 32, Ms. Smith downgraded Mr. Hughes\u2019 ability to process CEP applications, contradicting her January 8, 2008, commendation of his work ethic and her offer to be a reference on his behalf.\n[42] In a \u201cReference Check\u201d dated October 11, 2008, Ms. Smith mentioned the incident and stated \u201cA more appropriate approach would have been to personally approach the Team Leader rather than requesting involvement from the Local Union.\u201d\nD. Mr. Hughes\u2019 Continuing Disability [43] At the end of the intense period of CEP processing, Mr. Hughes began to re-experience health problems. Exhibit C-4, Tab 28 is an exchange of emails on December 14, 2007, between Mr. Hughes, Cherie Nash (Acting Project Officer) and team-leader Jacky Smith. Mr. Hughes reported that he had been ill for two days with a back problem and a bout of food poisoning or flu, rendering him unable to work on the coming Saturday. On December 17, 2007, Mr. Hughes emailed Ms. Smith explaining that his hip pain was still severe, stating \u201cI have suffered from Piriformis Syndrome and\/or Spondylolithesis for the last 12 years and usually can deal with the pain and condition without missing much work. It only flares up once or twice a year.\u201d\n[44] On February 18, 2008, Mr. Hughes received a signed handwritten memorandum, Exhibit C-4, Tab 19, from Dr. John Miller, M.D., a general practitioner in Victoria:\nName \u2013 Chris Hughes\nDate \u2013 Feb. 18\/08\nChris has a history of depression and has been somewhat stressed and depressed for the past month. Reduced client telephone contact would be helpful. (Emphasis added)\n(Signed) Dr. John Miller, M.D.\n[45] The Oxford Dictionary defines depression as \u201cMed. a pathological state of extreme dejection, characterized by a mood of hopelessness and feelings of inadequacy, often with physical symptoms.\u201d\n[46] Mr. Hughes presented Dr. Miller\u2019s memorandum to Ms. Smith, and she accommodated his episode of depression by changing his duties.\n[47] On April 14, 2008, Mr. Hughes made another request for accommodation to Ms. Smith:\nThis is a further request for accommodation due to my disability. Thank you for modifying my job earlier when I brought this to your attention.\nI had a great difficulty getting through last week. I request to be transferred to the CR-04 Service Delivery Agent processing GIS renewal [Guaranteed Income Supplement] on medical grounds.\nThe current position I hold and the program I am assigned to is making my health condition worse. I believe working in GIS will improve my health. The GIS job involves a lot of number crunching (which I excel at and enjoy) and involves less client contact by phone. The nature of the program is also not depressing.\nCEP deals with a lot of stressful and depressing issues of abuse and discrimination. It is not a good fit given my medical history.\nThe GIS position would be less stressful and should also alleviate my depression.\nI am sure there are persons at GIS who are not enjoying it or want to come back to CEP. In any event, I have a medical request that needs to be accommodated per the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Treasury Board\u2019s Duty to Accommodate.\nBoth my current position and GIS are CR-04 jobs. There should be no reason for HRSDC to deny this request as I am in a fully qualified pool for a CR-04 position and the job poster stated it could be used to staff similar positions at the CR-04 level. Exhibit R-5\n[48] Mr. Hughes\u2019 request for further accommodation with respect to his disability of depression was sent to Ms. Smith at 9:34 am on April 14, 2008. It was followed by a brief exchange of emails with Ms. Smith at 10:02 am and 10:08 am. At 10:09 am Ms. Smith sent Mr. Hughes\u2019 request to Mr. Quinn. At 10:21 am Ms. Smith emailed Mr. Quinn, verbatim, Dr. Miller\u2019s note dated February 18, 2008, stating that on receipt of the note, she had ended Mr. Hughes\u2019 duty to receive client phone calls. At 11:10 am Mr. Quinn forwarded Mr. Hughes\u2019 request for accommodation to Human Resources Consultant Caleigh Miller, and she replied immediately:\nI agree with the medical being required. Denying a deployment (for other reasons such as right fit etc) does not constitute denying a DTA. We have to make all efforts to accommodate in the current position before we look at a same level transfer. Given that the duties of a CR-04 are relatively similar (ie\/clerical in nature) we would need to know specifically which duties he is not able to do. Can he not deal with the public? Use a telephone? Etc etc. He says it should alleviate his depression. It may not. Depression is a medical condition which needs to be treated along with a medical professional. It is presumptive to say how a different job would affect one\u2019s health considering he does not know the nature of that specific job.\nWe can also prepare a letter to send to Chris\u2019 physician asking more questions about his abilities\/limitations, enclosing a copy of the work description etc even if he brings in a medical.\n[49] Ms. Miller\u2019s comments informed HRSDC\u2019s management of the seriousness of the illness of depression gripping Mr. Hughes. Despite Ms. Miller\u2019s recommendations, Ms. Smith and Mr. Quinn failed to implement them or to otherwise accommodate Mr. Hughes\u2019 disability. Ms. Miller made specific recommendations that ought to have been acted upon. The several managers who failed to respond to Mr. Hughes\u2019 request for accommodation of his mental illness revealed that they were incapable of identifying themselves with and comprehending the rigours of mental illness and their duty as HRSDC managers as stipulated by the Treasury Board of Canada.\nE. Termination of Mr. Hughes Employment [50] Five weeks after Mr. Hughes\u2019 request for accommodation concerning his depressive condition, Anne Milne, Senior Director, Processing and Payment Services, BC\/AB Territories Region, HRSDC, notified Mr. Hughes by letter dated May 20, 2008, (Exhibit C-4 Tab 42), that his CEP term employment would terminate on June 27, 2008.\nF. Mr. Hughes\u2019 claim of retaliation [51] In June 2009, Mr. Hughes filed a complaint of retaliation against HRSDC. Ostensibly, it stemmed from his January 2008 complaint of discrimination on the prohibited ground of disability. In his complaint of retaliation, Mr. Hughes alleged that in January 2008, he told his team leader that he was suffering from depression, and that he had filed a human rights complaint. He also alleged that the hiring managers knew of his human rights complaint based on disability.\n[52] Mr. Hughes asserted that when the HRSDC management learned of his complaint based on disability, he was retaliated against by denial of transfers to other work areas, that ultimately his CEP contract was not extended and, after he was terminated, that he was not selected for re-employment out of two staffing pools in which he had been qualified.\n[53] It is pertinent that Mr. Hughes claimed that both discrimination and retaliation were ongoing throughout the period January to June 2008. In considering the merit of Mr. Hughes\u2019 claim of on-going retaliation, I note that throughout his testimony, Mr. Hughes revealed himself to be overly assertive and dogmatic concerning his perceived entitlement to a career with HRSDC. In this regard, he could not accept that HRSDC management staffing decisions focus on the ultimate criteria of the \u201cright fit\u201d; and he perceived management decisions to disregard him as on-going retaliation.\nG. Complainant\u2019s prima facie Case [54] Mr. Hughes\u2019 case consisted of his viva voce testimony and pertinent documentary evidence from which I have selected the most cogent and probative. I conclude, on a balance of probabilities that Mr. Hughes has established a prima facie case of a discriminatory practice contrary to s. 7 of the CHRA, engaged in by HRSDC in its refusal to continue his employment in a manner that would accommodate his disability, and by terminating his employment while he was disabled.\n[55] Considering the same evidence, I conclude that it falls short of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation arising from and related to his complaint of discrimination contrary to section 14.1 of the CHRA.\nIII. The Case Presented by HRSDC [56] Since a prima facie case has been established, the onus now shifts to the Respondent to provide a reasonable explanation that demonstrates either that the alleged discrimination did not occur as alleged or that the conduct was somehow non-discriminatory. In other words, the Respondent must demonstrate that it did not terminate the Complainant\u2019s employment on the basis that he was disabled or that accommodating the Complainant would have amounted to undue hardship.\nA. Respondent witness Kenneth Campbell [57] During the years 2006, 2007 and 2008 Mr. Campbell was a lower-level manager at HRSDC Victoria, Mr. Quinn was above him in the chain of authority, and Ms. Milne was superior to both of them, having a relatively high level managerial position in HRSDC operations in Western Canada.\n[58] Mr. Campbell recalled an interview he had with Mr. Hughes in 2006 in connection with the CR-05 staffing pool 2006-REH-EA-BC-SC-587 in which Mr. Hughes was accepted. During the interview Mr. Hughes tendered a package of work-related information and requested special consideration over his inability to secure references because of unwarranted refusal on the part of managers who had supervised him in his earlier federal employment. In their conversation Mr. Hughes explained that he was blacklisted because of his past whistle-blowing actions and disputes with his managers.\n[59] I conclude that at all relevant times beginning in 2006 Mr. Campbell knew that Mr. Hughes had the ability to perform work at the CR-05 level, that in 2007 Mr. Hughes had been accepted into two lesser staffing pools: a CR-03 pool and a CR-04 CEP staffing pool, and knew that Mr. Hughes was employed by HRSDC in 2007 from the CR-04 pool to process CEP applications.\n[60] During the training of CEP processors, a training official from Ottawa, Mr. Paul Thomas, engaged Mr. Campbell in a conversation about Mr. Hughes. As a result of this conversation Mr. Campbell, a CEP Team Leader, sent an email on September 18, 2007, marked \u201cImportance: High, Subject: Issues\u201d, to Mr. Quinn, the manager of CEP processing, informing Mr. Quinn of negative comments made by Paul Thomas about Mr. Hughes. Mr. Campbell stated in his email \u201cI asked Paul to put this information and any other comments he has in writing as we may want a record of this. I am not sure if Liz has had any issues with Chris but we may want to inquire.\u201d\n[61] The contractual letter of employment used by HRSDC stipulates that a new employee is a probationary employee without providing any precise meaning to probation. By ordinary definition, probation is the action of subjecting an individual to a period of testing and trial to ascertain the individual\u2019s fitness or lack of fitness in a particular job. In this case, Mr. Campbell and Mr. Quinn ought to have disclosed Mr. Thomas\u2019 allegations to Mr. Hughes and given consideration to his explanation. It was unacceptable behaviour and it is to their discredit that they chose to file the information away for some future use against Mr. Hughes.\n[62] A significant potential witness, Mr. Hughes\u2019 team-leader Jacky Smith, died after Mr. Hughes\u2019 employment was terminated. Without any forewarning from counsel, Mr. Campbell attributed some very inflammatory comments to Ms. Smith with respect to her supposed fear concerning prospective behaviour of Mr. Hughes that might be caused by his depressive condition. I excluded this evidence but consider it relevant in determining the credibility of Mr. Campbell.\n[63] Later, when asked about one somewhat negative comment about Mr. Hughes made by Ms. Smith in a February 11, 2008 report, \u201cReference Check \u2013 CEP employees,\u201d intended to identify top CEP performers, (Exhibit C-4 Tab 17), Mr. Campbell testified that it was generally \u201csomething about a co-worker\u201d and that it \u201craised a bit of a red flag.\u201d The truth of the incident is that a co-worker had harassed Mr. Hughes and Mr. Campbell either knew this to be the case or was reckless in his red-flag comment. It was a groundless observation.\n[64] After being terminated (or non-extended as HRSDC phrased it) Mr. Hughes continued to bombard HRSDC with applications for employment during 2008, one of which illustrates a very acrimonious attitude toward Mr. Campbell.\n[65] When Mr. Hughes applied for employment as a Program and Service Delivery Clerk at the CR-04 level, Mr. Campbell was by then the Service Delivery Manager, Old Age Security BC, Alberta and the Territories.\n[66] In an email sent October 30, 2008, Mr. Campbell informed Mr. Hughes that \u201cAll references provided by you either could not confirm or would not discuss your past performance. On October 22, well after the September 10th deadline communicated to you, we received reference information from Mr. Tim O\u2019Neill. In addition to being untimely, the reference indicated someone who was substantively a co-worker with short term acting assignments as team leader. The Assessment board\u2019s determination that your qualifications do not meet the requirements of this position stands.\u201d\n[67] Mr. Hughes responded the same day with a page-length email, a firestorm of accusations beginning \u201cYou can expect three Public Service Commission investigations (this one and the two hiring pools I am in that HRSDC is ignoring), an additional human rights complaint and possibly civil suit,\u201d and ending \u201cI will be bringing all of this to the attention of my MP and the media. Then I will make a sign and protest in front of your office.\u201d\n[68] Mr. Campbell immediately sent his email and Mr. Hughes\u2019 response to six senior managers stating: \u201cChris\u2019s response. Please note threats including media.\u201d Exhibit C-5, Tab 30. Mr. Campbell testified he felt threatened, that it was the first time he had experienced this kind of behaviour.\n[69] I find that Mr. Campbell was deeply troubled by Mr. Hughes\u2019 hostility towards him, that it negatively affected his testimony to the point that he became noticeably reticent in answering questions put to him in cross-examination. Moreover, in the process of listening to his evidence I detected an undercurrent of antipathy towards Mr. Hughes. In all the circumstances of this case, I conclude that Mr. Campbell\u2019s testimony did not provide a dispassionate and objective recounting of his dealings with Mr. Hughes.\nB. Respondent witness James Quinn [70] Mr. Quinn, Service Delivery Manager, Processing and Payment Services at Service Canada, agreed, in 2006, to organize and manage HRSDC\u2019s processing of CEP applications. Under the shadow of an unexpected volume of applications, Mr. Quinn moved quickly to find suitable accommodation for an anticipated staff of at least one hundred processors and ancillary support staff. CR-04 and CR-03 staffing pools were established, approximately 400 applications were received, applicants were tested and approximately 200 were hired as term employees. Mr. Quinn did not participate in the hiring process, although he was aware that Mr. Hughes was hired from the CR-04 pool.\n[71] Mr. Quinn testified that the CR-04 CEP competition involved a process of testing that produced a ranking of candidates. Mr. Hughes obtained Exhibit C-5, Tab 40 under a Freedom of Information request. Exhibit C-5, Tab 40 consists of two emails clearly indicating the urgency to secure CEP term employees and stating an intention to rely on several tests to establish a ranking of applicants. The emails state the same subject: \u201cConfidential CR04 board report 2007-CSD-EA-BC-SC-425 (Victoria),\u201d each states \u201cImportance: \u201cHigh,\u201d and \u201cSensitivity: Confidential.\u201d The first email was sent in the morning of August 3, 2008, from Linda Granger to Bob McFarland, copied to six management personnel including Mr. Quinn. The first email closes with a specific message for Mr. Quinn: \u201cJim: Attached is a ranked list of potentially qualified candidates. They have been ranked according to our conversations \u2013 Test results: First \u2013 Verification & Accuracy, Second \u2013 Memo, Third \u2013 Grammar.\u201d Mr. Hughes name appears ranked fifth on a list of eighty-eight potentially qualified candidates.\n[72] HRSDC anticipated a year-long high volume of CEP applications however the reality was a very intense surge in October, November and December 2007, diminishing dramatically in January 2008. In early 2008, Mr. Quinn was instructed to move remaining files to Calgary by September.\n[73] On December 14, 2007, Mr. Quinn addressed an email to BC-YT-DIST-CEP-PEC with cc\u2019s to four HRSDC senior managers, including Anne Milne and Kim Bergh, the subject being \u201cInfo \u2013 Upcoming CR04 OAS-CPP Processing Centre Staffing activity\u201d:\nAs you may be aware, over the coming weeks and months OAS-\/CPP Processing will be looking to the current CR04 complement in CEP, along with other candidates remaining in the CR04 pools, to fill vacancies in their Processing Centre.\nThe OAS-CPP Processing Centre Managers have requested that additional reference information be provided in relation to current CR04 CEP employees, as those employed with CEP have had the opportunity to demonstrate the Abilities & Skills and Personal Suitability competencies required for positions responsible for processing applications.\nHere is some background on how this process will work. The Hiring Manager requesting the staffing action will determine the \u201cSelection Criteria\u201d based on the Statement of Merit for this Service Delivery Agent 1 (CR04) position that reflects the competencies required for the position being staffed. These competencies will include a combination of both Abilities & Skills and Personal Suitability factors. Resourcing (HR) will identify the individuals from the original pools who have demonstrated the strongest degree of these competencies during the initial hiring process; and along with current reference information provided by your Team Leader, this information will be utilized by the hiring Manager to determine the \u201cright fit\u201d for deployment opportunities.\nThis process is being utilized to ensure the selections made are based on all available information, in an effort to ensure the \u201cright fit\u201d for the position and the organization. Those identified and selected for deployment opportunities with CPP\/OAS will be contacted directly in relation to their interest in a deployment opportunity. Those not contacted remain in the pool and may be selected at a future date as additional vacancies arise.\n[74] I conclude that Mr. Quinn\u2019s December 14, 2007 letter clearly shows that it was the intention of HRSDC to offer continuing employment to CEP employees \u201c\u2026 (who) have had the opportunity to demonstrate the Abilities & Skills and Personal Suitability competencies required for positions responsible for processing applications.\u201d Occurring shortly before Mr. Hughes\u2019 request for accommodation, this letter demonstrates that HRSDC could have deployed Mr. Hughes to a position that would accommodate his disability.\n[75] It is highly likely that all CEP employees, including Mr. Hughes, were on tenterhooks due to the uncertainty of their future with HRSDC; and they would recognize Mr. Quinn as being central to any management decision whether or not to continue their employment.\n[76] On May 22, 2008, Mr. Quinn sent an email to Kim Bergh, Director of Service Canada, entitled \u201cSubject: FW- Chris Hughes \u2013 timeline \u2013 Provided this yesterday in response to a request from NHQ \u2013 Corporate Staff relations. The non-extension letter for Chris Hughes was sent to Anne Milne yesterday\u201d which Mr. Bergh forwarded to Ms. Milne. In response to this email, Ms. Milne sent an email to Mr. Quinn and Kim Bergh and copied to two other senior officials entitled \u201cSubject: RE Chris Hughes \u2013 timeline \u2013 Jim\/Kim . . . should you receive any further calls or emails with respect to this employee please refer them to me or to Debra Pynten. Thanks.\u201d\n[77] I conclude that Mr. Quinn could have persuaded other HRSDC management to accept deployment of Mr. Hughes into a job that would accommodate his disability. Rather, as with the negative opinions levelled at Mr. Hughes by training official Paul Thomas, I conclude that Mr. Quinn was the linchpin in a managerial intrigue that was heedless of the rigours of depression which beset Mr. Hughes, and disdainful of s.7 of the CHRA. I conclude that Mr. Quinn did not provide an objective recounting of his part in the decision to \u201cnon-extend\u201d Mr. Hughes\u2019 term employment, and that he was fully aware that an extension of employment was essential to facilitate the process of accommodating Mr. Hughes\u2019 disability, a matter that might have taken many months to deal with appropriately.\nC. Anne Milne [78] Anne Milne, Senior Executive Director, HRSDC Western Canada, first became aware of Mr. Hughes through his request for deployment. She testified she didn\u2019t make the decision not to deploy Mr. Hughes, \u201cI believe it was Mr. Quinn.\u201d Repeatedly, Ms. Milne demonstrated uncertainty in her answers: she couldn\u2019t recall why she signed the May 20, 2008, letter of \u201cnon-extension;\u201d she couldn\u2019t remember when she was first aware of Mr. Hughes\u2019 human rights complaint; she believed being briefed that Mr. Hughes needed accommodation but referred only to stress, making no mention of depression. Under cross examination Ms. Milne asserted that she did not make the decision to terminate Mr. Hughes and when asked \u201cWho did?\u201d, answered \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d When asked why she signed the letter sent to Mr. Hughes but did not sign two other termination letters, Ms. Milne\u2019s did not provide a satisfactory explanation.\n[79] As demonstrated by the email exchange which took place on May 22nd, significant HRSDC management discussion was engaged in with respect to Ms. Milne\u2019s May 20th letter terminating Mr. Hughes\u2019 employment. I infer that this action by Ms. Milne was a high-level management rejection of Mr. Hughes and his numerous requests for further employment with HRSDC. Coming just five weeks after Mr. Hughes\u2019 second request for help with his depression the closing paragraph is somewhat incredulous: \u201cI would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the services which you have provided while employed by Human Resources and Social Development, and to wish you well in any future undertakings. Should you have any questions about your employment or benefits, please contact your current Team Leader.\u201d Copies of the termination letter were sent to Jim Quinn, Service Delivery Manager of the CEP project, Victoria, and Elizabeth Li, Human Resources Advisor, Edmonton.\n[80] Ms. Milne\u2019s participation in this management action is particularly questionable because it was contrary to the opinion of Human Resources Consultant Caleigh Miller who stated, in part, that \u201c... Depression is a medical condition which needs to be treated along with a medical professional.\u201d It was a mistake on Ms. Milne\u2019s part to ignore the magnitude of Ms. Miller\u2019s advice, and the seriousness of Mr. Hughes\u2019s disability, a mistake that was compounded by management\u2019s wilful zeal to get rid of him.\nIV. Conclusions [81] HRSDC\u2019s witnesses rationalized the fact that Mr. Hughes was not granted a third extension of his CEP employment, or deployment to another department, by asserting that it was a reasonable exercise of managerial authority with its quintessence of the imprimatur, the \u201cright fit.\u201d I conclude that an HRSDC management determination whether a qualified applicant for employment or deployment is the \u201cright fit,\u201d or not, is an intangible process, subjective rather than objective, and may be coloured by feelings or opinions.\n[82] The CHRA requires that an employer must continue to employ a worker who becomes disabled. Once a disability is identified, an employer must engage in continuing attempts to accommodate the employee with work that he\/she is able to perform while in a disabled state, to a point at which the employer experiences undue hardship. It is only then that employment may be appropriately terminated.\n[83] With full knowledge that Mr. Hughes was disabled by depression and that he had requested work that would accommodate his episodic depression, and scornful of their duties under the CHRA to continue his employment, at least until the full extent of his disability was determined, HRSDC\u2019s management wilfully disregarded their duty under the CHRA and summarily terminated Mr. Hughes\u2019 employment.\n[84] Considering the entirety of the evidence presented by HRSDC, I conclude that it did not rebut the complainant\u2019s prima facie case.\nV. Decision [85] I find that Mr. Hughes was subjected to a course of conduct that was a discriminatory practice, namely that HRSDC, knowing that Mr. Hughes suffered from a disability, wilfully refused to continue to employ him contrary to s. 7(a) of the CHRA.\n[86] I find that the respondent did not subject Mr. Hughes to retaliation or threats of retaliation for filing the foregoing complaint against it.\nVI. Remedy A. Pain and Suffering [87] Section 53(2) (e) of the CHRA provides that a complainant may be compensated up to $20,000 for any pain and suffering that he experienced as a victim of the discriminatory practice.\n[88] As a federal government agency, HRSDC has a paramount duty as an employer to deal promptly and effectively with a disabled employee. By failing to do so and then terminating his employment HRSDC exacerbated Mr. Hughes\u2019 state of anxiety and depression.\n[89] In these circumstances I order HRSDC to pay the maximum of $20,000 to Mr. Hughes for his pain and suffering.\nB. Special Compensation [90] Section 53 (3) of the CHRA provides that the Tribunal may order a respondent to pay up to $20,000 in compensation to the victim if the respondent is found to have engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly.\n[91] I conclude that it was wilful conduct for HRSDC to refuse to continue Mr. Hughes\u2019 employment and deal with Mr. Hughes\u2019 disability.\n[92] In the circumstances, I order HRSDC to pay $10,000 to Mr. Hughes in special compensation.\nC. Interest [93] Under s. 53 (4) of the CHRA simple interest is payable with respect to compensation for pain and suffering, and special compensation, calculated on a yearly basis from the date of the complaint, at a rate equivalent to the Bank Rate (monthly series) set by the Bank of Canada.\nSigned by\nWallace G.

Lustig\nDate:\nOctober 12, 2012\nCitation: 2012 CHRT 23\nI. Context\n[1] The Complainants filed a human rights complaint alleging that the inequitable funding of child welfare services on First Nations reserves amounted to discrimination on the basis of race and national ethnic origin, contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RCS 1985, c. H-6 (the Act). In light of the uniqueness and importance of this case and the aboriginal community\u2019s interest in being able to observe the proceedings, the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (\u201cAPTN\u201d) requested, in a letter dated October 22, 2009, permission from the Tribunal to film the complaint proceedings including opening and closing statements, testimony of witnesses, questions, objections and arguments. The Tribunal denied this request in a decision dated May 28, 2010, (2010 CHRT 16) on the basis that allowing camera access would be detrimental to the fairness of the hearing and could undermine the integrity of the proceedings. APTN subsequently filed an application for judicial review of this decision. On March 14, 2011, the Tribunal rendered a decision (2011 CHRT 4) granting a motion brought by the Respondent for the dismissal of the complaint on the ground that the issues raised in the complaint were beyond the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction (the \u201cjurisdictional motion\u201d). This decision was also subsequently the subject of an application for judicial review before the Federal Court.\n[2] On June 3, 2011, the Federal Court rendered its decision on the issue of APTN\u2019s request for camera access to the Tribunal proceedings (2011 FC 810). The Court found that the Tribunal\u2019s decision 2010 CHRT 16 was made without regard to the material before it and was unreasonable when measured against the available record. The Court concluded that the decision fell short of the standard of justification, transparency and intelligibility required by Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick,[2008] 1 S.C.R. 190,2008 SCC 9, and allowed APTN\u2019s application for judicial review. However, in light of the Tribunal\u2019s decision 2011 CHRT 4, in which it was held that it had no jurisdiction to consider the underlying complaint, the matter of the re-determination of the decision not to grant camera access was deferred until the judicial determination of the jurisdictional motion was resolved.\n[3] On April 18, 2012, the Federal Court rendered its decision, reported at 2012 FC 445, setting aside the Tribunal\u2019s 2011 CHRT 4 decision and remitting the matter to a differently constituted panel of the Tribunal for re-determination in accordance with its reasons. On July 10, 2012, Vice-Chairperson and Acting Chairperson Gupta appointed a panel of three members to hear the complaint.\n[4] On August 24, 2012, following the Federal Court\u2019s decision 2012 FC 445 which resolved the jurisdictional motion, the Tribunal proceeded with the re-determination of the motion to grant camera access in accordance with the Federal Court\u2019s reasons in 2011 FC 810. In its decision, reported at 2012 CHRT 18, the Tribunal ruled that camera access must be allowed during the proceedings in accordance with operating guidelines that had yet to be defined.\n[5] The proposed operating guidelines submitted by APTN in its original 2009 request were discussed in a case management conference with the parties and APTN on September 26, 2012. During the case management conference, contention arose with regard to the Respondent\u2019s proposal for the addition of letter \u2018(q)\u2019 to the guidelines. The proposed amendment read as follows:\n(q) No witness testimony will be recorded or broadcast. This applies to the questioning and answering on direct examination, cross-examination or any other participation of the witness within the hearing room;\n[6] Upon receipt of the proposed amendment, the Panel requested that the parties provide the Tribunal with their views on the addition of guideline \u2018(q)\u2019 in the hope of reaching a consensus. Unfortunately, the parties and APTN were unable to agree on the terms of this proposed guideline and, following short deliberations, the Tribunal rendered the present ruling to the parties orally.\n[7] In his decision, reported at 2011 FC 810, Justice Lutfy ruled on the issue raised by the Attorney General concerning evidence that some of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses had expressed concern about their testimony being recorded and broadcast due to the risk of selective editing along with the impact on possible exclusion orders and the impact on witnesses. The Federal Court Judge ruled that the Tribunal had failed to consider whether these concerns over camera access had been dealt with in the case law in R. v. Pilarinos, 2001 BCSC 1332, R. v. Fleet, (1994), 137 NSR (2d) 156 (SC) and Andreen v. Dairy Producers Co-operative Ltd. (No. 2), (1994), 22 CHRR D\/80, and whether these cases were applicable to the facts in this matter. The Judge gave, as an example of this, that there was no evidence that exclusion orders had been issued or were contemplated, or that this issue could not be dealt with if and when it arose.\n[8] In examining whether these cases were indeed applicable to the case at hand, the Federal Court Judge stated:\nII. Analysis\n[\u2026] there was no evidence before the tribunal that the privacy interests at stake in the case at bar were similar to the privacy interests at stake in Pilarinos, Fleet, and Andreen. In Andreen, the privacy concern was that \u201cthere is a distinction between disclosing potentially intimate details of one\u2019s life in a hearing room where the public attend, on the one hand, and having those disclosures broadcast throughout the province, and perhaps throughout the country, over a television network, on the other hand\u201d (para. 14) [emphasis added].\nThe evidence before the tribunal was that the human rights complaint would not require personal information about a complainant or respondent to be disclosed. None of the proposed witnesses were survivors of the child welfare system. No personal respondents were named in the complaint. The government witnesses would be testifying about policies and decisions made regarding the provision of child welfare services. Information about these policies and decisions is already publicly available through several reports, including a National Policy Review (2000) prepared by the Assembly of First Nations and First Nations child and family service agency representatives in partnership with the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, a 2008 Report from the Auditor General of Canada, a 2009 Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, and the 2008 Canadian Incidence Study on Reported Child Abuse Neglect. The evidence before the tribunal was that the testimony and submissions would focus on widely known public policies.\n[9] Having considered the Federal Court Judge\u2019s reasons, the parties\u2019 submissions on this issue, and the guidelines proposed by APTN, the Tribunal is of the view that the Respondent\u2019s proposed blanket exclusion of the recording and broadcasting of all witness testimony is unnecessary and goes against the Federal Court\u2019s 2011 decision. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the guidelines as they now stand, address the Respondent\u2019s concerns regarding witness testimony. Paragraph l) of the guidelines addresses the issue of broadcasting and witness exclusion. This paragraph reads as follows:\nIn the event of witness exclusion, the testimony of both the excluded witness(es) and those present in the hearing room may be recorded but shall not be broadcasted until the testimony of the last of those witnesses has been heard.\n[10] Furthermore, taking into consideration witnesses\u2019 concerns regarding the fact that they might potentially be obliged to divulge information of a personal nature that would subsequently be broadcasted on national television, the Tribunal has replaced the Respondent\u2019s proposed letter \u2018(q)\u2019 with the following guideline:\nThere shall be no broadcasting of the testimony of a witness who has objected to the broadcasting of his or her testimony on the basis that it contains information that is personal in nature once this objection has been upheld by the Tribunal upon examining the witness\u2019 testimony.\n[11] In applying this guideline, the Tribunal will allow the recording of the witness testimony and subsequently, rule on whether the testimony contained information that is personal in nature so as to warrant upholding the objection and prohibiting the broadcasting. In establishing whether the objection should be upheld, the Tribunal will determine whether the information disclosed is \u201cpersonal information\u201d, such as defined under section 3 of the Privacy Act, and will balance the right to privacy with the public\u2019s right to access, as well as the Canadian Human Rights Act\u2019s underlying purpose to promote human rights. The issue of objections to the broadcasting of witness testimony will be, in this manner, dealt with if and when it arises in the course of the proceedings.\nIII. Ruling\n[12] The Tribunal will not add the Respondent\u2019s proposed letter \u2018(q)\u2019 to the guidelines for camera access. Letter \u2018(q) of the Guidelines will, rather, read as follows:\nThere shall be no broadcasting of the testimony of a witness who has objected to the broadcasting of his or her testimony on the basis that it contains information that is personal in nature once this objection has been upheld by the Tribunal upon examining the witness\u2019 testimony.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nPanel Chairperson\nSigned by\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nTribunal Member\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Lustig\nDate: October 16, 2012\nCitation: 2012 CHRT 24\nI. Context [1] The Complainants have filed a human rights complaint alleging that the inequitable funding of child welfare services on First Nations reserves amounts to discrimination on the basis of race and national ethnic origin, contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RCS 1985, c. H-6 (the Act). On December 22, 2009, the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada (\u201cFNCFCS\u201d) served a notice of motion to amend the complaint to include allegations of retaliation, contrary to section 14.1 of the Act (the motion to amend the complaint). On February 7, 2011, Dr. Cindy Blackstock, Executive Director of the Caring Society and FNCFCS, filed a second human rights complaint alleging that the Respondent had engaged in retaliation. This complaint is currently at the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) stage and has yet to be referred to the Tribunal.\n[2] In view of the Respondent\u2019s December 21, 2009 motion for the dismissal of the complaint on the ground that the issues raised were beyond the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction (the jurisdictional motion) and the Tribunal\u2019s March 14, 2011 decision reported at 2011 CHRT 4, granting this motion, the Tribunal never ruled on the motion to amend the complaint. The Tribunal\u2019s 2011 CHRT 4 decision was subsequently the subject of an application for judicial review before the Federal Court and, on April 18, 2012, the Federal Court set aside the Tribunal\u2019s decision and remitted the matter to a differently constituted panel of the Tribunal for re-determination in accordance with its reasons (2012 FC 445).\n[3] On July 10, 2012, a panel of three Tribunal members, composed of members Marchildon, Lustig and B\u00e9langer was appointed to hear this case (2012 CHRT 16). In a letter dated July 16, 2012, counsel for FNCFCS brought to the Tribunal\u2019s attention the December 22, 2009 motion to amend the complaint, which is the subject of the present ruling.\nII. The allegations of retaliation [4] The Complainants contend that the Respondent has retaliated against Dr. Blackstock since they filed the initial complaint. The Complainants allege that on December 9, 2009, Dr. Blackstock was invited by the Chiefs of Ontario to attend a meeting with David McArthur in INAC\u2019s office regarding child welfare funding in Ontario. She was one of five individuals who had been invited to attend this meeting by the Chiefs of Ontario as a technical aid. Upon her arrival, David McArthur told Dr. Blackstock that he was aware that she had a number of \u201cissues\u201d regarding child welfare, including a human rights complaint, and that he would rather meet with her another time. Mr. McArthur made it clear that he would refuse to meet with the Chiefs of Ontario if Dr. Blackstock were present. Dr. Blackstock was asked to wait outside the meeting room, in the reception area, during the meeting. No other individual invited to provide technical support to the Chiefs was excluded from the meeting. Dr. Blackstock wrote to Minister Chuck Strahl on December 15, 2009, detailing the incident and asking for an explanation as to why she was excluded from the meeting.\n[5] According to the Complainants, this was not the first time that Dr. Blackstock had been denied the opportunity to provide support to agencies seeking her expertise. A similar incident happened in 2008 when the British Columbia Children and Family Services Association (\u201cBCCFSA\u201d) invited Dr. Blackstock to provide them with support during the negotiation of an enhanced funding model with INAC officials. The officials refused to meet with BCCFSA if Dr. Blackstock were present because she had filed a complaint against INAC.\n[6] In addition, Dr. Blackstock contends that, since December 2009, she has become aware that INAC and Department of Justice officials have monitored her personal and private Facebook page. Internal INAC email correspondence obtained through various Access to Information and Privacy Act requests links the surveillance of her personal Facebook page and Twitter account with trying to discover \u201cother motives\u201d for the filing of the Complainants\u2019 human rights complaint. Dr. Blackstock explains that these transgressions into her personal life constitute a form of intimidation which might impact the fairness of the process before the Tribunal. The Complainants submit that prior to filing the human rights complaint, Dr. Blackstock was regularly consulted by INAC officials and worked collaboratively with the department on studies and projects in order to help improve the outcome of First Nations children in care.\nIII. The parties\u2019 position The Complainants\u2019 position [7] The Complainants submit that Rule 3(2) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (the Rules of Procedure) confers to the Tribunal considerable discretion in the manner in which it disposes of motions and specifies that amendments to complaints can be made at any time prior to the commencement of proceedings in order to promote expeditiousness and the procedural rights of the parties: Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canadian Telephone Employees Assn., 2002 FCT 776, at paragraphs 30-32. The test to be applied in determining whether to allow the amendment of the complaint was stated by the Tribunal in Virk v. Bell Canada, 2004 CHRT 10, at paragraph 8: \u201cwhether the allegations of retaliation are by their nature linked, at least by the complainant, to the allegations giving rise to the original complaint and disclose a tenable claim for retaliation\u201d. In coming to this conclusion, the Tribunal \u201cshould not embark on a substantive review of the merits of the amendment\u201d; rather, it should grant the amendment unless it is plain and obvious that the allegations have no chance of success: Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2004 CHRT 02, at paragraph 6. While the Tribunal in Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 1, at paragraphs 10 and 12, acknowledged that because the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over a complaint originates from a referral by the Commission, there must be certain limits on the scope of the amendments; this constraint is \u201conly one aspect of the matter\u201d as \u201chuman rights tribunals have adopted a liberal approach to amendments\u201d that is in keeping with the remedial nature of the CHRA.\n[8] The Complainants argue that the allegations of retaliation are clearly linked to the Caring Society\u2019s complaint. Indeed, Mr. McArthur expressly stated that Dr. Blackstock was not permitted in the meeting room because of the Caring Society\u2019s human rights complaint. Regardless of Mr. McArthur\u2019s motivation in making these statements, a reasonable complainant would have perceived this adverse treatment as retaliation: Witwicky v. Canadian National Railway, 2007 CHRT 25. In addition, the Complainants submit that the Respondent will suffer no prejudice if the amendment is made to add the allegations of retaliation as it has been aware for some time that the Complainants\u2019 claims to have been subjected to retaliation and was given the opportunity to respond to these allegations shortly after the incident occurred. Furthermore, for the Tribunal to render a decision on the allegations of retaliation separately would cause a duplication of proceedings, involving the same parties, overlapping evidence and interrelated issues. The Complainants submit that any prejudice to the Respondent as a result of amending the complaint to include these allegations of retaliation would be offset by the prejudice to the Complainant arising from the artificial separation of these related allegations into multiple proceedings. Should the motion to amend the complaint be granted, the Complainants agree to jointly ask the Commission to place the retaliation complaint currently before the Commission in abeyance, pending a determination on the merits of the amended complaint.\nThe Respondent\u2019s position [9] The Respondent is of the view that to amend the complaint now to include allegations of retaliation would disregard the complaint process established under the Act and deprive the parties of this procedure. The retaliation complaint is currently under investigation by the Commission. During this investigation, the Respondent will have its first opportunity to respond to the merits of the complaint and provide its version of the events. Only once the Commission has completed its investigation, taking into account the evidence submitted, will it make a decision to either dismiss the complaint or refer it to the Tribunal. The Respondent is of the view that if the motion to amend the complaint is granted, all of these steps will be bypassed, which would result in denying the Respondent an opportunity to respond to the complaint, thereby compromising its right to procedural fairness at the investigation stage.\n[10] The Respondent also submits that amending the complaint would result in the expansion of the scope of the complaint and supplant the role of the Commission, thereby prejudicing the Respondent. According to the Respondent, the underlying nature of the two complaints in this case is different as the original complaint concerns allegations of funding for child welfare services for First Nations children on reserve and the complaint of retaliation deals with allegations arising from personal interactions between the Executive Director of the Caring Society and federal government officials. The Respondent is of the view that there is an insufficient nexus between the complaints to warrant amending the initial complaint at this stage of the proceedings and that the Tribunal should allow the Commission to make a full and informed decision on whether an inquiry by the Tribunal into the retaliation complaint is warranted in these circumstances.\nThe Commission\u2019s position [11] The Commission contends that to dismiss the motion to amend the complaint would permit a respondent to engage in retaliation against representatives of charitable organizations that have filed complaints on behalf of victims. The Commission is of the view that the Act must be interpreted in a liberal and purposive manner so as to protect the officer or agent of a charitable organization which has become identified with a complaint: Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec v. Syndicat des employ\u00e9-e-s de techniques professionnelles et de bureau d\u2019Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, section locale 2000, 2008 SCC 43.\n[12] Section 14.1 of the Act states that \u201cit is a discriminatory practice [\u2026] to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint [\u2026]\u201d. In the present case, by signing the original complaint, Dr. Blackstock is the \u201cindividual who filed the complaint\u201d and should therefore have the same protection from retaliation as the First Nations children on behalf of whom she signed. Any other interpretation would result in everyone having protection from alleged retaliation except parties who file representative complaints on behalf of the victims. Moreover, the Commission is of the view that the evidence suggests that Dr. Blackstock has been identified as the Complainant by the Respondent.\nIV. Analysis and Decision [13] It is trite law that the Tribunal has the ability to amend a complaint. The Federal Court in Canada (Attorney General) v. Parent, 2006 FC 1313, affirmed this principle at paragraph 30 of the decision in the following manner:\nThe Tribunal enjoys considerable discretion with respect to the examination of complaints under subsections 48.9(1) and (2) and sections 49 and 50 of the Act. As for the exercise of that discretion in regard to an amendment request, Mr. Justice Robert D\u00e9cary wrote in Canderel Ltd. v. Canada (C.A.), 1993 CanLII 2990 (FCA), [1994] 1 F.C. 3, 1993 CanLII 2990 (F.C.A.), that \u201c [\u2026] the general rule is that an amendment should be allowed at any stage of an action for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties, provided, notably, that the allowance would not result in an injustice to the other party not capable of being compensated by an award of costs and that it would serve the interests of justice.\u201d\n[14] As to the issue of amending a complaint so as to consider allegations of retaliation in the same proceeding as the allegations of discrimination which gave rise to the initial complaint, the Tribunal previously addressed this issue in Kavanagh v. C.S.C. (May 31, 1999), T505\/2298 (C.H.R.T.). At paragraph 9 of this decision, the Chairperson of the Tribunal adopted the reasoning of the Ontario Board of Inquiry in Entrop v. Imperial Oil Limited (1994) 23 C.H.R.R. D\/186, stating that it \u201cwould be impractical, inefficient and unfair to require individuals to make allegations of reprisals only through the format of separate proceedings.\u201d In deciding whether to grant the amendment, the Tribunal must determine whether \u201cthe allegations of retaliation are by their nature linked, at least by the complainant, to the allegations giving rise to the original complaint and disclose a tenable claim for retaliation\u201d: Virk v. Bell Canada, 2004 CHRT 10, at paragraph 7; See also Fowler v. Flicka Gymnastics Club, 31 C.H.R.R. D\/397 (B.C.H.R.C.), Cook v. Onion Lake First Nation, [2002] C.H.R.R. no. 12, at paragraph 17 and Tran, Cam-Linh (Holly) v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2010 CHRT 31, at paragraph 18.\n[15] In addition to establishing a link between the complaint and the amendment, the Tribunal must also examine the prejudice that the Respondent could suffer in allowing the Complainant to amend its complaint. As stated in Parent, supra, at paragraph 40:\nThe issue of prejudice is the predominant factor to be considered in such circumstances: the amendment must not be granted if it results in a prejudice to the other party. In this case, even though the complaint could have been amended at an earlier stage of the proceedings, nothing in the evidence indicates that the Canadian Forces were unable to prepare themselves and argue their position on the issues raised. The amendment caused no prejudice to the Canadian Forces, and in the circumstances, the balance of convenience favours the position of Alain Parent.\n[16] In the present case, the panel is of the view that to proceed to a hearing on the initial complaint and then subsequently hold a separate hearing to address the allegations of retaliation would thwart the fair administration of justice and hinder the panel\u2019s ability to conduct the proceedings in the most informal and expeditious manner, as the requirements of natural justice and rules of procedure allow as mandated by paragraph 48.9(1) of the Act. Moreover, the Complainants\u2019 allegations of retaliation emanate from the same factual matrix as the initial complaint as both complaints share the same Complainants and the retaliatory events alleged are linked to the filing of the initial complaint against the Respondent.\n[17] Furthermore, the panel is of the view that the Respondent will not be prejudiced by the amendment as it has had ample time and will have ample opportunity to respond to the allegations of retaliation made by the Complainants. To hear both the initial complaint and the allegations of retaliation in the same proceeding, as opposed to creating an artificial separation of the allegations in multiple proceedings, is favorable to all parties and is in the interest of justice.\n[18] For the foregoing reasons, the motion to amend the complaint is granted. The Respondent will be granted an opportunity to amend its Statement of particulars by way of a request made to the Tribunal and other parties will be able to file a reply. Upon reception of the Respondent`s request, the panel Chair will set timelines for the filing of the amended particulars.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nPanel Chairperson\nSigned by\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nTribunal Member\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Background & Preliminary Objections [1] On July 29, 2011, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) requested that the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) institute an inquiry into the complaint of Norm Murray (the Complainant) against the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Respondent) pursuant to subsection 49(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the Act].\n[2] On April 10, 2012, the Commission filed a motion for an order of production by the Respondent of certain documents in its possession and\/or control. On April 24, 2012, the Complainant filed its own motion for an order of production of certain documents by the Respondent. In its submissions in response to the motions for disclosure, the Respondent filed the affidavits of Antonella Gullia and Angela Henry. Both the Commission and the Complainant objected to the admissibility of the Respondent\u2019s affidavits in their replies to the Respondent\u2019s submissions.\n[3] On June 4, 2012, the Respondent brought a motion for an order dismissing the complaint. In support of its motion to dismiss, the Respondent also relies on the affidavits of Ms. Gullia and Ms. Henry. In response to the motion to dismiss, the Complainant again objected to the admissibility of the Respondent\u2019s affidavits.\n[4] On its part, the Respondent objects to the filing of exhibit F of the affidavit of France Saikali. Ms. Saikali\u2019s affidavit was filed by the Commission in support of its reply submissions on the motion for disclosure.\nII. Positions of the Parties [5] According to the Commission, the Respondent\u2019s affidavits are inadmissible. The Commission submits that Ms. Gullia\u2019s affidavit deals mainly with the Commission\u2019s process and decision from the filing of the complaint in 2004 up until the time it was referred to the Tribunal. The Commission claims this discussion is irrelevant to the issue of disclosure and that it appears that the Respondent is taking issue with the Commission\u2019s decision. With regard to Ms. Henry\u2019s affidavit, the Commission argues that it contains opinion evidence from an unqualified witness and there has not been an opportunity for the Commission to challenge the Respondent as to her bona fides to give opinion evidence. The Commission adds that the affidavit of Ms. Henry contains details of Treasury Board policy with regard to employment equity, which has no relevance to the current Tribunal proceedings.\n[6] The Complainant adopts the submissions of the Commission on the admissibility of the Respondent\u2019s affidavits. With specific regard to the affidavit of Ms. Henry, the Complainant submits that the assertions made regarding the policies and practices of the Treasury Board and other government departments in relation to employment equity are irrelevant to the motions. Furthermore, Ms. Henry has not been qualified as an expert and is not in a position to provide opinion evidence to the Tribunal.\n[7] The Respondent replied to the Commission and Complainant\u2019s arguments regarding the admissibility of the affidavits as part of its reply to its motion to dismiss. According to the Commission, this amounts to a sur-reply to the Commission and Complainant\u2019s reply submissions on the motion for disclosure and, therefore, is an improper reply submission. As a result, the Commission requests that paragraphs 5-7 of the Respondent\u2019s reply submissions on its motion to dismiss be stricken. According to the Respondent, it included its arguments relating to the objection to the affidavits in its reply on the motion to dismiss, because the Complainant raised the issue once again in his response to the motion to dismiss.\n[8] With regard to the affidavit of Ms. Gullia, the Respondent submits that it does not seek review of the Commission\u2019s decisions and this is not the purpose of the evidence. Rather, the Respondent submits that the evidence is relevant to establishing the scope of the complaint before the Tribunal. With regard to the affidavit of Ms. Henry, who is a Director at the Treasury Board Secretariat, the Respondent submits that the Treasury Board is the employer of the Complainant, and it bears the reporting responsibilities for all government departments listed in Schedule II of the Financial Administration Act. Therefore, the Treasury Board\u2019s position on the potential release of employment equity information is relevant to the issues before the Tribunal. The Respondent adds that to the extent that the affidavit contains opinion evidence, it is admissible either on the basis that lay witnesses may provide opinion evidence where they have the requisite experiential capacity to opine on the relevant matter, or because the Affiant\u2019s qualifications are such that she is qualified to give an expert opinion on the particular point.\n[9] With regard to the affidavit of Ms. Saikali, the Respondent objects to the filing of the unredacted copy of the Commission\u2019s Supplementary Investigation Report. The Respondent has filed the same report, but in redacted form. According to the Respondent, the portions of the report which it redacted contain the information which it objects to being disclosed in the motion for disclosure. The Respondent therefore asks that the Tribunal not permit the filing of this portion of the Commission\u2019s materials.\nIII. Ruling [10] Pursuant to subsection 48.9(1) of the Act, \u201c[p]roceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow\u201d. Furthermore, subsection 50(3)(c) of the Act grants the Tribunal broad powers to \u201c\u2026receive and accept any evidence and other information, whether on oath or by affidavit or otherwise, that the member or panel sees fit, whether or not that evidence or information is or would be admissible in a court of law\u201d.\n[11] The Commission and Complainant objected to the Respondent\u2019s affidavit evidence in their respective replies to the motions for disclosure. In support of its motion to dismiss, the Respondent relies on the same affidavit evidence. In response to the motion to dismiss, the Complainant once again objected to the admissibility of the affidavit evidence. The Respondent replied to those arguments in its reply submissions on the motion to dismiss. Given that the objection to the affidavit evidence was again raised in the context of the motion to dismiss, and that the Complainant relied on the same arguments it made in the context of the motion for disclosure - namely, its reliance on the submissions of the Commission - it was not improper for the Respondent to reply to the Complainant and Commission\u2019s arguments in the fashion it did. Therefore, I am not prepared to strike paragraphs 5-7 of the Respondent\u2019s reply to the motion to dismiss.\n[12] With regard to the affidavits of Ms. Gullia and Ms. Henry, neither the Commission nor the Complainant claims any prejudice or unfairness by the filing of these affidavits. Rather, they claim the information contained in the affidavits is irrelevant and contains opinion evidence from an unqualified witness. Given the informality of Tribunal proceedings and the broad powers to accept information and evidence in subsection 50(3)(c), I am not inclined to strike the affidavits completely. Rather, I will consider the objections of the Commission and Complainant in weighing the value of the information presented in the affidavits.\n[13] With regard to exhibit F of the affidavit of Ms. Saikali, the Commission relies on the Supplementary Investigation Report to support its claim that, during the investigation of the complaint the Respondent provided statistical data on representation for 2003-2004, it has waived any claims to confidentiality of the information. It is not necessary for the Tribunal to view the unredacted statistical data in the Supplementary Investigation Report for the Commission to make out this argument. Suffice to say, statistical data on representation for 2003-2004 was examined as part of the Supplementary Investigation Report. At this stage of the proceedings, before having determined the motions for disclosure and the Respondent\u2019s claim to confidentiality over the statistical information, it is not appropriate to consider the unredacted version of the Supplementary Investigation Report. Therefore, exhibit F of the affidavit of Ms. Saikali is sealed for the purposes of these motions and until such time as the motions are decided the Tribunal will rely on the redacted version of the Supplementary Investigation Report provided by the Respondent.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Context [1] The complainant, Chris Hughes, filed against the respondent, Transport Canada, a complaint of discrimination under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act alleging that the respondent refused to hire him owing to a disability he disclosed to the respondent. The complaint relates to various job applications submitted by him to the respondent, namely an application for the Marine Security Analyst Position (PM-04) in fall 2005, as well as three job applications he submitted for the positions of Regional Security and Emergency Preparedness Inspector, which he applied for in September 2005, of Regional Transportation and Emergency Preparedness Inspector, which he subsequently applied for in July 2006, and finally, of Transportation Security Inspector, which he applied for in March 2007.\n[2] In all of those cases, the applications were rejected without any real or reasonable excuse from the respondent in his view.\n[3] For the purpose of having a better understanding of this case, the Tribunal refers to the provisions of section 7(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (R.S., 1985), c. H-6, which reads as follows:\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[4] Also, in his arguments, the complainant maintains that the respondent allegedly discriminated against him pursuant to the provisions of section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which reads as follows:\n14.1 It is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n[5] In that respect, the complainant\u2019s ambition was to pursue a career within the federal government through the various job offers referred to in paragraph 1 above.\n[6] With respect to the proceedings brought by the complainant, a conference call in preparation for the hearing of the complainant\u2019s complaint was held on May 28, 2012, between the Tribunal and the parties.\n[7] At that point in time, after some discussion between the parties, it was agreed that the parties would plead in writing by way of two motions filed in the matter of Complainant Chris Hughes, that is, a motion by the complainant dated May 11, 2012, in order to obtain from the respondent, Transport Canada, certain documents that would make it possible for him to establish that the complainant was discriminated against by respondent Transport Canada and also, a second motion dated May 15, 2012, filed by the Canadian Human Rights Commission, which would also make it possible to obtain, from the respondent, Transport Canada, a series of documents that would allow the Canadian Human Rights Commission to also establish whether the respondent acted in a discriminatory manner, contrary to sections 7 and 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nII. The Motions A. Motion of Complainant Chris Hughes [8] In his motion, dated May 11, 2012, the complainant asks that the Tribunal order the respondent to produce the following documents:\n(c) The selection board's completed Rating Guides for each candidate placed on the Eligibility List for the PM-04 Marine Security Analyst position (selection process 05-MOT-OC-VAN-005187; reference no. 90932RF73), including but not limited to the interview notes and reference checks in support of the selection board's assessment of each candidate in the \u201cPersonal Suitability\u201d category;\n(d) The application packages of each candidate placed on the Eligibility List in the PM-04 Marine Security Analyst competition (selection process 05-MOT-OC-VAN-005187; reference no. 90932RF73);\n(e) The curriculum vitae of the successful applicants to the TI-06 Regional Security and Emergency Inspector position (selection process 05-MOT-OC-VAN-005467; reference no. MOT91286RF73);\n(f) The curriculum vitae of the successful applicants to the TI-06 Regional Transportation and Emergency Preparedness Inspector position (selection process 06-MOT-OC-VAN-008455; reference no. MOT06J-007605-000099); and\n(g) The curriculum vitae of the successful applicants to the TI-06 Transportation Security Inspector position (selection process 07-MOT-EA-VAN-60712; reference no. MOT07J-007605-000202) including all material supporting each candidate's ratings, including but not limited to interview notes and reference checks.\n[9] In his motion, the complainant indicates that the required documents would be pertinent to establishing that the respondent refused to employ him contrary to the provisions of section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act owing to a disability the complainant allegedly disclosed to the respondent in the process of his applications. The claimant alleges having previously suffered from depression and anxiety, following the harassment and discrimination from his former employer, that is, the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) in January 2005 and the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) in February 2005, against him. Accordingly, the respondent allegedly refused to employ him following the disclosure of his disabilities, contrary to the provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[10] Also in his motion, the claimant refers as well to the fact that the respondent allegedly refused to employ the complainant by determining that the complainant failed to meet one of the qualification criteria, namely, to be detail-oriented. The complainant, therefore, reproaches the respondent for not having employed him not only owing to the failure noted above, with respect to the fact that he was not detail-oriented, but also owing to his disability, which he disclosed to the respondent following the complaints the complainant filed against the CBSA and the CRA, which were disclosed to the respondent. In that regard, the Tribunal refers to paragraphs 35 and 36 of the motion for disclosure of evidence filed by the complainant and dated May 11, 2012.\n[11] To conclude, the complainant indicates that the documents he referred to in his motion are directly related to the complaints filed by the claimant.\n[12] In its written response dated June 15, 2012, the respondent, Transport Canada, argues the following against the complainant\u2019s motion:\n(a) The documents required by the complainant would not be required under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, and more particularly section 7(a) of the Act, as according to the respondent, such a section would not make it possible to conduct a comparative analysis in terms of the reasons for refusing to employ an individual during a competition in this regard.\n(b) Subsequently, the respondent refers to the fact that the information sought by the complainant would be protected by the Privacy Act, 1985, c. P-21, and accordingly the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal would be subject to said Act.\n[13] According to the respondent, the provisions of section 7(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act would not make it possible to conduct a comparative analysis as required by the respondent in its complaint and that was not Parliament\u2019s intention in this regard.\n[14] Moreover, the respondent indicates in its written response that the information sought by the complainant is all protected under section 3 of the Privacy Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. P-21, and it supports that claim by referring to Warman v. Lemire, 2008 CHRT 16.\n[15] In response to the respondent\u2019s written response on the complainant\u2019s motion, the complainant reiterates to the Tribunal his request for documents. The complainant notes that section 7(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act does not prohibit a comparative analysis of various candidates who were part of a job competition and in that regard, he refers to Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 53 (Mowat).\n[16] Furthermore, the complainant continues to maintain that the documents sought are relevant to the review of the complaints filed by the complainant against the respondent.\n[17] Subsequently, the complainant indicates that the Privacy Act does not prohibit the production of documents required in his motion and refers more particularly to section 8(b) of the Act, which states that the Privacy Act does not prohibit the production of documents where required under an Act of Parliament, in this case, the Canadian Human Rights Act (Privacy Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. P-21, section 8(3).\n[18] Finally, in his response to the respondent, the complainant also refers to the fact that the documents sought are in reference to allegations he filed in a complaint under section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[19] More specifically, the documents sought would allow him to establish circumstantial evidence of the respondent\u2019s discriminatory treatment through the use of reprisals against the complainant in accordance with the provisions of section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nAnalysis of the law and facts on the Motion filed by the Complainant Chris Hughes for the production of documents [20] After having carefully read the various memorandums provided by the parties and having reviewed the relevant provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act as well as the Rules of Procedure established by the Tribunal, more particularly the provisions of Rule 6(1)(b) and (e) of said rules of procedure, the Tribunal considers that the motion filed by the complainant to obtain the documents sought should be granted considering that said documents sought by the complainant are relevant to instituting an inquiry into the complaints filed by the complainant against the respondent.\n[21] Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers that all information should be redacted (name, address, date of birth, sex, etc.) so as to ensure the security of confidential and personal information that may be transmitted by the respondent to the complainant.\n[22] With respect for the opinion expressed by the respondent in its written response of\nJune 15, 2012, the Tribunal does not consider that the provisions of section 7(a) of the CHRA prohibiting a comparative analysis of candidates in a competitive process as in the case at bar.\n[23] Also, the Tribunal is of the view that the provisions of the Privacy Act, R.S.C., do not prohibit the production of documents of the kind sought by the complainant in his motion, provided that the confidential nature of the applications submitted is protected.\n[24] In its analysis, the Tribunal refers to a recent decision on the subject matter in Leslie Palm v. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500, Richard Wilkinson and Cliff Willicome, 2012 CHRT 11 (CanLII).\n[25] In his decision, Member Susheel Gupta undertook an exhaustive analysis of the case law applicable to the production of documents, and, therefore, I refer to the same principles in this case, and I quote:\n[9] The right to a fair hearing requires that ''\u2026the affected person be informed of the case against him or her, and be permitted to respond to that case (Charkaoui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 SCC 9 (CanLII), 2007 SCC 9, at para. 53). In this regards, parties should be given an opportunity to address evidence prejudicial to their case and bring evidence to prove their position (see Ruby v. Canada (Solicitor General), 2002 SCC 75 (CanLII), 2002 SCC 75, at para. 40). In order to provide the parties with this opportunity, they require the full and ample disclosure of relevant information in the possession or care of the other party.\n[10] To make a determination as to whether documents should be disclosed, the Tribunal has identified the following three step process: (1) determine whether the information is ''likely to be relevant'', that is, the party seeking production of the information or documents must demonstrate a nexus between the information or documents sought and the issues in dispute; (2) without examining the documents, determine whether there is a compelling reason to maintain the privacy of the documents, and, (3) if the Tribunal is unable to resolve the matter without examining the material, then it should inspect the documents and decide whether the documents should be produced (see Day v. Canada (Dept. of National Defence), (December 6, 2002), T637\/1501 and T628\/1601 Ruling No. 3, at para. 7 (CHRT); and, Guay v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2004 CHRT 34 (CanLII), 2004 CHRT 34, at para. 44 [Guay]).\n[11] The Tribunal has recognized that a complainant has a right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to his or her medical records (see Beaudry v. Canada (Attorney General), (July 24, 2002), T694\/8201, Ruling No. 1, at para. 7 (CHRT) [Beaudry]; McAvinn v. Strait Crossing Bridge Ltd., (January 3, 2001), T558\/1600, Ruling No. 3, at para. 3 (CHRT) [McAvinn]). However, the right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to medical records may cease when that person puts his or her health in issue (see McAvinn at para. 4 (CHRT); Guay at para. 45; and, Communications Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada and Femmes-Action v. Bell Canada, 2005 CHRT 9 (CanLII), 2005 CHRT 9, at paras. 9-11). In cases where the Tribunal has ordered the disclosure of medical records, it has used the following procedures to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the information:\nVet the documents to determine which ones are in fact related to the medical condition in issue (see Guay; McAvinn; and, Beaudry); and\/or,\nPut conditions on who may see and copy the documents (see Shiv Chopra v. Health Canada, 2007 CHRT 10 (CanLII), 2007 CHRT 10; Micheline Montreuil v. Canadian Forces, 2005 CHRT 45 (CanLII), 2005 CHRT 45; and, Beaudry).\n[26] Also, in another decision of the Canadian Human Right Tribunal in Bushey v. Sharma, 2003 CHRT 5 [Bushey], decision dated February 11, 2003, former Member Athanasios D. Hadjis, referred to the test for relevance with respect to the guiding principle regarding disclosure:\nThe Respondent has taken issue with the fact that a copy of the minutes of settlement with the unions has not been disclosed to him. Although the Respondent is not represented by legal counsel and is acting on his own behalf, I understand him to be contending that he is entitled to have this document communicated to him, in accordance with Rule 6 (3) of the Tribunal's Interim Rules of Procedure. This rule, when read together with Rule 6 (1) (d), obliges a party to provide to other parties, copies of all documents in its possession which are relevant to any matter in issue in the case and for which no privilege is claimed. The test for relevance for these purposes has been expressed as being whether the document in question is \u201carguably relevant\u201d to the hearing.\n[Bushey at para. 4, footnotes omitted]\n[27] Bushey was also referred to in Member Edward P. Lustig\u2019s ruling on disclosure in Knowles, Carol, Godin, Rhoda, Cannon, Elizabeth v. Human Resources and Social Development Canada, 2011 CHRT 7.\n[28] Generally speaking, there has to be a rational connection between the documents sought and the issues in a motion insofar as the information sought must be arguably relevant and the disclosure of the document will be useful, is appropriate, is likely to contribute to advancing the debate and is based on an acceptable objective in the case. The retrieval of documents must be related to the dispute. (Smith & Nephew Inc. v. Glegg, 2005 SCC 31, see paragraph 23 of the decision.)\n[29] In its analysis, the Tribunal notes that the complainant seeks the production of various documents that would have been useful to a selection committee in verifying whether elements of discrimination existed in contravention of sections 7(a) and 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[30] The Tribunal also notes, without going into a detailed analysis of the probative value of said documents sought, that the documents would enable the complainant to build his discrimination case against the respondent.\n[31] The Tribunal considers that the elements sought possess relevance, and could be useful in the litigation between the complainant and the respondent under the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[32] In a decision that the Tribunal consulted as well, that is, that of Ray Davidson v. Health Canada, 2012, CHRT 1 (CanLII), a question similar to that under review was then reviewed by another Tribunal Member.\n[33] Indeed, in that decision, reference was also made to a request for the production of documents concerning the assessment of candidates in a selection process that had been the subject of two appeals to the Public Service Commission Appeal Board (PSCAB).\n[34] In that case, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal denied permission to produce such documents, considering that the PSCAB was a Tribunal with concurrent jurisdiction and, accordingly, there was no need to review the decisions of another Tribunal and to, therefore, litigate a second time what had already been decided by a different adjudicative forum.\n[35] The Tribunal finds that in the case of Complainant Hughes, a mere selection committee is not a valid adjudicative forum within the meaning of Ray Davidson v. Health Canada, 2012 CHRT 1 (CanLII) and Workers\u2019 Compensation Board v. Figliola, 2011 SCC 52 (see paragraph 9 in Ray Davidson).\n[36] Consequently, the Tribunal orders the production of the documents appearing in the motion of Complainant Hughes with the obliteration of all personal information of the various candidates who applied for the same positions as the complainant, including the name, address, date of birth and sex, as well as all other information making it possible to establish the identity of the other candidates.\nB. Motion of the Canadian Human Rights Commission [37] In a second motion filed by the Canadian Human Rights Commission on May 15, 2012, the Commission sought the production of two types of documents: the first type being documents of a non-confidential nature, whereas the second type of documents required by the Commission from the respondent were classified as privileged by the respondent.\n[38] The Tribunal will, therefore, examine in order each of the two series of documents required by the Commission.\nNon-privileged Documents [39] Thus, the Commission first requires the production of the following documents from the respondent:\nThis motion is for:\n1. An Order for production by the Respondent, Transport Canada, of all arguably relevant documents in its possession and\/or control, notably:\na) All documents or material of any kind whatsoever whether in digital form or otherwise concerning the phone call between Mr. Lavers and Mr. Hughes in February 2006, including, but not limited to documents pertaining to the discussions between Mr. Lavers and other selection board members and\/or Human Resources personnel regarding Mr. Hughes\u2019 references, his other complaints against other departments or agencies, or his disability; notes taken during reference checks by the selection board members, Human Resources personnel and\/or any other individuals.\nb) All documents or material of any kind whatsoever whether in digital form or otherwise pertaining to Mr. Hughes\u2019 emails of June 19, 2006 and November 29, 2006.\nc) All documents or material of any kind whatsoever whether in digital form or otherwise pertaining to the conference call of March 2, 2006 between the selection board members regarding Mr. Hughes\u2019 employment application and reference checks.\nd) All documents or material of any kind whatsoever whether in digital form or otherwise pertaining to Mr. Hughes\u2019 human rights complaints against other departments or agencies.\ne) All documents or material of any kind whatsoever whether in digital form or otherwise regarding the conference call of February 20, 2006 between Mr. Lavers and Sonya Wood, including, but not limited to an unredacted copy of her memo to file regarding her conversation with Mr. Lavers in February 2006.\n[40] The Tribunal notes that the Commission no longer requires subparagraph (f) of\nparagraph 1 of its motion with respect to the 2007 Public Service Commission\u2019s investigation into the complaint filed by the complainant. Accordingly, the Tribunal will not rule on subparagraph (f) of paragraph 1 of the Commission\u2019s motion.\n[41] In its response dated June15, 2012, the respondent indicates that all documents in its power, possession or control and described as being those appearing in paragraphs 1 (a) to (e) of the Commission\u2019s motion, cannot be produced as they do not exist. The respondent recognizes its obligation to produce all relevant documents for which no privilege of confidentiality is required and the respondent also indicates that it undertakes to produce all documents should it ever learn of their existence. However, the respondent confirms that it does not have any other element that could have been brought to the attention of the respondent\u2019s advisor.\n[42] Also, the respondent refers to paragraph 1(d) of the Notice of Motion of Canadian Human Rights Commission with respect to documents that could come from other agencies or departments and the respondent indicates that if such documents exist they are not in its possession, power or control and, therefore, they cannot be the subject of an order for production by the Tribunal. In that same regard, the respondent refers to the Privacy Act, which prohibits such an order.\n[43] Later in its response, the respondent also alleges the following at paragraphs 11, 12 and 13 of its response:\n11. Those materials that do not relate to matters at issue have not been produced. In addition, any materials that are otherwise protected by the Privacy Act, or are not relevant to a claim brought under Subsection 7(a), cannot be produced. Subsection 7(a) of the CHRA is very specific as it relates to a refusal to hire by a Respondent. More specifically, subsection 7(a) differs from 7(b) in that it does not require a comparative analysis. This means that the qualifications of other individual candidates are not relevant to proceedings respecting a refusal to hire.\n12. Based on the specificity of the CHRC's motion one of two things is possible: (a) either the Complainant is already in possession of the documents being sought, or (b) they do not exist. If the Complaint has these materials in his possession then they should have been disclosed in his list of documents.\n13. It is trite to say that documents that do not exist cannot be produced. No law is necessary to support this assertion.\n[44] In its response to the respondent\u2019s response, the Commission contends that the respondent\u2019s arguments for refusing to produce the documents appearing in its motion are nothing more than a blanket response, and therefore, the Commission requires a precise answer for each of the items appearing in its motion.\n[45] Without reiterating again the reasons for the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the general principles for the production of documents as set out by the Tribunal with regard to the complainant\u2019s motion for the production of documents, the Tribunal understands that the Commission also seeks information to support its position with respect to evidence of discrimination which the respondent allegedly committed against Complainant Hughes.\n[46] The Tribunal considers that the information sought by the Commission in its motion for the production of documents in paragraphs 1 (a) to (e) of its motion may be relevant to the complaints filed by the complainant against the respondent. There is no doubt, however, that the requirement for production of all documents or material of any kind whatsoever appearing in the wording of each of the items required by the Commission should not amount to a fishing expedition as our courts have repeatedly stated in a number of decisions (see more particularly CTEA v. Bell Canada, [2000] C.H.R.D. No. 6, T503\/2098, Ruling No. 2, paragraphs 12 to 14; subsequent paragraphs.\n[47] Is that the case here?\n[48] The Tribunal is faced with a situation where the respondent claims that it does not have the documents in its possession and\/or that they do not exist using a phraseology that appears vague to the Tribunal.\n[49] In such a context, it appears to the Tribunal that it would be prudent and appropriate to require from the respondent a clear and unequivocal acknowledgement that it cannot produce any of the documents required by the Commission in its motion with respect to paragraphs 1 (a) to (e).\n[50] In order to clarify the situation, the Tribunal finds that it would therefore be good practice for the respondent to file an affidavit clearly and formally indicating, for each of the documents required by the Commission that it is not in possession of the documents required by the Commission. The Tribunal refers the reader to the reasons for such an affidavit at paragraph 63, which follows.\n[51] Furthermore, in the event that the respondent fails to file such an affidavit within fifteen (15) days from the date of this judgment the Tribunal considers that such documents exist and accordingly, the respondent is therefore ordered to produce such documents without further delay.\nDocuments for which privilege of confidentiality is alleged [52] In the second part of the Commission\u2019s motion, the Commission requires that the respondent produce all documents for which the respondent alleged a privilege of confidentiality. Such privilege of confidentiality appears in a list of documents appearing in the correspondence between the parties, but more particularly in the Commission\u2019s motion dated April 24, 2012, and described as follows:\n1.

Handwritten notes, undated.\n[53] The Tribunal notes that the respondent submits that the Commission\u2019s motion respecting the documents sought in the second part of the Commission\u2019s motion is barred on the basis that the documents are privileged (list of privileged documents).\n[54] First, the Tribunal notes that the Commission\u2019s motion for the production of all documents appearing in the list of privileged documents, with the exception of the documents at Tab 16 for which the Commission does not require production, does not appear to clearly identify the documents so as to link them to the complainant\u2019s file.\n[55] In other words, while the requirement of production of such documents, as drafted, does not directly refer to information that would be useful or necessary for the purposes of the complainant\u2019s file, said point does not appear to be fatal at this stage of the Commission\u2019s motion for the production of documents. The relevance of such documents will be more highly appreciated by the tribunal member at the hearing on the merits of this case.\n[56] The Tribunal then notes that the respondent refers to a privilege of confidentiality and, correlatively, does not in any way indicate, for each of the items required, how the privilege of confidentiality should be applied in this case.\n[57] In other words, what is the nature of the privilege of confidentiality that should apply to each of the items appearing in the list of documents required by the Commission?\n[58] In the case law applicable to such a question of confidentiality and claims of solicitor-client privilege, the Tribunal consulted a number of decisions, the most relevant of which appear below.\n[59] First, in Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada (Minister of Personnel for the Government of the Northwest Territories), 2000, CanLII 20412 (CHRT), the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal referred to Walsh-Canadian Construction Co. Ltd. v. Churchill (Labrador) Corporation Ltd. (No.1) (1979) 9 C.P.C. 229. In that decision of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, the Tribunal members stated as follows:\nThe question of description cannot be neatly severed from the question of challenges, however, and there is no reason to examine documents which clearly attract a privilege. In many cases, for example, the mere fact a document is prepared by legal counsel will be sufficient to establish that it attracts a solicitor-client privilege. It would be abusive of the process to enter into an inquiry into the circumstances under which it was made. The immediate issue is whether the description of the documents, on the face of it, is sufficient to permit the other side to decide whether they wish to challenge the Respondent's assertion of privilege. It would appear, at the outset, that there are two minimal requirements which must be met. The first is that there must be a satisfactory description of the physical documents; the second is that the description of a document should explain why it attracts a particular privilege.\n[60] Also, the Tribunal stated the following further on in the decision:\nBe that as it may the only issue before us is at this time is the question of identification. The crucial issue is whether the entries describing each document, together with the claim of privilege, is sufficient to notify the other parties why it has no obligation to disclose the document. It is evident, in this regard, that the Respondent is obliged to indicate, without defeating the privilege, how the general claim of privilege relates to the document in question. It would normally follow that it should not be put before us in the hearing. There are separate issues, on other documents, as to whether the fact that a party has disclosed documents to the other side prevents it from asserting the privilege in the body of the hearing.\nWe have accepted that all of the factors identified by the Respondent should be taken into account, in determining whether a document is properly described for the purposes of disclosure. None of these factors are decisive in themselves, however, and the question whether a document is sufficiently identified is ultimately a matter of judgement. One the one hand, the ordinary principles of practice make it clear that it is not enough to state that certain documents exist and assert that they are privileged. Something more is required, which advises the other parties of the purpose of the document and explains why the relevant privilege applies.\nOn the other hand, it would be a mistake to set out a formula as to what is required, in each and every case. The issue is a pragmatic one, which calls for latitude and common sense, and there is no need for a detailed description of documents. It may be enough, in many instances, to provide an extremely brief description, or a recitation of circumstances which give rise to an obvious inference of privilege. The mere fact that legal counsel prepared a particular document will usually be sufficient to assert a solicitor-client privilege. In other instances, the identification of hand-written notes or other private documents will be sufficient to establish the private nature of the documents and explain why the privilege has been claimed. In the instance of collective bargaining a reference to an \u201cemployer\u2019s proposal\u201d, with a corresponding date, may be sufficient to establish the nature and identity of the document.\n[61] Those same principles reappear in Poitras v. Twinn, 2001 FCT 456 (CanLII), where the following is stated for the same issue:\n[5] That brings me to the second part of this motion, namely, the claim for privilege in the affidavit of documents of the Crown. In this aspect, I am in agreement with the Band\u2019s submissions, the claim for privilege is altogether too broad and vague. Twenty two documents or bundles of documents are identified by an index number only. A further file is identified by a description only, namely the solicitors\u2019 trial file. There is no indication with respect to any of those documents or bundles of documents as to whether or how many documents they contain, there is no indication as to their dates, and there is only the most general indication as to the author and recipient of each of those documents. This is clearly inadequate. While I agree that the description of a document to which privilege is claimed should not be such as to defeat the claim for privilege itself, the mere indication of a date and either the name or title or initials of the author and the recipient will normally not defeat a claim for privilege unless there is some special circumstance attaching and there has been no suggestion that that is the case here.\n[6] Accordingly, I will order that the motion will be allowed in part and the Crown will be required to produce a further and better affidavit of documents with respect to its claim for privilege within the next 30 days.\n[62] Also, in 1185740 Ontario Ltd. v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue), 1999 CanLII 9151 (FC), in reference to Lumonics Research Ltd. v. Gordon Gould, Refac International Limited, and Patlex Corporation, [1983] 2 F.C. 360, the following is stated:\n[6] In Lumonics Research Ltd. v. Gordon Gould, Refac International Limited, and Patlex Corporation [1983] 2 F.C. 360, the Federal Court of Appeal made it clear that the party opposing the production of documents by reason of privilege had the onus of establishing the facts relevant to the claim of privilege. In my view, the Respondents herein have not met that onus. Counsel for the Applicant argued that it was incumbent on the Respondents to establish the facts which gave rise to the privilege which they claimed, and that the Respondents had not adduced any evidence in that regard. I agree entirely with counsel\u2019s submission. Counsel argued, rightly in my view, that Ms. Castle, counsel for the Respondents, could not by way of argument adduce in evidence the facts on which the Respondents relied for their claim of privilege. Obviously, that contention cannot be disputed. Counsel for the Applicant referred me to the decision of Rothstein J. (as he then was) in Evans (K.F.) Ltd. v. Canada (Minister of Foreign Affairs) [1996] 106 F.T.R. 210. In Evans, Rothstein J. had to decide whether solicitor-client privilege attached to certain documentary material. In support of his claim that the documents did not have to be produced by reason of solicitor-client privilege, the Respondent Minister filed the affidavit of Beverly Anne Chomyn, the solicitor who had given the legal advice at issue.\n[7] Mr. Justice Rothstein then went on to conclude that the Respondent had waived privilege because of partial disclosure. I need not address the issue of waiver, in view of my conclusion that the Respondents have not met their onus. It is clear from Mr. Justice Rothstein\u2019s decision in Evans and the decision of the Court of Appeal in Lumonics that an affidavit setting forth the relevant circumstances is necessary to establish a claim of privilege. In the present matter, as the Respondents have filed no affidavit setting forth the relevant facts and circumstances, I am unable to decide whether the expunged portions of the memoranda are subject to a solicitor-client privilege. As the burden of proof was on the Respondents, the Applicant succeeds on its motion and the expunged portions will be produced by the Respondents within ten days of this Order.\n[63] Based on the principles cited above, the Tribunal finds that a privilege of confidentiality or solicitor-client privilege cannot be validly claimed unless a document containing information describing, on the one hand, the document in question and explaining, on the other hand, the reasons for claiming privilege of confidentiality, is produced preferably in the form of a detailed affidavit. The Tribunal mentions that while the requirement of an affidavit does not appear in the rules of evidence of the CHRT, which are different from those of the Federal Court of Canada, the use of an affidavit is certainly appropriate and better meets the need for a more formalized response as in this case.\n[64] However, there is no affidavit before the Tribunal in this case from the respondent, only a mere claim of privilege of confidentiality on the part of the respondent.\n[65] The mere assertion of a privilege of confidentiality is not acceptable in the absence of appropriate reasons as per the decisions of our courts which the Tribunal refers to above.\n[66] Of course, it is not within the powers of the Tribunal to argue the substantive issue of the existence of privilege of confidentiality owing to a solicitor-client relationship. In that regard, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to do so as held in the case law, more particularly in Canada (Privacy Commissioner) v. Blood Tribe Department of Health and Attorney General of Canada et al. [2008] 2 S.C.R. 574, 2008 SCC 44.\n[67] However, the mere assertion of a privilege of confidentiality, without a valid explanation that does not compromise said privilege, is not acceptable by the Tribunal.\n[68] Consequently, if the respondent wishes to reasonably claim a privilege of confidentiality in respect of the items appearing in the list of documents referred to in the Commission\u2019s motion, it is suggested that it provide an affidavit sufficient for each of the items appearing in said list by indicating why said documents cannot be produced, owing either to their confidential nature or to a relationship of solicitor-client privilege and\/or established in preparation for litigation, within fifteen (15) days from the date of this judgment.\n[69] Failure by the respondent to file such an affidavit within the prescribed time frame shall result in an order requiring the respondent to produce the documents appearing in the Commission\u2019s motion, without further delay.\nIII. Decisions For these reasons, the Tribunal orders as follows:\nOn the motion of Complainant Chris Hughes:\n(a) The respondent is ordered to produce the documents appearing in the complainant\u2019s motion dated May 11, 2012, by redacting all information that would identify each of the persons referred to in each of the documents to be produced by the respondent;\nOn the motion of the Canadian Human Rights Commission:\n(b) The respondent is ordered to produce all non-privileged documents required by the Canadian Human Rights Commission, unless the respondent files a detailed affidavit indicating why the respondent cannot validly produce said documents, the said affidavit to be produced within fifteen (15) days from the date of this decision, and failing such affidavit the respondent shall provide all non-privileged documents appearing in the motion of the Canadian Human Rights Commission;\n(c) The respondent is ordered to produce all documents appearing in the Commission\u2019s motion in respect of privileged documents with the exception of the documents at Tab 16, unless the respondent files a detailed affidavit indicating for each of the items a valid reason that would allow the respondent to claim a privilege of confidentiality, the said affidavit to be produced within fifteen (15) days from the date of this decision, and if such affidavit is not filed, the respondent shall provide all documents appearing in the motion of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, at paragraph (d) of its motion, with the exception of paragraph 16.\nSigned by\nRobert Malo\nTribunal Member\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nOctober 25, 2012\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1656\/01111\nStyle of Cause: Chris Hughes v.

Credibility of the Complainant 8\nXII....... Argument of the Respondent 8\nXIII..... Decision. 9\nI. Complaint [1] On October 26, 2009, Ms. Ravi Lally filed a complaint, Exhibit C-1, under the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) against Telus Communications Inc. (Telus). The Canadian Human Rights Commission investigated Ms. Lally\u2019s complaint, and then referred it to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal for inquiry.\nII. Relevant sections of the CHRA [2] The relevant sections of the CHRA that apply are as follows:\n3. (1) For all the purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or to continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nIII. Inquiry [3] An inquiry into Ms. Lally\u2019s complaint commenced on October 9, 2012, and continued on October 10, 11 and 12, 2012, presided over by Tribunal member Wallace Gilby Craig. The Complainant presented documentary evidence and oral testimony to establish, on a balance of probabilities, (a prima facie case), that Telus had subjected her to discrimination while she was disabled by clinical depression. At the end of the Complainant\u2019s case, Telus argued that the Complainant had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.\nIV. Shifting Burden of Proof [4] Every complainant must present evidence that establishes a prima facie case of contravention of the CHRA. Failure to do so results in dismissal of a complaint. However, once it is determined by the adjudicator that a prima facie case has been established then the evidentiary burden shifts to the respondent to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the conduct complained of either didn\u2019t occur or doesn\u2019t constitute a discriminatory practice.\nV. Standard of Proof and Assessing Credibility [5] In F. H. McDougall, 2008 SCC 53, the Supreme Court of Canada clarified the law with respect to the standard of proof in civil cases: nothing more, nothing less than a balance of probabilities. Evidence must be clear, convincing and cogent in order to satisfy the balance of probabilities test.\n[6] The Court also affirmed that a trial judge must not consider a witness\u2019 evidence in isolation, but should consider the totality of the evidence in the case, and assess the impact of any inconsistencies on questions of credibility and reliability pertaining to the core issues in the case.\nVI. Background [7] Ms. Lally testified that she had been a Telus employee for 16 years, beginning as a telephone operator, ultimately achieving accredited status as a project manager. Ms. Lally explained the courses she had taken and the instruction and training she had received to achieve certification as a Project Management Professional.\n[8] In 2003, Ms. Lally worked on an on-loan basis for Mr. Brett Holt in Telus\u2019 Small Business Solutions division. In the aftermath of her on-loan work, Mr. Holt asked her to work full-time with him. She declined due to on-going commitments in another project, promising to call him when she was finished. In their subsequent discussions, Ms. Lally agreed to work for Mr. Holt in Telus\u2019 Small Business Solutions as a Project Manager and Senior Business Analyst.\nVII. Project Clearwater [9] Between March and October 2007 Telus engaged in a project to persuade underperforming sales managers and sales employees to voluntarily accept severance packages ending their employment with Telus. Four severance packages were for sales managers, and sixteen severance packages were for unionized sales employees. It is reasonable to infer that this project was approved by Telus Chief Executive Officer or his\/her delegate.\n[10] The project was code-named Project Clearwater, it was managed by Mr. Holt under the direction of a senior executive, Dan Goldberg. Based on the totality of evidence in the Complainant\u2019s case, I conclude that Project Clearwater was abnormal and stressful. It was a critical and confidential project to create greater sales potential and it was accomplished between March and October 2007.\n[11] Exhibit C-5 is an insightful email exchange on August 14 and 15, 2007, between Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Holt.\n[12] In Exhibit C-5, Mr. Goldberg on August 14, 2007: \u201c\u2026 Frankly I worry that once we deploy the VDIP, the union will essentially claim that we are targeting people for exit through this move. Now I don\u2019t know if there is any recourse from the union \u2013 we might be technically within the letter of the law (contract). That said, I worry about our exposure and moreover, it just feels unfair.\u201d\n[13] In my opinion it is significant that Mr. Goldberg referred to the unfairness of the project. I conclude that Mr. Goldberg was sensitive to the fact that good, loyal employees would be forced to leave Telus simply because they were not high performance sales people.\n[14] Ms. Lally testified that she made a firm oral commitment to work on Project Clearwater based on Mr. Holt\u2019s reciprocal oral assurance that she would receive one of the management severance packages. Ms. Lally testified that from time to time she reminded Mr. Holt of their understanding, however in October 2007 he avoided any conversation about it, finally agreeing to discuss her severance package on October 16, 2007. Mr. Holt delayed meeting with her until 4:30 in the afternoon when he telephoned Ms. Lally and told her that she would not be given a severance package. Mr. Holt said \u201cWe don\u2019t pay for good people to leave\u201d. When Ms. Lally reminded him that she had held up her end of the bargain, Mr. Holt replied \u201cYou\u2019ll have to live with it.\u201d\n[15] The words Ms. Lally attributed to Mr. Holt \u2013 \u201cWe don\u2019t pay good people to leave\u201d suggest that Mr. Holt was instructed to bring an end to the supposed agreement.\n[16] I conclude that Mr. Holt and Ms. Lally struck a private, unenforceable bargain concerning one of the four management severance packages; that if it had come to fruition, which is highly unlikely, then Ms. Lally would have terminated her employment. In testifying to the existence of her \u201cbargain\u201d with Mr. Holt, Ms. Lally revealed a failure to understand the ramifications of this unsanctioned under-the-table agreement including the possibility it might be construed as an attempt to defraud Telus of a significant sum of money.\n[17] It is bizarre that while Ms. Lally was persuading targeted employees to accept severance packages, specifically intended for underperforming employees, she had bargained surreptitiously with Mr. Holt to receive one herself.\n[18] However, if I am wrong in characterizing Ms. Lally\u2019s severance package deal as an act of malfeasance, then in the least she revealed herself to be dishonest in entering into an unsanctioned bargain. In this regard it is significant that Ms. Lally neglected to ascertain whether Mr. Holt had been authorized by Telus to reward her if the project was successful. At the very least she ought to have queried Mr. Holt whether he had Mr. Goldberg\u2019s assurance that a package would be set aside for her.\nVIII. Insight into Ms. Lally\u2019s Work on Project Clearwater [19] Exhibit C-6 is a 27-page internal Telus Performance assessment for the period January to June 2007. Of significance is the manager\u2019s comment at page 14: \u201cRavi\u2019s strategic thinking and planning skills have excelled with Proj. Clearwater. Thank you for taking the lead on this initiative and driving this growth within SBS.\u201d\n[20] Exhibit C-7 is September 20, 2007 email exchange between Ms. Lally and Mr. Holt in which she details progress with specific selected employees, and he concludes his response: \u201cGood work again \u2013 Thank you\u201d.\n[21] Ms. Lally testified that her contribution to the success of Project Clearwater was recognized, in part, with a gift: a three-day holiday.\n[22] It is likely that Ms. Lally was at the ultimate point of her mental endurance when Mr. Holt telephoned her and callously dashed her illusory expectation of a severance package. It is extremely regrettable she was very ill with depression, unfit to respond to ill-conceived communications from Telus. It is significant that in 2007 Ms. Lally was emotionally fraught with a rebellious teen-age son and a seriously ill mother, matters which compounded the stressful aspect of Mr. Holt\u2019s inability to provide her with a severance package.\nIX. Clinical Depression [23] Exhibit C-29 is an email from Ms. Lally to Adriana Eanga, Catherine McColl and Brett Holt dated November 2, 2007 with attached doctor\u2019s note also dated November 2, 2007. Ms. Lally consulted Doctor S. Gnui, her family doctor. He certified that Ms. Lally was not able to return to work. \u201cRavi is suffering from severe mental and physical stress and is not able to continue at work. Kindly excuse her from work.\u201d\n[24] On November 13, 2007, Dr. Gnui was again consulted. He completed Telus\u2019 \u201cPractitioner\u2019s Assessment Form\u201d, marked as Exhibit C-37, stating that Ms. Lally was ill with \u201cmajor clinical depression\u201d, and he recommended that Ms. Lally utilize psychological services available through work or at a psychiatrist. Dr. Gnui indicated that Ms. Lally was unfit to work, that her return to work was unknown, and that if her depression persisted he would refer her to a psychiatrist.\n[25] Exhibit C-38 is an internal Telus email exchange between Adriana Eanga, Alan Dabb and Corinne Wilander, commenting on Dr. Gnui\u2019s \u201cPractitioner\u2019s Assessment Form\u201d. On November 16, 2007, Eanga writes to Wilander and Dabb: \u201cHi Corinne, Can you please advise where we stand with assessment of the PAF that we received from Ravi earlier this week? Your initial assessment seemed to be that leave would not be approved beyond 4 weeks. Can you please inform us of the final decision? Alan, should the communication be from you or is it okay to come from health services given her last email to us. AE\u201d On November 19, 2007, Wilander replies to Dabb and Eanga: \u201cHi, The medical information received is inadequate to support a continued abs cense (sic) from work. Having said that would it be prudent to arrange an IME? My rationale is this: 1. She will refuse to attend and we then we (sic) can say we did due diligence. 2. She attends and is not found to be disabled. 3. She is disabled which explains her behaviour. Regardless of the outcome it will give us the information we need to either close this file or manage the disability. Your thoughts? \u201d Finally, still on November 19, 2007, Wilander writes to Eanga and Dabb: \u201cHi Adriana: IME: request a Specialist, in the correct field, to see the Team Member for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment recommendations as well as their fitness for work. Depends on the Specialist so no longer than 1 \u2013 2 months. She should be unpaid until it is verified that she is disabled. The business can\u2019t really replace her if she is disabled. Question: she was AWOL for 5 weeks and left as if she was not coming back. Should we be concerned now that she is medicalizing (sic) the situation? Frankly the medical produced is weak and certainly would not support her continued absence.\n[26] At Telus\u2019 request, Ms. Lally agreed to undergo an independent medical assessment.\n[27] On February 6, 2008, Dr. Jeffrey M. Claman, a Clinical Associate Professor, Department of Psychiatry, UBC, provided Telus with a 10-page report which resulted from his interview of Ms. Lally the same day. The document was filed as Exhibit C-59. At page 8, current diagnosis based on the DSM IV criteria: Major Depressive Disorder.\n[28] I note that doctors use the term \u201cclinical depression\u201d on an inclusive basis when referring to the more severe forms of depression one instance being \u201cmajor depressive disorder.\u201d\n[29] Exhibit C-58 is an email from Corinne Wilander RN, Service Manager, Telus Corporate Health Services, to Joni Kert, subject Ravi Lally: \u201cHi Joni, the specialist report from the Independent Medical Exam, which we arranged for her, indicated that Ravi is disabled and unable to work. Please correct the coding so that she is paid, if she has not been. I don\u2019t know what the long term plan is however it is unlikely that she will return to her current position.\u201d\n[30] Exhibit C-60 is an email continuing the conversational string in Exhibit C-58. Adriana Eanga informs Brett Holt in a fashion that is not an acknowledgment of her own erroneous assessment concerning Ms. Lally\u2019s absence from work: \u201cYes, this is per Alan\u2019s last note to us. Looks like she was in fact ill and (it) would have been simpler all around had she been communicating openly with her manager.\u201d\nX. The Core of Ms. Lally\u2019s Complaint [31] Ms. Lally began her testimony by affirming the truthfulness of her complaint, which was filed as Exhibit C-1. In the second paragraph she states the core element of her complaint: \u201cHe stated he wanted someone reliable and trustworthy as it was a confidential and critical project. I was already under extreme personal stress due to family challenges with my rebellious teenager and an ailing mother. I communicated that I needed the ability to focus on family but also required a salary to make ends meet. Brett and I discussed this in detail and found a solution. Brett confirmed he would hold one of the management departure packages for me upon successful completion in fall 07. We both were benefitting and both verbally committed to this agreement and I began execution. I regularly checked in with Brett during our private meetings to confirm our agreement was understood and solid. I successfully completed Project Clearwater by the end of SEP07. Brett and I had discussed my transition and as a result, I had nearly half the month of OCT07 scheduled off as well as NOV07. This was to ease the team\u2019s dependency on me and allow Brett time to complete my exit with minimal interruption to the business.\u201d\nXI. Credibility of the Complainant [32] Ms. Lally\u2019s viva voce evidence and tendering of documents amounted to an orderly assertion of the details of her complaint. However, under rigorous cross examination concerning attempts by manager Joni Kert to contact her in the weeks following October 17, 2007, Ms. Lally claimed, speciously, that she was being subjected to harassment therefore discrimination. Though framed in blunt and insensitive language, the communications express Telus\u2019 right to know the reason for Ms. Lally\u2019s absence and I conclude they were not harassment, neither were they acts of discrimination within the reach of s. 7 of the CHRA. I make the same determination in connection with the bureaucratic manner in which Telus employees facilitated Ms. Lally\u2019s entitlement to short and long-term disability payments and ultimately to coverage by Sun Life Assurance.\nXII. Argument of the Respondent [33] Telus argues that it was unaware that the Complainant was disabled by clinical depression until October 29, 2007; and that the non-existence of a disability on October 16, 2007 (the day Mr. Holt informed Ms. Lally she would not receive a severance package), is fatal to the complainant\u2019s allegation that she was subjected to a discriminatory practice based on disability. The same argument is made concerning Ms. Lally\u2019s allegation that she was subjected to harassment when Telus employees\u2019 attempted to communicate with her to determine why she was absent from work and to obtain business updates.\n[34] Telus argued that after it was informed of the disability, Ms. Lally was not subjected to adverse differential treatment; that Telus\u2019 requirement for an independent medical examination was legitimate and necessary to confirm the Complainant\u2019s medical status thereby justifying her leave of absence and entitlement to disability benefits.\n[35] Telus acknowledged that it made administrative errors in overpayment of salary to Ms. Lally, and in processing her entitlement to long term disability benefits which included failure to ensure that she made a timely application to receive extended coverage from Sun Life Assurance. Telus asserts that where possible it corrected these errors; and that the test for discrimination is not whether the employer acted perfectly in its dealing with a disabled employee, rather it is whether it acted reasonably and did not, by reason of her disability, differentiate adversely against the employee.\n[36] The Respondent\u2019s arguments are persuasive.\nXIII. Decision [37] Based on my findings in this matter, and on a balance of probabilities, I conclude that the Complainant has failed to establish a prima facie case of a discriminatory practice contrary to s. 7 of the CHRA, engaged in by the Respondent, in the period October 16, 2007, to October 20, 2009.\n[38] Accordingly the complaint is dismissed.\nSigned by\nWallace G.

Lustig\nDate: October 31, 2012\nCitation: 2012 CHRT 28\nI. Context [1] The Complainants have filed a human rights complaint alleging that the inequitable funding of child welfare services on First Nations reserves amount to discrimination on the basis of race and national ethnic origin, contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RCS 1985, c H-6 (the Act). The complaint was referred to the Tribunal by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) on October 14, 2008, and on November 3, 2008, the Commission indicated that it would be participating at the hearing on this matter.\n[2] On December 21, 2009, the Respondent filed a motion for the dismissal of the complaint on the ground that the issues raised were beyond the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction (the jurisdictional motion). The Tribunal ruled on the jurisdictional motion on March 14, 2011, in a decision reported at 2011 CHRT 4, and granted the motion, thereby dismissing the complaint. This decision was subsequently the subject of an application for judicial review before the Federal Court and, on April 18, 2012, the Federal Court set aside the Tribunal\u2019s decision and remitted the matter to a differently constituted panel of the Tribunal for re-determination in accordance with its reasons (2012 FC 445). On July 10, 2012, a panel of three Tribunal members, composed of members Marchildon, Lustig and B\u00e9langer were appointed to hear this case (2012 CHRT 16).\nII. FNCFCS\u2019 Motion to strike the Respondent\u2019s Expert Report [3] On July 23, 2012, counsel for FNCFCS filed a Notice of Motion to strike the two parts and covering letter of the Respondent\u2019s expert report from KPMG filed September 15, 2010, on the ground that the report failed to meet the requirements set out in Rule 6(3) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (the Rules of Procedure). Rule 6(3) reads as follows:\na. Within the time fixed by the Panel, each party shall serve on all other parties and file with the Tribunal,\n(a) a report in respect of any expert witness the party intends to call, which report shall,\n(i) be signed by the expert;\n(ii) set out the expert\u2019s name, address and qualifications; and\n(iii) set out the substance of the expert\u2019s proposed testimony; and\nb. (b) a report in respect of any expert witness the party intends to call in response to an expert\u2019s report filed under 6(3)(a), which report shall comply with the requirements of 6(3)(a).\n[4] Specifically, FNCFCS highlighted the report\u2019s failure to identify or set out the qualifications of any expert from KPMG, a consulting firm, who the Respondent intended to call as an expert witness in respect of the report. FNCFCS submitted that without identifying its individual author and his or her qualifications, the report was inadmissible as expert evidence. In letters dated August 13, 2012, both AFN and the Commission expressed their support for this motion.\n[5] On August 27, 2012, in response to this motion, the Respondent submitted a letter drafted by Paul Ross, Senior Vice President of KPMG, indicating that he had authored the KPMG expert report and enclosing a copy of his Statement of Qualifications. The Respondent submits that this letter and the Statement of Qualifications address the concerns raised by FNCFCS in their motion, that FNCFCS has not suffered any prejudice by the delay in providing this information and therefore that the motion should be dismissed.\nIII. The Respondent\u2019s Motion to strike the opposing parties\u2019 Expert Reports [6] On August 29, 2012, the Respondent filed a motion to strike the Chiefs of Ontario (COO) expert report by Hislop, R. and Finlay, J. entitled Conditions Facing First Nations Children in Remote Northern Communities in Ontario: Preliminary Impressions, prepared by the Office of Child and Family Service Advocacy in Ontario, dated July 2006. The Respondent\u2019s motion also sought to strike following expert reports from the Commission:\n(a) Milloy, J. A National Crime: The Canadian Government and the Residential School System, 1879 to 1986 (University of Manitoba Press: 1999);\n(b) Greenwood, M. Places for the Good Care of Children: A Discussion of Indigenous Cultural Considerations and Early Childhood in Canada and New Zealand, June 2009;\n(c) Greenwood, M. and Shawana, P. Whispered Gently Through Time, First Nations Quality Child Care;\n(d) Report of Dr. Nico Trocm\u00e9, dated September 2, 2009;\n(e) Wien, F. Keeping First Nations children at home: A few Federal policy changes could make a big difference; and\n(f) Loxley, J. Wen:de The Journey Continues.\n[7] The Respondent questions the necessity, relevance and potential cost-benefit of the proposed expert reports to the matter at issue, relying on the criteria established by the Supreme Court in R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9 to determine the admissibility of expert evidence, namely relevance, necessity in assisting the trier of fact, the absence of an exclusionary rule, and a properly qualified expert. The Respondent also relies on the Ontario Court of Appeal\u2019s new approach to these criteria adopted in R. v. Abbey, 2009 ONCA 624 and Rule 6(3) of the Rules of Procedure.\n[8] The Respondent challenges both the relevance of these reports along with their necessity in assisting the trier of fact. According to the Respondent, none of the proposed expert reports pertain to the allegation that the funding provided by the federal government to child and family service providers on-reserve is less than what the provincial and Yukon governments provide to child and family service providers off-reserve. In addition, none of the proposed expert reports, with the exception of the report of Dr. Trocm\u00e9, were prepared for this proceeding and the information they contain goes beyond the scope of the allegations that the Tribunal must determine. The Respondent further contends that the proposed experts behind many of these reports are not properly qualified experts in the area of funding child and family service on-reserve or off-reserve.\n[9] The Respondent also brings specific objections regarding the reports entitled \u2018Wen:de The Journey Continues\u2019 and \u2018Keeping First Nations children at home: A few Federal policy changes could make a big difference\u2019, which were co-authored by Dr. Cindy Blackstock, the Executive Director of FNCFCS. In light of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s role in these proceedings, the Respondent contends that the reports are unreliable, have little probative value and cannot be viewed as being objective or impartial. The Respondent also submits that all these concerns, along with the prejudicial impact of these reports to the Respondent, outweigh any possible benefits to their admission. The reports should therefore be excluded as expert evidence.\n[10] In response, FNCFCS argues that this motion is premature. FNCFCS contends that while the failure to meet the criteria in Rule 6(3) for the proper service of expert witness reports can be raised on a preliminary basis, the Respondent\u2019s motion does not challenge the reports\u2019 compliance with this Rule. Rather, the Respondent challenges the admissibility of the reports by disputing the qualifications and objectivity of their authors. In response, FNCFCS argues that it is inappropriate at this stage to adopt this approach. Indeed, FNCFCS maintains that these are matters which cannot be decided by the Tribunal before the hearing has begun and until the panel has heard from the proposed expert at the initial qualification stage. At that stage, the panel will have the chance to assess the scope of the author\u2019s expertise and its relevance to the case, and the Respondent will be able to challenge the authors\u2019 qualifications and objectivity through cross-examination.\n[11] FNCFCS relies on the Tribunal\u2019s ruling in PSAC v. Northwest Territories (Minister of Personnel), [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 26 at paragraphs 5 and 12, where member Groark stated: \u201cissues with respect to the relevance and admissibility of an expert\u2019s testimony are more properly decided when the witness is called\u201d. FNCFCS submits that in bringing this motion at the preliminary stage, the Respondent is asking the Tribunal to effectively bypass the qualifying process and preemptively exclude expert evidence without hearing any evidence as to the witnesses\u2019 qualifications or the scope of their proposed testimony. For these reasons, FNCFCS submits that the Respondent\u2019s motion should be dismissed, and the issues of the reports\u2019 admissibility and qualifications and objectivity of any expert witness should be left for determination by the Tribunal in the ordinary course. In an email dated September 21, 2012, AFN confirmed its support for the position of FNCFCS and the Commission with respect to this motion.\n[12] On September 25 and 26, 2012, the panel heard the parties\u2019 oral submissions on the Respondent\u2019s motion to exclude the Commission\u2019s expert reports. The Respondent took this opportunity to argue orally its reply to FNCFCS\u2019s response to the motion to strike expert reports. In addition to its initial submissions, the Respondent further argued that the motion was not premature as the existing issues that gave rise to the motion will remain throughout the hearing. Indeed, the issues of impartiality and objectivity raised by the reports co-authored by Dr. Blackstock will not change as Dr. Blackstock will continue to be a Complainant in this matter. The Respondent submits that while she can give evidence as a witness, it would be inappropriate to allow her to give evidence as an expert despite the fact that she may have the necessary professional and academic qualifications to do so.\n[13] Overall, the Respondent expressed that while it understands the need to provide background and context to the complaint, it is concerned that the Commission\u2019s expert reports go far beyond the scope of the complaint as it was originally particularized in 2007 and beyond the basis on which the complaint was referred by the Commission to the Tribunal in 2008.\nIV. Analysis and Decision A. FNCFCS\u2019 Motion to Strike the Respondent\u2019s Expert Report [14] In light of the Respondent\u2019s August 27, 2010 letter providing the name of the author of the KPMG report along with his Statement of Qualifications, the Tribunal asked FNCFCS whether it wished to maintain its motion to strike the report. FNCFCS responded that it was satisfied with the information provided and the report\u2019s compliance with Rule 6(3), and withdrew the motion.\nB. Respondent\u2019s Motion to Strike the Commission\u2019s Expert Reports [15] It is well established in law and, recognized by the parties, that the Mohan decision and the criteria of relevance, necessity in assisting the trier of fact, absence of any exclusionary rule and, a properly qualified expert, form the test to be applied in deciding whether expert evidence is admissible. However, it is important to distinguish between an application for leave to call witnesses and the issues which arise with respect to the admissibility of their evidence. As stated by this Tribunal in the PSAC decision, supra, the latter is more properly decided when the witness is called to testify.\n[16] At this preliminary stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal is merely trying to establish whether or not to allow the Commission to call its expert witnesses. To this end, it is sufficient for the Tribunal to determine that the expert\u2019s testimony is needed to determine one of the factual issues in the case (Mellon v. Canada, at paragraph 6) or, in other words, to determine whether the Commission possesses reasonable grounds for calling the witnesses as their testimony would logically contribute to the Commission\u2019s position: PSAC, supra, at paragraphs 5 and 6.\n[17] For reasons that follow, we are satisfied that the Commission and the Complainants can reasonably claim that they need the evidence contained in the expert reports. John Milloy\u2019s report, A National Crime: The Canadian Government and the Residential School System, 1879 to 1986, appears prima facie to provide a context to the complaint and child welfare services in Canada. Margo Greenwood\u2019s reports Places for the Good Care of Children: A Discussion of Indigenous Cultural Considerations and Early Childhood in Canada and New Zealand, and Whispered Gently Through Time, First Nations Quality Child Care (co-authored with Perry Shawana) pertain to the issue of First Nations child care in Canada and Nico Trocm\u00e9\u2019s report, along with that of John Loxley and Frederic Wien, address the key issue of INAC\u2019s child and family services funding policies and formulas.\n[18] The Tribunal is of the view that these reports logically contribute to the Commission\u2019s position and, therefore, that the proposed expert witnesses may be called by the Commission. The Tribunal is not in a position, and need not, determine the relevance of these reports or their necessity in assisting the panel as per Mohan and as challenged by the Respondent. While the Respondent argues that the impartiality issues raised by Dr. Blackstock\u2019s involvement in two of the reports will not change between now and the time of the hearing on the merits of the complaint, this submission goes to the reliability of the evidence and, therefore, to its relevance: Mohan at paragraphs 18 and 19. The Tribunal is unable to make such an inquiry until Dr. Blackstock and\/or her co-authors are called to testify.\n[19] The Tribunal takes note of the COO\u2019s letter dated September 19, 2012, informing the parties that Ruth Hislop and Dr. Finlay\u2019s report entitled \u201cConditions Facing First Nations Children in Remote Northern Communities in Ontario: Preliminary Impressions from the Perspective of the Office of Child and Family Services Advocacy\u201d would not be tendered as an expert report in these proceedings although the COO reserved the right to call Dr. Finlay as a witness. As such, the Tribunal need not determine its compliance with Rule 6(3) or whether the report would logically contribute to the Complainants\u2019 position.\n[20] For the foregoing reasons, the motion is dismissed.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nPanel Chairperson\nSigned by\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nTribunal Member\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Introduction [1] These are my Reasons for Decision in the Complaints of Doris Cassidy against Raj Thambirajah (\u201cPersonal Respondent\u201d), a co-worker and Union shop steward, and Canada Post Corporation (\u201cCanada Post\u201d), her employer. The allegation against Mr. Thambirajah is that he sexually harassed the Complainant, contrary to subsection 14(2) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 as amended (\u201cCHRA\u201d). The Complaint against him was also amended to include three incidents of retaliation during the course of the hearing, contrary to section 14.1 of the CHRA. The Complaint against Canada Post is that it differentiated adversely against Ms. Cassidy and failed to provide a harassment-free workplace based on the ground of sex, contrary to subsections 7(b) and 14(2) of the CHRA, respectively. The Complaints were combined into a single hearing. The Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) did not participate in the hearing.\nII. Decision [2] The Complaints are substantiated in part.\nIII. Delay and Length Of Proceeding [3] The genesis of the Complaints goes back to on or about November 9, 2005 (the Complainant does not remember the exact date) when Mr. Thambirajah is alleged to have sexually harassed the Complainant by way of inappropriate touching and comments in the workplace. The Complainant filed her Complaints on March 27, 2007. The Commission referred them to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (\u201cTribunal) on May 26, 2009. The Complaints were case-managed and then assigned to me for a hearing. The first day of hearing was February 1, 2010; the last day was October 11, 2011. The proceeding closed when the Complainant counsel\u2019s request to re-open the hearing was denied on January 19, 2012.\n[4] This was too long for a proceeding to take place \u2013 seven years after the cause of action arose. I won\u2019t comment on the lapsed time from when the Complainant filed a Complaint to the Commission\u2019s referral to the Tribunal. But I can and will comment on the carriage of the matter before the Tribunal.\n[5] In the many years that I have been adjudicating human rights cases, in the federal and Ontario jurisdictions, this case is unique and was more difficult than others, for many reasons. First, there were time consuming disclosure and production matters that arose during the hearing. These involved the six journals\/diaries of the Complainant. To preserve her privacy and confidentiality, I agreed to vet or review them for arguable relevance. There were hundreds of pages to meticulously go through. When I ordered certain parts produced to the Respondents, and other journals be returned to the Complainant, there was a mix-up. The Complainant or her representative gave the non-produced documents to Mr. Machelak, Canada Post\u2019s counsel (but not to Mr. Platt, the Personal Respondent\u2019s representative). The Complainant was upset that Mr. Machelak had confidential parts of the journals that were ordered redacted and accused him of taking them from her belongings in the hearing room. Understandably, counsel took umbrage at this accusation. And yet again, there were problems with the proper copies being made by the Complainant. The copies given to each of the Respondents, the Registry Officer, and the copy on the witness stand, did not match.\n[6] I should add for the record that, as the Complainant was rightly agitated about intimate, private matters in her journals being disclosed to the Respondents, particularly the Personal Respondent, I also made an Order sealing certain documents and ordering the Respondents to return certain productions of the Complainant upon the end of the proceeding and any judicial review\/appeal thereto. Ms. Cassidy\u2019s concern was palpable and I hope that I achieved the right balance in the review of the journals and the issuance of the Order.\n[7] There was also a fair bit of shuffling of witnesses, even before their testimony was completed, in order to accommodate scheduling issues, and I thank the parties for their co-operation. That prevented the loss of hearing days. There was also the passage of time with the not uncommon difficulty in finding common available dates for the parties, their counsel\/representatives and the Tribunal.\n[8] The hearing itself took longer in part - 22 hearing days, not including the many Case Management Conference Calls that I held with the parties to deal with various issues\/events that arose during the course of the proceeding - because the Complainant\u2019s testimony took longer than anticipated. As will be discussed later, the Complainant was sometimes evasive, other times not evasive but still having problems answering the questions, particularly in cross-examination. There was also a mediation in the middle of the first week of the hearing between the Complainant and Canada Post, conducted by the Chair of the Tribunal. The matter settled, but within a day, the Complainant indicated that she wished to \u201ctear up\u201d the agreement and proceed with the hearing against the two Respondents.\n[9] Other exceptional events that lengthened the hearing were motions. There was a motion to amend the Complaint against Mr. Thambirajah to add an allegation of retaliation in regard to three incidents that occurred during the first week of the hearing. There was also a motion to allow similar fact evidence.\n[10] Of greater significance was the motion to re-open the Complainant\u2019s case after it closed on May 28, 2010 and to add an allegation of retaliation against Canada Post. This wasn\u2019t resolved ultimately until March 14, 2011 \u2013 some 10 months later. And during this time, there was a change in Ms. Cassidy\u2019s representation from Julie Marshall (agent) to William Kelly (counsel) to the Complainant being self-represented briefly, after counsel went off the record. (He then re-appeared as counsel on April 25, 2011 and for the remainder of the hearing.)\nA. Motion to Re-open the Complainant\u2019s Case and Subsequent Events [11] The genesis of the motion to re-open the Complainant\u2019s case was the alleged meeting between Ms. Cassidy and her supervisors on the day of the November 9, 2005 incident of sexual harassment by Mr. Thambirajah. This will be discussed further in these Reasons. Ms. Cassidy indicated for the first time on May 31, 2010 that there was a witness who took her to and sat in on the meeting. She did not remember this because, she claimed, she has been suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) since that day in November of 2005, right through to May 28, 2010. I set dates for motion materials to be filed and argument to be made, including an expert report by a psychiatrist. She had not been seen by a psychiatrist or diagnosed with PTSD by a physician. I discussed with the parties the legal test to re-open a party\u2019s case, as stated in Johnson v. Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 1994 CanLII 284 (CHRT)(\u201cVermette\u201d), aff\u2019ed 1996 CanLII 3858 (FC). The hearing was adjourned to the motion date.\n[12] Several events then transpired. Ms. Marshall advised on a Conference Call that the Complainant had \u201cchecked herself into\u201d the psychiatric unit of Lakeridge hospital after the May 31, 2010 hearing date. She was now under the care of a psychiatrist, Dr. Malamed. The Complainant missed her first deadline for filing motion materials. The Tribunal Registry Officer was unable to reach Ms. Marshall or the Complainant. After several weeks had passed, Ms. Marshall finally contacted the Tribunal. I then gave the Complainant additional time to file. When those materials arrived on October 8, 2010, they failed to adhere to one of the requirements as discussed on May 31, 2010: that in order to meet the legal test, the moving party would have to show that she suffered from PTSD for the entire period from the cause of action to the end of her case at the hearing. Also, she would have to demonstrate that she exercised due diligence in preparing her case (i.e., she could not have been aware of this witness because of the PTSD diagnosis). The hospital psychiatrist\u2019s letter (not adhering to the requirements of an expert\u2019s report under the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure) did not include a PTSD diagnosis from November 9, 2005 to May 2010.\n[13] Exit Ms. Marshall; enter counsel Kelly. I should add that this was a difficult case and Ms. Marshall, not being trained as a lawyer, represented her friend Ms. Cassidy on a volunteer basis. She did a competent job in that context. Mr. Kelly was then retained and so advised the Tribunal on November 10, 2010. I held a Conference Call with the parties on November 29, 2010. To the opposition of the Respondents, I allowed, yet again, the Complainant to re-file her motion materials, by January 25, 2011. I had hoped that, with Complainant counsel\u2019s arrival to the proceeding, the motion materials would be filed properly and the motion heard as soon as possible. My hopes were unrealized.\n[14] I should add that, before Mr. Kelly was retained, in order to move the process faster, and with the parties\u2019 approval, I had directed on May 31, 2010 that we would first hear from the proposed witness to the alleged November 9, 2005 meeting, A.B., before requiring the moving party to file an expert psychiatrist\u2019s report and the other parties potentially filing a rebuttal expert report. There was a dispute as to whether the witness was even at the Canada Post depot in question on November 9, 2005 \u2013 the day of the incident and alleged meeting with the Complainant and her supervisors. I heard A.B.\u2019s evidence on that point and Canada Post\u2019s witnesses on July 20, 2010. Parties had agreed that I could use the evidence on the motion for purposes of the \u201con-the-merits\u201d main hearing too, if necessary, in order to avoid having A.B. called back as a witness in the \u201cmain\u201d hearing.\n[15] The January 25, 2011 filing deadline for the Complainant\u2019s motion materials passed, with no word from Complainant counsel. Weeks passed. Complainant counsel did not answer correspondence and voice-mail messages from the Tribunal indicating the deadline had passed. Messrs. Machelak and Platt did not hear from him either. On February 2, 2011, I directed the Tribunal Registry to send out a letter indicating that I had interpreted counsel\u2019s failure to file as abandoning the motion to re-open the case (as well as the other motion to add an allegation of retaliation against Canada Post). The hearing was scheduled to resume on March 14, 2011.\n[16] One week before the resumption of the hearing, the Tribunal received a letter from Complainant counsel asking that the hearing be adjourned and permission to continue with the motion and re-file materials. The other parties opposed the request. I denied the request. On March 9, 2011, Complainant counsel wrote in again requesting that the Tribunal reconsider its refusal of his adjournment request. I directed that he \u201cmay speak to this matter [in-person] when the hearing resumes on March, 14, 2011\u2026\u201d Complainant counsel subsequently attended at a medical clinic and sent in a doctor\u2019s note indicating that he would not be able to attend the hearing. I then directed that he send someone in-person to the hearing to speak to the adjournment request, or if he could not attend, we could arrange for a Conference Call with him, the parties and me in person in the hearing room. He chose the latter. So on March 14, 2011, the hearing resumed in Toronto, with Complainant counsel (and his client) participating via teleconference.\n[17] What transpired on this date was truly bizarre. Complainant counsel explained that he had been ill with \u201cstomach flu\u201d for a month and that is why he missed the deadlines and didn\u2019t contact the Tribunal or the other parties. He also indicated that, despite the 3 \u00bd months that had transpired from the date of the Conference Call when his client was given additional time yet again to re-file motion materials to the date of this hearing date of March 14, 2011, he still did not have an expert\u2019s report from Dr. Malamed. The reason?: counsel had written a letter to the psychiatrist, but just learned that it was never actually sent to Dr. Malamed. He also indicated that if I did not grant the adjournment and the right to continue with the motion, he would have to go off the record, and put his insurer on notice of a possible negligence claim. The other parties agreed to a short adjournment (as Ms. Cassidy was in Oshawa with her counsel, and not in the hearing room) for the Complainant to retain new counsel, but vehemently opposed the Complainant being allowed to continue with the motion. The other parties submitted that I had given enough chances to the Complainant to file her materials, that 9 \u00bd months had transpired since the motion to re-open her case was first raised on May 31, 2010, and that Complainant counsel had returned to work and certainly, should have had his assistant contact the Tribunal and the other parties, if counsel was unable to do so himself. I agreed. I granted a one-month adjournment for Ms. Cassidy to get new counsel and to advise by then if she had done so. A hearing date would then be set. The motion would not proceed. I gave oral reasons.\n[18] The month passed, and no word from Ms. Cassidy or her new counsel, contrary to my Order. I then directed the Registry Officer to send a letter to the parties (Ms. Cassidy now being self-represented) arranging for a Case Management Conference Call to set new hearing dates. The Tribunal subsequently received a response from the parties, including Mr. Kelly, who indicated that he was now back on the record. I held the Conference Call and set new hearing dates for October 2011 to finish the hearing.\n[19] October came and the hearing proceeded relatively smoothly. We completed the evidence part. The parties asked that they be able to provide written final submissions, followed by brief oral argument via teleconference. I agreed. Filing deadlines and the Conference Call date for final submissions were set. I should add that Complainant counsel\u2019s conduct was fine during the hearing. My issue has been with his conduct before and after the October 2011 hearing.\n[20] The November 1, 2011 filing deadline for final submissions passed with no submissions received by the Complainant, or any communication for that matter. Once again, I directed the Registry Officer to contact Complainant counsel to find out what had happened; no response. I directed the other parties to file their written submissions on time, which they did. On November 28, 2012, the Tribunal finally heard from Complainant counsel, in the form of a letter asking for an extension (well after the November 1 deadline) to file written submissions and to adjourn the December 6, 2011 oral argument Conference Call, as he was to be in the Ontario Superior Court in Oshawa that day, notwithstanding the Tribunal date had been set first. The other parties vehemently opposed, indicating that this was the same type of behaviour from Complainant counsel as he had demonstrated in the past. They had suffered prejudice and wanted a conclusion to this hearing. I granted Complainant counsel\u2019s request to adjourn the Conference Call for oral argument with the condition that he contact Messrs. Machelak and Platt to find a replacement date for December and advise the Tribunal by December 9, 2011. I denied his request to file written submissions, but indicated that he would be allowed to make oral submissions. Not having heard from Complainant counsel as previously directed, the Tribunal wrote the parties on December 16, 2011 that if it does not hear back from Complainant counsel by December 19, \u201cit will deem the hearing concluded and begin writing its Reasons for Decision.\u201d I also instructed the Registry Officer to telephone Complainant counsel and if he was not available, to leave a voice-mail message indicating the contents of the letter. She spoke with his receptionist who confirmed the email address to which the Tribunal sent this and previous correspondence. She said that Complainant counsel would be in the office on December 19, 2011 and thus would be able to reply to the Tribunal\u2019s letter. On December 21, 2011, the Tribunal received a faxed letter dated the previous day from Complainant counsel indicating inter alia that he was \u201cin discoveries all day today\u201d but would respond tomorrow. He claimed that he never received the December 5, 2011 letter from the Tribunal. He subsequently wrote on December 23, 2011 that he would undertake to speak with the other representatives in January 2012 with a view to arriving at a January date for the final argument conference call. I then had the Tribunal send out a letter seeking the other parties\u2019 position. The other parties opposed the request. As Mr. Machelak had aptly stated, \u201cMr. Kelly chose to ignore that letter [of the Tribunal] as he has ignored other time lines set by the Tribunal.\u201d On January 19, 2012, a letter was sent to the parties indicating that I had denied the Complainant\u2019s request to re-open the hearing. The hearing remained closed.\n[21] I wish to state that I am very mindful of the difficulty and seriousness of concluding a hearing without receiving submissions from all parties. Indeed, in the over 14 years that I have adjudicated human rights cases at the federal and Ontario tribunals, and as an arbitrator\/mediator in private practice, this is the first time such an occurrence has taken place. However the key here, I believe, is not so much receiving final submissions from all parties, but having given a reasonable opportunity to all parties to make final submissions. And I believe that I have been more than fair to the Complainant to present her best case, and to the Respondents to mount their best defence. But at some point, enough is enough, after which, prejudice befalls a respondent and the Tribunal process itself. It almost becomes an abuse of the Tribunal\u2019s process and its ability to control its own process. The case law is replete with examples of courts dismissing cases (which is not the case here) for failing to follow their rules of procedure.\n[22] Furthermore, the case before me is one of sexual harassment. In our rights-based society, there is an inherent stigma attached to those accused of sexual harassment. Often the public does not even differentiate between allegations of sexual harassment and criminal sexual assault. In Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 1998 CanLII 13300, rev\u2019ed 2000 SCC 44, the B.C. Court of Appeal wrote at para. 57: \u201cDespite the often heard characterization of human rights adjudication as a mediative and conciliatory process aimed at remedying discrimination and making the victim whole as opposed to punishing the perpetrator, the fact remains that unproven charges of sexual harassment and sexual discrimination are, in our society, charges accompanied by high stigma. Such charges have the power to destroy lives.\u201d Not only is this of significance to Mr. Thambirajah, but there are employees (and former employees) at Canada Post whose reputations are left twisting in the wind regarding allegations involving their action (or inaction) in the handling of Ms. Cassidy\u2019s Complaint against the Corporation.\n[23] I also should add that the continuation of the motion to re-open the Complainant\u2019s case because of PTSD is really a moot point, given my finding later in these Reasons that A.B. was not at Willowdale Station \u201cD\u201d (\u201cWillowdale D\u201d) after the touching\/comment incident occurred at noon on November 9, 2005; therefore, she could not have attended the alleged meeting between her, Ms. Cassidy, and Messrs. Tidman and Sultan. Thus, the moving party would not have satisfied the third branch of the legal test in Vermette, supra. The three branches are:\n(1) It must be shown the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable [due] diligence for use at the trial;\n(2) The evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive; and\n(3) The evidence must be such as presumably to be believed, or in other words, it must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible.\n[24] Notwithstanding I did not receive final submissions from the Complainant, the viva voce and documentary evidence at the hearing, along with the Statements of Particulars and the actual Complaint forms, were sufficient for me to make findings of fact and law and determine issues of liability and remedy. One final note: mea culpa \u2013 I have taken ten months from the closing of the proceeding on January 19, 2012 to complete and issue my Reasons for Decision. I thank the parties for their patience.\nIV. Credibility [25] I refer to the often quoted case of Faryna v. Chorney, [1952] 2 D.L.R. 354 (B.C.C.A.) on the issue of credibility:\n\u2026\nOpportunities for knowledge, powers of observation, judgment and memory, ability to describe clearly what he has seen and heard, as well as other factors combine to produce what is called credibility.\n\u2026\nThe test must reasonably subject his [witness\u2019] story to an examination of its consistency with the probabilities that surround the currently existing conditions. In short, the real test of the truth of the story of a witness in such a case must be its harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions.\n[26] I have attempted to follow the above approach. As an adjudicator, I am mindful that the hearing room is an artificial environment where witnesses react in individual and different ways to the stresses of giving testimony, etc. Accordingly, their demeanour is used as only one indicium of credibility. More important is the content of their testimony and what they did, said and wrote (as documentary evidence is important too) regarding past events that form the basis of the subject matter of the Complaint before me, and how their evidence fares in the context of the totality of the evidence presented. I also wish to add that finding a witness credible or not does not mean necessarily that everything the witness says or writes is accepted or rejected. A witness may be testifying honestly, but still be mistaken in fact. I have tried to make sense of all the evidence and make findings of fact about what actually occurred.\n[27] I will make findings of credibility when dealing with various allegations in these Reasons. However, I wish to state that I had serious concerns about the credibility\/reliability of the evidence of the two key witnesses in this case: Ms. Cassidy and Mr. Thambirajah. Ms. Cassidy was evasive at times, and required questions to be repeated often. Witness Cam Tidman said she is not the \u201cbest communicator\u201d. I have taken this into account. I also find that there were key areas where she had conflicting evidence and omissions in her evidence. What she said at the hearing did not match what she had told Canada Post or the Commission, verbally and in her documents. Examples will be given in these Reasons. In some matters, I have no choice but to conclude that she fabricated, embellished or exaggerated things. My concern is such that I am hesitant to accept her evidence on key, controversial issues without cogent, corroborative evidence.\n[28] With regards to Mr. Thambirajah, I also have concerns about his credibility\/reliability. On some issues, he contradicted himself even within his own testimony. One example relates to the retaliation allegation in the parking lot during the hearing. Another is what actually happened on November 9, 2005. While English is not his first language, I am satisfied that he is sufficiently proficient in the English language to have participated in the hearing, including the giving of evidence. It is true that he is heavily accented and counsel, witnesses and I had difficulties understanding him. However, being heavily accented should not be confused with a lack of comprehension or proficiency in a language. Mr. Thambirajah has been in Canada for over 30 years, worked at Canada Post for 22 years and has been a shop steward with the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (\u201cCUPW\u201d) at Canada Post since 1998. In that capacity, he is interpreting complex legal documents like the Collective Agreement and a multitude of corporate and union policies and rules. He communicates in English and writes his journals and work documents in English too.\n[29] Another witness whose testimony caused me concern was John Pyziak. While some of his evidence was credible and reliable, in other areas that was not the case. For example, he provided four varying accounts of what took place on November 9, 2005, as found in: his statement to Canada Post\u2019s human rights investigator Kelly Edmunds; his statement to the Commission\u2019s investigator; his statements in a recorded meeting with Mr. Thambirajah; and his testimony at the hearing.\n[30] In contrast to the above, I find that Canada Post\u2019s witnesses were credible and their evidence fairly reliable or accurate. In particular, Ms. Edmunds and retired Superintendent Cam Tidman testified at great lengths and were key actors in the events herein. They were credible witnesses.\nV. Findings of Fact [31] Ms. Cassidy was a Relief Letter Carrier with Canada Post in 2005, stationed at Willowdale D. She remains with Canada Post to this day. She would fill in for regular letter carriers on their routes as the need arose. She did not \u201cown\u201d her route; she could be moved around on different routes and in different depots. Mr. Thambirajah was a Letter Carrier with Canada Post in 2005 at the same location as Ms. Cassidy. He was also the Union shop steward there.\nA. November 9, 2005: Touching\/Comment Incident [32] This is the genesis of Ms. Cassidy\u2019s Complaints. On or about November 9, 2005, she was at the Station talking with co-worker John Pyziak. Ms. Cassidy does not remember the exact date and did not record it anywhere. However she testified that she was \u201csure it was in early November\u201d of 2005. From documentary evidence too, including calendars, I find that it most likely took place on November 9, 2005. The Complainant said, \u201cIt was around noon\u2026in the afternoon after the [mail] walk\u2026Raj [Thambirajah] stayed around the Station after his work often.\u201d The timing is relevant as will be discussed later with the evidence of witness A.B. who testified that it was early in the morning before the carriers went out on their route. I find that it was indeed around noon when the incident occurred.\n[33] Ms. Cassidy indicated that the first description of the November 9, 2005 incident (including the actual date) was in one of her journals\/diaries. I reviewed the six of them that were produced. They were hundreds of pages in total. I saw no description of the event or date. She testified that it was in the journal that she gave to Detective Cecile. She stated that he did not return the journal. Detective Cecile testified that he reviewed the journals for relevancy regarding her request that Mr. Thambirajah be charged with sexual assault for that day\u2019s event. The detective testified that he did not remember any reference to an exact date or description of the events in the journal. Had he seen such a reference, he would have been obliged to refer to it in his report and provided it to the Crown to give to the defence and would have indicated the specific date in the police report. He said he checked with the \u201cproperty\/evidence\u201d room; the journal was not there either. I accept his evidence.\n[34] The first written account of the November 9, 2005 incident entered into evidence may be found in her April 25, 2006 written complaint to Canada Post. In it, she wrote that Mr. Thambirajah approached her and Mr. Pyziak:\nDuring this time my co-worker asked him why he was staring at my chest. Then, when my co-worker looked down and noticed a button was undone on my shirt my co-worker informed me of this. As I turned to fasten my shirt up Raj said- \u201cI wasn\u2019t staring at her chest, she has no tits to stare at.\u201d While he was saying this, he pulled down my shirt as to look down into my shirt. I was so mad, embarrassed and in shock of what just took place.\n[35] In her Complaint to the Commission she wrote: \u201cIn November of 2005, while I was working at Willowdale D a co-worker (Raj Thambirajah), pulled my shirt open in front of another co-worker.\u201d\n[36] As described by Ms. Cassidy at the hearing, she was talking with Mr. Pyziak, with whom she was on friendly terms. She was joking around with him. At one point, Mr. Thambirajah came in and according to the Complainant:\nRaj was staring at me. Johnny asked him what he was staring at\u2026He [Mr. Thambirajah] said she has no breasts to stare at. He [John Pyziak] said my buttons are undone. As I turned, he [Raj] took his fingers and pulled my shirt down\u2026and looked into my shirt\u2026One button popped open. I was embarrassed and humiliated\u2026My breasts were exposed. I told him never to touch me again, called him an ass. He pulled my shirt open, at that point, I just wanted to run. I was humiliated. Raj said, \u201cShe\u2019s got no boobs to look at.\u201d I said it doesn\u2019t matter, he shouldn\u2019t have touched me.\n[37] In cross-examination she was asked if she had said something to the effect of \u201cI have small boobs, I was always bugged in high school about that.\u201d She said she could not remember. But she reiterated that Mr. Thambirajah pulled her shirt open with his fingers and looked down her shirt. Regarding her breasts having been exposed, she said she was wearing a \u201chalf-cup bra\u201d. On the stand, she also physically demonstrated what had happened using a Canada Post shirt as a prop. She clearly showed the button being ripped open as Mr. Thambirajah \u201cripped\u201d open her shirt.\n[38] In the police report of October 14, 2006 for the sexual assault charge (R1-33), it states:\n[After Mr. Thambirajah joined the conversation with the Complainant and Mr. Pyziak] During this time [redacted by police] notice that [redacted] was staring at Cassidy\u2019s chest, [redacted] then looked at Cassidy and saw that a button on her shirt was undone, Cassidy quickly turned around to button up her shirt and that\u2019s when [redacted] said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t staring at her chest, she has no tits to stare at\u201d. While Thambirajah was saying this [redacted] reached in front of Cassidy grabbed the top of her shirt with [redacted] hand and pulled it downward and in doing so a third button came undone. Cassidy was so embarrassed and shocked she turned to walk away and called [redacted] an ass hole and also stated \u201cThis is just another reason why nobody likes you in this station.\u201d\nMr. Thambirajah\u2019s Evidence on this Point\n[39] Mr. Thambirajah\u2019s evidence on what, if anything, happened on that day changed by the end of the hearing. When questioned by Kelly Edmunds in her investigation in June 2006, he denied anything had happened. His Statement of Particulars filed at the hearing indicates: \u201cThe Respondent acknowledges inappropriate touching took place in November 2005 but denies any sexual assault on the Complainant\u2019s body and recalls the incident only as joking between co-workers.\u201d In explaining his client\u2019s theory at the hearing, Mr. Platt remarked: \u201cThe workplace conflict in April 2006 triggered the Complaint [about the November 9, 2005 incident]. The November 9, 2005 incident occurred, but not in the way described by Ms. Cassidy. It was consensual; flirtation.\u201d In his final submissions, Mr. Platt wrote at para. 6 of his Summary: \u201cNeither the Complainant nor any of the witnesses, including Mr. Pyziak, reported a sexual assault to Canada Post in November of 2005 because there wasn\u2019t one unless the brushing of Ms. Cassidy\u2019s blouse by the Respondent is considered to be a sexual assault.\u201d\n[40] In chief, Mr. Thambirajah testified that, \u201cIn November 2005 nothing happened.\u201d When asked if it was possible he made the comment on November 9 about her breasts, he answered, \u201cNo, I never do [sic] that. Maybe the swipe with the hand.\u201d Later, in chief, he was asked that, assuming the account of November 9, 2005 was accurate and he did in fact inappropriately touch and commented on the size of Ms. Cassidy\u2019s breasts, if he regretted it. He replied in the affirmative. \u201cWould you apologize? asked Mr. Platt. Mr. Thambirajah replied, \u201cI apologize if anyone thinks it was my intention to touch you for sexual purpose, a thousand times.\u201d\n[41] In his testimony under questioning by Mr. Machelak, Mr. Thambirajah averred:\nTouching may have occurred, but not in a sexual way. For some reason, Johnny, who was a good friend made a sweet deal with management\u2026to get me out of the station\u2026[\u201cswipe\u201d] happened before or after November 8 or 9. My hand did not make any contact with her shirt, maybe a swipe toward Johnny.\nWhen counsel asked why he said in-chief that something may have happened and he apologized, the Personal Respondent answered, \u201c\u2026may be possible I swiped Johnny Pyziak, may be possible I touched her hand. Johnny was holding her in an embrace. Possible I touched her on the arm.\u201d\n[42] In cross-examination, Mr. Thambirajah agreed that the touching\/comment, allegedly occurring on November 9, 2005, is inappropriate conduct if it occurred. However, he maintained that, \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen.\u201d What exactly he meant by \u201cit\u201d is not clear: i.e., if the touching and comment never happened; or the touching for a sexual purpose didn\u2019t happen; or the comment (about her breast size, etc.) did not take place. When Mr. Kelly suggested he is not really apologizing because he is saying he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, Mr. Thambirajah agreed. \u201cWhy apologize then?\u201d asked counsel. The Personal Respondent replied, \u201cIt\u2019s possible it may have happened before April 10 [2006]. We were joking around, laughing\u2026each other swearing.\u201d Pushed by counsel that it\u2019s possible the touching and comment on November 9 occurred, Mr. Thambirajah reacted, \u201cNo. I was asked to apologize [by Mr. Platt]. Better to apologize if I had done it. Never sorry because I never accept what I didn\u2019t do. No one lives in a perfect world\u2026Again, if it happened. I will apologize. English is not my first language. If I touched her body, but not her breast, I would apologize.\u201d Later, he remarked: \u201cI would be sorry if I intentionally touched her.\u201d He also stated that he was the \u201cvictim\u201d in this matter and the \u201cwhole story will come out.\u201d\n[43] Mr. Thambirajah then said it\u2019s possible, as Mr. Pyziak had claimed, that Mr. Thambirajah had \u201cswiped\u201d her chest with his hand: \u201cHe may be correct by his recollection.\u201d He then states that he could \u201cguarantee\u201d and is \u201c100 percent sure\u201d that it didn\u2019t occur on November 8 or 9, 2005 as it was not recorded in his journal [or hers for that matter]. His journal had an interaction between him, Ms. Cassidy and the late Ann Jones, a co-worker, on November 8, but no noted interaction with Ms. Cassidy on November 9.\nJohn Pyziak\u2019s Evidence on this Point\n[44] Mr. Pyziak was the only third party who saw what happened that day. Mr. Thambirajah said that he was \u201cbest friends\u201d with Mr. Pyziak and that the latter had been his campaign manager in the shop steward election. Mr. Pyziak said that he was friends with the Respondent until the latter \u201cchanged\u201d after he became shop steward. He still remained on friendly terms with Mr. Thambirajah thereafter. Mr. Pyziak was also friendly with the Complainant.\n[45] Mr. Pyziak testified that on the day in question:\nRaj wanted to go for cigarettes with me\u2026He didn\u2019t mean to, but he put his hand on her shirt\u2026I was just shocked. I don\u2019t know where Raj\u2019s mind was then. Doris reacted, \u201cMy family was flat-chested, in a funny way, but she was red-faced, shocked, she was embarrassed. She didn\u2019t slap him or anything\u2026She was nervous about it. She nervously laughed.\nMr. Pyziak stated that after the incident, he went to the back dock with Mr. Thambirajah and the Respondent said, \u201cAh, it\u2019s nothing. He just shoved it off.\u201d\n[46] Mr. Pyziak testified under cross-examination that he told Canada Post in an interview: \u201cI was shocked what he did. He reached out and jokingly said she had nothing there\u2026He sort of just did a swipe. His hand made contact with her shirt.\u201d At another moment in cross-examination, he averred: \u201cHe took a swipe at her, said she\u2019s got nothing there, his hand went down on her chest. He did not grab her. He touched her top.\u201d When put to him that he didn\u2019t know if it might have been accidental, and Ms. Cassidy didn\u2019t slap the Respondent, indeed she made a joke, why did you consider it \u201ctotally inappropriate,\u201d he answered, \u201cWhat Raj did \u2013 glancing touch and \u201cnothing there\u201d comment, was inappropriate. I was shocked what he did.\u201d He also admits that he did not stay with her after the incident: \u201cI would have gone to her if she was upset.\u201d\n[47] In Ms. Edmunds\u2019 notes of the interview with Mr. Pyziak dated July 12, 2006, she records him as saying:\nHe [Mr. Thambirajah] was staring at Doris (in the chest area). She realized her button was undone so when she did it up Raj reached over towards her and with his index finger he touched her blouse, pulled it forward and looked down her top. Doris didn\u2019t know what to do or say so I believe as a nervous reaction she started saying, Oh I have small boobs. I was always bugged about it in high school\u2026\u201d or something similar to that. After that, he walked away. I looked at Doris and said can you believe that he just did that to you. Shortly after this on the dock I saw Raj and I said to him \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that\u201d. I think Raj realized what he had done and just tried to fluff it off by saying \u201cOh this was nothing\u201d and he just made light of it.\n[48] Mr. Pyziak\u2019s written statement to the Commission dated September 19, 2007 was provided by Ms. Cassidy as part of her letter to the Commission after her Complaint was filed. In it, Mr. Pyziak writes:\nI notice him staring down her shirt so I asked him what he was looking at. He reply [sic] \u201cnothing, she as [sic] no breast to look at\u201d, I couldn\u2019t believe what he had done. As I turn around I noticed that Doris\u2019s top button was undone and informed her. Embarrassed she quickly turned to button it up but didn\u2019t have time before Raj reached out and ripped another button undone exposing her\u2026\nIn the Interview Notes of the Commission investigator dated September 12, 2008, it states that Mr. Pyziak indicated: \u201c\u2026I was talking to her and Raj put his finger in her shirt an [sic] pulled it back and said \u201cnothing there\u201d Doris turned all red and she was embarrassed\u2026\u201d\n[49] In cross-examination, Mr. Pyziak acknowledged that his September 19, 2007 written statement sent by Ms. Cassidy to the Commission was different in its recollection of the events of November 9, 2005 than his statement to Canada Post and to the Commission investigator. It was put to him that the statement to the Commission dated September 19, 2007 \u201cembellished\u201d the events. He replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t type it. I don\u2019t recall who gave it to me,\u201d although he acknowledges that it\u2019s his signature on it. The part \u201c\u2026Raj had reached out and ripped another button undone exposing her [breasts]\u201d is not what he indeed saw that day. He answered, \u201cExactly.\u201d Counsel then said, \u201cBut you signed it.\u201d \u201cI could have,\u201d retorted Mr. Pyziak. \u201cDoris wrote it and asked you to sign it and sent it to the Canadian Human Rights Commission,\u201d stated counsel. \u201cI don\u2019t recall,\u201d was the witness\u2019 answer.\n[50] Also entered into evidence were taped conversations of September 7-8, 2006 (unbeknownst to Mr. Pyziak) between the Personal Respondent and Mr. Pyziak. The quality of the tape is not good and there are parts that are inaudible. However, one can clearly hear Mr. Thambirajah quizzing Mr. Pyziak about what had happened on November 9, 2005. On the first part, Mr. Pyziak says that Mr. Thambirajah \u201cdidn\u2019t grab her. It didn\u2019t bother her. It\u2019s bullshit\u2026four months later she wants to charge you\u201d [it was actually 5 \u00bd months between the November 9, 2005 incident and Ms. Cassidy\u2019s April 25, 2006 written complaint to Canada Post]. On the tape the following day [again, Mr. Pyziak does not realize their meeting is being recorded] he repeated: \u201cYou didn\u2019t grab her\u2026Nothing is going to happen. Too long ago\u2026.She comes back later because she\u2019s mad about something [being disciplined along with Mr. Thambirajah for shouting\/profane language in April 2006]. Mr. Thambirajah then states, \u201cShe does this for an advantage\u2026undo my union work\u2026I don\u2019t want to be the victim because of my union work.\u201d Mr. Pyziak later remarks, \u201cIt\u2019s fucking bullshit\u2026Why didn\u2019t she complain to management? That\u2019s all you have to say.\u201d Later, Mr. Pyziak states, \u201cAnn Jones, that fucking witch\u2026you had problems with her. She [Ms. Jones] pushed that woman [Ms. Cassidy].\u201d Mr. Thambirajah replied, \u201cThat\u2019s the way it is.\u201d\n[51] In cross-examination about the taped conversation on September 8, 2006, Mr. Pyziak was asked what he meant by his constant comment \u201cthis is bullshit\u2026\u201d He replied, \u201cHe asked me thirty times, constant questioning by him about what happened\u2026He doesn\u2019t give up: thirty-two times he asked, \u201cHow did I touch her?\u201d When put to the witness that he said at least eight times it was \u201ca joking\u201d incident, yet he told Canada Post and the Commission a different story, he responded:\nI will give in to Raj\u2026I was being harassed by him to do it his way\u2026To get him off my back, agreeing with him, this is the kind of man he is\u2026he threatened me one day, my job\u2026it\u2019s part of the world he\u2019s from, the man rules\u2026[turning to Mr. Thambirajah in the hearing room he stated] Why didn\u2019t you just apologize for what you did? Not in his personality...To get this guy off your back, you had to play in his world. That\u2019s the truth...I was surprised he showed up [in-person on September 8]. That\u2019s how you deal with this guy. You go with the flow.\nHowever, as Mr. Machelak pointed out to the witness, he had invited Mr. Thambirajah to meet with him on September 8.\n[52] When I asked him what he meant by \u201cthis is bullshit,\u201d the witness said it was not that Ms. Cassidy\u2019s complaint and allegation regarding November 9, 2005 were \u201cbullshit,\u201d but that it referred to Mr. Thambirajah\u2019s harassment of Mr. Pyziak on the taped conversations: i.e., asking him what happened thirty times. Mr. Machelak questioned him on this point: \u201cAre you saying he turned off the tape recorder and then you said \u2018\u2026stop harassing me\u2019 and he cut it out of the tape and only left in the part, \u2018it\u2019s bullshit\u2026four months,\u2019 that he manipulated the tape?\u201d Surprisingly Mr. Pyziak answered, \u201cHe is very capable of doing that. I was agreeing with whatever he wanted to hear. That\u2019s why I never get into problems with him. I always agree with him.\u201d Mr. Pyziak also testified that the Respondent probably turned off the tape in parts.\nB. Canada Post\u2019s Investigation Report [53] In her investigation report and findings dated September 1, 2006, Ms. Edmunds found that Ms. Cassidy\u2019s complaint had merit. She stated that the account of \u201cwitness A\u201d (Mr. Pyziak) \u201csubstantiates\u201d Ms. Cassidy\u2019s version of the November 9, 2005 incident. She wrote:\nThis witness also substantiates that the Respondent did reach out, pull her blouse his index finger and look down her top. Although the Witness could [sic] [not] recall any words being utter [sic] by the Respondent such as \u201cI wasn\u2019t staring at her chest, she has not tits to stare at\u201d, he does recall the Complainant looking dumbfounded and shocked in disbelief\u2026\n[54] Ms. Edmunds in her report also notes that Mr. Thambirajah denied the event ever occurred and that he was away from Willowdale D for part of the month of November 2005. Ms. Edmunds writes in her report that Canada Post attendance records for the month of November 2005 show that Mr. Thambirajah was at Willowdale D every day in full or in part, except November 2 and 21 only.\nC. Findings About What Happened on November 9, 2005 [55] Based on the foregoing, I do not accept in their entirety the version of any of the three principal actors in this episode \u2013 Ms. Cassidy, Mr. Thambirajah and Mr. Pyziak. Ms. Cassidy\u2019s testimony does not match her prior statements and other documentary evidence. Mr. Pyziak\u2019s testimony lessens what occurred: a \u201cswiping\u201d of her shirt over the chest area vs. Mr. Thambirajah grabbing her shirt with his index finger, pulling it toward him and looking down her shirt. It is clear from the taped conversations that Mr. Pyziak was indeed telling Mr. Thambirajah what he wanted to hear: e.g., \u201cit\u2019s bullshit Raj,\u201d meaning her complaint was being raised for the first time in April 2006. Mr. Pyziak was clearly being disingenuous. As well, what he told Ms. Edmunds is somewhat different from his testimony.\n[56] What about Mr. Thambirajah\u2019s account of November 9, 2005? It goes from outright denial to quasi-admission of touching. I put aside Mr. Platt\u2019s submissions which vary greatly at the start of the hearing to his final submissions, and what is in the Statement of Particulars. Mr. Thambirajah in his testimony contradicted himself, in his direct examination and cross-examination and even within parts of his cross-examination. I am left with the view that, he goes from a complete denial of the event in his statement to Ms. Edmunds, to testifying that the touching or \u201cswiping\u201d of Ms. Cassidy\u2019s blouse over the chest area might have been accidental. However, according to him, if he did do that, he did not have the intention of touching her in a sexual way. And hence his \u201cnon-apology apology\u201d as stated in his direct examination and cross-examination by Mr. Kelly. I conclude that Mr. Thambirajah made a de facto admission that some form of touching occurred as evidenced in his testimony. As well, Mr. Pyziak testified that in the recorded conversations in September 2006 the Personal Respondent asked him thirty-two times how he touched Ms. Cassidy. Regarding the \u201cshe has no tits to look at\u201d comment, he flatly denied that. There was no quasi-admission, even a nuanced or qualified one, regarding it.\n[57] Based on the foregoing, I am satisfied that on or about November 9, 2005, Mr. Thambirajah did touch Ms. Cassidy\u2019s shirt over her chest area with his hand, while making a comment about the size of her breasts. There was definite physical contact between his hand and her shirt over the chest area. I need not decide if it was a \u201cswipe\u201d or \u201cglancing touch\u201d. It was not an accident. It was an intentional inappropriate touching of her shirt on the chest area along with an inappropriate sexual comment about the size of her breasts. I will deal with the legal implications of this further on in these Reasons.\nMs. Cassidy\u2019s Reaction\n[58] I am satisfied that Ms. Cassidy did make a joke about her family members having small chests, but also let Mr. Thambirajah know that his touching\/comment were not welcomed or appreciated. I also accept that Mr. Pyziak made some comment at the time to Ms. Cassidy and afterward in the dock with Mr. Thambirajah that unequivocally conveyed to both of them that Mr. Pyziak was \u201cshocked\u201d at what had happened. Ms. Cassidy testified that she, on that same day, made a complaint against Mr. Thambirajah to her supervisors, Cam Tidman and Moe Sultan. I will deal with this issue later in this section.\nD. November 10, 2005 \u2013 April 9, 2006: Interaction Between the Complainant and Respondent [59] There was some interaction between Ms. Cassidy and Mr. Thambirajah during this period following the touching\/comment incident. In her testimony, Ms. Cassidy stated that he was bothering or \u201charassing\u201d her frequently: \u201cpretty much every day at work he did something [from November 9, 2005 to 2006]. She claims that in December 2005 she nearly fell over a mail \u201ctub\u201d in the depot and Mr. Thambirajah said, \u201cAt least you have an ass.\u201d Mr. Thambirajah denied this. There is no corroboration of this event. I am not prepared to find that it occurred.\n[60] What was their relationship like before November 9, 2005? I find that the Complainant and Personal Respondent were on good, friendly, cordial terms. They were not in a constant state of conflict in the workplace. Neither disputes that, before November 9, 2005, this was the case. For example, I accept the entry as being accurate in Mr. Thambirajah\u2019s journal for November 8, 2005 (one day before the touching\/comment incident): \u201c\u2026Doriss [sic] pass by Joke around with me\u2026\u201d\n[61] Regarding post-November 9, 2005 through to April 10, 2006 (when the conflict escalated), what was the state of their workplace relationship? There was conflicting evidence about this. Notwithstanding the events of November 9, 2005 to which I have found Ms. Cassidy did not welcome, I find that Ms. Cassidy and Mr. Thambirajah were not in a constant state of conflict. As Canada Post points out, she did not take off a single day of work because of the November 9 incident and did not claim any such days in her \u201clost wage\u201d claim against Canada Post during this time period (Exhibit C1-31). The first day claimed there is April 12, 2006. The detailed clinical notes of her family doctor, Dr. Ung, do not demonstrate conflict between her and Mr. Thambirajah during that time period.\n[62] As well, I find that she sought Mr. Thambirajah\u2019s assistance several times during this period, despite her claims that she was afraid of him during this period. For example, Mr. Thambirajah testified that on November 15, 2005 \u2013 less than one week after the November 9 incident \u2013 Ms. Cassidy approached him to help her fill out a leave form (Exhibit RT1-10, p. 10). The handwriting on the form is his. She denied that she ever sought his assistance during this time period. However, in cross-examination she replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not my writing.\u201d Later, she said, \u201cNot a writing expert, could be possible. I definitely wouldn\u2019t have asked him because of the event that happened that month [November 9].\u201d Further yet she stated, \u201cI would not go to Raj to help me. Would have asked Jim Steward, Ann Jones or Cam\u2026I did not ask him [Mr. Thambirajah].\u201d I do not accept that Mr. Thambirajah would have filled out that form for no reason and without Ms. Cassidy\u2019s request for assistance. The form is signed by Ms. Cassidy.\n[63] I also accept the evidence that Mr. Thambirajah assisted her on December 29, 2005. His journal entry for that date says, \u201cDorris [sic] claimed she has migraine headache so I arranged to cover her PM\u201d. This reinforces that Ms. Cassidy was not fearful of Mr. Thambirajah at this time and was on cordial terms with him, notwithstanding what had occurred on November 9. She sought his assistance as shop steward. I should add that there was nothing improper about her seeking the assistance of her shop steward and co-worker.\n[64] Entries in Mr. Thambirajah\u2019s 2006 journals for the days of January 3 and 10 show that he was assisting Ms. Cassidy. The January 10 entry involved Ms. Cassidy making an inappropriate comment about a disabled co-worker. Mr. Thambirajah had her apologize and he did not report the incident to management. The Complainant admits to this incident having occurred. If the relationship had been poisoned at this point, it would have been an opportune time for Mr. Thambirajah to have reported Ms. Cassidy to management. He did not.\n[65] On January 19, 2006 to March 20, 2006, the Complainant was away from work due to a shoulder injury.\nE. The Conflict Intensifies in April 2006 [66] Mr. Thambirajah\u2019s theory of his defence includes the proposition that the conflict between him and Ms. Cassidy began in April 2006. I have already found that the unwelcome, inappropriate touching\/comment incident took place on November 9, 2005. I also find that for the most part, their relationship was a cordial one from that period until April 10, 2006. That is when the conflict intensified between them. What happened?\n[67] On April 10, 2006 it is undisputed that the Complainant and Personal Respondent got into a swearing match over the delivery of flyers. Ms. Cassidy was covering for Mr. Thambirajah on his route. The Personal Respondent testified that Ms. Cassidy told him to \u201cfuck off\u201d when asked to deliver the flyers. She testified that he responded in kind. The following day they got into an argument at a union meeting wherein Ms. Cassidy demanded of another member that he bring Mr. Thambirajah outside or she was going to have him \u201ccharged\u201d. On April 12, 2006, again they got into a verbal argument. Mr. Thambirajah swore at Ms. Cassidy and she booked off sick the rest of that day.\n[68] On April 18, 2006, Ms. Cassidy alleges that Mr. Thambirajah \u201ctouched, slapped me on the backside\u201d and said, \u201cAt least you have an ass.\u201d At another time, she said that he used the term \u201cgrabbed\u201d [her buttocks]. She said this was the most upsetting of his wrongs against her after the November 9, 2005 incident. Mr. Thambirajah denies the accusation. In cross-examination she was asked why this serious incident of touching her buttocks was never documented in her April 25, 2006 written complaint to Canada Post (only the comment was), or indeed why she didn\u2019t have him criminally charged. She replied, \u201cSometimes you hit a brick wall, no use to pursuing it.\u201d However, as pointed out, she was assertive in pursuing her rights at other times and for less serious infractions. Indeed, she did not even mention the \u201cslapping\/grabbing\u201d incident in her evidence-in-chief. She eventually said that with regard to her failure to put it in her April 25, 2006 complaint to Canada Post, \u201c\u2026If I didn\u2019t, it was a big oversight on my part.\u201d Later she testified that \u201cmore likely\u201d the \u201cback-slapping\u201d took place in December 2005, not on April 18, 2006, \u201cbecause that\u2019s when everything was happening.\u201d Counsel noted that she only worked with Mr. Thambirajah for two days in December of 2005 and may not have even seen him on those two days. I find that she was evasive in this part of her testimony and her answers lacked believability. A sexual touching incident like this she does not remember, but only the less invasive verbal comment. And yet she also remembers much less serious wrongs against her by Mr. Thambirajah (i.e., not involving touching) in her April 25, 2006 complaint. On a balance of probabilities, I am not willing to find that this event occurred as described by Ms. Cassidy.\n[69] The next significant event took place on April 19, 2006. Ms. Cassidy and Mr. Thambirajah were overheard by co-workers yelling and swearing at each other in the hall at Willowdale D. It was so bad that Superintendent Cam Tidman got complaints from other workers. He intervened. Mr. Tidman called in both of them for interviews and proceeded to discipline them. He issued a warning to them and placed it in their respective files. Ms. Cassidy testified that she was quite upset about this, saying it was not fair that she got disciplined for this, even though she admits to having sworn at the Personal Respondent in the hallway. She was upset because of what she claims he had been subjecting her to previously, specifically, the November 9, 2005 incident and \u201congoing harassment\u201d.\n[70] Mr. Tidman testified that Ms. Cassidy\u2019s response to him about the April \u201cswearing\u201d episodes was, \u201cYou expect me to deliver the walk and he\u2019s not co-operating.\u201d There was no mention of the November 9, 2005 incident or Canada Post not dealing with it \u201cin-house\u201d as promised. Mr. Tidman said he could not ignore and fail to act on the yelling\/swearing incident of April 19, 2006. And this is no more serious than the November 9, 2005 touching and comment incident.\nF. April 25, 2006 Written Complaint to Canada Post [71] This is a significant date in this matter. On this date, Ms. Cassidy presented Mr. Tidman with a written complaint regarding the November 9, 2005 touching\/comment incident and other allegations of ongoing harassment by Mr. Thambirajah. Ms. Cassidy said that she had waited 5 \u00bd months since November 9, 2005 for Canada Post to deal with this incident, but to no avail. She said when she complained about it on November 9 to Messrs. Tidman and Sultan, she was told that they would handle it and to keep it \u201cin-house\u201d. Mr. Sultan did not testify. For Mr. Tidman\u2019s part, he was vehement in his testimony that April 25, 2006 was the first time he learned of the November 9, 2005 incident.\nG. Did Canada Post Know About the November 9 Incident Before April 25, 2006? [72] Ms. Cassidy was adamant in her testimony that she went by herself into the shared office of Messrs. Tidman and Sultan on November 9, 2005 and told them what had happened. I note that there is no mention of this in her voluminous, detailed journals. I will deal later with her allegation on May 31, 2010 after she had closed her case at the hearing, that an employee from another depot, A.B., had taken her to Messrs. Tidman\u2019s and Sultan\u2019s office and attended that meeting with her.\n[73] Mr. Tidman was examined in-chief and in cross quite extensively on this point. He did not relent from his position that April 25, 2006, not November 9, 2005, was when he first learned of the incident, and he was floored by it. He stated:\nShe didn\u2019t come in [on November 9, 2005 or at anytime] and definitely no one said anything about a sexual assault or touching. Moe and I were in the same office\u2026No, not at all [to the question of whether Moe Sultan had ever talked to him about this incident or whether Ms. Cassidy had ever come in to see him]. Moe and I had a good relationship. If there was a problem, I would have heard about it.\nHe did say Ms. Cassidy would come in to talk to him, but about her personal problems, like her daughter\u2019s chronic illness.\nH. Mr. Tidman\u2019s Actions Upon Receiving the April 25 Complaint and the \u201cComedy of Errors\u201d [74] Mr. Tidman averred that April 25, 2006 was, \u201cMy first exposure to the incident and it shocked me. I never had to deal with this in my working life. I sent an email to Kelly [Edmunds] saying I have a human rights complaint, bigger than what we would normally deal with\u2026so leave it to the experts.\u201d\n[75] Mr. Tidman also stated that the problem between the Complainant and Personal Respondent \u201cfirst became evident in April 2006 with the shouting match. I was not aware of the touching [on November 9, 2005] until the complaint in April. I would have been over the wall if someone said someone assaulted Doris physically.\u201d He said that his and Moe Sultan\u2019s strategy of handling conflict was to have the employees try to work it out themselves. If they couldn\u2019t, Mr. Sultan or he would step in and impose a solution. However, he was quite adamant that that approach did not apply to serious matters, such as \u201cfights, sexual harassment and sexual touching.\u201d This was in keeping with Canada Post\u2019s harassment policy. Such \u201cserious matters\u201d would \u201cturn on the radar\u201d for him. He said, \u201cWhen I got her complaint in April, I read it three times, to get my brain unscrambled.\u201d He also denies that the late Ann Jones ever came to him about the November 2005 incident.\nI. Stressors in Ms. Cassidy\u2019s Life [76] Mr. Tidman was candid about a change in Ms. Cassidy\u2019s demeanour that he noticed from November 2005 to April 25, 2006: \u201cShe was less easy going, more stressed. I associated some of this to her daughter\u2026Doris was different...\u201d As will be discussed later, Ms. Cassidy during this time period and beyond, up to 2009, as demonstrated in her testimony, her journal notations and Dr. Ung\u2019s clinical notes, was experiencing great stress from a number of sources. She was also prescribed Prozac to deal with depression. This stress included family problems with her common law partner, her daughter\u2019s illness and other health issues, her workplace injuries and absences from work in 2006, her fear of being fired from Canada Post, sleeping problems, and chronic migraine headaches. And of course she became increasingly stressed from her allegations of ongoing harassment by Mr. Thambirajah, which will be discussed later, intensifying after April 2006 and continuing up to 2009. While I find that she was dealing with great stress in her life during this time \u2013 personal and work-related - I note that there is no notation in Dr. Ung\u2019s clinical notes from November 17, 2005-February 2, 2006 referring to stress at work. He acknowledged at the hearing that from the period of November 2005-May 5, 2006, she had not mentioned the issue of sexual harassment by Mr. Thambirajah to him, for if she did, he would have documented it, as he had with other issues, including stressors like her daughter\u2019s illness and other health issues.\nJ. The Alleged Meeting Between Ms. Cassidy and Her Supervisors (and A.B.) [77] As indicated above, Ms. Cassidy has consistently maintained that on the day of the touching\/comment incident on November 9, 2005, she went to the office of Superintendent Tidman and Supervisor Sultan to file a complaint. She says that she was told that they would handle it and to keep it \u201cin-house\u201d. Mr. Tidman denies this. Mr. Sultan did not testify.\n[78] It was only after her case closed in-chief that on May 31, 2010 - for the first time in the almost five years that had elapsed - that Ms. Cassidy indicated that there was another person in that meeting, A.B., an employee from another depot who happened to be at Willowdale D on November 9, 2005. Ms. Cassidy said that on the weekend after her case had closed, she was at her friend\u2019s house \u2013 George and Pattie Tomaszewski, both witnesses at the hearing - and A.B. had asked the Complainant why she hadn\u2019t called her as a witness at the hearing. Ms. Cassidy asked why? The witness replied because she was in a meeting with the Complainant and her supervisors complaining about Mr. Thambirajah\u2019s sexual harassment of her on November 9. Ms. Cassidy then sought to re-open her case and call A.B. to testify. Ms. Cassidy said that she never remembered anything about A.B. being there because she \u2013 Ms. Cassidy \u2013 was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d).\n[79] Canada Post disputed the above, including whether A.B. was even at Willowdale D that day. I agreed as a preliminary step to the motion to hear from A.B. and Canada Post\u2019s witnesses on this issue to determine if she was even in the depot on the day in question.\nA.B. and the November 9 Incident at Willowdale D\n[80] In November of 2005, A.B., a close friend of Patti Tomaszewski who is a close friend of the Complainant, was a relief letter carrier at Thornhill station, known as West Beaver Creek. She testified that on the day in question \u2013 she could not remember the exact date and never made a written note of the events \u2013 she was asked by a supervisor (she cannot remember which one) to pick up or drop off \u201cmis-sorts\u201d in the morning, between 7:30 and 9 a.m. at Willowdale D. When she arrived, she ran into the Complainant who appeared \u201cupset\u201d and \u201cagitated\u201d and was crying. She told her what had happened with Mr. Thambirajah. The witness then insisted that they go to Mr. Tidman\u2019s office and report the incident. A.B. said she sat in the meeting with them when the Complainant told Messrs. Tidman and Sultan what had happened.\n[81] In cross-examination, counsel for Canada Post made the point that she never made notes of that day, including the alleged meeting. She replied \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was important.\u201d He suggested that the other Canada Post witnesses indicated that it would not make sense from a financial perspective to have sent her to Willowdale D and back when the practice was to send a taxi one-way to collect or drop off mis-sorts or to have it sent downtown to be redistributed for the next day. She replied, \u201cI did what I was asked. Did what I was told. I was a relief letter carrier. If a supervisor tells you, even pulls you off a route, you did it, \u2018do you what you are told, grieve later.\u2019\u201d \u201cBut you didn\u2019t claim overtime here\u2026and in a claim for overtime form you would state the reason why,\u201d retorted Mr. Machelak. \u201cYes, you must have a detailed reason why you are claiming it [overtime]\u2026I always put it down in very detailed form,\u201d said the witness. However that was not the case here. Counsel then put it to her that the records filed at the hearing showed that she covered route 51 that week, a foot walk and didn\u2019t mention going to Willowdale D to pick up or drop off mail mis-sorts. A.B. said that it took almost twenty minutes by van to reach Willowdale D at around 8 a.m.\n[82] Counsel came back to the point: \u201cIt makes no sense to pay a carrier overtime to do that when the normal practice was to send a taxi, only a 1-way trip. And you don\u2019t recall putting in for overtime and this would not be considered eligible for \u2018emergency over time\u2019.\u201d A.B. retorted, \u201cThen I have been robbed of a lot of overtime.\u201d Counsel then remarked that the witness had claimed for overtime for November 8 and 9, writing \u201cvolume\u201d and \u201cunion meeting\u201d. Counsel said union meetings are usually in the mornings. She responded, \u201cNot always.\u201d But the point was that A.B. did not mark down on the form the trip to Willowdale D. I asked the witness, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you put \u2018pick up mis-sorts\u2019 or something to that effect on the overtime form?\u201d A.B. replied, \u201cI can\u2019t begin to tell you. Sometimes I changed locks but didn\u2019t put it down. If today, I would put specifics and \u2018mis-sorts\u2019.\u201d\n[83] On the question of the timing of the incident on November 9, 2005, counsel put it to A.B. that the Complainant testified that the incident with Mr. Thambirajah occurred at noon. A.B. answered, \u201cThat surprises me. I remember being there in the morning.\u201d Counsel stated, \u201cWillowdale D is a very small station. At 8 a.m. wouldn\u2019t she be surrounded by co-workers. But none of them comes to her and say \u2018Doris why are you crying?\u2019 You say it takes a stranger to come to her and ask her why?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t see any co-workers around her,\u201d replied A.B.\n[84] Mr. Machelak then asked: \u201cYou wrote that you stayed with Ms. Cassidy for another 15 minutes, 40 minutes there and back, a smoke break 10 minutes, 10 minutes in the office with Mr. Tidman, etc., and another 15 with her after that. When you came back, no one questioned you about the time away, longer than expected?\u201d She agreed.\n[85] Canada Post called Christopher Moore to give evidence. He is a supervisor currently at Willowdale depot 2 (not to be confused with Willowdale D) and was the \u201cLC supervisor\u201d at Thornhill station, in November of 2005. This was the station where A.B. was posted at that time. He described what mis-sorts are and the process for dealing with them. Simply put, \u201cmis-sorts\u201d are items of mail that arrive at the wrong Canada Post facility. They are brought to a supervisor\u2019s attention in the morning. The policy\/practice is for the depot to call a taxi company, fill out a taxi chit, give it to the \u201ccabbie\u201d with the mail and s\/he would deliver it to the right depot. \u201cThat was the quickest way to get it to the other station. You\u2019re trying to get it out so it\u2019s not miscommitted for that day. From 8:30-9:30 the letter carriers go out. Get the mis-sorts there before 8 a.m.\u201d He said they were cognizant of the cost implications too.\n[86] When A.B.\u2019s assertion was put to him, Mr. Moore responded:\nIf Willowdale D supervisor called me, I would say \u2018put it in a cab.\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t send an employee or put an employee in a cab. I would have to pay a 2-way trip and wouldn\u2019t take a letter carrier off their route and [A.B.] was scheduled to work route 51\u2026 Would never have done that, taken the LC off the route. The LC would expect over time.\n[87] Mr. Machelak told Mr. Moore that the alleged incident took place at noon on November 9, 2005 at Willowdale D: \u201cIf there were mis-sorts at Willowdale D, would anyone pick them up at noon to bring them back to the other station?\u201d The witness, looking surprised, responded: \u201cNo, they would already be miscommitted for that day and would just sit there to the next day\u2026Just send it back downtown and send it out on truck the next day between midnight and 8 a.m.\u201d\n[88] In cross-examination, the witness was asked, \u201cAre you saying that no employees were ever asked to go out to get mis-sorts?\u201d He responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know any who did. I certainly didn\u2019t send any out. Carriers were sent to other stations if they need someone else to do a route, \u2018up or down staffing\u2019 that morning, but not to deliver mis-sorts.\u201d\n[89] Canada Post also called Gwen Kenyon to testify. She is the Superintendent for Thornhill and before that was the Superintendent for training for the division and prior to that, the Superintendent of sortation plants. She worked at Canada Post for 34 years. She searched Canada Post\u2019s computer database for any overtime claimed by A.B. from November 7-9, 2005. The database shows that she claimed for overtime, but not for attending at Willowdale D. The entries show she worked at Thornhill station during those three days, regular or overtime. The witness was asked: if A.B. had gone to Willowdale D to pick up mail causing her to incur overtime, would that be listed along with the reason? Ms. Kenyon replied in the affirmative. In cross-examination, the witness was asked if it\u2019s possible that the supervisor would ask the letter carrier \u201cas a favour\u201d to drop this off to another depot? The witness answered, \u201cFor free? Don\u2019t know any of those employees. They wouldn\u2019t get paid for it\u2026And in 2005, claiming for overtime was more aggressive than now\u2026makes no sense, time and dollar wise, never heard of it\u2026\u201d\n[90] Ms. Kenyon also corroborated Mr. Moore\u2019s testimony regarding the system for dealing with \u201cmis-sorts.\u201d\n[91] I find that A.B. did not attend at Willowdale D on November 9, 2005, the day of the incident for the following reasons:\n(1) As the Complainant herself testified, the incident took place at around noon. A.B. testified that she arrived there in the morning around 9 a.m.;\n(2) I accept the evidence of Canada Post\u2019s witnesses that a supervisor would not have sent a carrier to pick up or deliver \u201cmis-sorts\u201d. S\/he would have used a one-way taxi fare; and\n(3) Had A.B. attended on that day, she would have claimed overtime for her attendance at Willowdale D, as she did for other tasks that day.\nK. When Did Canada Post First Learn of the November 9 Incident? [92] On the important question of when Canada Post first became aware of the November 9, 2005 touching\/comment incident, I find that Canada Post first learned of it on April 25, 2006 when Ms. Cassidy gave her written complaint to Mr. Tidman. I find Mr. Tidman to be a credible witness and his evidence reliable. He was candid about the less than perfect response to Ms. Cassidy\u2019s complaint post-April 25. He is retired and no longer employed by Canada Post.\n[93] As well, I accept the evidence that both Mr. Sultan and Ms. Edmunds had asked Ms. Cassidy on different occasions \u2013 the former on May 16, 2006 and the latter when she spoke to Ms. Cassidy on May 14, 2006 \u2013 why she had not reported it earlier. In neither conversation did the Complainant correct them and say that she had in fact reported it to Messrs. Tidman and Sultan on the day of the incident. Ms. Edmunds testified, and consistent with her September 1, 2006 investigation report, that when she asked the Complainant why she had waited over five months to report it to Canada Post, \u201cMs. Cassidy stated that she didn\u2019t want to pursue the matter further because she was shocked and dumbfounded that Mr. Thambirajah would even have had the nerve to have done what he did and secondly he was the steward in the facility and he could cause a lot of difficulties for her\u2026\u201d\n[94] Mr. Tidman had acted on less serious matters, including calling Ms. Edmunds on April 12 or 13, 2006 regarding the swearing\/language incidents. Ms. Edmunds testified about her dealing with him for ten years, including his practice of calling her on certain human rights matters less significant than the November 9 touching\/comment incident. Mr. Tidman and other managers were trained to call the Human Rights Officer at Canada Post if a CHRA-type matter arose. As well, I do not believe that Messrs. Tidman and Sultan would have had Ms. Cassidy \u201ccover\u201d for Mr. Thambirajah\u2019s route in April 2006 if they had been aware of the November 9 incident.\nL. What Happened After April 25, 2006: The \u201cComedy of Errors\u201d and Miscommunication [95] Mr. Tidman, who has since retired from Canada Post, was candid about its handling of Ms. Cassidy\u2019s April 25, 2006 complaint. He was asked how long it took management to respond to the complaint after he sent the email to Ms. Edmunds on that same day. He remarked, \u201cThe emails tell the story. I was disappointed by the slow response with people I was dealing with. Kelly wasn\u2019t in the office for awhile. I wished things had worked out differently\u2026My hands were tied\u2026The wheel didn\u2019t turn\u2026\u201d\n[96] I accept Mr. Tidman\u2019s evidence that he immediately mailed Ms. Cassidy\u2019s April 25 complaint to Ms. Edmunds. To my surprise, he stated that Willowdale D did not have a fax machine or scanner back in November 2005. He also sent an email to Ms. Edmunds \u201csaying I have a human rights complaint and need direction.\u201d After he hadn\u2019t heard anything for 4-5 days, Mr. Tidman sent a follow-up email to Ms. Edmunds\u201d and copied to acting zone manager Joanne Coe. On May 12, he sent a further email to Ms. Edmunds to \u201cexpedite\u201d the complaint as Ms. Cassidy was complaining of stress with Mr. Thambirajah.\n[97] Why hadn\u2019t Ms. Edmunds responded? She testified that she had been away from the office from April 28 to May 16, 2006 on business. The complaint that Mr. Tidman had mailed apparently arrived on approximately April 28. Ms. Edmunds had no assistant, so the envelope was left in her office unopened, until she returned on May 16. Coinciding with this were the swearing\/verbal altercations between the Complainant and Personal Respondent between April 10-19, 2006. Ms. Edmunds had spoken with Mr. Tidman about these at the time. The \u201cComedy of Errors\u201d \u2013 to use Ms. Edmunds\u2019 phrase during her testimony \u2013 was that when Mr. Tidman had left voice mail and email messages for her, she had (incorrectly) assumed they were about the April swearing incidents, and not about the touching incident that had happened some six months earlier. And so when Mr. Tidman on May 3 had emailed her: \u201cDoris Cassidy is asking where things stand now. Any feed-back?\u201d her response on May 9 was, \u201cCam, I have no updates right now. In fact, I have been out of the office tied up with opther [sic] cases. I will call you tomorrow to discuss further.\u201d And again on May 12, Mr. Tidman emailed Ms. Edmunds: \u201cI have Doris in my office as I write this. She is telling me that the stress surrounding her concerning this issue and her daily contact with \u201cRaj\u201d is affecting her at and after work. Can anything be done to expedite this complaint?\u201d At this point, Ms. Edmunds testified that she was still unaware of the April 25 complaint regarding the November 9, 2005 incident and thought Mr. Tidman was referring to the April 2006 swearing\/verbal altercations between them. I accept her evidence on this point. Further in my Reasons, I write about the legal implications of this \u201ccomedy of errors\u201d.\n[98] It was not until the following weekend that Ms. Edmunds became aware of what Mr. Tidman\u2019s emails were all about. On Sunday, May 14, she got a call at home from a frantic Ms. Cassidy. It was during this conversation that Ms. Edmunds got an \u201caha\u201d moment, realizing this was not about the April swearing incidents. After questioning her, Ms. Edmunds became aware of the November 9, 2005 allegations for the first time.\n[99] Ms. Edmunds began her investigation in June 2006, conducting interviews with witnesses to the November 9 incident in June and July. Her investigation report with findings and recommendations is dated September 1, 2006. She found in Ms. Cassidy\u2019s favour regarding both groups of allegations against Mr. Thambirajah: first, the November 9 \u201cinappropriate touching\u201d incident; and second, \u201callegations regarding inappropriate behavior and language,\u201d including profanity and \u201cinterfering with her movement in and around the workplace.\u201d She made some recommendations of discipline.\nMissing the 10-Day Period\n[100] Ms. Edmunds testified that she could not impose discipline on employees. She made recommendations and it was up to the appropriate managers to impose any discipline. Importantly, Article 10 (\u201cDiscipline, Suspension and Discharge\u201d) of the Collective Agreement imposes a requirement that management must give 10 days\u2019 notice after the \u201calleged infraction\u201d in question or of its \u201ccoming to the attention\u201d of the employer to impose discipline. The 10-day period for the April 25, 2006 triggering notice was approximately May 5, 2006 according to Ms. Edmunds. I also heard evidence that management could \u201cfreeze the clock\u201d if certain steps were taken. They were not done in this case. So, because of the \u201ccomedy of errors,\u201d the 10-day period was missed. What was the impact? First, Ms. Edmunds testified that she would have recommended that Mr. Thambirajah be suspended without pay for five days. The other recommendations \u2013 training, letter on file for one year, etc. \u2013 were also not binding on Mr. Thambirajah. However, he did agree to take a human rights training course (two years later). He was on \u201ccompany time\u201d and paid while taking this course. The letter stayed in his file for one year only, under the terms of the Collective Agreement.\n[101] From May 15-October 16, 2006, Ms. Cassidy was off work from an injury, unrelated to her interactions with Mr. Thambirajah. Mr. Thambirajah\u2019s last day at Willowdale D was on May 18, 2006. He was transferred to another station as part of an accommodative measure, unrelated to his interactions with Ms. Cassidy. From that period on, they never worked at the same station again. I also accept the evidence that from April 25-May 23, 2006, the Complainant and Personal Respondent did not interact even once.\nM. Other Actions Taken by Canada Post After April 25, 2006 Bidding\/Transferring Out of Willowdale D\n[102] Ms. Cassidy alleges that she repeatedly asked Candace Carpenter, staffing officer for seven stations, and had asked Joanne Coe, acting zone manager at the time, to transfer her out of Willowdale D because of the harassment by the Personal Respondent.\n[103] Ms. Carpenter testified the Complainant called her on numerous occasions and had met with her. She indeed asked to be transferred, but not because of her conflict with Mr. Thambirajah. That was never raised. The witness said the reason was she wanted to be closer to home and her ill daughter: \u201cIt was never about Raj, [it was] about her kids\u2026It\u2019s such an easy thing to do to bid, such an easy thing [for her] to get closer to home.\u201d Ms. Carpenter averred that she told the Complainant to put in a transfer form and with her seniority, she would be successful. She even offered to fax the bid\/transfer form to her and to help her complete it. The witness said it\u2019s a simple 1-page form. To her surprise and bewilderment, it became a bit of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Each and every time the Complainant would come back, raising the same issue, and Ms. Carpenter would explain that she had to put in a transfer form. And each time, the Complainant went away, but didn\u2019t complete and hand in a form. Ms. Carpenter did not know why. I heard evidence that it may have been because she didn\u2019t want to get a \u201cbad route.\u201d\n[104] Eventually, Ms. Cassidy was \u201cplaced\u201d in a position to accommodate her regarding her ongoing problems with Mr. Thambirajah. She did not have to fill out a bid form for this. As will be discussed later, Ms. Edmunds was responsible for this transfer.\n[105] I heard evidence that an employee could \u201cbid\u201d into another location within the local or \u201ctransfer\u201d to another location in a different local. There is a \u201cbid\u201d form, distinct from a \u201ctransfer\u201d form. The \u201cbid\u201d sheets entered into evidence clearly show that Ms. Cassidy would have been successful in her bid application if she had applied in the months after the November 9, 2005 incident. Article 56.07 of the Collective Agreement also provided: \u201cUpon written request by the complainant and following consultation and agreement, the Corporation may grant the complainant the right to be assigned to another assignment or position on a temporary basis.\u201d Ms. Cassidy neither requested nor was asked by Canada Post if she wanted a \u201ctemporary\u201d transfer.\n[106] On May 17, 2006, she went in-person to meet with Ms. Carpenter and also dropped by the office of Ms. Coe. At this time, the Complainant was off work for an Injured on Duty claim until October 16, 2006 and Mr. Thambirajah was about to be transferred to a different station and city as a disability accommodation measure. I note that in Ms. Cassidy\u2019s journal, she writes that she went to see Ms. Coe on that day not because of her conflict with the Personal Respondent, but rather, because she was concerned Mr. Sultan was going to dispute her I.O.D. claim.\n[107] Ms. Coe testified that her understanding was that the Complainant was \u201cfrustrated she didn\u2019t have a route, but Candace [Carpenter] said she wasn\u2019t bidding to get a route.\u201d She corroborates Ms. Carpenter\u2019s testimony that Ms. Cassidy never mentioned she wanted to bid out of Willowdale D because of Mr. Thambirajah. Furthermore, Ms. Coe testified that on May 17, \u201cAfter her meeting with Candace about the bidding process, she [Ms. Cassidy] told me about her daughter\u2019s illness. She was quite upset.\u201d\n[108] Ms. Coe was asked when Canada Post was made aware on April 25, 2006 about the November 9, 2005 incident what urgency did she feel there was in separating the Complainant and Respondent. She answered, \u201cNot a high level. I wasn\u2019t aware of other incidents. Let the investigation take its course.\u201d Of course, there were the name-calling\/shouting incidents in April 2006.\n[109] Ms. Edmunds corroborated the evidence of Ms. Coe and Ms. Carpenter that the Complainant had never indicated that Mr. Thambirajah was the reason for a bid\/transfer; rather, it was sought because of concerns about her daughter\u2019s illness and being closer to home. However, eventually, Ms. Cassidy did leave Willowdale D, on a successful \u201cbid\u201d to 101 Placer Court on September 20, 2006. Thereafter, she was transferred to Oshawa, on the initiative and assistance of Ms. Edmunds. The witness averred that:\nAt some point, I asked her if she would like to leave Willowdale D\u2026I called Arthur, the staffing officer\u2026to hold the position for her. I told Doris, so your paths don\u2019t cross with Raj, what about Oshawa? It\u2019s not easy to move someone from one zone to another, the union doesn\u2019t like it, it affects seniority rights, it was a temporary assignment. I had to work with both unions, it bypassed Article 56\u2026I was living this with her.\nLater she added: \u201cI went to two locals and got their permission to be a temporary accommodation\u2026Oshawa is closer to her home. I don\u2019t know if she had enough seniority to normally have gotten that transfer\u2026Doris never asked me to move. On my own initiative I got her to Oshawa. She told me about her daughter\u2019s medical problem\u2026\u201d This was one example of the caring, compassionate and proactive actions that Ms. Edmunds took for the benefit of the Complainant.\n[110] I accept the evidence of the three Canada Post witnesses with regards to the issue of bidding\/transferring out of Willowdale D. They were credible in this regard; Ms. Cassidy was not.\nOffering Employee Assistance Program to Ms. Cassidy\n[111] Ms. Edmunds testified that she called the Complainant to advise her of the privacy violation involving the bid sheets being inadvertently sent to Mr. Thambirajah. During that call, she asked the Complainant if she needed Employee Assistance Program (EAP) assistance. Ms. Cassidy stated that she did not; rather, she would speak to her friend who is a psychologist.\nTwo Weeks Free Vacation Pay\n[112] Ms. Edmunds also averred that the Complainant had called her after the \u201cdead rat\u201d incident in December 2006. She testified: \u201cI was really upset. She had me by the heartstrings for the entire time until we got the stuff from the Commission. I read her stuff and thought, \u2018That\u2019s not what happened\u2019.\u201d Ms. Edmunds said that she went in December to the Director to authorize giving the Complainant two weeks pay after the rat incident \u201cas if she had been at work.\u201d\nAlerting Corporate Security\n[113] Ms. Edmunds testified about contacting Canada Post corporate security department to have them \u201ckeep an eye\u201d on Ms. Cassidy when she was transferred to Oshawa, including following her at random times. This was due to Ms. Cassidy\u2019s allegation of ongoing harassment and fear of the Personal Respondent.\nDecember 8, 2006 Interview with Mr. Thambirajah\n[114] Mr. Tidman had sent an email to Ms. Coe and Ms. Edmunds dated October 17, 2006. In it he wrote that Ms. Cassidy had come in to see him the previous day, raising \u201ca number of allegations about Raj that should be put on the record\u201d. One of them involved Mr. Thambirajah being \u201cbefore the courts with respect to physical attacks on his former wife. Doris gives her source as the police.\u201d She told the same story to Ms. Edmunds. Ms. Edmunds had Corporate Security look into this and they responded that there was no merit to this allegation. Mr. Tidman also indicated in the email that the Personal Respondent had been \u201ccharged\u201d and was served with a peace bond. Mr. Tidman also said that Anne Jones had told him that she was receiving hang-up calls, as was he. Mr. Tidman was not examined about the last matter and so I give it no weight.\n[115] As a result of the above, Canada Post held an \u201cinterview\u201d with Mr. Thambirajah \u201cto inform the employee of the statements made about him by another employee and the narrative of the meeting will be placed on his file.\u201d Mr. Thambirajah grieved and lost.\nN. Incidents After the Complainant and Personal Respondent No Longer Worked Together [116] Part of Ms. Cassidy\u2019s CHRA Complaints involve allegations of harassment after she and Mr. Thambirajah no longer worked together at Willowdale D.\nCar Scratched at Union Meeting\n[117] On September 19, 2006, Ms. Cassidy attended a union meeting. Mr. Thambirajah was also in attendance as were many people. When she left, she noticed that someone had \u201ckeyed\u201d her car, scratching \u201cfuck off\u201d into the paint. Understandably, she was quite upset. She immediately suspected Mr. Thambirajah, although she had no direct proof. She filed a police report. Mr. Thambirajah denies any responsibility for the car \u201cscratching\/keying\u201d incident. I find that the incident did occur. However, on a balance of probabilities, I am unable to find that Mr. Thambirajah, as a matter of fact, was responsible for that incident. There is no evidence \u2013 e.g., eye-witness account, video surveillance, etc. \u2013 other than the \u201ccircumstantial\u201d evidence of his attendance at the union meeting that night and his strained relationship with Ms. Cassidy during that time. I acknowledge that circumstantial evidence can suffice in some cases. However, the circumstantial evidence here is too weak to support the desired inference.\nSexual Assault Complaint Filed with Police; Charges Laid\n[118] On September 28, 2006, Ms. Cassidy filed a Sexual Assault complaint with the police, regarding the November 9, 2005 incident. Charges were laid and Mr. Thambirajah was arrested on November 8, 2006. She also went to court to have a peace bond posted against Mr. Thambirajah. The sexual assault charges were withdrawn by the Crown on March 31, 2008. Detective Cecile testified that he had met with Ms. Cassidy and explained to her that the Crown, after reviewing the evidence, did not feel there was a reasonable prospect for a conviction on those charges and thus would be withdrawing them.\nPunctured Tires After Court Appearance\n[119] On November 1, 2006, Ms. Cassidy and Mr. Thambirajah appeared in the Ontario Court of Justice. As she was driving home, Ms. Cassidy testified: \u201cMy tires blew. I almost killed another women and child\u201d as she lost control of her car. She managed to drive home and take the car to Canadian Tire and go shopping. She claims that Mr. Thambirajah is responsible for the incident. She stated that she saw a young Indian man come into the courtroom and talk to Mr. Thambirajah, looking and grinning at her.\n[120] Her friend, Sue Baird, testified that she called the Complainant after the incident and Ms. Cassidy was in tears. Ms. Cassidy filed a police report. She told the police that she thought Mr. Thambirajah was responsible. No charges were ever laid.\n[121] Mr. Thambirajah denied any involvement and says the person to whom he was speaking in the courtroom was his lawyer. Canada Post\u2019s counsel cross-examined the Complainant about the incident, revealing discrepancies in her testimony (e.g., involving her claim to have almost killed a woman and her child on the highway).\n[122] I am satisfied that Ms. Cassidy\u2019s tires were punctured on that day. The mechanic\u2019s report from Canadian Tire corroborates that all four tires were punctured, although he does not indicate whether the puncturing of the tires was deliberate or by accident (e.g., by driving over sharp objects). However, I am not prepared, on a balance of probabilities, to find that Mr. Thambirajah was responsible. While it is \u201cpossible\u201d that he was culpable, I am not willing to find that it was \u201cprobable\u201d based on the circumstances alone.\n\u201cDark Complexioned People\u201d and \u201cIndian\u201d Following the Complainant in November 2006\n[123] I heard evidence from the Complainant that she got permission from Canada Post to allow her nephew, Scott Parsons, to accompany her on her route. She was fearful of harassment and retribution from Mr. Thambirajah at this time, notwithstanding that they no longer worked in the same depot or area, as of May 2006. On November 17, 2006, the Complainant and her nephew noticed an \u201cIndian\u201d person following them in a car while Ms. Cassidy was on her route. They did not take down the licence plate number. As well, she and Mr. Parsons both testified that on November 8, 2006, they noticed a car leaving Ms. Cassidy\u2019s driveway in the country in Durham Region. Mr. Parsons stated that there were \u201ctwo dark complexioned people [in the car] pulling out of the driveway\u201d as Ms. Cassidy and he arrived. They did not take down the licence plate number.\n[124] For his part, Mr. Thambirajah denies that Ms. Cassidy and Mr. Parsons were even followed or that the car in the driveway incident even occurred, let alone that he was responsible for their being followed.\n[125] I am willing to find the events as described above by the Complainant and Mr. Parsons did take place in fact (e.g., a car pulled out of Ms. Cassidy\u2019s driveway), but not that it involved the \u201cfollowing\u201d of them or harassment or intimidation of them. Furthermore, based on the evidence, on a balance of probabilities, I will not go so far as to find that Mr. Thambirajah was connected to the \u201ccar on the mail route\u201d or \u201ccar in the driveway\u201d incidents.\n\u201cRat in the Mailbox\u201d Incident\n[126] On December 4, 2006, Ms. Cassidy claims that either Mr. Thambirajah or someone acting on his instructions, put a dead rat in an envelope in her rural mailbox. The Complainant testified that, at the time, she was living at her common law spouse\u2019s home in the country on a 180 acre lot, with farm land on three sides. On the morning in question, she said that she went to her mailbox, opened it and found an envelope (she said \u201cbrown bag\u201d in her journal entry). Inside was a dead rat (or mouse). \u201cI tossed it on the ground on our property (later she testified that she threw the rat in the bushes); the rat could still be there today\u2026\u201d She then ran inside the house screaming. Her nephew was there and her daughter was sleeping. Surprisingly, she did not wake up with all the commotion. Later, her daughter wanted to get the rat, but Ms. Cassidy wouldn\u2019t let her out. When they left later, upon their return, they did not look for the rat. She testified that, \u201cI knew Raj did this\u2026\u201d She said that she later received a phone call from Mr. Thambirajah: \u201cDid you get the rat? It\u2019s not over yet.\u201d\n[127] To this day, no one saw the dead rat except for the Complainant. I find it strange that she would not have had either her nephew or daughter witness what had happened, or taken a picture of the dead rat with a camera or cell phone to show the police. This is particularly surprising given the fact that by this time in December of 2006, by her own account, her conflict with Mr. Thambirajah had escalated. I do not accept that the dead rat incident or the follow-up call from Mr. Thambirajah occurred. In the alternative, even if I were to find that an envelope containing a dead rat was placed in the Complainant\u2019s mailbox, I would not extend my finding that Mr. Thambirajah was responsible for that act.\nThreatening Phone Calls\n[128] One of the allegations is that either Mr. Thambirajah, or someone else instructed by him, made a series of threatening phone calls to the Complainant over the course of three years. The Complainant testified at first that \u201che started calling me when Kelly Edmunds started investigating.\u201d At one point in her testimony, she said something different, that Mr. Thambirajah started calling her shortly after the November 9, 2005 incident. When asked how often he called, she replied, \u201cAs high as six or ten times a day; some days nothing\u2026I know Raj\u2019s voice. He would say things like \u2018how many lives do you have?\u2019 \u2018next time you won\u2019t be so lucky, it will be your face.\u2019\u201d\n[129] Ms. Cassidy\u2019s friend, Sue Baird, testified that she was with the Complainant \u201cmultiple times\u201d (later she said 3 or 4) when she received threatening phone calls. Ms. Cassidy told her it was Mr. Thambirajah and held the phone to both of their ears so that Ms. Baird could hear. Ms. Baird testified that it was a male voice with an accent. She said she couldn\u2019t hear clearly but once heard something to the effect of \u201cabout your face\u201d and then \u201c\u2026.lives do you have.\u201d\n[130] In cross-examination, Ms. Baird was asked if she ever heard Mr. Thambirajah\u2019s voice before. She replied \u201cno.\u201d Ms. Cassidy had told her it was Mr. Thambirajah. The witness stated, \u201cI have no idea who it was.\u201d\n[131] Corinne Pearce, another friend of the Complainant, testified that Ms. Cassidy was at her house a few times when Mr. Thambirajah called her, saying things like \u201crat in the mail box, how do you like your present, next time may be you.\u201d Ms. Cassidy held the phone to the witness\u2019 ear so she could hear. When asked if she understood the caller, the witness responded, \u201cI understood him clearly, an accent, but not a big one, an East Indian one, I could make out all of the words.\u201d On the second call, she stated that the caller said, \u201c\u2026How do you like the scrape on your car; next time it could be your face.\u201d\n[132] Mr. Machelak asked Mr. Thambirajah in the hearing room to repeat the words from the two alleged threatening phone calls that the witness claims to have heard. He did so for the witness. \u201cThat was clear?\u201d asked counsel. \u201cYes, and that was the accent,\u201d came the response from the witness. Looking astonished, Mr. Machelak put it to the witness that the hearing had been going on for a week and that the parties and counsel had difficulty understanding Mr. Thambirajah, yet the witness said he only had a \u201clittle bit of an accent.\u201d The witness replied, \u201cYes, I can say I could understand [Mr. Thambirajah]. I used to date East Indian people and I understand their accent better than other people do.\u201d Ms. Pearce acknowledged that she had never met Mr. Thambirajah before the hearing.\n[133] What then transpired was quite interesting. Mr. Thambirajah himself cross-examined the witness. He asked five questions. To three of them, the witness answered, \u201cWhat, pardon?\u201d When I pointed out to the witness that she said \u201cpardon\u201d several times to his questioning indicating that she could not understand him, the witness responded, \u201cI can understand what he said, but not what he meant.\u201d She also said, \u201cYes, I got confused a bit, about what he meant.\u201d I do not accept her explanation. I find on the evidence that the person she could clearly understand on the phone with a \u201clittle bit of an accent\u201d was not the same person - Mr. Thambirajah - that she had great difficulty understanding at the hearing.\n[134] Ms. Marshall, who acted as Ms. Cassidy\u2019s agent\/representative for a good deal of the proceeding, also gave evidence. She is a close friend of the Complainant. Ms. Marshall stated that close to the commencement of the hearing, Mr. Thambirajah \u201cpersisted\u201d in making threatening calls to Ms. Cassidy. Ms. Marshall claims to have heard one call, but only parts of it. The Complainant put the cell phone to Ms. Marshall\u2019s ear. \u201cI heard \u2018you think you\u2019re safe, you can\u2019t hide.\u2019 It was an Indian gentleman. I live in an East Indian neighbourhood.\u201d The witness also averred that on October 21, 2009, when submissions were due to the Tribunal, Ms. Cassidy came to her house crying, saying that Mr. Thambirajah had just called her and made a joke about Ann Jones having died, something like \u201cyour witness is dead, and you\u2019re next\u2026I made a comment on the bottom of the page [in the letter to the Tribunal] that he needs psychiatric treatment and is a cruel person.\u201d\n[135] Ms. Marshall\u2019s contempt for the Personal Respondent was quite palpable during the hearing. She is a close friend of the Complainant and has spent considerable time \u2013 on a volunteer basis \u2013 acting as Ms. Cassidy\u2019s representative\/agent in the proceeding. She indicated at the hearing that she had suffered abuse herself and wanted to ensure that justice was done in the case of Mr. Thambirajah\u2019s ongoing harassment of the Complainant.\n[136] Neither Ms. Baird, Ms. Pearce, Ms. Marshall, nor the Complainant knew of the exact dates of the calls. They did not write down the dates. And despite claiming to have received over 30 threatening phone calls, some as frequently as \u201csix or ten per day,\u201d the Complainant never recorded a single call, did not contact the police (although she did for less serious matters, such as damage to her property), did not contact the phone or cellular company to see if a \u201ctrace\u201d could be put on her phone, etc. Neither her nor Mr. Thambirajah\u2019s phone records were entered into evidence. I am left with her evidence and those of close friends who attest to have heard an \u201cIndian\u201d voice on some calls, sure that it was Mr. Thambirajah. While it is possible that Mr. Thambirajah did indeed make threatening calls, on a balance of probabilities, and lacking cogent evidence, I am not prepared to make a finding on such a serious matter that even if these calls were made, that they were made by Mr. Thambirajah himself or someone else acting on his instructions.\nPayroll Issue\n[137] Ms. Cassidy alleges that Mr. Thambirajah was responsible for a payroll error in September 2006 whereby she was over-credited. She claims that Mr. Thambirajah told her that he \u201cwould make my life miserable, that he had a friend in payroll.\u201d Mr. Thambirajah denies this. Canada Post\u2019s counsel put the following to the Complainant: \u201cIf I said that payroll issues are a huge issue at Canada Post, underpayment and overpayment, there are over 60,000 employees and errors do happen.\u201d The Complainant answered, \u201cI also had pay deductions that were too much. Raj told me he had a friend in payroll and that\u2019s just the start of it.\u201d\n[138] Ms. Edmunds testified about the payroll problem. She said that Ms. Cassidy made an allegation of \u201cpay tampering\u201d \u2013 overpayment and that she was also owed money in regard to sick leave time. Ms. Edmunds, Penny Comport, the supervisor at her then-station (101 Placer Ct.) and the union steward, Mark Sinclair met with Ms. Cassidy on May 4, 2007 to discuss the sick leave under-payment issue. The supervisor explained the reason for the \u201csick time\u201d error, and that upon investigation, it was determined that Ms. Cassidy was not underpaid, but was in fact overpaid and owed Canada Post two days plus. Canada Post just \u201cforgot about it\u201d and did not demand re-payment.\n[139] Based on the evidence presented, I do not find that Mr. Thambirajah was responsible for the payroll errors described above.\nPrivacy Breach: Complainant\u2019s Phone Number Inadvertently Given to Mr. Thambirajah\n[140] The Complainant alleges that Canada Post improperly gave her phone number to Mr. Thambirajah. At Willowdale D, Mr. Thambirajah was allowed to share part of the filing cabinet in the office of Messrs. Tidman and Sultan to store his union documents. On October 26, 2006, when Mr. Thambirajah was no longer the shop steward there and had been transferred to Unionville, a Canada Post employee inadvertently sent the contents to him at his new location. This included many \u201cleave form requests\u201d of employees, including Ms. Cassidy. Mr. Thambirajah reported this error and turned over the envelope with the leave forms to the Union which then sent them to management. Ms. Cassidy claims that her phone number was on the leave forms. However, upon review of the ones tendered into evidence, it appears that she had put the number for Willowdale D on the form. On one form, it looked like she had scratched out another number and put in the Station number. Canada Post advised Ms. Cassidy of the privacy breach on December 15, 2006 and apologized.\n[141] The above incident clearly upset the Complainant. She felt that Mr. Thambirajah had gotten her phone number from the leave forms. She also filed a complaint with the Privacy Commissioner of Canada and filed a grievance.\nO. Three Allegations of Retaliation During the Hearing [142] On February 19, 2010, I granted the Complainant\u2019s motion to amend her Complaint against Mr. Thambirajah by adding three incidents of retaliation under section 14.1 of the CHRA. As I stated in my oral reasons at the time, the granting of the motion, with its low threshhold, does not mean that a finding of liability will be made out against Mr. Thambirajah at the conclusion of the hearing. Below are my findings of fact only with respect to the three incidents.\nFirst Incident: The Parking Lot on February 2\n[143] This was the first of the three incidents during the hearing. Both Ms. Cassidy and Ms. Marshall testified that at the conclusion of the second day of the hearing on February 2, 2010, Ms. Cassidy, her partner and Ms. Marshall were in their car in the parking lot across from the building where the hearing was being held. It was snowing lightly. Ms. Cassidy testified:\n\u2026Julie [Marshall] looked up and said, \u2018There he [Mr. Thambirajah] is.\u2019 He was staring at my licence plate. He looked up at me and grinned. I fell apart. My boyfriend was really upset. I started to cry, couldn\u2019t believe he was still doing it: harassment, intimidation, trying to show me in his way he can still get to me and it doesn\u2019t matter where\u2026He was standing there right in front.\nShe stated that she was seated on the front passenger side. In her Notice of Motion, she writes: \u201cJulie watched him cross back over four lanes of traffic and proceed to walk north on Bay Street, with his bag and carry tray.\u201d\n[144] Ms. Marshall corroborates the Complainant\u2019s evidence. She stated that she walked to the Complainant\u2019s car, parked across the street from the hearing on the west side of Bay Street and \u201cjumped into the back seat\u201d. She averred:\nThe wipers were going, light snow melting off the windows, Doris and George were there, talking about what was said in court\u2026I looked to my left and said, \u2018Oh my God, there he is\u2019\u2026Raj was walking in between the lanes. We were on the south side. He was in between the next set of two, in the parking lot. She started shaking and crying\u2026I watched him walk straight to the car to Doris on the passenger side, looked down at the licence plate, looked up at Doris and smiled, little grin and walked away. The closest he came was approximately six feet away from the front of the car, standing in front of the bumper on the passenger side. He walked straight back, crossed four lanes of\u2026walked north on Bay.\nShe stated that Mr. Thambirajah did not have his case with him when he was in the parking lot: \u201cDoris was hysterical, shaking, crying. I swore, called him a nasty name. He has big balls to do something like that. I said I would bring it to your attention right away.\u201d Ms. Marshall stated that she telephoned the parking lot owner, The Hospital for Sick Children, three times to see if there was a surveillance tape, but they did not return her calls. She did not request an Order of production from me.\n[145] The above incident was raised in \u201copen tribunal\u201d the following day, February 3. Mr. Thambirajah (not sworn) stated that \u201cI forgot where I was\u201d. He said his car was indeed parked in a different lot than Ms. Cassidy\u2019s. He got lost. He said that he used his remote to try to find his car. He did not deny being in the parking lot where Ms. Cassidy\u2019s car was parked.\nHowever, he averred: \u201cI didn\u2019t even see who they are, what they are\u2026was full of [sic] snows.\u201d He denied smiling at them. I indicated when this was first raised in the hearing that their unsworn comments would not form part of the evidence or my findings, or any Order, \u201cat this time\u201d. I indicated that it may become relevant at a future date. That came to fruition as the Complainant subsequently brought a motion to amend her Complaint against the Personal Respondent. Upon hearing the motion, I granted it and gave oral reasons.\n[146] In his sworn testimony on the second last day of the hearing, Mr. Thambirajah was asked if he approached Ms. Cassidy\u2019s vehicle in the parking lot. He responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t do that. I was there, parked in the same lot, going to my car. I didn\u2019t look at her [licence] plate.\u201d I asked the Respondent to clarify his evidence at the end of the re-examination. He stated that he was parked in the same parking lot as Ms. Cassidy, but in a different aisle, specifically, \u201ctwo aisles from them up front facing the hospital.\u201d He averred, \u201cI didn\u2019t know where they were parked and who was in the car until the following day [when the Complainant first raised the issue in the hearing]. It\u2019s all a made-up story. I didn\u2019t see them or their car\u2026\u201d I then asked the Respondent, \u201cHow did you know you were in the same parking lot in a different aisle if you didn\u2019t see their car or them?\u201d The Respondent answered, \u201cIt was the only parking lot there.\u201d Mr. Kelly followed that up by asking, \u201cIn Court [on February 3] you advised the Tribunal that you were parked two blocks away down the street, in a different parking lot.\u201d Mr. Thambirajah\u2019s answer was difficult to understand, given his accent. He stated that he was not familiar with the area, but that the parking lot was \u201ctwo aisles behind the Tribunal [building on Bay Street]. He confirmed the parking lot was on the Northwest side of the Bay and Elm St. corner, beside a construction site.\n[147] When I examine Mr. Thambirajah\u2019s unsworn comments when the incident was first raised on February 2, 2010, and his testimony (in-chief, cross-examination and re-direct, including my questions) on October 7 and 11, 2011, I have some difficulty understanding exactly what happened. He appears to have contradicted himself. First he says he was parked in a different parking lot from Ms. Cassidy, got lost and ended up in the parking lot where her car was parked, but that he was never in front of her car, and thus did not smile at her or look at the licence plate. At the hearing, he avers that he was parked in the same parking lot as she, but did not go in front of her car, stare or smile at her and didn\u2019t even know where she was parked. He then states that he was there, his car being two aisles away from hers but did not look at her or the licence plate. His answers are convoluted and contradictory. Even if I were to give the best interpretation to his answers, and find that he was parked in the same parking lot as Ms. Cassidy, that he got lost and ended up in front of Ms. Cassidy\u2019s car unknowingly, I would have to stop there. I could not accept the rest of his version of the events. I find that he was in front of Ms. Cassidy\u2019s car after the hearing with the snow coming down. I believe Ms. Cassidy and Ms. Marshall that he looked down at her licence plate and looked back up at Ms. Cassidy, smiling or grinning. He then left the parking lot walking north, no doubt to the other parking lot where he was indeed parked. I accept Ms. Marshall\u2019s evidence that, after he left their car, \u201cHe walked straight back, crossed four lanes of traffic [on Bay Street], picked up his carrying bag, and walked north on Bay.\u201d His parking in the lot north of the Tribunal building and northeast of where Ms. Cassidy was parked is consistent with his original statement and Ms. Marshall\u2019s testimony and I so find as a matter of fact. I will deal later in these Reasons with whether his actions constituted \u201cretaliation\u201d within the meaning of section 14.1 of the CHRA.\n[148] After the Complainant first raised the parking lot incident in the hearing on February 2, I admonished the parties and directed that they not have any contact with each other and to deal with each other through their representatives at the hearing. Notwithstanding this direction, two other alleged incidents arose.\nSecond Incident: The Hearing Hallway on February 16\n[149] Ms. Cassidy alleges that the Respondent \u201cfurther verbally harassed me when I left the court room. We had brought up in court, the possibility of having a new witness summoned \u2013 Marcia Busarello (Iunni). When I left the courtroom Raj said to me \u2013 when no one else was in ear range \u2013 \u201cwait to [till] Iunni gets here\u201d furthering his intimidation against me.\u201d The Complainant testified that she \u201cfelt this was another way of him getting to me, hurting me.\u201d No one can corroborate her evidence; the Complainant was alone. Mr. Thambirajah denies this interaction ever occurred. On a balance of probabilities, I am not willing to find that this event occurred as described by the Complainant. Furthermore, even if it did occur, the Respondent saying \u201cwait till Iunni gets here\u201d in and of itself and based on the totality of the evidence, does not amount to retaliation under the CHRA.\nThird Incident: On Bay Street Outside the Tribunal Building on February 17\n[150] The third allegation took place on February 17. The Complainant\u2019s Notice of Motion states: \u201cI went outside 655 Bay Street, to have a cigarette. I was strolling down the street, and Mr. Thambirajah came out from behind a pillar and said to me \u201cYou\u2019ll get yours\u201d. I was very distraught and came and advised you [the Tribunal] immediately\u2026\u201d She testified that she, Ms. Marshall and Ms. Baird were having a cigarette outside: \u201cI walked away, Raj was behind the pillar\u2026he made a comment \u2018you\u2019ll get yours\u2019. I walked back and said, \u2018I can\u2019t even have a cigarette and escape from him\u2019 and told them what had happened.\u201d Ms. Marshall confirms that the Complainant told her what had happened moments after it allegedly occurred. But no one saw the actual interaction between Ms. Cassidy and Mr. Thambirajah. Mr. Thambirajah testified: \u201cShe walked to me. I was on a break, standing beside the pillar. She tried to provoke something\u2026I said nothing.\u201d He said there was no verbal\/visual exchange.\n[151] Based on the testimony of the Complainant and Personal Respondent, I find that they did interact beside the pillar. However, on a balance of probabilities, I do not find that he made the threatening comment that she alleges. I also decline to find that \u201cshe tried to provoke something\u201d from him. I say this mindful of the credibility issues that both have had throughout the hearing,\nVI. The Law [152] The initial onus of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination under the CHRA rests with a complainant or the Commission: Ontario Human Rights Commission and O\u2019Malley v. Simpsons-Sears Limited, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at para. 28. Once that is established, the burden then shifts to the respondent to establish a justification or explanation for the discriminatory practice or action. The respondent\u2019s explanation should not figure in the determination of whether the complainant has made out a prima facie case of discrimination: Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204, at para. 22.\n[153] Also relevant to human rights tribunal cases is the legal principle that: \u201cIt is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue in order that the complaint may succeed. It is sufficient that the discrimination be one of the factors for the employer\u2019s decision\u201d: Morris v. Canada (Armed Forces) (2001), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/443 (C.H.R.T.), at para. 69; Holden v. Canadian National Railway Co. (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12, at para. 7.\n[154] The standard of proof in discrimination cases is the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probabilities. According to this standard, discrimination may be inferred where the evidence offered in support of the discrimination renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses: Premakumar v. Air Canada (No. 2) (2002), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/63 (C.H.R.T.), at para. 81. As Member Craig wrote in Naistus v. Chief, 2009 CHRT 4, at para.72: \u201cEvidence must always be clear, convincing and cogent in order to satisfy the balance of probabilities test.\u201d\nA. Sexual Harassment [155] Paragraph 14(1)(c) of the CHRA states that it is a discriminatory practice to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination, including the ground of sex, \u201cin matters related to employment\u201d. Subsection 14(2) specifies that \u201csexual harassment shall, for the purposes of that subsection, be deemed to be harassment on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\u201d\n[156] In the seminal case dealing with sexual harassment decided by the Supreme Court of Canada, Janzen v. Platy Enterprises Inc., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252, at 1284., sexual harassment was described as \u201cunwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that is detrimental to the work environment.\u201d Other courts or statutes have defined it as engaging in a course of vexatious sexual comment or conduct that is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome. This exact or similar language is legislatively mandated in many human rights statutes in Canada. Notably, the CHRA is not one of them.\n[157] In a complaint of sexual harassment pursuant to sections 7 and 14 of the CHRA, Tremblay-Lamer J. expanded on the dicta in Janzen, supra in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Armed Forces) et Franke, 1999 3 FC 653. For a sexual harassment allegation to be substantiated, the following items must be shown:\n(1) The acts that form the basis of the complaint must be unwelcome, or ought to have been known by a reasonable person to be unwelcome;\n(2) The conduct must be sexual in nature. That does not encompass only physical contact or touching (e.g., sexist remarks, gender-based insults, and comments about appearance, dress and sexual habits);\n(3) Ordinarily, sexual harassment requires a degree of persistence or repetition, but in certain circumstances (such as a serious physical assault), even a single incident may be severe enough to create a hostile or poisoned environment. The Court also applied \u201cthe inversely proportional rule\u201d: The less serious the conduct, the more persistent it must be. The more serious the conduct, the less persistence need be shown. The objective \u201creasonable person\u201d standard is used to assess this factor as well; and\n(4) Where the sexual harassment takes place in an employment context, the victim of the harassment must notify the employer of the alleged offensive conduct.\nB. Corporate (Vicarious) Liability: Section 65 of the CHRA [158] A corporate (including governmental) respondent (analogous to vicarious liability under tort law) may be held liable for the discriminatory acts or harassment committed by its officers, directors, employees or agents acting in the course of their employment, pursuant to section 65 of the CHRA. This is so unless the respondent employer can show it did not consent to the discriminatory practice, and exercised \u201call due diligence\u201d to prevent it and mitigate or avoid its effect. I should add that, in my view, the modifier \u201call\u201d before \u201cdue diligence\u201d does not require a standard of \u201cperfection\u201d in the exercise of its due diligence. Rather, the modifier requires that the corporate respondent exercised \u201creasonable\u201d due diligence all of the time. In Hinds v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Comm.)(1988), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/5683 (C.H.R.T.), at para. 41611, applying s. 48(6) of the CHRA [s. 65(2) as it then read], the Tribunal wrote:\nAlthough the C.H.R.A. does not impose a duty on an employer to maintain a pristine working environment, there is a duty upon an employer to take prompt and effectual action when it knows or should know of coemployees\u2019 conduct in the workplace amounting to racial harassment\u2026To avoid liability, the employer is obliged to take reasonable steps to alleviate, as best as it can, the distress arising within the work environment and to reassure those concerned that it is committed to the maintenance of a workplace free of racial harassment. A response that is both timely and corrective is called for and its degree must turn upon the circumstances of the harassment in each case. [Emphasis added.]\n[159] Included in this duty to mitigate is an examination of the steps taken by a corporate respondent to investigate, make findings and impose a resolution. In Sutton v. Jarvis Ryan Associates et al., 2010 HRTO 2421, at paras. 130-33, the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario dealt with a corporate respondent\u2019s duty to investigate a complaint of discrimination or harassment:\nIt is well established in the Tribunal\u2019s jurisprudence that an employer may be held liable for the way in which it responds to a complaint of discrimination.\nThe rationale underlying the duty to investigate a complaint of discrimination is to ensure that the rights under the Code are meaningful. As stated in Laskowska v. Marineland of Canada Inc., 2005 HRTO 30 (CanLII) (\u201cLaskowska\u201d), at para. 53:\nIt would make the protection under subsection 5(1) to be a discrimination-free work environment a hollow one if an employer could sit idly when a complaint of discrimination was made and not have to investigate it. If that were so, how could it determine if a discriminatory act occurred or a poisoned work environment existed? The duty to investigate is a \u2018means\u2019 by which the employer ensures that it is achieving the Code-mandated \u2018ends\u2019 of operating in a discrimination-free environment and providing its employees with a safe work environment.\nThe Tribunal\u2019s jurisprudence has established that the employer\u2019s duty to investigate is held to a standard of reasonableness, not correctness or perfection. In Laskowska, the Tribunal set out the relevant criteria for an employer to consider in its duty to investigate as:\n(1) Awareness of issues of discrimination\/harassment, Policy Complaint Mechanism and Training: Was there an awareness of issues of discrimination and harassment in the workplace at the time of the incident? Was there a suitable anti-discrimination\/harassment policy? Was there a proper complaint mechanism in place? Was adequate training given to management and employees;\n(2) Post-Complaint: Seriousness, Promptness, Taking Care of its Employee, Investigation and Action: Once an internal complaint was made, did the employer treat it seriously? Did it deal with the matter promptly and sensitively? Did it reasonably investigate and act; and\n(3) Resolution of the Complaint (including providing the Complainant with a Healthy Work Environment) and Communication: Did the employer provide a reasonable resolution in the circumstances? If the complainant chose to return to work, could the employer provide him\/her with a healthy, discrimination-free work environment? Did it communicate its findings and actions to the complainant?\nThe Tribunal in Laskowska also stated the following at para. 60:\nWhile the above three elements are of a general nature, their application must retain some flexibility to take into account the unique facts of each case. The standard is one of reasonableness, not correctness or perfection. There may have been several options \u2013 all reasonable \u2013 open to the employer. The employer need not satisfy each element in every case in order to be judged to have acted reasonably, although that would be the exception rather than the norm. One must look at each element individually and then in the aggregate before passing judgment on whether the employer acted reasonably.\nC. Retaliation: Section 14.1 of the CHRA [160] Section 14.1 of the CHRA provides that it is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint.\n[161] In Witwicky v. Canadian National Railway, 2007 CHRT 25, Member Doucet sets out and analyzes the two competing schools of thought about whether \u201cintention\u201d is required to establish a section 14.1 complaint. Witwicky is the most recent analysis of this area by the Tribunal. There are conflicting decisions at the Tribunal level, as well as in some provincial human rights tribunals and provincial appellate and superior courts. The Federal Court, Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada have not waded into this issue as of yet.\n[162] In Witwicky, at the following paragraphs the Tribunal writes as follows:\n[121] This Tribunal has taken two slightly different approaches to the legal framework under which a claim of retaliation should be examined. These approaches are illustrated in two cases: Wong v. Royal Bank of Canada, [2001] C.H.R.D. No.11 and Virk v. Bell Canada (Ontario), [2005] C.H.R.D. No.2. The primary difference between these two approaches is the emphasis placed on the intention of the alleged retaliator.\n[122] In Wong, the Tribunal determined that given the remedial nature of the Act, the complainant should not be required to prove that the respondent intended to retaliate against the complainant. Rather, the focus of the analysis is on the perception of the complainant and whether or not the complainant could reasonably have viewed the respondent's conduct as an act of retaliation:\n[124] The other approach is set out in the Virk case [at paras. 155-57]:\nUnder section 14.1 of the Act, it is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\nRetaliation implies some form of wilful conduct meant to harm or hurt the person who filed a human rights complaint for having filed the complaint. This view departs in part from those expressed in previous decisions of this Tribunal on the issue of retaliation (Wong v. Royal Bank of Canada, [2001] CHRT 11; Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2004 CHRT 40 (CanLII).\nIn Wong and Bressette, the views expressed are to the effect that a complainant does not have to prove an intention to retaliate and that if a complainant reasonably perceived the impugned conduct by the respondent to be in retaliation to the human rights complaint, this could amount to retaliation quite apart form any proven intention of the respondent.\n[163] I agree with the reasoning in Virk, supra and other judicial and tribunal decisions requiring an element of intention. \u201cIntention\u201d includes wilful and reckless thought and action to retaliate against or punish a complainant for having filed a human rights complaint. While the CHRA does deem \u201cretaliation\u201d to be a discriminatory practice, it is different from the prohibition against discrimination and harassment in that \u201cretaliation\u201d need not be linked to a prohibited ground under the CHRA. As will be seen later in these Reasons, the application of either the Virk or Wong approach regarding intention would yield the same result herein.\nVII. Liability A. Liability vis-\u00e0-vis the Complaint Against Mr. Thambirajah Allegation #1: November 9, 2005 Touching\/Comment Incident\n[164] Based on my findings of fact, I am satisfied that Mr. Thambirajah knew or, at the very least, ought to have known that his touching of Ms. Cassidy\u2019s shirt over the chest area along with his comment about her breast size were \u201cunwelcome\u201d. His position on what happened, including at first a straight denial to Canada Post\u2019s Ms. Edmunds, to his changing position at the hearing, puts his credibility in issue. At a minimum, at one point, he admitted to the comment, and to the touching, but not with a sexual intent attached. It was not a \u201csexual assault\u201d according to the Respondent. Of course, I have no jurisdiction to deal with a criminal or civil sexual assault allegation. My bailiwick is \u201csexual harassment\u201d as set out in the CHRA.\n[165] Mr. Thambirajah\u2019s physical contact with his hand was on a sexual part of the female body, the Complainant\u2019s breasts or chest area. As well, his contemporaneous comment about the size of her breasts was of course sexual in nature. I am also satisfied that the touching, coupled with the comment, triggers liability under the CHRA. While it occurred only once, the physical contact aspect over her chest area is serious enough to trigger liability. It was no mere joke. This is evident from Ms. Cassidy\u2019s and Mr. Pyziak\u2019s reaction and what a \u201creasonable person\u201d objectively would think. While the purpose of the CHRA and the Tribunal is not to sanitize all behaviour in the workplace to the point where it becomes a sterile, human-less environment, there are boundaries. And Mr. Thambirajah clearly crossed the boundary of acceptable and non-CHRA triggering behaviour. He clearly sexually harassed the Complainant on November 9, 2005. This is even more disturbing given his position as a Union shop steward. As Mr. Tomaszewski, himself a union official, testified, shop stewards are held to a higher standard. They are the \u201cbuffer\u201d between the union, the employee and management. They are elected by their fellow members. It is a position of trust. One would expect shop stewards would be the exemplars of human rights, not the perpetrators of sexual harassment. This will be addressed further under the remedial section of these Reasons.\nAllegation #2: Fall on Mail Tub\/\u201cGrabbed (or Slapped) My Ass\u201d Incidents\n[166] As I stated in the section \u201cFindings of Fact\u201d, the Complainant\u2019s viva voce and documentary evidence were contradictory on this issue. It certainly was not \u201cclear, convincing and cogent.\u201d At one point, she seemed to be indicating that they were two separate incidents: one involving falling on a mail tub and Mr. Thambirajah making the \u201cat least you have an ass...\u201d comment (see her Statement of Particulars) and the other, involving the actual touching of her buttocks while making the same comment. She contradicted herself as to the date: December 2005 versus April 18, 2006. It may be that this was indeed one event. In any event, pursuant to my findings of fact, I do not accept that these events occurred as described by her, and for the reasons stated therein. Consequently, there is no finding that the CHRA provisions have been violated.\nAllegation #3: April 10-19, 2006 Swearing\/Inappropriate Language Incidents\n[167] The findings of fact surrounding these incidents do not support a finding of liability. The swearing, shouting and inappropriate language were not of a sexual nature (or linked to the prohibited ground of sex) or of a serious enough nature to attract CHRA liability. The behaviour by both the Complainant and Personal Respondent were of the nature of pejorative, high-schoolish name-calling. They were appropriately dealt with by Mr. Tidman.\nAllegation #4: Car Scratched\/Keyed at Union meeting: September 19, 2006\n[168] I have made a finding of fact that Ms. Cassidy\u2019s car was indeed scratched\/keyed with profanity during the Union meeting. On a balance of probabilities, I was unable to find that Mr. Thambirajah (or an accomplice at his instruction) was responsible. Accordingly, I need not determine whether he is liable under the CHRA for this incident, including whether such action even constitutes \u201csexual harassment\u201d under the CHRA.\nAllegation #5: Punctured Tires Incident\n[169] I made a finding of fact that her car tires were punctured on November 1, 2006. Again, on a balance of probabilities, I was not convinced that Mr. Thambirajah (or his accomplice) was responsible, based on the evidence before me. Thus, the CHRA provisions are not engaged here.\nAllegation #6: Complainant Followed on Mail Route and Car in Her Driveway Incidents\n[170] Based on my earlier findings of fact, on a balance of probabilities, I am not satisfied that Mr. Thambirajah was responsible for these incidents or for that matter, whether they even constitute sexual harassment under the CHRA.\nAllegation #7: Rat in the Mail box: December 4, 2006\n[171] I have found that this event did not occur as described by the Complainant. I have serious concerns about the credibility and reliability of her evidence on this point, as described earlier. In the alternative, if the dead rat was placed in her mail box as she described, I found that there was an insufficient evidentiary basis to conclude that Mr. Thambirajah was responsible for this, on a balance of probabilities. I did not accept as a finding of fact that he had made a \u201cfollow-up\u201d threatening phone call to the Complainant about the dead rat. Based on my findings of fact, I need not decide whether there is a legal basis for finding that the Respondent has violated her rights under the CHRA regarding this incident.\nAllegations #8: Threatening Phone Calls\n[172] My findings of fact illustrate my concern that the evidence was not \u201cclear, convincing and cogent\u201d in this area. I had serious credibility\/reliability concerns regarding said evidence. I set out these concerns in the section entitled \u201cFindings of Fact\u201d. I found that the Complainant had exaggerated the number of said calls. Even if some of them were made, on a balance of probabilities, I was not able to find that Mr. Thambirajah (or an individual acting on his behalf) made them. Accordingly, the CHRA provisions are not triggered. Had I made such a finding, it is more likely that a finding of \u201cretaliation\u201d would have been more appropriate than one of \u201csexual harassment\u201d.\nAllegation #9: Payroll Tampering\n[173] Earlier in these Reasons I made a finding of fact that, after a thorough investigation by Canada Post including a meeting with the Complainant, management and her Union representative, it was clear that her payroll had not been tampered with. Indeed, she was \u201cover-credited\u201d with an amount, and her employer did not seek reimbursement. As well, I found that the evidence was such that it did not warrant a finding that Mr. Thambirajah was responsible for tampering with her payroll records. Thus, I need not go to the next step of determining whether he had infringed her rights under the CHRA.\nAllegations #10-12: Three Retaliation Incidents During the Hearing\n[174] I ordered the Complaint against the Personal Respondent amended to include three instances of retaliation that allegedly occurred during the course of the hearing. Regarding the first one \u2013 the \u201cparking lot\u201d incident \u2013 I have made a finding of fact that Mr. Thambirajah indeed appeared in front of the Complainant\u2019s vehicle, looked down at her licence plate, then looked up at her, smiled or grinned, then left. I also found that he was not parked in the same parking lot.\n[175] Regardless of whether I apply the \u201cintention\u201d requirement or not to the facts at hand, the result would be the same: Mr. Thambirajah \u201cretaliated\u201d against the Complaint for the filing of her sexual harassment claim against him. I am satisfied that \u201cintention\u201d includes \u201cwilful\u201d or \u201creckless\u201d behaviour. Applying the objective test of the \u201creasonable person\u201d, I find that, at a minimum, Mr. Thambirajah was reckless in his actions in the parking lot. He was aware of the Complainant\u2019s agitated feelings toward him and the stress experienced by her, both of which were demonstrably clear during the hearing. He gave contradictory evidence during the hearing about what happened in the parking lot. He was not believable or more apt, I did not know what to believe from his evidence. That left me with the corroborated evidence of the Complainant and Ms. Marshall.\n[176] Another element to this is the importance to the administration of justice that parties and witnesses feel safe in the confines of a trial or hearing before a court or tribunal of justice. Participants should expect that they will not be subjected to threats or intimidation, implied or otherwise, from participating in a trial\/hearing. In this case, a complainant should not be subjected to retaliation or punishment for going through with a CHRA complaint. I am satisfied that a reasonable person, looking objectively at these facts, would conclude that Mr. Thambirajah did what he did in the parking lot to get back at and punish Ms. Cassidy for filing her CHRA complaint against him, including the accompanying matters like the pressing of sexual assault charges. Even if he did not \u201cintend\u201d this as the effect of his actions, he knew they could have been interpreted in this way by the Complainant and did not care (or turn his mind to the likely consequences of his actions). His actions had a harmful impact on her that evening and into the next day at the hearing. Accordingly, I find that he infringed her rights under section 14.1 of the CHRA.\n[177] With regards to the other two allegations of retaliation, as a finding of fact, I have concluded that those events did not transpire in the way the Complainant alleges. Consequently, I am unable to find that Mr. Thambirajah retaliated against her in those instances.\nB. Liability vis-\u00e0-vis the Complaint Against Canada Post [178] The main thrust of the Complaint against Canada Post is that it failed to provide a harassment-free, safe work environment for the Complainant. Specifically, it was allegedly aware of the November 9, 2005 touching\/comment incident on the same day and did nothing to address it. It then continued to fail to properly address the escalating conflict between the Complainant and Personal Respondent thereafter. Although the Commission referred the Complaint to the Tribunal on the basis of an alleged violation of sections 7 and 14 of the CHRA, the parties, in their Statements of Particular and the presentation of evidence and argument (the Complainant did not make final submissions) at the hearing, focussed on section 14 only. Therefore, I deem the alleged violation of section 7 abandoned.\n[179] I have made numerous findings of fact regarding these issues. I will address the issue of liability by analyzing the application of the law regarding section 65 of the CHRA \u2013 corporate\/vicarious liability. That section provides that an act or omission shall not be deemed to be an act or omission of the \u201cperson, association or organization\u201d if it can be shown:\n(1) It \u201cdid not consent to the commission of that act or omission\u201d;\n(2) It \u201cexercised all due diligence to prevent the act or omission from being committed\u201d; and\n(3) It exercised all due diligence \u201csubsequently to mitigate or avoid the effect thereof.\u201d\n[180] I have made findings of liability against Mr. Thambirajah for the November 9, 2005 touching\/comment incident and the \u201cparking lot\u201d retaliation incident in February 2010, the latter of which does not form part of the Complaint against Canada Post. A corporate respondent can only be held liable under the CHRA for failing to provide a harassment-free workplace in instances where a finding of harassment has been made out. Section 4 of the CHRA says that, in order to be the subject of a remedial order under section 53 or 54, a respondent must be found to have engaged in a discriminatory practice. Accordingly, my analysis herein will address the above three branches of the section 65 test vis-\u00e0-vis my finding against Mr. Thambirajah for the November 9, 2005 touching\/comment incident only.\nThe First Criterion: Canada Post Did Not Consent to the Harassment\n[181] I am satisfied that Canada Post did not consent to Mr. Thambirajah\u2019s sexual harassment of the Complainant on November 9, 2005. First, I have made a finding of fact that it did not become aware of it until Ms. Cassidy\u2019s April 25, 2006 written complaint which she gave to Mr. Tidman on that day. Canada Post has contracted with CUPW anti-discrimination\/harassment provisions, including processes for dealing with said complaints, in their successive Collective Agreements. Canada Post has in place extensive policies\/procedures dealing with this area. I heard evidence about the training that is given to managers and workers regarding same. Furthermore, Canada Post had no way of preventing Mr. Thambirajah\u2019s actions. Indeed, as a shop steward, it would not expect such behaviour on his part.\n[182] Mr. Tidman\u2019s and Ms. Edmunds\u2019 reaction and action upon learning of the November incident on April 25, 2006 illustrate the seriousness with which they took this matter and that the Corporation would never consent, condone or support such behaviour. Such behaviour is clearly in violation of Canada Post\u2019s anti-discrimination\/harassment policies and a breach of Mr. Thambirajah\u2019s responsibilities and obligations as an employee.\nThe Second Criterion: It Exercised Due Diligence to Prevent the Act From Being Committed\n[183] My comments above also show the due diligence on the part of Canada Post to prevent such acts from occurring.\nThe Third Criterion: It Exercised Due Diligence Subsequently to Mitigate\/Avoid the Effects\n[184] Canada Post did many positive things in furtherance of this third criterion, some of which went above and beyond CHRA-mandated requirements. However, there were many other glaring examples where it failed to meet the due diligence threshhold in addressing the November 9, 2005 incident, for which I must find it liable.\n[185] First, I will discuss the positive actions. At the outset, I must commend the actions of Mr. Tidman and Ms. Edmunds. They were the principal Canada Post management people who dealt with this issue. Some of the things that they did to \u201cmitigate the effects\u201d of the November sexual harassment incident were:\n(1) Mr. Tidman immediately attempted to contact Ms. Edmunds, the Human Rights Officer;\n(2) They both showed compassion and sensitivity dealing with Ms. Cassidy. Mr. Tidman made several attempts to see about the status of the investigation. Ms. Edmunds spoke frequently with her, comforting her. She was empathetic toward the Complainant, \u201cfeeling\u201d for her. I accept her evidence that, until she questioned what had occurred as a result of reading Ms. Cassidy\u2019s March 2007 Complaint to the Commission, \u201cDoris had me by the heart strings\u201d;\n(3) On her own initiative, Ms. Edmunds spearheaded Ms. Cassidy\u2019s transfer out of Willowdale D to Oshawa in October 2006. I mention this notwithstanding Mr. Thambirajah had been transferred to another location \u2013 Unionville \u2013 by this time;\n(4) Ms. Edmunds\u2019 investigation report and findings were fair and reasonable, subject to my specific misgivings as described below.\n[186] There were other actions that were decent, thoughtful and mitigating, such as: providing two weeks\u2019 \u201cfree vacation pay\u201d to Ms. Cassidy; alerting Corporate Security to watch over her in Oshawa, etc. These were more out of response to the \u201congoing harassment\u201d that Ms. Cassidy complained of, which I have not found to be discriminatory under the CHRA as a result of my findings of fact and\/or law. However, one could argue that these mitigating measures address, and owe their genesis to, the incident that started off the conflict: the November 9, 2005 touching\/comment incident.\n[187] What wasn\u2019t done to CHRA-standards vis-\u00e0-vis the November 9, 2005 incident? To answer this question, I focus on the following: the \u201ccomedy of errors and miscommunication\u201d to quote Ms. Edmunds. There is no question that there was a profound miscommunication between Mr. Tidman and Ms. Edmunds in the period of April 25-May 14, 2006. It was inadvertent, but it occurred nevertheless and could have been prevented. What was the result of this miscommunication:\n(1) The 10-day period to discipline Mr. Thambirajah was missed. What is its significance? First, had it not been missed, Ms. Edmunds\u2019 recommendation in her September 1, 2006 Investigation Report of a 5-day \u201cmajor misconduct suspension\u201d without pay against Mr. Thambirajah would have been implemented by management. Along with the other disciplinary recommendations, this would have properly addressed the wrong that had been done to Ms. Cassidy on November 9, 2005 as well as sent a signal to Mr. Thambirajah and others about what is surely unacceptable behaviour: sexual harassment in the workplace. Employee complainants, such as Ms. Cassidy, had a reasonable expectation that said terms and conditions in the Collective Agreement negotiated between Canada Post and CUPW would be met. Furthermore, the other disciplinary recommendations could have been enforced by Canada Post, including those that occurred only by way of consent of Mr. Thambirajah;\n(2) The investigation could have begun three weeks earlier and concluded earlier too, rather than providing the Report and Recommendations to the parties in September 2006. The Union had, not unjustly, complained on August 2006 about the delay. Article 56.05 (Investigation) of the Collective Agreement reads:\n(a) When the Corporation receives a signed complaint, it shall commence an investigation within a reasonable time and at all times, use its best efforts to commence its investigation within three (3) working days.\n(b) The Corporation shall ensure that the investigation is completed within a reasonable time.\n(3) Canada Post should have been proactive sooner and asked Ms. Cassidy if she wished to be temporarily transferred out of Willowdale D, pursuant to Article 56.07 of the Collective Agreement. After all, by the time Ms. Cassidy gave her written complaint to Mr. Tidman on April 25, 2006, he (and therefore Canada Post) was aware of the recent swearing\/verbal altercations in April between the Complainant and Personal Respondent, which resulted in their both being disciplined.\nWhat Could Have Prevented the Miscommunication?\n[188] I appreciate that \u201chindsight is 20\/20\u201d. However, there is a benefit to examining this, not just from the perspective of learning what went wrong, but also to prevent its re-occurrence. The latter is provided for in the Tribunal\u2019s \u201cfuture practices\u201d remedial powers found in paragraph 53(2)(a) of the CHRA.\n[189] First, I appreciate that the miscommunication occurred between two intelligent and experienced people. Secondly, the miscommunication was due to human error and facilitated by technology or the lack thereof. Finally, other circumstances aided in this, such as Ms. Edmunds being out of the office on business during this critical period after April 25, 2006. It could have been avoided if Mr. Tidman had specifically stated in his email and telephone calls to Ms. Edmunds that he was now contacting her with regards to a previously undisclosed allegation of sexual harassment: i.e., the touching\/comment incident on November 9, 2005, and not about the April 10-19, 2006 swearing\/language incidents. And of course, from Ms. Edmunds\u2019 end, she might have reasonably suspected, or at least had cause to investigate, whether his email and voice mail messages were about something different, given that it had been two weeks (April 12 or 13) since he had called her about the swearing\/language incidents.\n[190] The lack of a fax machine or scanner at Willowdale D and no \u201cautomated absence message\u201d for Ms. Edmunds\u2019 email account also contributed to the miscommunication. As well, while Ms. Edmunds was away, the envelope with the April 25 complaint that Mr. Tidman had mailed was sitting unopened in her office for three weeks. She had no assistant or alternative person in place to deal with urgent matters in her absence, or if she did, Mr. Tidman was not aware of that person.\nC. Union Involvement in this Matter [191] CUPW was not named as a party respondent in this proceeding. Accordingly, I have not made any adverse findings against it, including its handling of such member vs. member\/shop steward allegations of harassment.\nVIII. REMEDY [192] Having found the Complaints against Mr. Thambirajah and Canada Post substantiated in part, I turn now to the question of remedy under section 53 of the CHRA. The goal of the CHRA and other anti-discrimination human rights statutes is to \u201cmake a complainant whole\u201d, to put that person in a position s\/he would have been in \u201cbut for the discrimination\u201d the complainant suffered. The CHRA is a remedial statute. Its goal is to compensate, not punish a respondent. That said, aggravating (as opposed to punitive) and mitigating factors are relevant to the award of compensation. The remedy must be reasonable and have a nexus or causal link to the discriminatory practice found to have occurred.\nA. Remedy vis-\u00e0-vis the Complaint Against Mr. Thambirajah \u201cPain and Suffering\u201d and \u201cWilful and Reckless\u201d Compensation For the Sexual Harassment\n[193] I have reviewed the following Tribunal sexual harassment jurisprudence dealing with compensation \u201cfor any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice\u201d up to a limit of $20,000 and \u201cspecial compensation\u201d for discriminatory practices that have been engaged in wilfully or recklessly up to a limit of $20,000, pursuant to sections 53(2)(e) and 53(3) of the CHRA, respectively. In addition to authorities filed by the parties, I reviewed the following decisions: Woiden v. Lynn, 2002 CanLII 8171; Bushey v. Sharma, 2003 CHRT 21; Des Rosiers et al. v. Barbe, 2003 CHRT 24; Goodwin v. Birkett, 2004 CHRT 29; Mowat v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 31; Hunt v. Transport One Ltd., 2008 CHRT 23; and Naistus v. Chief, 2009 CHRT 4.\n[194] Regarding the issue of \u201cwilful\u201d and \u201creckless\u201d discriminatory conduct, I am satisfied that such an award is appropriate in this matter. Mr. Thambirajah ought to have known that his actions and words on November 9, 2005 were \u201cunwelcome\u201d by Ms. Cassidy. I believe he did know that such conduct was unworthy of a co-worker and especially, a union shop steward. At the very least, his actions and words constituted sexual harassment against Ms. Cassidy done in a \u201creckless\u201d fashion, with no regard as to the consequences.\n[195] To this end, I am awarding compensation for pain and suffering in the amount of $5,000 and \u201cspecial compensation\u201d in the amount of $2,500 to the Complainant. I determined the quantum upon reviewing the awards in the sexual harassment cases listed above. Here it was a single event and the physical contact was of a brief duration and of a relatively less severe nature than in other cases.\n\u201cPain and Suffering\u201d and \u201cWilful and Reckless\u201d Compensation For the Retaliation\n[196] The prohibition against retaliation under section 14.1 of the CHRA is a separate, specialized type of \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d. It calls for the consideration of a separate head of damages in the form of compensation. I expressed earlier the importance of complainants being able to file a CHRA complaint with the Commission and pursue their rights under the CHRA to be free from discrimination and harassment without the fear of retaliation or reprisal. This is especially so during the conduct of the proceeding before the Tribunal. Thus, the violation of her right to be free from retaliation attracts compensation for Ms. Cassidy\u2019s \u201cpain and suffering\u201d. I also find that Mr. Thambirajah retaliated against her (i.e., the parking lot incident) \u201cwilfully\u201d or at the very least \u201crecklessly\u201d. Given the history that he had with Ms. Cassidy leading up to and during the hearing, he should have been nowhere near her vehicle and her after the hearing, let alone looking at her licence plate, then looking back at her with a smile or grin.\n[197] In this regard, I am awarding compensation for pain and suffering in the amount of $2,000 and \u201cspecial compensation\u201d in the amount of $500 to the Complainant. The quantum reflects the relatively limited impact that the discriminatory act of retaliation had on the Complainant.\nOther Remedies Sought by the Complainant\n[198] In her Statement of Particulars, the Complainant requested the following additional remedies against the Personal Respondent: that he be dismissed from his job at Canada Post, or in the alternative, be disciplined; and that he \u201cbe stripped of all his union committees\u201d and his position as shop steward.\n[199] It is unclear whether I have the jurisdiction to grant these requested remedies, given the lack of submissions on this point from the parties. This is separate from the issue of whether these remedies would be appropriately linked causally to the discriminatory acts of sexual harassment and retaliation which I have found. As well, CUPW is not a party to these proceedings and would no doubt be impacted from said remedies as they relate to the Collective Agreement negotiated between it and Canada Post. For the foregoing reasons, I decline to order said remedies.\nB. Remedy vis-\u00e0-vis the Complaint Against Canada Post [200] Canada Post\u2019s counsel argues at para. 88 of his final submissions: \u201cAs Ms. Cassidy made no submission whatsoever as to remedy, the Corporation submits that it is too late for her to now seek any remedy with respect to wages or compensation for pain and suffering.\u201d I disagree. While it is true the Complainant did not make any final submissions (for the reasons enumerated in detail in this Decision), Canada Post (and Mr. Thambirajah) were put on notice of her requested remedies early on in the proceeding, as listed in her Statement of Particulars. There is also ample evidence \u2013 viva voce and documentary \u2013 pertaining to said requested remedies, and on which Mr. Machelak cross-examined. Indeed, counsel addresses the merits of her claim for lost wages at paras. 89-90 of his final submissions.\n\u201cPain and Suffering\u201d and \u201cWilful and Reckless\u201d Compensation\n[201] I outlined earlier in the Liability section my findings against Canada Post. They were related to the November 9, 2005 touching\/comment incident only. And so the remedy must match the discriminatory conduct so found \u2013 the \u201ccausal link\u201d. I have also factored in mitigating circumstances, including the many positive, ameliorative things Canada Post did for the Complainant, mostly at the direction of Ms. Edmunds. Furthermore, I have considered the lack of action and \u201cmixed signals\u201d sent by the Complainant in matters such as bidding\/transferring out of Willowdale D. As well, I do not believe that any violation of her rights by Canada Post was engaged in wilfully or recklessly and so no such award will be made. I wish to add that, just because an employer did not exercise \u201call due diligence\u201d, does not mean per se that the employer was \u201creckless\u201d or \u201cwilful\u201d, attracting such compensation pursuant to section 53(3) of the CHRA.\n[202] Consequently and based on the foregoing, I am awarding compensation for \u201cpain and suffering\u201d to the Complainant by Canada Post in the amount of $5,000. The quantum has been arrived at considering the emotional impact and anxiety on the Complainant as a result of Canada Post\u2019s lack of due diligence.\nLost Wages\n[203] By the end of Ms. Cassidy\u2019s cross-examination, she was claiming for lost wages for 17 days, beginning on April 12, 2006 and concluding on November 30, 2007. No claim was made for days between November 9, 2005 and April 11, 2006. During the hearing, the Complainant, both directly and through her representative Ms. Marshall, made it clear that she is claiming as against Canada Post for lost wages, not as against Mr. Thambirajah.\n[204] As with other remedial heads, any order for lost wages to be paid must be linked to the violation of her rights under the CHRA by Canada Post. Even if I were to assess this particular remedial request from the perspective of section 65 (1) - i.e., Canada Post \u201cstanding in the shoes\u201d of Mr. Thambirajah \u2013 the days claimed as lost wages would still have to be causally linked to the discriminatory practices found against Mr. Thambirajah (i.e., the November 9, 2005 touching\/comment incident and the retaliation incident). The first day claimed \u2013 April 12, 2006 \u2013 was the day both she and the Personal Respondent engaged in inappropriate language and name-calling. I have not found Canada Post liable for their handling of the swearing\/language behaviour of the Complainant and Personal Respondent during the period of April 10-19, 2006, nor have I found the Personal Respondent liable for these incidents. Accordingly, Canada Post is not liable to compensate her for using a vacation day on April 12, 2006.\n[205] The 16 other claimed days, beginning on November 15, 2006 and ending November 30, 2007 all occurred after the April 25, 2006 notification by Ms. Cassidy of the November 9, 2005 incident. They were taken, according to the Complainant, as a result of the stress and \u201congoing harassment\u201d by Mr. Thambirajah. They are not tied or linked to the items for which I found Canada Post lacking in due diligence \u2013 e.g., missing the 10-day discipline period, not being more proactive and acting sooner with regards to separating the Complainant and Personal Respondent, etc. Nor are they causally linked to or \u201cas a result of the discriminatory practices\u201d that I have found against the Personal Respondent. Accordingly, I decline to make an order against Canada Post for compensation of those lost wages.\nComplainant and Personal Respondent Never Working Together Again\n[206] To prevent a future re-occurrence of harassment or retaliation by Mr. Thambirajah against Ms. Cassidy while the two are employees of Canada Post, I am granting her request for an Order that Canada Post ensure that Ms. Cassidy and Mr. Thambirajah are never placed in the same station\/depot again. I am satisfied that such an Order falls within my broad remedial jurisdiction under the CHRA.[1]\nHer Own Designated Mail Route\n[207] In her Statement of Particulars, the Complainant requested an Order requiring Canada Post to assign a designated mail route to Ms. Cassidy. She wrote, \u201cI feel that I have earned it after what I have been subject [sic] to endure in the last 4 years, and would like to have the freedom of choice.\u201d I decline to grant this remedy because there is no causal link established between the remedy requested and the discriminatory practices that I have found against Canada Post (or the Personal Respondent for that matter).\nC. Interest on Compensation Awards Payable by the Respondents [208] Simple Interest, calculated on a yearly basis, and at a rate equivalent to the Bank of Canada rate (monthly series), shall be awarded on all compensation ordered. The interest period shall run from the date of the filing of the Complainant\u2019s CHRA complaint with the Commission to the payment of said compensation awards with respect to the \u201charassment\u201d findings of liability. With respect to the compensation for \u201cretaliation\u201d, the interest period shall run from the date of the granting of the motion to amend the Complaint to include allegations of retaliation to the payment of said compensation award.\nD. Retention of Jurisdiction [209] I shall remain seized to deal with any implementation issues for a period of three months from the date of this Decision and Order.\nIX. ORDER [210] Having found the Complaints of Doris Cassidy against Raj Thambirajah and Canada Post Corporation substantiated in part, the Tribunal orders that:\nCompensation\n(1) Mr. Thambirajah shall pay the Complainant compensation for pain and suffering for the sexual harassment in the amount of $5,000 and \u201cspecial compensation\u201d in the amount of $2,500;\n(2) Mr. Thambirajah shall pay the Complainant compensation for pain and suffering for the retaliation in the amount of $2,000 and \u201cspecial compensation\u201d in the amount of $500;\n(3) Canada Post shall pay the Complainant compensation for pain and suffering in the amount of $5,000;\nComplainant and Personal Respondent Never Working Together Again\n(4) Canada Post shall ensure that Ms. Cassidy and Mr. Thambirajah are never placed in the same station\/depot again;\nInterest on Compensation Awards Payable By the Respondents\n(5) Simple Interest, calculated on a yearly basis, and at a rate equivalent to the Bank of Canada rate (monthly series), shall be awarded on all compensation ordered.

Complaint & Adjournment Request [1] On August 25, 2011, pursuant to section 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act), the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) requested that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) institute an inquiry into the complaint of Diane Carolyn Emmett (the Complainant) against Canada Revenue Agency (the Respondent). The Complainant alleges that she has been subject to adverse differential treatment in the course of her employment as she has not been given the same opportunities for development and advancement as her male colleagues and more youthful employees. In this regard, the Complainant also alleges that the Respondent has systemically discriminated against women by denying them employment opportunities. Accordingly, she claims to have been a victim of discrimination on the basis of sex and age, contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the Act.\n[2] On September 26, 2011, the Respondent filed a Notice of Application for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision to refer this matter to the Tribunal. On November 16, 2011, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal adjourn its proceedings in this matter pending the outcome and appeal, if any, of its judicial review application.\nII. Law & Analysis [3] Pursuant to section 48.9(1) of the Act, proceedings before the Tribunal are to be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow. Accordingly, in deciding whether to grant an adjournment, the Tribunal must weigh the goal of resolving human rights complaints in a timely manner against the requirement to be fair to all parties and to provide them with a full and ample opportunity to present their case (see Leger v. Canadian National Railways Company, [1999] Ruling No. 1, CHRT File T527\/2299, (Nov. 26, 1999) at paras. 4-6 [Leger]; and, Baltruweit v. Canadian Security Intelligence Service, 2004 CHRT 14 at paras. 12-17 [Baltruweit]).\n[4] Relying on Leger and Baltruweit, the Respondent argues that, as master of its own procedure, the Tribunal may adjourn proceedings where appropriate in its discretion, having regard to the principles of natural justice. In this regard, the Respondent submits that its ability to mount a defence to the Complainant\u2019s allegations is compromised without a decision on the judicial review. Given that the Commission\u2019s investigator recommended dismissal of the complaint and without the benefit of adequate written reasons from the Commission setting out the basis for its referral, the Respondent is unaware of the preliminary case to meet and, therefore, cannot present a meaningful response to the complaint that they would otherwise have if reasons were provided.\n[5] The Respondent\u2019s argument fails to consider the separate roles of the Commission and the Tribunal under the Act. With regards to a complaint of discrimination under the Act, the role of the Commission is to investigate the complaint and determine whether an inquiry into the complaint by the Tribunal is warranted (see sections 43, 44 and 49 of the Act). If an inquiry is requested by the Commission, section 50 of the Act provides that the Tribunal give all parties a full and ample opportunity to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations. As such, the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry proceeds without reliance on the Commission\u2019s investigation report and\/or reasons for referring the complaint. In each case before the Tribunal, the complainant must establish a prima facie case of discrimination and, if established, the respondent is given an opportunity to demonstrate that the discrimination did not occur or was justified under the Act. Therefore, through the Tribunal\u2019s proceedings, the Respondent will be made aware of the Complainant\u2019s case and will be given a full and ample opportunity to present its case.\n[6] The Respondent also argues that if the adjournment request is denied, and the application for judicial review is successful, the Tribunal proceedings will be rendered a legal nullity and will be terminated. As a result, there would be a needless expenditure of both public and private resources. Furthermore, the Respondent points out that the Complainant has also filed two additional complaints with similar allegations, which are currently at the investigation stage before the Commission. Therefore, it may be beneficial to all parties to have all three complaints heard together.\n[7] Both these arguments are speculative and do not raise issues of natural justice or procedural fairness. Absent any fairness issues, pursuant to section 48.9(1) of the Act, the Tribunal\u2019s proceedings in this matter should continue as expeditiously as possible.\n[8] For these reasons, in my opinion, the Tribunal would be justified in dismissing the Respondent\u2019s request for an adjournment.\nSigned by\nShirish P.

Complaint [1] On June 8, 2011, pursuant to subsection 49(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the Act], the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) requested that the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) institute an inquiry into the complaints of Stephen Closs (the Complainant) against Fulton Forwarders Inc. (FFI) and Stephen Fulton (Mr. Fulton). The Complainant claims FFI engaged in discriminatory practices, contrary to paragraphs 7(a) and 7(b) of the Act, on the grounds of disability and family status. The Complainant also claims that FFI and\/or Mr. Fulton engaged in a discriminatory practice, contrary to paragraph 14(1)(c) of the Act, on the same grounds.\nII. Complainant\u2019s Evidence [2] As part of the inquiry into these complaints, a hearing was held on February 2, 2012 in Cambridge, Ontario. At the outset of the hearing, the parties presented the Tribunal with an Agreed Statement of Facts. Together with these agreed facts, the Complainant testified as to his version of the events that gave rise to these complaints as follows.\n[3] The Complainant was employed as a truck driver by FFI. Located in Cambridge, Ontario, FFI is a trucking transport business that delivers goods within Ontario and also between Ontario and Quebec. In 2008, the Complainant worked under the supervision of Terence Fulton, President of FFI, as a replacement driver, filling in for drivers who were sick or on vacation. In February 2009, Stephen Fulton, the Operations Manager for FFI, hired the Complainant as a part-time driver. According to the Complainant, at the beginning of his part-time employment with FFI, he worked primarily day shifts. In addition to his day shifts, the Complainant was sometimes asked to work night shifts. Over time, the Complainant claims that the request to work night shifts grew to a point where he was working up to four night shifts a week, on top of his day work. During this time, the Complainant described his work load as \u201crunning hard\u201d for FFI, working sixty to seventy hours a week, with little time to sleep between his shifts. From February 9, 2009 until his last shift with FFI on May 14, 2010, the Complainant was under the direct supervision of Stephen Fulton and reported to him directly.\n[4] The Complainant advised FFI that he had a \u201cdisease\u201d which impacted his eyesight. The Complainant testified that he told both Terrence and Stephen Fulton, at the outset of his employment relationship with each of them, that he suffers from Jessner\u2019s, a form of lupus. According to the Complainant, his lupus affects his nervous system and causes him some fatigue. The Complainant added that some of the medication he takes to address his condition affects his eyesight. This requires him to get eye exams every six months. On occasion, the Complainant would have to miss work for medical appointments or because of the side effects of the medications he was prescribed. The Complainant testified that, at first, FFI was accommodating and understanding concerning any time off he needed to attend to his medical condition. As a result of his condition, the Complainant claims to have also requested that he be able to bring his friend, Tim Caskenette, along with him on his runs in order to help him stay awake. The Complainant claims that FFI was aware that Tim Caskenette was riding with him for this reason. In fact, the Complainant stated that he has no complaint about FFI\u2019s accommodation in this regard.\n[5] Under the heading \u201cCloss\u2019s Medical Condition\u201d, at paragraph 12 of the Agreed Statement of Facts, it states that the Complainant advised Mr. Fulton that he could no longer drive at night and that FFI agreed to this request. During his testimony, the Complainant explained that he did not request that FFI no longer schedule him for night driving. Rather, as he felt he was getting \u201cburnt out\u201d by his day\/night work schedule, he requested that he be allowed to go home and sleep between shifts or that his hours be scaled back. The Complainant claims to have even suggested to Mr. Fulton that he hire another driver to reduce his workload.\n[6] In April 2009, the Complainant and his spouse found out they were pregnant. On or about April 13, 2009, the Complainant\u2019s spouse went to the hospital for an ultrasound. The ultrasound indicated there were complications with the pregnancy, and the Complainant\u2019s spouse set up an appointment with her personal physician for later in the day to discuss the nature of the complications. The Complainant was on duty at the time he found out about the complications with the pregnancy and the scheduled appointment. He phoned Mr. Fulton to advise him of the situation and his desire to be with his wife for the appointment. According to the Complainant\u2019s testimony, arrangements were made by Mr. Fulton to expedite the loading\/unloading of his truck, which allowed him to finish his runs early, and leave work to attend the appointment.\n[7] At the appointment, the Complainant and his wife learned that their pregnancy had been lost and that his wife would need to go to the hospital to receive treatment. As the Complainant was scheduled to work another shift that evening, he phoned Mr. Fulton to discuss the situation and requested the night off to go to the hospital with his wife. According to the Complainant, he was denied the night off and was threatened with termination should he not work his shift. The Complainant claims Mr. Fulton told him words to the effect of \u201cYou have a job to do \u2013 so do it\u201d. The Complainant decided he would stay at the hospital until the miscarriage occurred, and told Mr. Fulton that he would call him again at that point.\n[8] At around 12:00am, on April 14, 2009, the Complainant and his spouse suffered the miscarriage. Shortly thereafter, the Complainant again phoned Mr. Fulton to discuss the situation and claims to have requested a few days off to grieve the loss of the pregnancy with his wife. Once he advised Mr. Fulton of the miscarriage, the Complainant claims that Mr. Fulton told him words to the effect of \u201cThe first thing that\u2019s good for you is getting your ass back in that truck and driving down the highway because you\u2019re going to get your mind off it\u201d. While the Complainant understood the comment to be related to Mr. Fulton\u2019s own experience with having suffered a miscarriage and his way of coping with it, the Complainant did not feel as though working would be best for him. Subsequently, the Complainant claims he was denied any time off and was threatened with termination should he not work. According to the Complainant, the words of Mr. Fulton were to the effect that \u201cI\u2019m going to have to fire you and get a real truck driver because you can\u2019t do your job right\u201d. Therefore, the Complainant went to work.\n[9] In September 2009, the Complainant and his spouse once again learned they were pregnant, this time with twins. On or about December 17, 2009, the Complainant\u2019s spouse was hospitalized due to complications with this second pregnancy. The Complainant was on duty at the time he found out about his spouse\u2019s hospitalization. The Complainant phoned Mr. Fulton to advise him of the situation and his desire to be with his wife. According to the Complainant, he was denied permission to leave his shift to be with his wife at the hospital. The Complainant testified that Mr. Fulton told him words to the effect that \u201cit\u2019s a miscarriage, she\u2019ll get over it, just do your job\u201d. During his shift, on or about Friday, December 18, 2009, the Complainant\u2019s spouse suffered a second miscarriage. Subsequently, the Complainant again claims to have requested some time off to grieve the loss of the pregnancy with his wife. The Complainant claims he was again advised by Mr. Fulton that if he did not come to work his employment would be terminated. Therefore, the Complainant worked his next shift on Monday, December 21, 2009.\n[10] On or about Friday, April 9, 2010, the Complainant sustained a leg injury. The Complainant testified that he slipped on mud in FFI\u2019s yard while getting out of his truck. The Complainant testified that he attempted to reach Mr. Fulton on April 10 and 11 to discuss the injury, leaving him messages. On April 11, 2010, Mr. Fulton phoned the Complainant and they discussed the leg injury over the phone. During this conversation, the Complainant advised Mr. Fulton that he could not work because he was having difficulty walking and that he needed to consult with his doctor concerning the injury. Also during their conversation, the Complainant testified that Mr. Fulton asked that he not file a Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) claim in respect of the injury, and assured the Complainant that FFI would compensate him during his time off. Subsequent to this conversation, the Complainant testified that he obtained a note from his doctor, which he gave to Mr. Fulton, indicating that he required a week off to allow his leg injury to heal.\n[11] During his week off, the Complainant again consulted with his doctor regarding his injury and it was recommended that the Complainant take an additional week off from work to allow his injury to heal. Another note was prepared, dated April 20, 2010, indicating that the Complainant was to be off work from the 12th to the 26th of April. The Complainant phoned Mr. Fulton to indicate that he required another week off from work and could only return to work on April 26, 2010. In response, the Complainant testified that Mr. Fulton requested that he attend at FFI\u2019s yard on April 23, 2010 to clean out his truck to allow another driver to drive it during the Complainant\u2019s absence.\n[12] On or about April 23, 2010, the Complainant went to FFI\u2019s yard to meet with Mr. Fulton and to clean out his truck. At that time, the Complainant provided Mr. Fulton with the doctor\u2019s note, dated April 20, 2010. The Complainant claims to have questioned Mr. Fulton as to why, given he was returning to work on the 26th, he had to clean out his truck. The Complainant testified that Mr. Fulton advised him that a new driver was hired to cover his shift and that there was no longer work available for the Complainant. A Record of Employment (ROE), dated April 23, 2010, was issued to the Complainant under code D \u201cillness or injury\u201d. Under \u201cexpected date of recall\u201d, the ROE indicates \u201cunknown\u201d. According to the Complainant, at this point, the conversation became heated and during this exchange he claims that Mr. Fulton advised him to \u201cride out\u201d employment insurance benefits in order to address his \u201cdisease\u201d.\n[13] At this time, it was the Complainant\u2019s understanding that his employment with FFI was no longer available to him; however, he does recall Mr. Fulton offering him replacement duties should they become available. On this basis, and as he feared refusing a shift could jeopardize his claim for employment insurance benefits, the Complainant worked one more shift with FFI on May 14, 2010, replacing a driver who was sick. Subsequently, the Complainant testified that due to the fact that he had launched the present complaints, he was advised to no longer return to work for FFI because doing so could jeopardize his legal proceedings\/complaints against FFI.\n[14] Mr. Tim Caskenette also testified as part of the Complainant\u2019s evidence at the hearing of this matter. As indicated above, and confirmed by Mr. Caskenette, he accompanied the Complainant during truck drives to help him stay awake. Apart from not being able to recall the physical exchange of the medical note and the ROE on April 23, 2010, Mr. Caskenette\u2019s testimony was consistent with his witness statement, which he testified was prepared by him independently based on his own memory of the events in question in this complaint. Overall, Mr. Caskenette\u2019s evidence was supportive of the Complainant\u2019s version of the events giving rise to this complaint.\nIII. Has The Complainant Established a Prima Facie Case of Discrimination? [15] The complainant in proceedings before the Tribunal must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is \u201c\u2026one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent\u2026\u201d (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 SCR 536 at para. 28 [O\u2019Malley]). In this case, the Complainant has alleged a contravention of paragraphs 7(a), 7(b) and 14(1)(c) of the Act.\nA. Complainant\u2019s allegations under paragraph 7(a) of the Act [16] With regard to his termination, the Complainant alleges that his knee injury and his ongoing treatment for lupus were factors in FFI\u2019s decision to terminate his employment. Given Mr. Fulton\u2019s comments regarding the Complainant\u2019s spouse, the Complainant also claims that his family status was a factor in the decision to terminate his employment. As a result, the Complainant submits that he was discriminated against on the basis of his disability and family status in his employment contrary to paragraph 7(a) of the Act.\n[17] Paragraph 7(a) of the Act provides that it is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly, to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination. In complaints under paragraph 7(a), the complainant must establish a link between a prohibited ground of discrimination and the employer's decision to refuse to employ or continue to employ (see Roopnarine v. Bank of Montreal, 2010 CHRT 5 at para. 49). That said, discrimination does not need to be the only reason for the decision. It is sufficient that discrimination be one factor in the decision (see Holden v. Canadian National Railway Co., [1990] F.C.J. No. 419 (F.C.A.) (Q.L.); and, Khiamal v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), 2009 FC 495 at para. 61).\n[18] In this case, the Complainant suffered a knee injury, a physical impairment which resulted in a functional limitation on his ability to drive a truck. As such, I find the Complainant\u2019s knee injury was a physical disability under the Act (see the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d at section 25 of the Act; and, Desormeaux v. Ottawa (City), 2005 FCA 311 at para. 15 [Desormeaux]). Having received from the Complainant a doctor\u2019s note indicating that he could return to work on April 26, 2010, FFI presented the Complainant with an ROE, dated April 23, 2010, indicating code D \u201cillness or injury\u201d. The ROE is an indication that the Complainant was no longer working with FFI as of April 23, 2010. Furthermore, FFI hired a another driver to perform the Complainant\u2019s work and indicated to the Complainant that, although he could return to the workplace once his knee healed, only replacement duties (filling in for drivers who are sick or on vacation) would be made available to him. This is in contrast to the sixty to seventy hour work weeks the Complainant indicated he had been working on a regular basis. While the Complainant may not have been terminated, he was no longer offered continued employment in the same capacity as he had been prior to the injury. This is similar to the situation in Tanzos v. AZ Bus Tours Inc., 2007 CHRT 33, aff\u2019d 2009 FC 1134, where the Tribunal found that an employer\u2019s refusal to return an employee to full-time duties, and only offering her part-time duties following her doctor\u2019s recommendation that she no longer work in the evening, constituted a prima facie case of discrimination under paragraph 7(a) of the Act. Given the Complainant\u2019s evidence, I find that he has established a link between his knee injury and FFI\u2019s decision to issue the ROE and no longer continue to employ the Complainant in the same capacity as he had been employed before.\n[19] While the issuance of the ROE arose from the Complainant\u2019s leg injury, the Complainant testified that other discriminatory factors may have factored into FFI\u2019s decision. The Complainant testified that, at the time of the issuance of the ROE on April 23, 2010, Mr. Fulton advised him to \u201cride out\u201d employment insurance benefits in order to address his \u201cdisease\u201d. The Complainant indicated that he informed FFI at the outset of his employment, through both Terence and Stephen Fulton, that his \u201cdisease\u201d was Jessner\u2019s, a form of lupus. According to the Complainant, at times his lupus limited his ability to drive a truck. To address those limitations, he requested some time off on occasion and that Mr. Caskenette ride with him. Given this evidence, I am satisfied that the Complainant\u2019s lupus is also a physical disability under the Act (see the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d at section 25 of the Act; and, Desormeaux at para. 15). While FFI argued that the Complainant never provided medical documentation to it or to the Tribunal to establish that he has lupus, aside from making this statement, FFI did not challenge the Complainant\u2019s assertion that he suffers from lupus before this Tribunal. Nor was any reason advanced as to why the Complainant\u2019s assertion that he has lupus is not credible. Therefore, given the Complainant\u2019s testimony regarding Mr. Fulton\u2019s comments at the time of the issuance of the ROE, I also find there to be some evidence of a link between the Complainant\u2019s lupus and FFI\u2019s decision to no longer continue to employ him.\n[20] Therefore, the Complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination, on the ground of disability, both his leg injury and his lupus, under paragraph 7(a) of the Act.\n[21] With regard to Mr. Fulton\u2019s alleged comments regarding the Complainant\u2019s spouse, the evidence presented by the Complainant indicated that the comments were made in the context of the Complainant\u2019s request for leave following each of the miscarriages. Sufficient evidence was not led to establish that those events and related comments somehow factored into FFI\u2019s decision to issue the ROE in April 2010. As a result, I fail to see a link between Mr. Fulton\u2019s alleged comments regarding the Complainant\u2019s spouse and FFI\u2019s actions in April 2010.\nB. Complainant\u2019s allegations under paragraph 7(b) of the Act [22] The Complainant also claims to have been denied accommodation by FFI at the time of his wife\u2019s two miscarriages. As a result, the Complainant submits that he was discriminated against on the basis of family status contrary to paragraph 7(b) of the Act.\n[23] Paragraph 7(b) of the Act provides that it is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee in the course of employment on a prohibited ground of discrimination. To \u201cdifferentiate\u201d is to create a distinction or to treat someone differently (see Tahmourpour v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2009 FC 1009 at para. 44 [Tahmourpour]; varied on other grounds in Tahmourpour v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2010 FCA 192 [Tahmourpour (FCA)]; and, Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FC 445 at para. 254). However, not every distinction is discriminatory, as the Act qualifies the differential treatment with the term \u201cadversely\u201d. According to the Federal Court, \u201cadverse\u201d is an adjective that in its ordinary meaning means harmful, hurtful or hostile (see Tahmourpour at para. 44; see also Tahmourpour (FCA) at para. 12). Finally, the adverse differential treatment must be based on a prohibited ground of discrimination. In this case, the Complainant argues that he was adversely treated by FFI on the basis of his family status.\n[24] In determining the scope of the protection against discrimination on the ground of family status, the Supreme Court of Canada has supported an approach that focuses on the harm suffered by the individual, regardless of whether that individual fits neatly into an identifiable category of persons similarly affected (see B. v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), 2002 SCC 66 at para. 46 [B]). In this regard, an approach to determining discrimination based on the harm suffered by the individual is reflected in the purpose of the Act at section 2:\nall individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices..\n(Emphasis added)\nIn the employment context, the Tribunal has stated that section 2 of the Act is a clear recognition, within the context of \"family status\", of an individual\u2019s right and duty to strike a balance between work and family obligations, coupled with a clear duty on the part of an employer to facilitate and accommodate that balance (see Brown v. Canada (Department of National Revenue), 1993 CanLII 683 (CHRT) at p. 20 [Brown]). On this basis, the Tribunal has recognized that the scope of \u201cfamily status\u201d can also include an individual\u2019s duties and obligations within the family (see Brown; Hoyt v. Canadian National Railway, 2006 CHRT 33 [Hoyt]; Johnstone v. Canada Border Service Agency, 2010 CHRT 20 [Johnstone]; and, Seeley v. Canadian National Railway, 2010 CHRT 23 [Seeley]).\n[25] The British Columbia Court of Appeal has suggested that only a \u201cserious interference\u201d between work and family obligations will result in a prima facie case of family status discrimination in the employment context (see Health Sciences Assoc. of B.C. v. Campbell River and North Island Transition Society, 2004 BCCA 260). However, the Tribunal and the Federal Court have rejected this approach as conflating the threshold issue of prima facie discrimination with the second-stage bona fide occupational requirement analysis; and, as creating a hierarchy of grounds of discrimination, where the ground of family status is singled out for a different and more onerous prima facie standard (see Hoyt; Johnstone; Seeley; and, Johnstone v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FC 36).\n[26] FFI argues that the requirements to establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on family status are as follows:\nthe evidence must demonstrate that family status includes the status of being a Parent and includes the duties and obligations as a member of society and further that the Complainant was a parent incurring those duties and obligations. As a consequence of those duties and obligations, combined with an employer rule, the Complainant was unable to participate equally and fully in employment with her employer\n(Johnstone at para. 55)\nBased on these requirements, FFI argues that the Complainant does not qualify as being a parent; that there is no employer rule inhibiting the Complainant from participating equally and fully in his employment; and, that the request to extend the definition of family status to cover the circumstances of this case stretches the definition beyond that of any prior jurisprudence and beyond a reasonable interpretation.\n[27] While the requirements outlined in Johnstone are instructive, they cannot automatically be applied in a rigid or arbitrary fashion in every case. Rather, the circumstances of each case must be considered to determine if the Complainant has established a prima facie case pursuant to the test established in O'Malley. I would add that the Act does not define the term \u201cfamily status\u201d as some provincial legislatures have chosen to do under their respective human rights schemes (see for example the definition of \u201cfamily status\u201d at subsection 10(1) of the Human Rights Code of Ontario; and, paragraph 44(1)(f) of the Alberta Human Rights Act). Therefore, Parliament has left it to the Tribunal to ascertain the meaning of the term \u201cfamily status\u201d. I have also not been referred to any jurisprudence that restricts the definition of \u201cfamily status\u201d under the Act to being a parent or being in a parent-child relationship. As was stated above, in determining the scope of the protection against discrimination on the ground of family status, the focus is on the harm suffered by the individual, regardless of whether that individual fits neatly into an identifiable category of persons similarly affected (see B at para. 46). =\n[28] In the circumstances of this case, the Complainant testified as to the pain he felt for not being there to support his wife during and after the miscarriages. He also testified as to the grief he experienced as a result of the lost pregnancies and the continuing effect that those losses have had on him. With specific regard to the second miscarriage, the Complainant testified that it still hurts him today that he was not there to be with his wife during and after the miscarriages. He explained that the experience with the miscarriages has made him fearful of getting pregnant again and that he avoids interacting with other people who may be pregnant. He claims he has become depressed by not having time to mourn the loss of the pregnancies and that this in turn has affected his home life. The Complainant claims he is now seeking counseling to address these issues.\n[29] In their closing submissions, the Respondents stated that the Complainant\u2019s testimony clearly demonstrated an individual with deep feelings regarding the miscarriages suffered by his spouse. I agree, but I believe it is more appropriate, given these circumstances, to characterize the loss of the pregnancies as suffered by the Complainant and his spouse together, as a family. The relationship between spouses is protected by the ground of family status (see meaning of \u201cfamily status\u201d in Schaap v. Canadian Armed Forces, 1988 CanLII 125 (CHRT) at p. 27, rev'd on other grounds [1989] 3 F.C. 172 (C.A.); and, in Justice Walter Surma Tarnopolsky & William F. Pentney, Discrimination and the Law, Vol. 2 (Toronto: Carswell, 2004) at p. 9-3).\n[30] In the situation where his wife had complications related to her pregnancies and had to go to the hospital, the Complainant felt he had an obligation within his family to be there with her to provide comfort and support. When the pregnancies were lost, the Complainant also felt he had an obligation within his family to take time off to grieve the losses with his wife. The Complainant claims to have asked FFI for time off to address these family obligations, but was denied such leave.\n[31] In denying his request for time off, the Complainant claims that FFI created a hurtful distinction between the Complainant\u2019s family obligations and work obligations. As described above, this distinction, which resulted in the Complainant not being able to attend to his family obligations, caused the Complainant some pain. According to the Complainant, there was no attempt to facilitate a balance between his family and work obligations. Rather, based on the Complainant\u2019s evidence, FFI was only concerned with ensuring that the Complainant got his job done, without consideration of his family obligations. On this basis, I am satisfied that the Complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination, on the ground of family status, pursuant to paragraph 7(b) of the Act.\nC. Complainant\u2019s allegations under paragraph 14(1)(c) of the Act [32] Paragraph 14(1)(c) of the Act provides that it is a discriminatory practice, in matters related to employment, to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Throughout his employment with FFI, the Complainant claims to have been harassed by Stephen Fulton, contrary to paragraph 14(1)(c) of the Act. Specifically, the Complainant claims that Mr. Fulton made continuous use of profane language in addressing and directing him; that the Respondent refused to accommodate his reasonable requests without consideration or explanation; and, that the Respondent routinely threatened to terminate his employment in the event \u201che chose to exercise his statutory rights\u201d or when the Complainant raised concerns about compliance with hours of work regulation. The Complainant adds that the Respondent routinely dismissed the severity of the miscarriages or their aggregate impact on him. In this regard, in addition to the comments the Respondent made at the time of the miscarriages, the Complainant testified that the Respondent also made a comment to the effect that \u201cmaybe if you got rid of your wife, you could actually work harder and wouldn\u2019t have to worry about going home to spend time with your wife\u201d. In the context of discussing his lupus, the Complainant also claims that Mr. Fulton suggested that he ask his doctor about medicinal marijuana.\n[33] Within the meaning of section 14 of the Act, harassment has been defined as unwelcomed conduct, directed at another person on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination. By its definition, harassment generally requires an element of persistence or repetition; however, the more serious the conduct and its consequences, the less repetition may be necessary. The severity of the impugned conduct is assessed from the perspective of the reasonable person in the circumstances (see Janzen v. Platy enterprises ltd., [1989] 1 SCR 1252; and, Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Armed Forces), [1999] 3 FC 653).\n[34] With regard to the allegations of the use of profane language and the threats related to statutory rights\/hours of work, the Complainant did not establish that these acts were related to a prohibited ground of discrimination. I would add that the Complainant\u2019s allegations relating to his family obligations were addressed above under paragraph 7(b); and, aside from FFI\u2019s reasons for issuing the ROE, the Complainant testified that he did not have a complaint regarding FFI\u2019s actions with regard to his lupus.\n[35] In discussing the comment made by Mr. Fulton with regard to medicinal marijuana, the Complainant testified that he was not sure whether the comment was an actual suggestion or was just a joke. Either way, the Complainant\u2019s testimony did not establish that the marijuana comments persisted beyond the one incident or that the severity of the one comment was such that it constituted harassment.\n[36] I also find that there is insufficient evidence to establish harassment on the basis of the Complainant\u2019s allegation that Mr. Fulton routinely dismissed the severity of the miscarriages or their aggregate impact on him. The Complainant testified about the comments the Respondent made at the time of the miscarriages, however, there was little evidence regarding any persistency in these comments outside of when the Complainant made requests for time off. While the Complainant, in his testimony, claims that the Respondent made an additional comment to the effect that the Complainant should get rid of his wife, the Complainant did not elaborate as to when this comment was made, the context in which it was made, or whether this persisted beyond the one incident.\n[37] Persistency aside, I also find that the severity of the comments does not meet the threshold to establish harassment. Mr. Fulton\u2019s alleged comments are focused on the Complainant fulfilling his employment obligations. While such a focus may have been insensitive to the Complainant\u2019s circumstances and family obligations, the Complainant did not indicate that the comments themselves seriously affected him. Rather, my understanding of the Complainant\u2019s testimony was that it was the denial of the time off itself that caused the Complainant pain in dealing with the miscarriages. I would add that the Complainant acknowledged that Mr. Fulton\u2019s comments regarding the miscarriages were influenced by his own experience with having suffered a miscarriage. Mr. Fulton\u2019s way of dealing with the grief was to get his mind off of it by working. While this strategy may not have been acceptable to the Complainant and the communication of such a perspective may have been done in an insensitive manner, I find this adds context to the comments made by Mr. Fulton and contributes to my finding that the severity of the comments does not meet the threshold for establishing harassment.\n[38] Given the reasons above, I do not find the Complainant to have established a prima facie case under paragraph 14(1)(c) of the Act.\nIV. Respondent\u2019s Evidence [39] For the reasons detailed above, I have found that the Complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination under paragraphs 7(a) and 7(b) of the Act on the grounds of disability and family status. Once a complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination, the respondent must demonstrate that the prima facie discrimination did not occur as alleged or that the practice is justifiable under the Act.\n[40] At the hearing of this matter, Stephen Fulton testified on behalf of FFI.\nA. Response to the Complainant\u2019s prima facie allegations under paragraph 7(a) of the Act [41] Mr. Fulton testified that the Complainant was informed, prior to injuring his knee, that another driver would share his duties with him. According to Mr. Fulton, the decision to hire another driver was in response to the Complainant\u2019s notification that he could no longer drive at night safely. According to Mr. Fulton, the Complainant was also advised in April 2010 of the loss of much of FFI\u2019s day work and the lack of work which could accommodate the no night driving requirement of the Complainant.\n[42] According to Mr. Fulton\u2019s testimony, following his knee injury, the Complainant phoned Mr. Fulton to inform him that he had slipped in the yard. Mr. Fulton says that the Complainant initially informed him that it would be six months to heal the injury. Mr. Fulton claims he offered to submit a WSIB claim, however, the Complainant said not to worry as he would say he hurt himself at home. During their phone conversion, Mr. Fulton claims to have also discussed the option of claiming employment insurance benefits to cover the Complainant\u2019s absence from work.\n[43] The genesis of the April 23, 2010 meeting at the yard was a request by the Complainant to remove his personal belongings from his truck, now being driven by another driver. When the Complainant arrived at the yard on April 23, 2010, Mr. Fulton claims he was limping and appeared to be in a lot of pain. While Mr. Fulton was provided with a note dated April 20, 2010 advising that the Complainant was unable to work for the period of April 12 to April 26, 2010, he requested a further and better medical note beyond the brief note provided. According to Mr. Fulton, the Complainant refused to provide a further note citing the cost of having to do so.\n[44] Overall, Mr. Fulton testified that his reasons for issuing the ROE were because the Complainant advised that his \u201cdisease\u201d would no longer allow him to drive at night and that FFI\u2019s daytime work was drying up. Mr. Fulton stated that he explained to the Complainant that \u201cyou got to deal with your disease\u201d and that FFI does not have short-term disability leave benefits, whereas Employment Insurance can provide him with that type of benefit. In their closing submissions, at paragraph 31, FFI added:\nGiven the lack of work and Closs having failed to provide medical clearance for [a] return to work and his ongoing advice as to a host of medical related issues and the lack of disability leave benefits Fulton advised Closs he could obtain Employment Insurance and this would permit him time to deal [with] his medical appointments and his reported disease.\n[45] FFI maintains that they did not terminate the Complainant. Rather, they note that an ROE is not a dismissal notice and that, following the issuance of the ROE, there was an offer of continued shifts in May 2010. Following his shift on May 14, 2010, the Complainant did not report for further shifts.\n[46] While the Complainant may not have been terminated at the time of the issuance of the ROE, FFI did not dispute that from that point forward it was no longer continuing to employ the Complainant in the same capacity as he was before. Whereas the Complainant was hired as a part-time driver, and would sometimes work up to seventy hours in a week; following the issuance of the ROE, he was only offered work as a replacement driver when other drivers were sick or otherwise absent from work.\n[47] It is curious that despite requesting further medical documentation regarding the Complainant\u2019s leg injury, and the effects that the injury may have on the Complainant\u2019s ability to drive a truck, FFI was still willing to have the Complainant drive a truck for them should it need a replacement driver. On this basis, without providing further medical documentation that his leg injury was healed, the Complainant was asked to work other shifts for FFI in May 2010. Therefore, I do not accept that the Complainant\u2019s refusal to provide further medical documentation regarding his ability to return to work factored into FFI\u2019s decision to issue the ROE. Nor do I accept that the ROE was issued to allow the Complainant to claim employment insurance benefits when FFI did not offer short-term disability benefits. This is not credible given that the ROE is dated April 23, 2010, and the Complainant was off work starting April 12, 2010; and, furthermore, the ROE is inconsistent with the Complainant having presented Mr. Fulton with a doctor\u2019s note indicating he could return to work.\n[48] While the circumstances giving rise to the issuance of the ROE were in relation to the Complainant\u2019s request for time off following his leg injury, by Mr. Fulton\u2019s own admission, FFI\u2019s decision to issue the ROE was primarily motivated by the Complainant\u2019s \u201cdisease\u201d and its inability to accommodate the Complainant\u2019s alleged request to no longer drive at night. This is reinforced by the Respondents\u2019 closing submissions which indicate that \u201cGiven...his ongoing advice as to a host of medical related issues...Employment Insurance...would permit him time to deal [with] his medical appointments and his reported disease\u201d. In his testimony, Mr. Fulton also admitted that he had some concern about potential abuse of time off by the Complainant, but did not pursue those concerns with the Complainant. From these statements, it appears as though FFI either did not believe that the Complainant\u2019s request for time off in April 2010 was related to his leg injury or they were just unwilling to entertain any further requests for time off from the Complainant. This is reinforced by the fact that, despite getting a doctor\u2019s note indicating he could return to work, FFI issued the ROE.\n[49] Despite Mr. Fulton\u2019s reasons for issuing the ROE, FFI argues that the Complainant never provided medical documentation to it or to the Tribunal to establish that he has lupus. As stated above, aside from making this statement, FFI did not challenge the Complainant\u2019s assertion that he suffers from lupus before this Tribunal. I would add that, notwithstanding the lack of medical documentation, FFI accepted that the Complainant could no longer drive at night and, that given this restriction and the loss of daytime work, it could not accommodate the Complainant. Even if it is true that the Complainant requested to no longer drive at night because of his medical condition, which the Complainant denies, once the accommodation request was made FFI had a duty to obtain all relevant information about the Complainant\u2019s disability and seriously consider how the Complainant could be accommodated (see Adga Group Consultants Inc. v. Lane, 91 OR (3d) 649 (Ont. Sup. Ct.) at para. 160; and, British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 SCR 3 at paras. 64-66 [Meiorin]). Given that FFI never requested medical documentation regarding the Complainant\u2019s lupus, I cannot accept that it seriously considered whether it could accommodate his alleged request to no longer drive at night. Nor was sufficient evidence led to establish that accommodating the Complainant\u2019s alleged request to no longer drive at night would have caused FFI undue hardship. In fact, FFI never led a defence under paragraph 15(1)(a) and subsection 15(2) of the Act in attempting to justify their actions.\n[50] Given the above, I find FFI\u2019s decision to issue the ROE to be discriminatory. Instead of seriously considering whether it could accommodate the Complainant\u2019s request for time off following his leg injury, FFI replaced the Complainant with another driver because they either did not believe, or were unwilling to entertain, his request for time off. While I recognize Mr. Fulton\u2019s testimony that FFI is a small business and that the trucking industry may present some unique challenges in attempting to accommodate employees; however, those factors must be considered alongside \u201c...the unique capabilities and inherent worth and dignity of every individual, up to the point of undue hardship\u201d (Meiorin at para. 62). As indicated above, the evidence in this case does not support FFI\u2019s decision to issue the ROE and no longer continue to employ the Complainant as a part-time driver.\n[51] As a result, I find that FFI has not provided a satisfactory explanation or justification for their prima facie discriminatory conduct in refusing to continue to employ the Complainant on the basis of his disability, both his leg injury and his lupus, contrary to paragraph 7(a) of the Act.\nB. Response to the Complainant\u2019s prima facie allegations under paragraph 7(b) of the Act [52] According to Mr. Fulton\u2019s testimony, when the Complainant notified him of his wife\u2019s hospitalization on April 13, 2009, it was the first he heard of the Complainant\u2019s pregnancy. At that time, the Complainant was on route with a delivery and arrangements were made to expedite the Complainant back to the home terminal. Following the Complainant\u2019s miscarriage, the Complainant and Mr. Fulton discussed the Complainant\u2019s return to work over the phone. In an attempt to be sensitive to the situation, Mr. Fulton testified about speaking with the Complainant about keeping busy, time healing and about his personal experiences with a miscarriage. Mr. Fulton denied any disregard for the situation or the feelings of the Complainant. According to Mr. Fulton, the Complainant did not request time off following the miscarriages, but decided he would continue working a reduced schedule, in order to continue receiving an income, at times when his wife was resting and other family members were available to assist her.\n[53] The Complainant\u2019s Trip Sheets for April14-17, 2009 were provided to the Tribunal as part of Mr. Fulton\u2019s testimony. The Trip Sheets, which are filled out by the driver of the truck, detail the trip information, including start and end date, pick-up and delivery location, and the mileage of the trip, for a given day. Mr. Fulton recalled that on April 14, 2009, the Complaint went to work early in the morning because he had been at the hospital with his wife the previous evening. According to Mr. Fulton, arrangements were made to have the Complainant perform one delivery and then return directly to FFI\u2019s yard. The Complainant then worked a shift on April 15, 2009, ending his shift the next day on April 16, 2009 in Bowmanville, Ontario. According to Mr. Fulton, the Complainant began his shift late on April 15, 2009 due to the fact that he was with his wife until other family members were available to be with her. On April 16, 2009, beginning in Bowmanville, the Complainant went to pick-up a load in Etobicoke. According to Mr. Fulton, as the Complainant\u2019s wife was not feeling well, arrangements were made to expedite the loading of the Complainant\u2019s truck in Etobicoke to allow for a quick return to FFI\u2019s yard. Mr. Fulton adds that the Complainant did not work the evening of April 16, 2009. On April 17, 2009, it was Mr. Fulton\u2019s understanding that the Complainant worked while his wife was sleeping.\n[54] According to Mr. Fulton, following the first miscarriage, the Complainant did not complain about his conduct or about having to work. Mr. Fulton recalls the Complainant expressing that he was having trouble getting over the loss of the pregnancy, but that he reassured the Complainant that time heals and to keep going.\n[55] Regarding the second miscarriage, Mr. Fulton testified that it was not possible to relieve the Complainant of his duties on December 17-18, 2009. The Tribunal was provided with the Complainant\u2019s Daily Log for December 18, 2009 and his Trip Sheets for December 17-18, 2009. On December 17, 2009, the Complainant made a delivery to Belleville, Ontario, and then went overnight from Bellville to Scarborough, Ontario, to pick up another load on the morning of December 18, 2009. From Scarborough, he delivered the load in Toronto, and then returned to FFI\u2019s yard in Cambridge. According to Mr. Fulton, during this time, another driver was involved in an accident. When the Complainant informed him of his wife\u2019s hospitalization and his request to be with her, he also requested that the driver involved in the accident come to relieve him. Given the accident and the other driver having worked in excess of his hours for the day, Mr. Fulton did not think it was safe for the other driver to relieve the Complainant. Also, given that the Complainant was on his way home with a load anyways, Mr. Fulton did not think the Complainant would be home any sooner whether he was relieved of his duties or completed his deliveries. Mr. Fulton added that arrangements were again made to expedite the loading of the Complainant\u2019s truck in Toronto to allow him to return home more quickly.\n[56] As December 18, 2009, was a Friday, the Complainant did not work on the weekend of December 19-20, 2009. Mr. Fulton recalls making contact with the Complainant over that weekend to discuss how he was doing and whether he was ready to return to work. According to Mr. Fulton, the Complainant was concerned about having money for Christmas. Therefore, Mr. Fulton offered him a shift for December 21, 2009. Mr. Fulton claims that the Complainant indicated to him that, as he had other family members available to be with his wife, he would work the shift on December 21, 2009. The Complainant\u2019s Daily Log and Trip Sheet for Monday, December 21, 2009 indicate that he worked from 5:30am until 7:00pm that day. The Complainant did not work an evening shift that night.\n[57] Following the December 21st shift, Mr. Fulton does not recall any discussions with the Complainant regarding his return to work or any request for time off. The Complainant next worked on December 28, 2009.\n[58] Overall, the FFI maintains that the Complainant was not treated in an adverse differential manner on the basis of his family status. FFI submits that it attempted to address the medical emergencies relating to the pregnancies and miscarriages by expediting a return to home base and providing work as requested by the Complainant. In this regard, the FFI claims that its actions were reasonable in response to the situation.\n[59] Again, without advancing a defence under paragraph 15(1)(a) and subsection 15(2) of the Act, FFI claims that it accommodated the Complainant in the circumstances prior to and subsequent to the miscarriages. Prior to both miscarriages, in the situations where his wife had complications related to the pregnancies and had to go to the hospital, FFI made arrangements to expedite the Complainant\u2019s return to the yard so he could leave work early to be with his wife. However, the crux of the complaint is that the Complainant was denied permission to leave his shift until after he completed his deliveries. While arrangements were made by FFI, sufficient evidence was not led to establish that those arrangements met FFI\u2019s duty to accommodate. Subsection 15(2) of the Act states that:\nFor any practice...to be considered to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement...it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual...would pose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost.\nGenerally, undue hardship is reached when an employer shows that it could not have done anything else reasonable or practical to avoid the negative impact on the individual (see Meiorin, at paras. 38, 64-65; and, Council of Canadians with Disabilities v. VIA Rail Canada Inc., 2007 SCC 15 at para. 130). In this case, sufficient evidence was not led to establish that FFI considered any other accommodation measures beyond expediting the Complainant\u2019s return to the yard or that it would have caused FFI undue hardship to allow the Complainant to leave his shift prior to finishing his runs. While Mr. Fulton explained that it was not possible to allow the Complainant to leave his shift prior to the second miscarriage, again, sufficient evidence was not led that FFI considered other accommodation measures beyond those that the Complainant proposed (ie. that a particular driver come to relieve him) or what undue hardship FFI would have sustained if the Complainant did not complete his deliveries.\n[60] Following the miscarriages, the Complainant also claims to have been denied time off. On the other hand, FFI says that the Complainant did not request time off, but, rather, wished to continue working a modified schedule, to keep earning an income, at times when his wife had other people with her to provide support. Given the contradictory evidence of the parties on these facts, this aspect of the complaint requires the Tribunal to make a credibility assessment. The Daily Log and Trip Sheets provided by FFI are not very helpful in this regard. While they establish that the Complainant was working on the days in question, which was not in dispute, they do not shed any additional light on Mr. Fulton\u2019s assertion that the Complainant did not request time off following the miscarriages.\n[61] In weighing the totality of the evidence presented on this aspect of the complaint, I do not find FFI\u2019s version of the events to be credible. I find it more probable than not that the Complainant requested time off following the miscarriages. In particular, some inconsistencies with FFI\u2019s version of events were identified. Following the first miscarriage, Mr. Fulton admitted to having researched whether FFI had an obligation to provide leave, whether paid or unpaid, following a miscarriage. If the Complainant had not requested time off, whether paid or unpaid, and actually wished to continue working, why would Mr. Fulton have looked into FFI\u2019s obligations in this regard? Furthermore, regarding the second miscarriage, Mr. Fulton was asked \u201cDo you not consider it reasonable for him [the Complainant] to ask you for time off?\u201d. In response, Mr. Fulton stated \u201cI gave him time off [...] During Christmas he worked one day\u201d. In its closing submissions, at paragraph 22, FFI added:\nIt was not in dispute that Closs did not work between December 22, 2009 and December 29, 2009. Fulton confirmed that work continued in their trucking business over this period except statutory holidays and subject to workload demands in the usual course. It was the position of Closs that this period in some way did not count towards a leave without providing an explanation for this position.\nWhile it maintains that the Complainant did not request time off, FFI here describes the period of December 22-29, 2009 as them providing him with leave. Finally, in response to the question \u201cHe [the Complainant] was a pain to you wasn\u2019t he?\u201d, Mr. Fulton responded \u201cNot when he was working\u201d.\n[62] This last comment is consistent with the Complainant\u2019s contention that, in the circumstances of his family\u2019s miscarriages and related requests for time off, FFI\u2019s primary concern was ensuring that he continued to work and completed his runs. The Complainant\u2019s testimony was straightforward and consistent with this allegation. Through his demeanor and answers, I had no reason to question the Complainant\u2019s capacity to remember the events surrounding the miscarriages or the credibility of his statement that he did in fact request time off following the miscarriages.\n[63] Having accepted that it is more probable than not that the Complainant requested time off following the miscarriages, FFI had a duty to consider whether it could accommodate the Complainant\u2019s request. Among the possible accommodation measures available, Mr. Fulton testified that replacement drivers may have been available to cover the Complainant\u2019s shifts. However, that measure does not seem to have been explored. That is not to say that FFI had to provide the Complainant with leave, or that it did not have valid reasons to deny the leave; however, as mentioned above, those factors must be considered alongside \u201c...the unique capabilities and inherent worth and dignity of every individual, up to the point of undue hardship\u201d (Meiorin at para. 62). While Mr. Fulton may have been of the view that the Complainant should work through the grief of the miscarriages, based on his own personal experience with having suffered a miscarriage, that is not a strategy that the Complainant shared or that could necessarily be applied to the Complainant. In this regard, \u201c[t]he importance of the individualized nature of the accommodation process cannot be minimized. The scope of the duty to accommodate varies according to the characteristics of each enterprise, the specific needs of each employee and the specific circumstances in which the decision is to be made\u201d (McGill University Health Centre (Montreal General Hospital) v. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l'H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, 2007 SCC 4 at para. 22). In this case, considering that FFI denies that the Complainant requested time off, which I do not find credible, there is no evidence to suggest that FFI seriously considered the Complainant\u2019s needs in requesting time off following the miscarriages or that FFI seriously considered whether it could accommodate those needs.\n[64] As a result, I find that FFI has not provided a satisfactory explanation or justification for its prima facie discriminatory conduct in relation to the Complainant\u2019s family status, contrary to paragraph 7(b) of the Act.\nV. Conclusion [65] Given the evidence and reasoning above, I find the complaints under paragraphs 7(a) and 7(b) of the Act to be substantiated.\nVI. Order [66] Pursuant to subsection 53(2) of the Act, if at the conclusion of the inquiry the Tribunal finds that the complaint is substantiated, the Tribunal can make an order against the person found to have engaged in the discriminatory practice. In this regard, the Complainant seeks an order with the following remedies: lost wages, interest on the lost wages; compensation for pain and suffering; compensation for having engaged in the discriminatory practice willfully or recklessly; and, such other remedy as Tribunal may determine is just.\n[67] The aim in making an order under subsection 53(2) is not to punish the person found to have engaged in the discriminatory practice, but to eliminate - as much as possible - the discriminatory effects of the practice (see Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84 at para. 13). To accomplish this, the Tribunal\u2019s remedial discretion must be exercised on a principled basis, considering the link between the discriminatory practice and the loss claimed (see Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 268 at para. 37). In other words, the Tribunal\u2019s remedial discretion must be exercised reasonably, in consideration of the particular circumstances of the case and the evidence presented (Hughes v. Elections Canada, 2010 CHRT 4 at para. 50).\nA. Lost wages [68] The Complainant seeks lost wages for the period of April 9, 2010 to December 15, 2011. According to the Complainant, his projected annual earnings for the years 2010 and 2011 would have been $63,000 per year or $1,220 per week. Therefore, over a period of 83 weeks, he would have earned $101,260. However, he mitigated those lost wages by earning $25,729 through employment insurance and other employment. Therefore, the Complainant claims he is owed $75,531 in lost wages.\n[69] FFI disputes the lost wages claim. According to them, the calculation is not applicable because their drivers are paid by the kilometer. FFI adds that the Complainant\u2019s evidence regarding his efforts to mitigate is questionable. He initially stated that he was off work until his employment insurance benefits ran out. The Complainant then obtained employment and has had employment since in or about December 2010. Therefore, FFI argues that the Complainant appears able to obtain and maintain employment when he chooses to do so.\n[70] The ROE dated April 23, 2010 issued by FFI to the Complainant indicates that the last day for which the Complainant was paid was April 9, 2010. The evidence indicates that the Complainant worked one more shift for FFI on May, 14, 2010. Subsequently, the Complainant received employment insurance benefits until, according to the Complainant, approximately the end of November 2010. The Tribunal was provided with the Complainant\u2019s T4E, Statement of Employment Insurance and Other Benefits, for the year 2010. This document indicates that the Complainant received $12,755 in employment insurance benefits for 2010.\n[71] The Complainant began employment with Challenger Motor Freight Inc. in December 2010. The Tribunal was provided with the Complainant\u2019s T4, Statement of Remuneration Paid, issued by Challenger for the year 2010, indicating he earned $5,550.27. The document does not indicate a start or end date for the Complainant\u2019s employment with Challenger. According to the Complainant, as he was not receiving sufficient hours with Challenger - only 5-6 hours a day, two to three days a week - he quit Challenger, and on the same day went to work for Wag-mar Transport Inc. The Tribunal was provided with an ROE, issued by Wag-mar on May 18, 2011. This document indicates that the Complainant started work with Wag-mar on February 11, 2011 and his last day for which he was paid was May 15, 2011. The ROE also indicates that the reason for issuing the ROE is code M \u201cdismissal\u201d. The ROE does not indicate the Complainant\u2019s income during his employment with Wag-mar, only his \u201ctotal insurable earnings\u201d. No evidence was provided regarding the Complainant\u2019s employment situation following his dismissal from Wag-mar.\n[72] Given that the Complainant was unemployed between April 2010 and December 2010 as a result of FFI\u2019s decision to issue the ROE, I accept that he suffered a wage loss for this period. While FFI questions the Complainant\u2019s efforts to mitigate his wage loss during this period, they did not advance sufficient evidence to support their claim. Furthermore, I accept the Complainant\u2019s testimony that in working for Challenger, his hours were significantly reduced from what he used to work with FFI. Despite partially mitigating his wage loss by working for Challenger, the Complaint continued to suffer a wage loss during this period.\n[73] However, despite procuring employment with Wag-mar, on a more full-time basis than with Challenger, the Complainant claims he continued to suffer a wage loss until December 2011. Sufficient evidence was not provided by the Complainant to explain why he continued to suffer a wage loss once he began employment with Wag-mar or subsequently. Specifically, I note that the Complainant\u2019s calculation of his \u201cprojected annual earnings for the years 2010 and 2011\u201d does not explain why his employment with Wag-mar ended and, as mentioned above, what the Complainant\u2019s employment situation was for the period between May to December 2011. Furthermore, while the Complainant claimed in his testimony that his legal action against FFI has made it difficult for him to find and maintain employment, sufficient evidence was not advanced to substantiate this claim.\n[74] Given the evidence and reasoning above, and pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(c) of the Act, I order FFI to compensate the Complainant for his lost wages for the period of Monday, April 12, 2010 until February 10, 2011. This amounts to 43 weeks and four days of wages.\n[75] In determining the amount to be awarded to the Complainant under this remedy, the calculation of the Complainant\u2019s wages shall follow the same method used by the parties previously, as indicated at paragraph 29 of the Agreed Statement of Facts, to calculate the amount of each week\u2019s worth of wages:\nCLC Proceeding\n29. No adjudication on the merits occurred and there was no determination as to unjust dismissal. No human rights claims were raised nor adjudicated. A without prejudice settlement was reached wherein FFI paid Closs two weeks wages.\n(emphasis added)\n[76] To avoid double compensation, the wages the Complainant received for his shift on May 14, 2010 shall be deducted from the award. Furthermore, the amount of $12,755 shall be deducted from the award to reflect the amount of employment insurance benefits the Complainant received during the relevant period. The amount of $5,550.27 shall also be deducted from the award to reflect the Complainant\u2019s earnings from Challenger in 2010. Finally, the earnings the Complainant received from Challenger in 2011 shall also be deducted from the award.\n[77] In accordance with subsection 53(4) of the Act, the Complainant also sought interest on any compensation for lost wages. As such, and pursuant to Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure, I grant interest on the lost wages award, from April 23, 2010, the date on which the ROE was issued to the Complainant, until the date of the payment of the award. The interest shall be simple interest, calculated on a yearly basis, at the Bank Rate (monthly series) established by the Bank of Canada.\n[78] I shall retain jurisdiction with regard to the lost wages award in the event any further clarification is required and until such time as the parties confirm that the terms of this aspect of the order have been implemented.\nB. Compensation for pain and suffering [79] The Complainant seeks $20,000 as compensation for the pain and suffering that he experienced as a result of the discriminatory practices. According to the Complainant, the way FFI treated him during the loss of the pregnancies and the resulting pain that it caused him warrants an award of compensation for pain and suffering. The Complainant also submits that he has suffered symptoms associated with mental distress and anxiety, which commenced after his employment with FFI and have progressively worsened since the termination of his employment. The Complainant claims he has been prescribed medication for the treatment of these symptoms.\n[80] According to FFI, the amount claimed by the Complainant is excessive given that there is evidence that indicates that the Complainant suffered from a pre-existing condition and that there were external factors affecting his mental well being.\n[81] Pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(e) of the Act, $20,000 is the maximum amount of compensation that the Tribunal can award for pain and suffering. Therefore, the Tribunal only awards the maximum amount in the most egregious of circumstances: where the extent and duration of the complainant\u2019s suffering as a result of the discriminatory practice warrants the full amount.\n[82] The Tribunal was provided with the Complainant\u2019s \u201cPatient Medical History\u201d, a printout from Shoppers Drug Mart, indicating the Complainant\u2019s prescription history. Among other medications, the Complainant was prescribed trimipramine, which the Complainant described as an anti-depressant, and ratio-fluoxetine, which the Complainant stated he took to address panic attacks. These prescriptions were both serviced on January 27, 2009, prior to the Complainant having been hired by Mr. Fulton. The Complainant also testified to having experienced anxiety and panic attacks prior to his employment with FFI, as a result of having witnessed an automobile accident at a previous job. Therefore, I do not accept the Complainant\u2019s statement that his mental distress and anxiety only commenced after his employment with FFI. Nor was the Tribunal provided evidence to support the claim that these symptoms worsened following the issuance of the ROE.\n[83] That said, I accept the Complainant\u2019s testimony that the issuance of the ROE caused him some emotional upset, which resulted in a heated exchange with Mr. Fulton and the filing of this complaint.\n[84] With regard to the miscarriages, as mentioned previously and as stated by FFI, the Complainant\u2019s testimony clearly demonstrated an individual with deep feelings regarding the miscarriages suffered by his family. However, in awarding a remedy under paragraph 53(2)(e), the Tribunal is not trying to rectify the pain and suffering the Complainant experienced as a result of the miscarriages. Rather, it is attempting to redress the effects of the discriminatory practices. In denying the Complainant time off to address his family obligations, without seriously considering his needs, FFI exacerbated the grief suffered by the Complainant as a result of the miscarriages. The Complainant testified that not being there to support his wife during the miscarriages and not being given time to grieve has had some long term effects on him, including depression. While the Complainant may have suffered from depression previously, again, I accept that the situation may have exacerbated his condition. Furthermore, the Complainant testified that he is now seeking counseling to address these issues, as his suffering is now affecting his relationship with his wife and others. That said, and without disregarding the effects of FFI\u2019s conduct, I believe the Complainant\u2019s evidence demonstrates that the bulk of his pain and suffering surrounding the miscarriages was as a result of losing the pregnancies themselves.\n[85] Given the above, and pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(e) of the Act, I feel it is appropriate to order FFI to compensate the Complainant in the amount of $5,000.00 for the pain and suffering he experienced as a result of the discriminatory practices.\nC. Compensation for having engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly The Complainant seeks $20,000 as compensation for FFI having engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly. According to FFI, there is no evidence to support wilful or reckless conduct which would give rise to damages under this head.\n[86] In order to be wilful or reckless, \u201c\u2026some measure of intent or behaviour so devoid of caution or without regard to the consequences of that behaviour\u201d must be found (Canada (Attorney General) v. Collins, 2011 FC 1168, at para. 33). Under subsection 53(3) of the Act, $20,000 is the maximum amount of compensation that the Tribunal can award for having engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly. Therefore, the award of the maximum amount should be reserved for the most severe or egregious cases.\n[87] While I do not believe that the evidence demonstrates that FFI intentionally sought to discriminate against the Complainant, I do believe that FFI demonstrated a reckless disregard for the consequences of its behaviour. In the situation of the miscarriages, the Complainant made FFI aware of his needs and asked for accommodation, but FFI chose to focus on its own needs, without giving adequate consideration to the Complainant\u2019s family obligations. In the situation resulting in the issuance of the ROE, again, the Complainant made FFI aware of his needs and his request for accommodation. FFI\u2019s reasons for ignoring that request were dispassionate towards the Complainant\u2019s needs and, in replacing the Complainant with another driver, demonstrated a reckless disregard for the accommodation process.\n[88] Given the above, and pursuant to subsection 53(4) of the Act, I feel it is appropriate to order FFI to compensate the Complainant in the amount of $5,000.00 for having engaged in the discriminatory practices recklessly.\nSigned by\nSusheel Gupta\nActing Chairperson\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nNovember 30, 2012\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1693\/4811 & T1694\/4911\nStyle of Cause: Stephen Closs v.

Context [1] The Complainant filed a human rights complaint on May 21, 2003, alleging that her employer, the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA), now known as Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), discriminated against because of her disability and refused to accommodate her, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RCS 1985, c H-6 (the Act). Section 7 of the Act reads as follows:\nEmployment\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[2] The Complainant is a legally blind woman who was employed as a Collection Contact Officer on an indeterminate full-time basis. In 1998, she sustained a non-work-related injury to her neck and upper back and to this day, suffers chronic pain. The Complainant went on disability leave for a period of two years following this incident. The Complainant\u2019s doctor deemed her fit to begin a graduated return to work in early 2001.\n[3] In the complaint form filed before the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission), the Complainant alleges that on numerous occasions, starting in April, 2001, she requested permission to work from home (Telework) as a manner for her to better manage the adverse effects of aspects of the workplace, including sitting at a desk for prolonged periods, lifting charts or files, and using a standard chair, computer monitor and mouse, as a result of her disabilities. The Complainant alleges that these accommodation requests were either avoided or refused by her employer. She also alleges that in June, 2001, a return to work plan was implemented without her consent and despite the recommendations of her doctor for a graduated and restricted work re-entry. According to the Complainant, the Respondent also denied the ergonomic assessment which had been recommended by her doctor.\n[4] In mid-November, 2001, the employer held a meeting to discuss the Complainant\u2019s progress in returning to work full-time. During this meeting, it was agreed that the Complainant would benefit from an ergonomic assessment. The assessment was completed in January 2002 and a report was provided to management on March 11, 2002 with a recommendation that the equipment be ordered and in place by the end of March 2002. According to the Complainant, in February 2003, she had still not received all the recommended equipment.\n[5] In February 2002, the Complainant made a request for Leave with Income Averaging. This request was denied by the Respondent in April 2002 because the Complainant had not yet established a working base of 37.5 hours per week. In June 2002, the Complainant was told that she had been selected for a Telework Pilot project and would also be granted the Leave with Income Averaging she had requested. While pleased with this decision, she describes being baffled that her application for this program had been granted under the project\u2019s criteria but not for reasons of her disability.\n[6] In February 2009, the Complainant sustained a workplace injury. The software installed for her visual acuity problems was allegedly malfunctioning, causing the cursor to jump all over the screen. As a result, the Complainant says that she had to use her mouse excessively and she eventually developed a repetitive stress injury to her elbow, shoulder and neck. She has not returned to the workplace since.\n[7] The Complainant describes that throughout this period, she felt that she was being discriminated against and suffered harassment. She notes that while the CCRA has policies on Telework, Duty to Accommodate, and Employment Equity, they were not adhered to in her situation.\n[8] The Complainant filed her human rights complaint with the Commission on\nMay 21, 2003. In a decision dated February 9, 2007, the Commission dismissed the complaint. This decision was judicially reviewed by the Federal Court and on May 22, 2008, the matter was remitted back to the Commission for redetermination. The Commission carried out two investigations and referred the Complaint to the Tribunal on September 10, 2010.\nII. Amending the Complaint [9] On June 28, 2012, the Complainant filed her Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d) with the Tribunal. The first two paragraphs of the SOP read as follows:\nThis is a case of discrimination, adverse differential treatment and harassment contrary to Sections 7 and 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (hereinafter called \"the Act\"). The Complainant, Pamela Egan, asserts that her employer, the Respondent, Canada Revenue Agency (\"the Respondent\"), contravened the Act by discriminating against her, and by adopting policies and practices that adversely impacted her due to her disabilities. Ms Egan further asserts that the Respondent harassed her as the result of her disabilities.\nMs Egan also asserts that the Respondent pursued policies and engaged in practices that had an adverse differential impact on Ms Egan's career opportunities. To bring all pertinent sections of the Act into conformity with the facts as asserted, Ms Egan anticipates requesting of this Tribunal that she be permitted to amend her complaint to include an allegation of discrimination contrary to Section 10 of the Act.\n[Emphasis Mine]\n[10] In addition to the events described in the initial complaint, the SOP described a series of incidents of harassment which are alleged to have occurred over the course of her employment with the Respondent. The SOP also contained allegations regarding the Respondent\u2019s failure to provide the Complainant with the training and accessible materials that were available to her sighted colleagues and would have permitted her to fulfill her career aspirations. Despite her excellent work record, fifteen years later, the Complainant remains at the PM01 (now SP4) level at which she was hired and links her lack of promotion to the Respondent\u2019s discriminatory practices.\n[11] Shortly after its receipt of the Complainant\u2019s SOP, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal expressing concern with the new allegations raised in the SOP, which the Respondent alleges were not raised during the Commission process. The Complainant replied to these concerns, characterizing the addition of sections 10 and 14 as mere housekeeping amendment arising out of the central facts of the complaint. Unsatisfied with this response, the Respondent submitted that the most appropriate means to deal with these issues was to have the Complainant file a formal motion, following which the Respondent would provide more fulsome submissions on the request to amend the complaint. The Complainant filed a motion to amend the complaint on September 6, 2012.\n[12] For ease of reference, sections 10 and 14 of the Act read as follows:\nDiscriminatory policy or practice\n10. It is a discriminatory practice for an employer, employee organization or employer organization\n(a) to establish or pursue a policy or practice, or\n(b) to enter into an agreement affecting recruitment, referral, hiring, promotion, training, apprenticeship, transfer or any other matter relating to employment or prospective employment,\nthat deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nHarassment\n14 (1) It is a discriminatory practice,\n(a) in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public,\n(b) in the provision of commercial premises or residential accommodation, or\n(c) in matters related to employment,\nto harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nIII. The Parties\u2019 Positions A. The Complainant\u2019s position [13] The Complainant is of the view that all of the impugned allegations are merely elaborations upon the initial complaint and that the addition of sections 10 and 14 of the Act to the complaint stems naturally from the facts alleged by the Complainant in her complaint. The Complainant disputes that denial of employment opportunities within the meaning of section 10 and harassment within the meaning of section 14 of the Act were not considered in the course of the investigation of the complaint.\n[14] The Complainant submits that Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 1 sets a relatively low threshold for amending a complaint and that, unlike situation in Cook v. Onion Lake First Nation, (2002), 43 CHRR D\/77 and Tran v. Canada (Revenue Agency), 2012 CHRT 31 where there existed no factual connection between the original complaint and the amendment sought by the Complainants, the proposed amendments in this motion simply add the legislative provisions engaged by the Complainant\u2019s existing allegations. The Tribunal in Gaucher at paragraphs 14, 15 and 17 held that there is no bright line between sections 7 and 10 of the Act. The Complainant submits that her allegation that the application of the Respondent\u2019s policies resulted in discrimination inevitably requires consideration for the application of those policies in general. According to the Complainant, the addition of section 10 merely \u2018clarifies the legalities\u2019 of the complaint, and therefore meets the test for amendment.\n[15] The Complainant submits that the impugned allegations simply serve as examples to demonstrate the ongoing pattern of the failure to accommodate on the part of the Respondent, which is consistent with the purpose of the SOP. The Respondent does not, contrary to what it alleges, have to respond to new allegations of which it was unaware when the process started. The Complainant submits that the Respondent has ample time at this stage to prepare its submissions on the basis of the added sections and therefore, does not suffer any prejudice as a result of this amendment. While the Complainant agrees that this complaint has been plagued with significant delays, they have impacted both parties equally. The Complainant also submits that the purported 20 new witnesses identified by the Respondent should reasonably have been anticipated as they are linked to the Complainant\u2019s initial allegations of lack of accommodation.\nB. The Respondent\u2019s position [16] The Respondent contends that the crux of the allegations contained in the Complainant\u2019s original complaint concern the Respondent\u2019s alleged failure to provide a timely provision of ergonomic equipment and the delay in approving the Complainant\u2019s request for Telework and Leave with Income Averaging. These are the issues which the Respondent had to defend before the Commission at the investigation stage.\n[17] The Respondent argues that the new allegations of harassment and systemic discrimination have no link to the original complaint, are not mentioned in any of the Investigation Reports considered by the Commission, and are tantamount to filing a new complaint. The Respondent submits that expanding the scope of the complaint so as include sections 10 and 14 of the Act would effectively bypass the Commission\u2019s referral process at the root of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction pursuant to sections 44(3)(a) and 49(1) of the Act. The Respondent relies on the Tribunal\u2019s position in Gaucher at Para. 8:\nThe Commission must have considered the essential situation that forms the subject-matter of the inquiry, when it referred the Complaint to the Tribunal. This places certain limits on amendments, which must have their pedigree in the circumstances that were put before the Commission.\n[18] The Respondent is of the view that to allow the amendment would seriously undermine the fairness of the process and open up a new and unanticipated route of inquiry. The Respondent states that out of the 37 witnesses identified during its review of the Complainant\u2019s SOP, 20 are new witnesses which the Respondent had not previously anticipated calling and which the Respondent would need to interview in order to respond to the allegations. The Respondent submits that it will take a significant amount of time to locate and interview these witnesses as some are no longer with the Public Service as they have changed jobs, retired or passed away. The Respondent claims to have contacted some of these witnesses and that a number of them could not recall the events set out by the Complainant in her SOP and stated that it was the first time that they were hearing the impugned allegations. In addition, the Respondent\u2019s retention policy requires employees to keep documents up to two years and it is therefore unlikely that these potential witnesses will have retained any documents relating to these issues.\n[19] The Respondent submits that the Complainant had many opportunities to amend her complaint and yet this motion has been filed two years after the matter was referred by the Commission. Had the Complainant raised these allegations during the investigation of the complaint, the Commission would have interviewed these witnesses to determine the veracity of the allegation and the Respondent would have received the appropriate notice required for the preservation of evidence. The Respondent submits that the significant passage of time will impede its ability to mount a full answer and defence. To permit these allegations to be raised for the first time, over nine years after the filing of the original complaint will cause substantial prejudice to the Respondent. The motion to amend should therefore be dismissed and the Complainant\u2019s SOP accordingly amended so as to remove the paragraphs dealing with the allegations of harassment and systemic discrimination.\nC. The Commission\u2019s position [20] While the Commission initially indicated that it would not be filing submissions on the Complainant\u2019s motion as they would not participating at the hearing in this matter, it reconsidered its position and filed submissions on October 4, 2012. The Commission stated that it does not object to the Complainant\u2019s motion as it is of the view that the amendments do not alter the substance of the complaint and will not prejudice the Respondent.\nIV. The Respondent\u2019s Supplementary Motion Record [21] On October 15, 2012, following the Commission\u2019s submissions on the motion to amend the complaint, the Respondent filed a Supplementary Motion Record which contained a copy of a memorandum to file authored by George Kolk of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, dated November 15, 2006. In this memorandum, Mr. George Kolk, Manager of Investigations, informed the Complainant\u2019s representative that if the Complainant had issues subsequent to the alleged events in the Complaint Form, she should file a new complaint. The Respondent argues that the Commission\u2019s current position is inconsistent with its advice of November 15, 2006.\n[22] In reply, the Complainant submitted that this evidence was hearsay as the purported author, Mr. Kolk, is not an affiant in the proceedings. The Complainant maintained that regardless, the evidence was wholly irrelevant to the motion and should therefore be disregarded. Indeed, the Complainant submits that there are no cases where a statement purportedly made by a Commission investigator to the Complainant\u2019s former representative was replied upon to determine the scope of a complaint. The Complainants contends that communications made by Commission staff to the parties during the investigation process are extraneous and do not assist in determining whether an amendment falls within the scope of the original complaint. Furthermore, the memorandum was written in the course of the first investigation into the Complainant\u2019s complaint which was subsequently found to be inadequate by the Federal Court. The Complainant submits that it would be absurd to construe the scope of the complaint based on an investigation that the Federal Court found to be insufficiently thorough.\nV. Analysis and Decision [23] The Tribunal\u2019s authority to amend a complaint is well-established and is not challenged by the parties in the present case. The Federal Court clearly affirms the Tribunal\u2019s discretion in this regard in Canada (Attorney General) v. Parent, 2006 FC 1313 at paragraph 30:\nThe Tribunal enjoys considerable discretion with respect to the examination of complaints under subsections 48.9(1) and (2) and sections 49 and 50 of the Act. As for the exercise of that discretion in regard to an amendment request, Mr. Justice Robert D\u00e9cary wrote in Canderel Ltd. v. Canada (C.A.), 1993 CanLII 2990 (FCA), [1994] 1 F.C. 3, 1993 CanLII 2990 (F.C.A.), that \u201c [\u2026] the general rule is that an amendment should be allowed at any stage of an action for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties, provided, notably, that the allowance would not result in an injustice to the other party not capable of being compensated by an award of costs and that it would serve the interests of justice.\u201d\n[24] It is clear that the \u201ccomplaint\u201d must be interpreted broadly so as to capture the full extent of the complainant\u2019s allegations and that it is open to refinement. As long as the substance of the original complaint is respected, or said otherwise, as long as the allegations are by their nature linked, the Complainant and the Commission are permitted to clarify and elaborate upon the initial allegations before the matter goes to a hearing: Gaucher at paragraph 11. The line is drawn where the amendment sought to the complaint can no longer be considered a \u201cmere amendment\u201d but becomes substantially a new complaint. \u201cIn such a situation, the Commission cannot be said to have requested an inquiry and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to proceed\u201d: Cook v. Onion Lake First Nation at paragraph 11.\n[25] In addition to establishing a link between the complaint and the amendment, the Tribunal must also examine the possible prejudice that the Respondent could suffer in allowing the Complainant to amend its complaint. The case law does not specify the degree of prejudice that must be demonstrated so as to deny an amendment, but it must be \u201creal and significant\u201d. As stated in Cook v. Onion Lake First Nation at paragraph 20, there must be \u201cactual prejudice\u201d and \u201cthere may be factors such as delay which are implicitly prejudicial. This might include the loss of the investigation and conciliation processes\u201d.\n[26] In applying these principles to the facts of the present case, I note that the two amendments sought are distinct both in their nature and scope. I have therefore addressed each of them separately, in turn.\nA. Adding section 14 of the Act to the Complaint [27] In establishing whether or not the amendment sought constitutes a \u201cnew complaint\u201d, the starting point is to examine the impugned allegations. The Complainant\u2019s harassment allegations are stated at paragraph 142 of her SOP. They read are as follows:\n142. Over the course of her employment with the Respondent, Ms. Egan was harassed by Respondent employees on the basis of her disabilities. These experiences of harassment included:\n(a) Her Team Leader Ellen Howard once complained to Ms. Egan that all of the disability cases were being \"dumped\" on her. It was to Ms Howard that Ms Egan was supposed to turn to check her leave balance and salary level, since the Employee Self Service Portal was not accessible to her.\n(b) Ms Kitchen, the Human Resources contact person for Ms. Egan's writing platform, emailed and telephoned Ms. Egan to complain about the high cost of the writing platform, despite the fact that the cost was not borne by the Hamilton Tax Services Office.\n(c) The clerk who had been directed to assist Ms. Egan to input her time, Barb Nelson, regularly complained to Ms. Egan and their manager lvano Feltrin because Ms. Egan submitted her materials in an incorrect format. Ms Egan was unfamiliar with the formatting required as the system was not accessible to her.\n(d) Ms. Egan's Team Leader Ellen Howard authored and distributed a 'Work Disposal Plan for 2003-04\" to all members of her team. Ms. Egan and two other colleagues with disabilities were identified as \"disabled\" to all other members of the team for no apparent purpose. Ms. Egan was embarrassed and upset to be characterized in such a reductive way to her colleagues when it was clearly not relevant to the objectives of the document.\n(e) Ms. Egan experienced harassment from the local IT department during their visits to her home to install technology for her home office. Mr. Tony Gazzalone and Mr. Brad Moore often made Ms. Egan feel like she was asking too much when they were simply doing what management had assigned to them. On one occasion, Mr. Gazzalone accused Ms. Egan of having too much equipment. He alleged that she already had a second computer at home, when in fact, the equipment he had singled out was a paper shredder.\n[28] In addition to these allegations, the Respondent also highlights a number of other harassment allegations raised elsewhere in the Complainant\u2019s SOP. In particular:\na. The allegation that Ms. Mary Wesko, a Health Canada employee, stacked binders for Ms. Egan to use as a platform (at paragraph 7 of the SOP);\nb. the allegation that Ms. Steacy made the statement during a January 29, 2004 meeting that she did not want to be \u2018blind-sided\u2019 by accommodation requests (at paragraph 82 of the SOP); and\nc. the allegation that Mr. Bill Julian said \u201cYou put on a good act\u201d (at paragraph 127 of the SOP).\n[29] While these incidents are not mentioned in the Complainant\u2019s complaint form (CF) or the Commission Investigation Report (IR) she does describe a working environment where she is treated differently than her coworkers (CF, page 2, para. 1; page 4, paras. 1, 3; IR, para. 33.c.). She alleges a disregard for the difficulties associated with her visual disability on the part of Respondent employees. For example, she describes a meeting with Assistant Director Tony Prosia during which she alleges that he minimized all that she had been through and refused to accommodate her visual impairment by letting her use a tape recorder as a way of taking notes in one of their meetings. The Complainant also alleges a disregard on the part of Respondent employees for the measures needed to accommodate the chronic pain she suffered following her accident. These include the allegations that the Respondent ignored her requests for Telework, which would have enabled her to better manage her pain, and for an ergonomic assessment. The Complainant concludes the complaint form by stating that she believes that she has been the victim of harassment and discrimination in the course of her employment with the Respondent.\n[30] While the specific incidents of harassment are absent from the complaint form these allegations all fall within a broader theme: the alleged difficulties faced by the Complainant in her requests for accommodation for her disabilities. If her allegations of harassment are believed, the Complainant\u2019s requests for accommodations, be it to the local IT department or to the Human Resources contact person, were met with hostility, often \u201cmaking her feel like she was asking too much\u201d. This is in line with the Commission Investigator\u2019s previous observation that \u201cMs. Cordeiro said that Ms Steacy \u201cmade the complainant feel like she was \u2018not worth it\u2019\u201d (See Investigator\u2019s Supplementary Report at paragraph 13) and with the Complainant\u2019s allegations in her complaint form that her other requests for accommodation such as Telework and an ergonomic assessment were disregarded. The Complainant does not allege that she suffered harassment in these specific accommodation requests and it is evident that the incidents of harassment described in the Complainant\u2019s SOP had not previously been particularized. However, in my view, these incidents elaborate on the Complainant\u2019s initial complaint and are sufficiently linked to the initial complaint to satisfy the test for amendment.\n[31] Turning to the Respondent\u2019s submission that it will be seriously prejudiced by the amendment, I am of the view that the Respondent has had ample time and will have ample opportunity to respond to these allegations. While the Respondent may have identified additional witnesses which it had not previously planned to call, I have not been convinced that the delay has resulted in obtaining their testimony unworkable. It may be that, due to the lapse in time, some of the witnesses called will have difficulty remembering the incidents alleged. This is something that I will consider when they are called to testify. In this regard, I note that I retain jurisdiction, having examined all the evidence provided, to dismiss the Complainant\u2019s allegations of harassment should I conclude that the delays incurred have resulted in the Respondent\u2019s inability to adequately respond to the allegations thereby compromising the procedural fairness of the process.\nB. Adding section 10 of the Act to the Complaint [32] In addition to the above-stated allegations, the Complainant\u2019s SOP contains allegations regarding the Respondent\u2019s failure to provide the Complainant with the training and accessible materials that were available to her sighted colleagues. In a section entitled \u201cAccess to Training\u201d at paragraphs 110 to 123 of her SOP, the Complainant contends, amongst other allegations:\na. that on three separate occasions she was turned down for acting assignments as a PM02 position because the required material was not provided in an accessible format and she could therefore not demonstrate her competency (paragraph 112);\nb. that she was unable to fill out an Individual Learning Plan (\u201cILP\u201d) which the Respondent created with each employee on an annual basis so as to highlights the employees competencies for improvement and development as the forms were not in an accessible format (paragraph 114);\nc. that she was unable to undertake the training recommended by her team leaders on the Campus Direct program as she had to put her face up to the monitor in order to view its content and the experience was too painful (paragraph 115); and\nd. that despite her Director\u2019s promise to try to provide her with accessible forms to enable the Complainant to become part of a Pre-Qualified Pool which was required to compete for positions, the accessible forms were never provided (paragraph 116).\n[33] The Complainant contends that access to this training and materials would have permitted her to fulfill her career aspirations and that the Respondent\u2019s failure in this regard resulted in a profound prejudice to her promotional opportunities, contrary to section 10 of the Act.\n[34] Unlike the allegations of harassment, however, neither the complaint form nor the Commission\u2019s investigation discuss a loss of promotional opportunities resulting from the Respondent\u2019s discrimination. While the Complainant highlights paragraph 41 of the Investigation Report wherein the Complainant stated that \u201cshe was not given training that was accessible to her\u201d, this statement is not linked to a loss of promotional opportunities but rather to the allegation that the Respondent provided her with the equipment it thought she would require as opposed to assessing her to ensure that she was provided with the right equipment. This only serves to further exemplify the difficulties faced by the Complainant in her requests to the Respondent for accommodation for her disabilities.\n[35] The allegations of loss of promotional opportunities are related to the Complainant\u2019s disabilities broadly. As argued by the Complainant: but for the Respondent\u2019s discrimination against the Complainant on the basis of her disabilities, the Complainant would have obtained the necessary training and, in light of her excellent work record, would have been promoted. However, I do not think the test is as broad. Adopting such reasoning would mean that any discriminatory act founded on the Complainant\u2019s disability, regardless of the Complainant\u2019s initial allegations or the Commission\u2019s investigation, could later be added to the Complaint. This would disregard the importance of a logical connection or \u2018nexus\u2019 between the facts investigated by the Commission and the new allegations which, in my view, is lacking in this instance.\n[36] Issues relating to employment staffing also require different considerations than those surrounding the accommodation of an employee in their current position. In addition to examining the Complainant\u2019s performance, consideration must be had, to name a few, for the number and type of promotional processes undertaken by the employer during the relevant period, their relation to the training which the Complainant alleges was inaccessible to her and to the other candidates benefitting from the processes, none of which was investigated at the Commission stage in the present case. In my view, for the Tribunal to now embark on this new and unanticipated route of inquiry would result in a lengthier and more complicated hearing and would require an analysis and examination of allegations that are beyond the investigation conducted at the Commission stage. It is therefore, beyond the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction: Canada (Attorney General) v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1991] F.C.J. No. 334 [Q.L.]. In addition, unlike the situation in Gaucher, the Respondent did not receive any notice of these allegations prior to receiving the Complainant\u2019s SOP. To allow this amendment and require the Respondent to defend these new allegations would, in my view, undermine the fairness of the process.\n[37] For these reasons, I would dismiss the portion of the Complainant\u2019s motion to amend the complaint which seeks to include section 10 of the Act and I would strike the paragraphs 110 to 123 of the Complainant\u2019s SOP which contain the allegations relating to loss of promotional opportunities. I would grant the portion of the motion to amend seeking the addition of section 14 of the Act to the complaint.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Analysis. 17\n[1] The complaint in this matter was filed by the Complainant, Deborah P. Labelle, on September 3, 2009, with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d). On March 2, 2011, the Commission, pursuant to s. 44 (3) (a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the \u201cCHRA\u201d), requested the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \"Tribunal\") to institute an inquiry into the complaint. The Complainant alleges that the Respondent, Rogers Communications Inc., discriminated against her, on the grounds of sex, by treating her in a different manner as compared to other male employees and, ultimately, terminating her employment, contrary to s. 7 of the CHRA.\n[2] This is a ruling concerning a Motion filed by the Respondent dated September 15, 2011, seeking an order dismissing the complaint. The Respondent\u2019s grounds for the motion are that the Complainant failed to comply with her disclosure obligations, that she repeatedly failed to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s Rules and procedures and that both the Tribunal and the Respondent have been frustrated in their efforts to move this case forward due to the willful and deliberate conduct of the Complainant. The Respondent alleges that unless the complaint is dismissed there will be an abuse of process.\n[3] For the reasons given below, I am granting the Respondent's motion and dismissing the complaint.\nI. Factual Background A. Correspondence and Communications History [4] On April 8, 2011, the Commission informed the Tribunal and the Parties that it would not be participating at the hearing into the merits of this complaint. However, the Commission\u2019s letter provided the name and contact information of the Legal Counsel at the Commission assigned to this case should the Complainant have any questions.\n[5] In keeping with the Tribunal's practice with regard to all complaints, the Tribunal offered the parties the opportunity to voluntarily attend a mediation session organized by the Tribunal. A \"mediation questionnaire\" in this regard was sent to the parties by the Tribunal on April 12, 2011 (Letter No. 1). The parties were asked to reply by April 26, 2011.\n[6] On April 19, 2011, the Commission wrote to the Tribunal indicating that it was prepared to participate in mediation. On April 20, 2011, the Respondents\u2019 Counsel wrote to the Tribunal indicating that their client did not wish to participate in mediation. The Tribunal did not receive anything from the Complainant.\n[7] The courier service\u2019s Tracking History shows that the courier attempted delivery to the Complainant on April 14, 2011. On April 19, 2011, the courier service attempted delivery again and a \u201cFinal Notice\u201d card was left at the Complainant\u2019s address wherein it notified the Complainant that the \u201cItem will be returned to sender if not collected within 10 days.\u201d The letter was ultimately returned to the Tribunal.\n[8] It should be noted that the Tribunal generally utilizes a courier service and registered mail wherein a signature is required by or on behalf of the named recipient. This is so the Tribunal has some proof of receipt of their mailed communications.\n[9] The Tribunal\u2019s mediation is a voluntary regime; all Parties must consent in order for a \u201cmediation\u201d to be held. The Respondent\u2019s decision to proceed to a hearing, without mediation, rendered the Complainant\u2019s lack of a response moot. The Tribunal therefore proceeded to the next phase of setting out the dates for the disclosure and filing of documents for all Parties in preparation for a hearing into the complaint.\n[10] On April 28, 2011, by courier, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties setting out the schedule for the submission of their respective statement of particulars and documentary disclosure, pursuant to Rule 6 of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (Letter No. 2). This was the first time a schedule of dates\/deadlines was set by the Tribunal. The letter is a standard letter, explaining in detail, what is required as part of disclosure to be provided to the opposing party, including: what is required to be in the Statement of Particulars, what the proposed remedies are, lists of documentary evidence\/exhibits, lists of witnesses and witness statements, including experts and detailed calculation of wage loss.\n[11] The dates set for this submission for each Party were as follows:\ni. Canadian Human Rights Commission: May 10, 2011\nii. Complainant, Ms. Labelle: May 24, 2011\niii. Respondent, Rogers Communications Inc.: June 14, 2011\niv. Complainant\u2019s Reply : June 21, 2011\n[12] The letter stated if any assistance was required, the Parties could contact the Tribunal\u2019s Registry Officer; with the name and contact information of the Registry Officer assigned to this file provided.\n[13] Letter No. 2 to the Complainant was returned to the Tribunal, marked \u201creturn to sender\u201d. While there is no record in the file of what specific date the letter was received at the Tribunal or the Tracking History of the letter, the Tribunal\u2019s file does indicate that the Registry Officer spoke to the Complainant, after the letter was returned to the Tribunal, at which point the Complainant indicated that she had received a Notice Card from Canada Post to go pick up a letter. The Complainant further indicated that she did not have time to pick up the letter and that Canada Post must have sent it back to the Tribunal.\n[14] On May 17, 2011, the Tribunal made a second attempt to provide the Complainant with the letter. The Tribunal\u2019s file indicates that the courier service made its first attempted delivery on May 19, 2011. A Notice Card was left behind at the Complainant\u2019s address indicating that a letter was available for pick-up at the post office. On May 25, 2011, the courier service left a Final Notice card indicating that the letter at the post office would be available for pick-up and would be returned to sender if not picked up within 10 days. The Tracking History indicates that the letter was signed for and picked up by Ms. Labelle on June 2, 2011.\n[15] What remains unclear in the Tribunal file is which letter this was that the Complainant had received, i.e. whether it was the Tribunal\u2019s Letter No. 1, or Letter No. 2 that was resent to the Complainant.\n[16] On May 24, 2011, by courier, the Tribunal sent a third letter (Letter No. 3) to all Parties setting out a new schedule for disclosure upon all Parties. The reason for the amended schedule, as stated in the letter, was that: \u201c... due to an error not all parties were in receipt of the original letter dated April 28, 2011. Please be advised that in the interests of fairness to all parties, new dates of disclosure are included in this letter.\u201d.\n[17] The new dates set for disclosure and filing by each Party were as follows:\ni. Canadian Human Rights Commission: June 3, 2011\nii. Complainant, Ms. Labelle: June 17, 2011\niii. Respondent, Rogers Communications Inc.: July 8, 2011\niv. Complainant\u2019s Reply : July 15, 2011\n[18] The Commission filed their disclosure materials on May 31, 2011.\n[19] Letter No. 3 to the Complainant was again returned to the Tribunal by the courier service utilized. On July 3, 2011, the letter was sent back to the Tribunal because it had not been picked up, and was ultimately received by the Tribunal on July 7, 2011.\n[20] On June 27, 2011, 10 days after the Complainant\u2019s disclosure obligations were required to be fulfilled, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal indicating that the Complainant had failed to comply with her disclosure obligations and requested that the Tribunal dismiss the complaint.\n[21] The Tribunal Registry attempted to reach the Complainant during the weeks of June 27 and July 4, 2011, without any success. The Registry Officer left voicemail messages at the Complainant\u2019s home telephone number and mobile phone number requesting that the Complainant contact the Tribunal Registry with regards to her file.\n[22] On July 6, 2011, the Tribunal sent another letter (Letter No. 4), by courier, to the Complainant referring to Letter No. 3, indicating that the \u201cwritten particulars\u201d which were due on June 17, 2011, had not been received. The Tribunal, once again, set a new date for the Complainant of July 12, 2011 to comply with her disclosure and related documentary obligations.\n[23] On July 7, the Tribunal Registry called and spoke to the Complainant Ms. Labelle wherein the Complainant was advised that the Tribunal had received Letter No. 3 \u201creturn to sender\u201d. The Complainant explained that the reason for this was that she was not at home during the day and thus, could not sign for any couriered mail. The Complainant requested that all future communications be made by Regular Mail, left in her mailbox, to which the Tribunal Registry agreed.\n[24] Further, during this conversation, the Complainant was informed of the Respondent\u2019s Motion to Dismiss due to the failure of the Complainant in filing her Statement of Particulars and other disclosure requirements under the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure in response to which the Complainant ended her participation on the phone call.\n[25] On July 12, 2011, the Tribunal had still not received the Complainant\u2019s documentary disclosure. The Tribunal Registry Officer received a voicemail message wherein the Complainant indicated she had received Letter No. 4 requesting the Complainant\u2019s documentary disclosure \u201cand is very upset about it and feels that this whole process is a joke and would like to speak to the Registry Officer\u2019s supervisor to express her disgust with human rights.\u201d\n[26] On or around July 12, 2011[1], the Respondent\u2019s Counsel contacted the Tribunal Registry by telephone, indicating their dissatisfaction with the fact that the Complainant had been given yet another extension of time (which was provided in Letter No. 4), but the Respondent had not been granted a similar extension. The Registry Officer explained that the previous letters sent by the Tribunal to the Complainant had all been returned to the Tribunal marked as \u201creturn to sender\u201d, and therefore the Complainant had not received the previous letters. Further, the Registry Officer indicated that Letter No. 4 could be disregarded and that a new letter with new dates for all parties would be sent out to all Parties.\n[27] On July 12, 2011, in light of the new information that Letter No. 3 to the Complainant from the Tribunal had been returned to the Tribunal, a new letter (dated July 11, 2011 (Letter No. 5)) with a new set of disclosure dates was sent to all Parties. The letter stated that \u201cdue to recent issues with mailing and the Complainant not being in receipt of previous letters from the Tribunal, the Tribunal is amending all filing deadlines and further extending deadlines for all parties.\u201d. This marked the third time that a schedule\/deadline was set by the Tribunal and represented approximately a 2 month delay in the course of these proceedings.\n[28] The new dates set for each Party were as follows:\ni. Canadian Human Rights Commission: June 3, 2011\nii. Complainant, Ms. Labelle: July 26, 2011\niii. Respondent, Rogers Communications Inc.: August 16, 2011\niv. Complainant\u2019s Reply: August 23, 2011\n[29] On July 26 or 27, 2011[2], the Respondent called the Tribunal Registry Officer to indicate that they had still not received the Complainant\u2019s statement of particulars and that they were upset with the repeated extensions granted by the Tribunal.\n[30] On July 27, 2011, after 9:00pm, the Tribunal Registry received a fax from the Complainant; past the July 26, 2011 deadline for the Complainant to meet her filing and disclosure requirements. The fax\/letter stated as follows:\nFile No. 20090592\nIn response to your voice mail.\nIn response to this letter, I am seeking 1 year\u2019s salary -- $42,000 from Rogers. I did receive Unemployment benefits during this time.\nThe supporting documents are the numerous repeat documents that I have forwarded on to various people at Human Rights over the past 2 years.\nI work until 4pm and am unavailable for any conference call until after this time.\nDebbie Labelle\n[31] On August 5, 2011, the Respondent wrote an email to the Tribunal to confirm the July 27, 2011 conversation between the Respondent and the Tribunal Registry Office that the Complainant had failed to meet the time limit to serve and file her Statement of Particulars which were due on July 26, 2011. The Respondent further wrote that the Tribunal Registry Officer had advised the Respondent that they would not be required to serve and file its Statement of Particulars by the deadline of August 16, 2011. And, further, that the Tribunal would provide the Respondent reasonable advance notice if and when the Tribunal subsequently required the Respondent to serve and file its Statement of Particulars.\n[32] The same day, the Tribunal Registry was able to reach the Complainant by telephone. The Complainant was advised that the Tribunal was not in possession of any documents she may have sent to the Commission because the Tribunal is a different department and that when a complaint is referred to the Tribunal, the only document that the Tribunal receives from the Commission is the Complaint form. The Registry Officer indicated that the Complainant\u2019s letter\/Statement of Particulars was deficient as it did not comply with the disclosure requirements (statement of facts, disclosure list, witnesses, etc\u2026) and that any material in the possession of the Commission was not in the possession of the Tribunal because we are separate departments.\n[33] The Complainant advised the Tribunal Registry Officer that she was not aware that the departments were separate and that she had not taken the time to read the letters that had been sent to her previously and that she would need time to get her documents together and submit her statement of particulars. The Tribunal Registry Officer advised the Complainant that should she require any help with respect to the actual formatting of her statement of particulars that she should consult with the CHRC Counsel assigned to her case. The Complainant informed the Tribunal Registry Officer that she would be contacting the CHRC Counsel as soon as possible and she apologized for the delay.\n[34] On August 8, 2011, the Respondent sent a letter to the Tribunal seeking to have the complaint dismissed. It did not appear that this letter had been sent to the Complainant or the Commission.\n[35] On August 10, 2011, the Respondent sent the Tribunal another letter seeking to have the complaint dismissed. This letter expanded upon the August 8, 2011 letter, and also did not appear to have been sent to the Complainant or the Commission.\n[36] On August 16, 2011, the Respondent wrote again to the Tribunal with respect to the letters of August 8, 10, 2011 and a telephone call they had had with the Tribunal Registry Officer four days earlier. As August 16, 2011, was the last set deadline for the Respondent to file their respective statement of particulars and comply with their document disclosure and other requirements pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure, the Respondent indicated that they would not be filing their material by August 16, 2011 as they had received no material from the Complainant and were not in a position to \u201crespond\u201d to information they had not received. The Respondent further indicated that they were awaiting responses to their letter of August 8 and 10, 2011.\n[37] I was assigned the file the same day. I directed the Registry Officer to confirm with the Respondent that the Tribunal had received their recent letters, and directed that the Respondent was no longer required to file and serve their statement of particulars as per the disclosure schedule set out in the Tribunal\u2019s letter of July 11, 2011. Further, I directed that a Case Management Conference Call (CMCC) be held in order to discuss the Respondent\u2019s Motion to Dismiss letters, the history of the file and how to proceed.\n[38] The Tribunal Registry Officer was able to reach the Complainant by telephone on August 16, 2011 to indicate that I had requested a CMCC be held in this matter on or before August 25, 2011.\n[39] Further, the Registry Officer forwarded the Motion to Dismiss letters of the Respondent\u2019s to both the Complainant and the Commission, since they had not received those materials from the Respondent. The Registry Officer also wrote, by email, to the Respondents advising them to copy any further correspondence regarding motions or objections to both the Complainant and the Commission, in addition to sending to the Tribunal.\n[40] On August 19, 2011, the CMCC was scheduled with all Parties for August 25, 2011 at 5:00PM.\nB. August 25, Case Management Call [41] On August 25, 2011, the CMCC occurred with myself present, a Tribunal Registry Officer, the Complainant and Counsels representing the Respondent. During that call, the Agenda I had set was to discuss: 1) Clarification of the Previous Tribunal letters; 2) the Respondent\u2019s Motion to Dismiss; and, 3) Next Steps\/Procedure.\n[42] I indicated that there had been some miscommunications regarding the previous \u201cdisclosure\u201d letters which I felt was important to discuss in order to bring all Parties to a common understanding, as not all Parties were made aware of all the facts surrounding these letters. I informed the Parties that the first two letters, dated April 28 and May 24, 2011 \u2013 the copies sent to the Complainant -- were returned to the Tribunal by the courier service as \u201creturn to sender\u201d. I further explained that it was my understanding that as each letter was returned to the Tribunal, a new letter with new disclosure dates was then sent out, for example, Letter No. 3 was sent out as a result of Letter No. 2 being returned and the Letter No. 4 letter being sent out as a result of the Letter No. 3 being returned.\n[43] Ms. Labelle indicated that the Commission[3] sent her about 4 letters which she did not receive. She did not explain how she knew she had not received these letters. However, the Complainant further indicated she received Letter No. 5. The Complainant further indicated that she was not at home during the day and could not sign for registered mail. She stated that if the Tribunal wanted to send her anything further, to send it by regular mail.\n[44] I then clarified with the Complainant that the Commission is not the Tribunal and that both are separate and distinct institutions. Further, that anything she may have submitted to the Commission would not necessarily be in the possession of the Tribunal. The Complainant responded that she had only recently learned of the distinction after having spoken to the Tribunal Registry Officer on August 5, 2011.\n[45] I then summarized the conversation that occurred between the Tribunal Registry Officer and the Complainant which had occurred on July 7, 2011, wherein the Complainant was advised that the Tribunal had received Letter No. 3 \u201creturn to sender\u201d.\n[46] The Complainant indicated that she had sent a one page fax to the Commission on July 25, 2011, and then sent the same one page fax to the Tribunal on July 27, 2011. This document was her Statement of Particulars. The Complainant had not sent a copy to the Respondents.\n[47] I then summarized the conversation that the Complainant had with the Tribunal Registry Officer on August 5, 2011 (see paragraphs 32-33 above).\n[48] The Complainant indicated on the CMCC that she had not contacted the Commission for assistance even though during her August 5, 2011 call she indicated she would be contacting the Commission. That portion of the exchange of conversation between the Complainant and myself was as follows, based upon the recording of the CMCC:\nMember: On August 5th, our Registry spoke to yourself Ms. Labelle indicating that we had not received the required disclosure under the Act. Also indicated that the Commission was separate and distinct. You indicated that you had not received the Tribunal letters. You also indicated that our Registry Officer did indicate to you on the 5th that if you needed assistance in completing the required documents you could contact the Human Rights Commission. Have you contacted them?\nComplainant: I have not bothered at all.\nMember: Is there a reason for that?\nComplainant: Kind of a busy life, I have a very busy life. And I sent you the, like, and as far as I am concerned, you have all the information. Like I said, I sent you probably about, well not you, but the other entity that you referred to probably about 10 documents and you want this repeated again. I\u2019m just flabbergasted like all the information I sent you, you don\u2019t have.\nMember: We\u2019re separate government departments Ms. Labelle. Do you understand that? The Tribunal is like a court separate and distinct from the Commission which is an investigatory body.\nComplainant: Yeah I know, that\u2019s the joke I have been involved with for 2 years, I realize that.\n[49] At this point in the CMCC, I clarified to the Respondents that upon my review of the file, it was apparent that the Respondent was not made aware of the non-receipt of all of the letters by the Complainant, and the reasons the Tribunal had decided to set new disclosure dates on several occasions.\n[50] Subsequent to this, the Complainant became disconnected from the call; the Tribunal requested a break in order to attempt to reach the Complainant and determine if the Complainant could\/would re-join the call. The Registry Officer called the Complainant on a separate line. They spoke briefly and the Complainant indicated she would not rejoin the call. I then recommenced the CMCC with the Respondents wherein I indicated that the Tribunal Registry Officer was able to reach the Complainant and that the Complainant had ended her participation in the CMCC voluntarily.\n[51] Mindful of the fact that the Complainant was no longer on the CMCC, I moved the discussion along to the Respondent\u2019s Motion to Dismiss. The Respondents indicated that they would like to supplement their previous submissions and re-submit as one document. A timeline for the submission of the Motion documents was then discussed and set, as follows:\ni. Respondent\u2019s Motion: September 15, 2011\nii. Complainant\u2019s Response: October 6, 2011\niii. Respondent\u2019s Reply: October 27, 2011\n[52] A summary of the CMCC, including a bold notation about the dates with respect to the Motion, was sent to the Respondent the following day on August 26, 2011, by email, and both regular mail and e-mail to the Complainant.\nC. Further Communications and Correspondence [53] In light of the timelines that were set for the Motion, I instructed the Tribunal Registry Officer to try to reach the Complainant by telephone to ensure she had received the CMCC Summary Letter dated August 26, 2011. A message was left for the Complainant on September 7, 2011. As of September 14, 2011, the Registry Officer had not received a call back from the Complainant as had been requested. I thus requested that a Process Server be utilized in order to ensure a copy of the August 26, 2011, Summary Letter would be received by the Complainant. A copy of the letter was sent to a Process Server on September 15, 2011, which included the address of the Complainant and a request for an Affidavit of Service upon completion or attempt of service. The sworn Affidavit of Service indicates that the letter was served personally, on the Complainant Ms. Deborah Labelle, on September 21, 2011, at her residence.\n[54] On September 16, 2011, the Complainant left a voicemail message with the Tribunal Registry Officer. The Complainant expressed anger over the Respondent\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, which she had received. Specifically, she was angry with the Tribunal for allegedly sharing all of her documents with the Respondents. Some of what the Complainant said on the message is: \u201cI just got a letter from Rogers\u2019 lawyers about their Motion to Dismiss and I am very concerned with what I see. It appears that you\u2019ve given the other side all of the documents that I have forwarded on to the human rights counsel and I am pretty disgusted with that. I thought that was all proprietary information between me and the counsel.\u201d The Complainant went on to state that she had suffered a violation of confidentiality and privacy, requested to speak to the Registry Officer\u2019s supervisor and rhetorically asks if this is \u201canother plan to make sure they [Respondent] win?\u201d\n[55] That same day, the Tribunal wrote to the Complainant, copying all Parties, clarifying that the Tribunal had not shared any information or documents that she provided to Counsel with the Commission. The only document that was provided to the Respondents, by the Tribunal, was the Complainant\u2019s July 27, 2011 fax which was to have been her Statement of Particulars (see paragraph 30). The letter stated that the Tribunal was not in possession of any documents she had provided to the Commission. Further, the letter re-stated that the Tribunal and the Commission are separate and distinct entities. Finally, the Complainant was advised that should she have any concerns with the disclosure of materials she had provided to the Commission, she should contact the Commission\u2019s Counsel assigned to her file.\n[56] The Respondent filed their Motion to Dismiss and Reply within the deadline as had been previously set. The Complainant also sent her Response before her deadline as had been previously set.\nII. The Positions of the Parties A. Respondent\u2019s Arguments for the Motion [57] The Respondents made submissions with respect to the findings of the Commission\u2019s Investigation and the report submitted by the Commission\u2019s Investigator. Specifically, the Investigator made recommendations that the Commission dismiss the complaint based on the facts that it did not appear to the Investigator that the Complainant had been treated in an adverse differential manner, nor did the termination of the Complainant appear to be related to a ground under the Act.\n[58] The Respondent further argued that the Complainant disregarded and frustrated the Tribunal process. Specifically, the Respondent relied upon the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedures and Practice Note 3 which sets out the requirements upon each Party in order to advance their respective case. The Respondent argued that the failure to abide by the Rules, specifically the filing of a Statement of Particulars by a complainant, will result in a complaint being unsubstantiated. In support of this argument, the Respondent set out the list of letters and filing dates that were set by the Tribunal to which the Complainant was non-compliant.\n[59] The Respondent further argued that the \u201cTribunal has inherent authority to control its process, which includes the authority to dismiss a complaint\u201d.\n[60] The Respondent also argues that there has been harm to both Rogers and a potential harm to the reputation of the Canadian Human Rights System. The harm to Rogers is that they have incurred significant legal costs that cannot be recovered and it would be unfair to allow the Complainant to disregard the Tribunal\u2019s rules and processes while requiring Rogers to comply.\n[61] With regards to the reputation of the Canadian Human Rights System, the Respondent submits that the Complainant \u201cis abusing the limited public resources available for the Canadian Human Rights System to pursue her personal vendetta against Rogers, which is not the result of discrimination based on a protected ground under the Act. Ms. Labelle has stated that she has given the Commission all information she has in support of her complaint. Given that Ms. Labelle has no other evidence to substantiate her complaint, proceeding with a hearing into Ms. Labelle\u2019s complaint would be an inefficient use of the Tribunal\u2019s limited resources.\u201d\nB. Complainant\u2019s Response Arguments [62] The Complainant submits that she had never received the first 4 letters from the Tribunal and thus, was never made aware of her deadlines for compliance with her disclosure obligations and document preparation and submission obligations pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure.\n[63] The Complainant also argues that once she did finally receive a letter from the Tribunal, setting out her obligations, she did comply, but was later informed that her material was incomplete. The Complainant stated that she had assumed all of her previous submissions[4] were already with the Tribunal. She submits that it was only in August of 2011, that she was informed that the Tribunal did not have any documentation she may have previously submitted to the Commission.\n[64] The Complainant further submits that she was informed that she could contact the Commission for assistance, but as she does not get home until between 4:30-5:00 p.m., her experience has shown that staff at the Commission leave between 4:00-4:30 p.m.\n[65] The Complainant argues that she lives with 2 teenage daughters who repeatedly check messages before the Complainant comes home and thus the Complainant never gets the messages. The Complainant states that if she does not receive the letters or messages, then she does not know that something is required of her.\n[66] With regards to the August 25, 2011, CMCC, the Complainant submits that \u201cmy cell phone dropped the call. Given the run around that Mr. Nixon [Counsel for the Respondent] was causing on the conference call, I refused to re-join the call to listen to more of the same harassing conversation he was subjecting us to.\u201d\n[67] The Complainant submits that she has provided irrefutable evidence to support her claim. Further, she submits that the Respondent has made misleading statements.\n[68] The Complainant argues that the last communication she received from the Tribunal was with regards to the conference call and that she has received no further requests from them [the Tribunal] requiring any more submissions.\n[69] The Complainant submitted the following with regards to her knowledge of the process: \u201cAnd, I\u2019d also like to point out that as a lay person, the terms Statement of Particulars has little meaning to me. We lay people do the best we can when a request is made. If more information is still required, then I should have been advised of this requirement from the Tribunal rather than find this out from Rogers.\u201d\n[70] Finally, the Complainant submitted and concluded the following with respect to her Response to the Motion: \u201cAnd as I stated above, this document is going only to the Commission. I will not be sending ANY information to Rogers.\u201d\nIII. Analysis [71] It is the Commission\u2019s role to investigate into a complaint and within their sole discretion whether to refer a complaint to the Tribunal for an Inquiry. A decision of the Commission can be judicially reviewed by a Party only to the Federal Court of Canada. Here, the Respondent had an opportunity to seek judicial review the decision of the Commission, but chose not to do so. The Tribunal is not an appellate body to which a Party can appeal decisions of the Commission, nor does the Tribunal have the jurisdiction to review a decision of the Commission, (Public Service Alliance of Canada (Local 70396) v. Canadian Museum of Civilization Corp., 2006 CHRT 1 at para. 27; International Longshore & Warehouse Union (Maritime Section), Local 400 v. Oster, [2001] F.C.J. No. 1533, 2001 FCT 1115 at para. 29; Tweten v. RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd., [2004] C.H.R.D. No. 14, 2004 CHRT 8 at para.17) (at para. 27).\n[72] As such, I do not place any weight on this aspect of the Respondent\u2019s arguments.\n[73] Rule 1(5) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure states that \u201cUnless the Panel grants an extension or an adjournment, all time limits for complying with these Rules and all dates set for a hearing, a motion or a case conference are peremptory.\u201d\n[74] At no time throughout these proceedings has there been any request by the Complainant seeking an adjournment or extension of time in order for her to fulfill her filing and disclosure requirements. Acknowledging that there were some mailed correspondence, which set out the \u201cdue dates\u201d for the Complainant to provide her materials, that the Complainant did not receive, there is also evidence that the Complainant was made aware of her responsibilities by both voicemail messages left for the Complainant and telephone conversations with the Tribunal Registry on July 7 and August 5, 2011. Further, the Complainant indicated she had received Letter No. 5 from the Tribunal which also set out compliance dates for her documents. She failed to meet those dates and did not ask for an extension of time.\n[75] The Complainant was made aware by both the Commission and the Tribunal that her matter had been forwarded on to the Tribunal. The Complainant was aware that mail had been sent to her, by courier, and she had never gone to pick them up. While the Complainant had indicated that she worked outside of her home during the day and thus, could not be there to sign for and receive registered mail, she was able to do so on June 2, 2011. The Complainant\u2019s choice not to pick up the other registered mail sent to her frustrated the efforts of the Tribunal in moving her complaint forward and was a repudiation of the Tribunal\u2019s processes.\n[76] These facts are akin to those of Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2009 CHRT 31 (CanLII), where it was stated, at para. 20:\n\u201cAny party seeking leave or authorization from the Tribunal to file documents outside prescribed time limits should at least be able to demonstrate that there was some valid justification for the late filing\u201d. The Complainant\u2019s justification for not filing on time was that she had never received the Tribunal\u2019s correspondence. She further indicated that she had filed material with the Commission and felt that that was enough. This is not a valid justification, particularly given the fact of the evidence of the telephone calls she had with the Tribunal Registry wherein her missed filing deadlines and a clarification of the distinctions between the Commission and the Tribunal were discussed. Further, the Complainant\u2019s deliberate choice not to pick up the registered mail is not a valid justification.\n[77] In Johnston v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2007 CHRT 42 (CanLII), the Tribunal recognized the two approaches which have developed with respect to dismissal for delay previously pointed out in Seitz v. Canada, 2002 FCT 456.\n[78] The first approach, which is sometimes referred to as the \"classic\" test, was set out in Nichols v. Canada, [1990] F.C.J. No. 567 (F.C.T.D)(Q.L.). It is a threefold test consisting, first, of determining whether there has been an inordinate delay; second, whether the delay is inexcusable; and third, whether the defendants are likely to be seriously prejudiced by the delay (Seitz at para. 10).\n[79] The second approach is appropriate in circumstances where litigants engage in a \"wholesale disregard\" for time limits provided in the rules of court (Seitz at paras. 16-18). This is how the Complainant has, in my view, conducted herself in the present case.\n[80] As summarized in Johnston:\n\u201caccording to Seitz, such breaches are not to be looked at only from the viewpoint of the litigants, but also in light of the abuse of and prejudice to the due administration of justice. Where an action has remained static for an unreasonable length of time, there is an abuse of the administration of justice, which is separate and apart from any prejudice caused by inordinate and inexcusable delay, elements that must be established under the \"classic\" test. Seitz notes that these sorts of breaches will give rise to an abuse of process and will constitute grounds for dismissal\u201d. See also Grovit and Others v. Doctor and Others, [1997]1 W.L.R. 640 and Trusthouse Forte California Inc. v. Gateway Soap and Chemical Co., 1998 CanLII 8897 (FC), 1998 CanLII 8897\n[81] I consider the second approach from Seitz to be appropriate for consideration based upon the facts before me in this particular case. It is clear to me that the Complainant has failed to comply with the time limits that were set by the Tribunal in order to advance her complaint. Numerous efforts were made by the Tribunal to communicate deadlines to the Complainant and the Tribunal allowed numerous extensions to these deadlines. The August 25, 2011 CMCC was another opportunity that was provided by the Tribunal in order to allow the Complainant to explain whether the Tribunal had an incorrect mailing address, whether the Complainant had an email address or fax number that could be utilized to send her mail and also provided an opportunity for the Complainant to explain to the Tribunal of any facts she deemed relevant for consideration on why she had not received the Tribunal\u2019s correspondence nor contacted the Tribunal in order to advance her case.\n[82] Ultimately, the Tribunal is responsible for ensuring that the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness are afforded to all parties. In this case, the Tribunal attempted the following to ensure fairness to the Complainant:\n\u2022 Provided several extensions of time to the Complainant for her to comply with her disclosure and filing obligations;\n\u2022 Contacted the Complainant on several occasions by telephone and informed her of her obligations;\n\u2022 Contacted the Complainant and explained that she could obtain assistance from the Commission in order to meet her filing and disclosure obligations;\n\u2022 Provided the Complainant with an opportunity to explain her failure to pick up or receive the mailed communications sent to her; and\n\u2022 Provided an opportunity to the Complainant to provide an explanation of why she had not advanced her case and how she intended to do so.\n[83] The Tribunal is entitled to protect the integrity of its processes from abuse brought on by a Party\u2019s failure to abide by time limits and comply with the Rules of Procedure. The Complainant is responsible for advancing her complaint and complying with the set deadlines. The following actions by the Complainant in this case demonstrate the Complainant\u2019s choice not to advance her case and thus, are breaches according the second test in Seitz:\n\u2022 Her failure to comply with any of the time limits set by the Tribunal, even when the Tribunal had provided extensions thereto;\n\u2022 Her failure and decision to not go and pick up the couriered mail sent to her by the Tribunal;\n\u2022 Her failure and decision not to seek assistance from the Commission in preparing and submitting her required filing material with the Tribunal and disclosure upon the Respondent;\n\u2022 Her failure to seek any extensions of time limits from the Tribunal upon learning of her missed deadlines\n\u2022 Her failure to participate fully in the Case Management Conference Call on August 25, 2011; and\n\u2022 Her failure to abide by the Rules of Procedure and ensure any material she files would also be served on the Respondents, as she had indicated she would not do so in her Response to this Motion.\n[84] During the August 25, 2011 CMCC, the Complainant indicated that she was aware the Tribunal had attempted to send her correspondence by courier, but was unable to offer a reasonable or excusable reason for not making the efforts to pick up such letters. The Complainant also admits in her response to the Motion that she chose to end her continued participation on the CMCC. I find these actions, including the actions listed above, to constitute a repudiation of the Tribunal\u2019s process by the Complainant.\n[85] I must note that if the Tribunal were to schedule a Hearing date for an inquiry into this complaint, the Respondents would be in a position where the Complainant had not disclosed a single document, filed sufficient and satisfactory materials with the Tribunal, had not disclosed her witnesses or the Statement of Particulars outlining the complaint. The Respondent would be in a position where it would not know what case or facts it must rebut, what witnesses it must call to rebut the Complainant\u2019s facts and what other evidence it must advance to effectively prepare its case.\n[86] In Kuhlmann v. Westcan Bulk Transport Ltd., 2007 CHRT 50 (CanLII), the Complainant arrived at the hearing having not complied with her disclosure requirements pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s Rules. The following excerpt describes the situation I find that the Respondents would be in, if they were compelled to appear at such a hearing:\n[18] Ms. Kuhlmann arrives today at the hearing without having disclosed a single document or complied with any of her other disclosure obligations. Are there any \"exceptional circumstances\" in this case to justify allowing her to proceed without complying with her disclosure obligations? I do not see any. On the contrary, as the Respondent points out, it finds itself in a \"most untenable position\". It must retain experts and expend time and money to fully prepare for the hearing, without knowledge of the case it must rebut. And in fact, it has not been able to prepare itself for today's hearing. In addition, there is no evidence of the Respondent having failed to comply with its duties in this process. For instance, given the Complainant's failure to disclose, it sought the Tribunal's authorization to be dispensed from disclosing at the dates that were stipulated for its disclosure.\n[19] The only justification that Ms. Kuhlmann appears to be providing for her failure to meet her disclosure obligations is her inability to get a response to her satisfaction from the Commission on the matters she has raised with them. This is not a relevant matter for the case at hand. Ms. Kuhlmann knows since at least April 2007 that the Commission will not be appearing. If she still wanted to pursue her complaint, it was incumbent upon her to focus her attention on the Tribunal process. She has failed to do so. I therefore see no reason to grant her leave from her disclosure obligations. Pursuant to Rule 9(3), and given her entire failure to disclose, she is foreclosed from leading any evidence in support of her complaint, raising any issue arising there from, calling any witness, or claiming any relief.\n[20] I also see no reason to adjourn this case to enable Ms. Kuhlmann to comply with her disclosure obligations. She has had ample opportunity to comply over the last two months, she has been repeatedly reminded of what she has to do to satisfy these requirements, and has opted not to do so. The Rules of Procedure are put in place to enable a fair and expeditious Tribunal hearing process. They are not there to be ignored and cast aside cavalierly, simply because a party opted to not comply with them. All parties have a duty to respect the Rules and Tribunal directives, be they Respondents or Complainants.\n[87] I find that this set of circumstances would be unfair to the Respondents and cause them prejudice if they were required to prepare for such a hearing.\n[88] For all the reasons above, I therefore grant the Respondent\u2019s motion, the complaint is dismissed.\nSigned by\nSusheel Gupta\nTribunal Vice-Chairperson\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nFebruary 29, 2012\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1655\/01011\nStyle of Cause: Deborah P.

Canadian International Development Agency & Health Canada, 2011 CHRT 13 [Cruden].\n[2] On November 24, 2011, counsel on behalf of Ms. Bronwyn Cruden (the Complainant) requested clarification with regards to the implementation of the remedy ordered by the Tribunal at paragraph 176 of its decision in Cruden. Specifically, the order provides:\n[P]ursuant to paragraph 53(2)(b) of the CHRA, I order CIDA to deploy the complainant in the GPB Branch at the PM06 level and to work with the complainant to post her in a friendly country within her top three choices where there are appropriate medical facilities and no medical restrictions she will face.\n(Cruden at para. 176)\n[3] In an order made pursuant to subsection 53(2)(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the Act], the person found to have engaged in the discriminatory practice, in this case the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA or the Respondent), is to make available to the victim of discrimination, on the first reasonable occasion, the opportunities that were denied to the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice. The issue currently requiring clarification is the timing of the requirement that the Complainant be posted to a friendly country, namely, what the first reasonable occasion to do so is.\n[4] On December 5, 2011, the Tribunal determined that it was not functus officio and retained jurisdiction with regards to the implementation of the order in issue (Bronwyn Cruden v. Canadian International Development Agency & Health Canada, 2011 CHRT 21). However, the Tribunal requested further submissions from the parties to determine the matter.\n[5] After having reviewed the additional submissions provided by the parties, the Tribunal required further explanation regarding the information contained therein. Due to the technical and factual nature of the parties\u2019 dispute, the Tribunal convened a hearing to receive viva voce evidence from the parties. The hearing was held on January 16, 2012.\nLaw & Analysis\n[6] The aim of the Act is remedial and is \u201c\u2026not aimed at determining fault or punishing conduct\u201d (Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1987] 2 SCR 84 at para. 13 [Robichaud]). Rather, the primary focus of the legislation is to \u201c\u2026identify and eliminate discrimination\u201d (Robichaud at para. 13). To eliminate discrimination, \u201cremedies must be effective, consistent with the \"almost constitutional\" nature of the rights protected\u201d (Robichaud at para. 13). As part of being an \u201ceffective\u201d remedy, the Act mandates that a remedy ordered under section 53(2)(b) be implemented \u201c\u2026on the first reasonable occasion\u201d. What is reasonable will depend on the circumstances of each particular case; however, the use of the word \u201cfirst\u201d in this subsection indicates that the implementation of the remedy should not be delayed unless it would be unreasonable to do so.\n[7] The Complainant applied for two postings in Vietnam for the 2012 posting cycle:\na PM-06: Head of Cooperation (ASI-1257) and a PM-5: Senior International Development Officer (ASI-17678). She was screened out of both competitions for lack of essential experience.\n[8] According to the Respondent, the Complainant possesses only 1 of the 4 essential qualifications for the ASI-1257 posting. She lacks experience managing programs or key issues in the international development field; she lacks experience liaising with stakeholders and lacks experience in formulating and delivering strategic advice and recommendations to senior managers. With regards to the ASI-17978 posting, the Respondent claims she does not have experience collaborating with foreign government representative or international organizations. The Respondent adds that the Complainant\u2019s application to these postings were reviewed by a panel who determined that she was not qualified to continue to the second stage of the process. With regards to the argument that the Complainant could gain the required experience before a 2012 posting, CIDA claims there is not enough time to allow for a combination of formal training and hands-on experience. On this point, the Respondent states that the Tribunal should be mindful that CIDA is in the best position to assess the requirements of the posting as well as the Complainant\u2019s qualifications. Relying on the decision in Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 [Dunsmuir], the Respondent asserts that the Tribunal should apply a deferential standard to CIDA\u2019s assessment that the Complainant should not be posted within the 2012 cycle.\n[9] According to the Complainant, she meets the essential qualifications for the 2012 postings, as she was previously screened into the pool for postings in 2010 with the same essential requirements. Alternatively, the Complainant\u2019s application and resume establish that she has the essential experience required for both positions. The area where the Complainant has less experience relates to those requirements that can only be gained in the field; however, this lack of experience in the field is the \u201charm\u201d that the order is designed to remedy and, therefore, cannot be used as the basis for delaying the decision to post the Complainant to 2013. The Complainant adds that there is no evidence to suggest that the appropriate skill set and knowledge required for a successful posting cannot be developed and learned in the six months prior to the commencement of the postings.\n[10] I do not find Dunsmuir to be useful in determining this matter. That decision examines \u201creasonableness\u201d as a standard of review applicable to administrative decisions on judicial review. Here, we are not reviewing CIDA\u2019s decision, but rather attempting to find a fair and proper way to implement the remedy ordered by the Tribunal and eliminate the discrimination suffered by the Complainant.\n[11] After having examined all of the submissions of the parties on this matter, including the oral arguments and testimonies presented to the Tribunal at the hearing, I accept that posting the Complainant in Vietnam for the 2012 cycle would not be reasonable given the current circumstances. CIDA\u2019s witness at the hearing, Lise Filliatrault, Regional Director General for Americas at CIDA, provided credible information as to exactly what kind of experience is necessary for an individual to succeed in the two postings in Vietnam and why the Complainant lacked the necessary experience. The Head of Cooperation is the most senior person in the country and supervises a team and provides guidance to senior development officers, and replaces the head of missions or ambassadors when required. The Complainant does not possess the required three years extensive experience in financial, material and human resources management of a project in the field. For the Senior Development Officer position, the Complainant does not have a year\u2019s experience in collaborating with foreign government representatives or international organizations.\n[12] While the Complainant was previously screened into a pool for PM-05 postings in 2010, Lise Filiatrault testified that CIDA no longer utilizes this availability bank of candidates. The organization has a 3 year decentralization plan. According to Ms. Filliatrault, decentralization means that more responsibilities are transferred to the field in an attempt to improve the chances for success of a project in that CIDA representatives are closer to their partners in the field. I accept the Respondent\u2019s evidence regarding decentralization, which explains why the 2012 PM\u201105 and PM-06 positions are classified differently than those in 2010, including the higher experience requirements necessary to qualify for a posting.\n[13] To post the Complainant prematurely, without the required experience, could jeopardize CIDA\u2019s project in Vietnam and would not give the Complainant the necessary tools to allow her to succeed in her posting. The mandatory training offered by CIDA that was discussed at the hearing is the training offered to successful candidates that have already qualified to go on a posting and does not compensate for the gaps in the experience the candidate requires to qualify for a posting. That being said, the Respondent has identified that it can provide the Complainant with a customized learning plan in order for her to gain the necessary training and experience she needs to be successful in a field posting. According to the Respondent, this learning plan could include placing the complainant in a PM-05 position while securing a PM-06 position; allowing her to shadow someone that has the necessary experience; visits in the field; and, providing her with courses, training, and coaching. In this regard, in its November 30, 2011 submissions, the Respondent states:\nCIDA intends, upon Ms. Cruden\u2019s return from maternity leave in February, 2012, to find her a suitable (operational) position within its GPB Branch. This will serve as a precursor to a field assignment to a friendly country commencing in 2013 wherein CIDA will work with Ms Cruden in 2012 to ensure that she has the appropriate skill sets and knowledge to allow her to succeed in her field posting assignment. To this end a defined learning plan will be elaborated with Ms. Cruden and put into place focusing on elements such as international project\/program management, working with various bilateral programming modalities (such as Program-based approaches, budget support) experience.\n[14] However, aside from making this statement, there is no indication that a defined learning plan has been developed. There is no indication that the Respondent has worked with the Complainant to identify satisfactory postings; what additional training and\/or experience is required for her to succeed in a posting; how the Respondent proposes she gain the required training and\/or experience to succeed in a posting; and, when, as a result, will be the first reasonable opportunity to post her abroad.\n[15] Even though the Complainant identified her preferred posting choices to CIDA early on in the posting process, a defined learning plan was not established at that time. Nor was a learning plan in place by the time the Tribunal conducted its hearing in this matter on January 16, 2012. At the hearing, CIDA\u2019s witness was not able to identify any concrete steps CIDA has taken in considering how it will implement the Tribunal\u2019s order because she was not involved in the implementation of the order. According to the Respondent, it sent a letter to the Complainant and her counsel inviting her to communicate with them about the way to implement the order and the Complainant did not respond. The Respondent contends communications were interrupted between the parties when the Complainant made its request for clarification to the Tribunal in November 2011. I find this explanation is not credible. In early November, the Complainant was told by the Respondent that CIDA was not going to post her in 2012, but that she could apply to the posting process anyways. She then applied for the two Vietnam postings and was screened out. At any moment after the Complainant made her posting choices, CIDA could have planned a meeting with her to start the discussions on how to implement the Tribunal`s order. The Complainant was available for such discussions.\n[16] Pursuant to section 53(2)(b) of the Act, the obligation is on the Respondent to make available to the Complainant the opportunities that were denied to her as a result of the discriminatory practice. To determine when the first reasonable occasion to post the Complainant is, the Respondent must first seriously consider how it will implement the order. While the Tribunal\u2019s order was meant as a guideline in order to allow the parties to work out between themselves the details of the implementation of the order, this may have resulted in the Complainant losing the opportunity to be posted to the positions in Vietnam. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that clarification of its order is required to facilitate its implementation and to ensure that the remedy ordered by the Tribunal is forthcoming to the complainant. In this regard, the Tribunal directs as follows:\n(1) Within seven days of the issuance of this ruling, CIDA must place Ms. Cruden in a PM\u201106 position in the GPB branch.\n(2) Within 15 days of the issuance of this ruling, CIDA is to identify to Ms. Cruden 2013 postings in foreign countries that are or will be available where there are appropriate medical facilities and no medical restrictions that she will face.\n(3) Within 21 days of Ms. Cruden indicating to CIDA in writing her top three choices for posting among those identified by CIDA (whether it be three choices for posting in different countries; in the same country; or, two choices in one country and one in another), CIDA is to prepare a customized learning plan, in consultation with Ms. Cruden, outlining any training and\/or experience Ms. Cruden needs to complete and\/or acquire in order for her to succeed in one of the field postings chosen for 2013.\n(4) The customized learning plan must specify how CIDA will provide the required training and\/or experience to Ms. Cruden and must also include a schedule, with dates, as to when the training and\/or experience will be provided to Ms. Cruden before the posting date.\n(5) Once Ms. Cruden has completed the required training and\/or experience identified by the learning plan; CIDA is to post Ms. Cruden to the field assignment for which the learning plan was developed.\n[17] The Tribunal shall continue to remain seized of this matter in order to be available in the event any further clarification is required and until the parties confirm that the terms of the Tribunal\u2019s order have been implemented.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nMarch 1, 2012\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1466\/1210\nStyle of Cause: Bronwyn Cruden v.

Introduction [1] On February 28, 2012 I granted a motion to adjourn this proceeding brought by the Air Canada Pilots Association (\u201cACPA\u201d). These are my Reasons for Ruling.\nII. History of This Proceeding and Related Ones The Complaints of Bailie et al.\n[2] This proceeding involves the Complaints of retired Air Canada pilots (Bailie et al.) who claim that Air Canada engaged (and continues to engage) in a discriminatory practice and applied a discriminatory policy by requiring them to retire at the age of 60. This was pursuant to the collective agreement negotiated between Air Canada and the bargaining agent, ACPA, and the pilots\u2019 pension plan. As a result, companion Complaints have been filed by these retired pilots against ACPA too, and had been combined into a single hearing by the Tribunal. The pilots claim that requiring them to retire at age 60 was in violation of sections 7, 9 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, as amended (\u201cCHRA\u201d).\n[3] As of the date of these Reasons, other complaints of retired Air Canada pilots involving the same issues have been referred by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) to the Tribunal. The Chair of the Tribunal has assigned those complaints to me. There are now a total of 178 complaints (89 complainants) in the cluster of complaints cited as \u201cBailie et al.\u201d They are all represented by counsel Raymond D. Hall (also a Complainant), except for three self-represented Complainants: Dennis Smith, Eric Rogers and Robert Walsh.\n[4] Below is a useful summary of the Tribunal and Federal Courts proceedings of the related Air Canada pilots mandatory retirement cases of Vilven\/Kelly and Thwaites et al. taken from ACPA\u2019s motion record, with additions\/changes by me.\nThe Complaints of Messrs. Vilven and Kelly\n(a) Tribunal Decision - 2007 CHRT 36\n\u2022 The Tribunal dismissed the complaints after finding that age 60 was the normal age of retirement within the meaning of s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA.\n\u2022 The Tribunal also found that s. 15(1)(c) was not discriminatory within the meaning of s. 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (\u201cCharter\u201d).\n(b) Federal Court - 2009 FC 367\n\u2022 This decision was a judicial review of 2007 CHRT 36.\n\u2022 The Court overturned the Tribunal\u2019s finding that s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA was not discriminatory and remitted the s. 1 Charter issue to the Tribunal.\n\u2022 The Court directed the Tribunal to consider the bona fide occupational requirement (\u201cBFOR\u201d) defences if the Tribunal found that s. 15(1)(c) was not saved by s. 1 of the Charter.\n\u2022 The Court upheld the Tribunal's finding and methodology with respect to age 60 being the normal age of retirement.\n(c) Tribunal -2009 CHRT 24\n\u2022 The Tribunal found that s. 15(1)(c) was not saved by s. 1 of the Charter.\n\u2022 The Tribunal dismissed Air Canada's and ACPA\u2019s BFOR defences and upheld the complaints.\n(d) Federal Court - 2011 FC 120\n\u2022 This decision was a judicial review of 2009 CHRT 24.\n\u2022 The Court upheld the Tribunal\u2019s finding that s. 15(1)(c) was not saved by s.1 of the Charter.\n\u2022 The Court overturned the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that Air Canada had not established a BFOR defence and remitted the issue to the Tribunal.\n\u2022 The Court declined to issue a general declaration of invalidity regarding s. 15(1)(c).\n(e) Tribunal - 2011 CHRT 10\n\u2022 The Tribunal re-determined the question of whether Air Canada had established a BFOR defence and concluded that it had. The complaints were dismissed.\n(f) Tribunal - 2010 CHRT 27\n\u2022 In spite of the outstanding judicial review applications of 2009 CHRT 24 [CHRA s. 15(1)(c) not saved by Charter s. 1; no BFOR; complaints substantiated], the Tribunal proceeded with the hearing regarding the appropriate remedies.\n\u2022 The hearing occupied 11 days and the decision was rendered moot by the subsequent Federal Court and Tribunal decisions.\nOutstanding Court Proceedings\n(a) Federal Court of Appeal - A-107-11\n\u2022 The appeal and cross-appeal from 2011 FC 120 were heard November 22, 2011.\n\u2022 The issues before the Court were whether s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA is saved by s. 1 of the Charter and if not whether the Court should issue a general declaration of invalidity.\n(b) Federal Court - T2036-10, T2047-10, T2048-10\n\u2022 These applications for judicial review are of the remedy decision 2010 CHRT 27.\n\u2022 Vilven and Kelly challenge the Tribunal's calculation of pension benefits.\n\u2022 Air Canada challenges the Tribunal's refusal to apply the doctrine of mitigation.\n\u2022 These applications were set for hearing in October 2011 but were adjourned generally as a result of the Tribunal\u2019s decision 2011 CHRT 10 which dismissed the complaints.\n(c) Federal Court - T1282-11, T1283-11, T1284-11\n\u2022 Judicial review applications of 2011 CHRT 10.\n\u2022 Vilven, Kelly and the Commission challenge the Tribunal's dismissal of the complaints on the basis of Air Canada\u2019s BFOR defence.\nThe Complaints of Thwaites et al.\n(a) Tribunal - 2011 CHRT 11\n\u2022 The Tribunal dismissed the complaints on the basis that age 60 was the normal age of retirement.\n\u2022 The Tribunal rejected the BFOR defences advanced by Air Canada and ACPA.\n\u2022 The Tribunal did not deal with the constitutionality of s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA and a motion to reopen the hearing was made. On February 20, 2012, the Tribunal ruled that it would resume the hearing to determine whether the Judgment of Mactavish J., 2011 FC 120, is binding on the Thwaites Tribunal; and, if not, whether s. 15(1)(c) is unconstitutional.\nOutstanding Court Proceedings\n(a) Federal Court T1428-11\n\u2022 Thwaites et al. have sought judicial review of the Tribunal\u2019s decision with respect to the proper calculation of the normal age of retirement and the Tribunal's failure to consider the constitutionality of s. 15(1)(c). On March 2, 2012, on consent the Federal Court ordered this and related judicial review applications consolidated and held in abeyance, pending the Tribunal\u2019s Decision above.\n(b) Federal Court - T1456-11\n\u2022 The Commission has sought judicial review of the Tribunal\u2019s failure to consider the constitutionality of s. 15(1)(c).\n(c) Federal Court - T1453-11\n\u2022 Air Canada has sought judicial review of the Tribunal\u2019s dismissal of its BFOR defence.\n(d) Federal Court - T1463-11\n\u2022 ACPA has sought judicial review on the basis that the Tribunal erred in rejecting its BFOR defence.\nIII. Grounds for the Motion - ACPA [5] The moving party, ACPA, \u201cseeks an Order that the complaints currently before the Tribunal be adjourned generally pending a resolution of the outstanding matters before the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal.\u201d\n[6] The crux of the moving party\u2019s argument is:\n\u2026all of the issues which may arise in the outstanding complaints have been considered by the Tribunal and in every case the Tribunal\u2019s decisions have been the subject of judicial review applications. Until the Federal Courts have ruled on those issues there is no reason for the Tribunal to conduct yet another hearing and issue another set of reasons which would inevitably be the subject of judicial review applications.\nAt this point there has already been a significant expenditure of time, resources and money. To commence a duplicative process that will not result in any finality is neither in the public interest nor in the interest of the litigants.\n[7] ACPA cites Tribunal jurisprudence which states that the Tribunal has wide discretion in determining whether to grant an adjournment (as opposed to a stay which it has no jurisdiction to issue): Baltruweit v. CSIS, 2004 CHRT 14; Abrams v. Topham, 2010 CHRT 14.\n[8] Abrams and the related Decision in Canadian Jewish Congress v. Makow, 2010 CHRT 13 dealt with the section 13 \u201chate messages\u201d provision of the CHRA. This followed the Decision of the Tribunal in Warman v. Lemire, 2009 CHRT 26 wherein it had held that section 13 of the CHRA violated section 2(b) of the Charter and refused to apply section 13 and related sections. In Abrams and Makow, Member Lustig granted an adjournment sine die (without a fixed resumption date) stating: \u201cIt is now up to the Federal Court to determine the operability of s. 13 of the CHRA.\nThis will achieve the clarity that the Commission has indicated and that I agree is desirable in order to allow the Tribunal to be able to determine this and other cases brought under s. 13 of the CHRA.\u201d ACPA submits that the same reasoning and adjournment should be granted to the analogous situation here:\n\u2026given the large number of cases before the Tribunal which result from the same mandatory retirement policy, it is appropriate to grant the adjournment being sought. The goal of achieving consistency in the proper interpretation and application of the Act is of particular concern where there are multiple cases before the Tribunal.\nIV. Other Parties\u2019 Positions Air Canada\n[9] Air Canada supports the motion and arguments of ACPA. Air Canada also writes of the \u201cclarity\u201d in Makow that would \u201cflow\u201d from the ultimate Reasons for Judgments of the reviewing and appellate courts. \u201cThat same clarity should be sought in the present case before proceeding\u2026Clarity will mean the case will ultimately proceed more efficiently, even if it does not commence right away.\u201d\n[10] Air Canada also submits: \u201c\u2026one important lesson to draw from the cases involving other former Air Canada pilots is the wisdom of trying to resolve one case first, and using the lessons learned from that experience to assist in the resolution of the cases which follow\u2026Adding a further burden to the Tribunal and parties by commencing another hearing without the courts[\u2019] rulings in hand will not favour an expeditious, efficient or final resolution to these matters.\u201d\nCanadian Human Rights Commission\n[11] In the absence of an undertaking by ACPA and Air Canada that it would be bound by the results of judicial review applications in the Vilven\/Kelly and Thwaites matters, the Commission is unable to consent, and must oppose the motion. It notes that, in contrast to Lemire, supra, here the Federal Court has already found that paragraph 15(1)(c) is contrary to the Charter and thus allows the Bailie et al. complaints to continue. The Commission also submits that the CHRA requires that a hearing be conducted as expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the Rules of Procedure allow. \u201cIt is therefore only in the most exceptional circumstances that the hearing of the complaints should be suspended.\u201d\n[12] Furthermore, the Commission argues that there is no indication that decisions by reviewing or appellate courts \u201cwould provide a full and final answer to the complaints presently pending before the Tribunal.\u201d\nThe \u201cCoalition Complainants\u201d\n[13] These 86 Complainants invoke the time-honoured legal adage \u2013 \u201cJustice Delayed is Justice Denied.\u201d Furthermore, they argue that matters here are \u201ccritically time-sensitive\u201d given the age of the former pilot Complainants and their claim for reinstatement as pilots-in-command (captains). \u201cNo amount of financial compensation can wholly offset the denial of the rights of these Complainants\u2026\u201d Their counsel further states, \u201cAny delay in the hearing of these Complaints inures entirely to the benefit of the Respondents and entirely to the prejudice of the Complainants.\u201d\n[14] The Coalition Complainants also argue that contrary to ACPA\u2019s and Air Canada\u2019s assertions, there is no such lack of clarity at the moment. The Federal Court\u2019s Judgment holding that para. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA is unconstitutional is binding on the Tribunal, until such time as it is overturned by a higher court. This possibility is not grounds for adjourning the instant complaints. Air Canada and ACPA are left with only one defence available \u2013 the para. 15(1)(a) BFOR one. The Tribunal should adjudicate on this matter.\n[15] With regards to the BFOR defence, the Coalition Complainants assert that such a defence is \u201cevidence-dependent in respect of each Complainant,\u201d regardless of conflicting Tribunal Decisions on this issue in Vilven\/Kelley, 2011 CHRT 10 and Thwaites, 2011 CHRT 11, respectively.\n[16] The Coalition Complainants also submit that the moving party and\/or Air Canada can bring a pre-hearing motion based on the doctrines of res judicata (issue estoppel) and abuse of process \u201cto foreclose re-litigation of already adjudicated legal issues.\u201d\n[17] In their conclusion, they argue that, \u201cAny Motion to adjourn the hearing must balance the benefits to allegedly be obtained from the proposed delay with the prejudice that is likely to result to the Complainants by reason of the delay\u2026Moreover, the submissions of both ACPA and Air Canada in support of the Motion are based upon mere speculation that some form of judicial or quasi-judicial economy may possibly result from the proposed delay in the hearing of these Complaints.\u201d\nV. Analysis [18] Subsection 48.9(1) of the CHRA provides that, \u201cProceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\u201d Rule 3 of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure sets out a procedure for bringing a motion, including a motion for an adjournment. Subsection 50(1) of the CHRA deals with the conduct of the inquiry and gives \u201call parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity\u2026to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations.\u201d\n[19] The Tribunal has held that a stay is not obtainable from the Tribunal. The Federal Court is the proper forum for that type of Order: Baltruweit, supra. In that ruling, the Tribunal also rejected the applicability of the RJR-Macdonald test, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311, which sets outs the conditions for granting a stay.\n[20] In Baltruweit, supra, the Tribunal noted the long held principle that administrative tribunals are the masters of their own proceedings. \u201cAs such, they possess significant discretion in deciding requests for adjournments\u201d: at para. 15. I agree. With an adjournment, the Tribunal may, on a party\u2019s motion or on its own, resume the proceeding. Adjournments may be granted sine die (without a fixed return date), with a fixed date, and with or without conditions. As will be seen later, I have granted the adjournment with conditions, utilizing the flexibility inherent in this tool.\n[21] At para. 17 in Baltruweit, supra, the Tribunal writes: \u201cIt is clear then that this Tribunal, when exercising its discretion, must do so having regard to principles of natural justice. Some examples of natural justice concerns to which the Tribunal could respond to, would be unavailability of evidence, the need to adjourn or obtain counsel, or late disclosure by an opposite party.\u201d I agree with this non-exhaustive list. Finally, at para. 19, the Tribunal states: \u201cUltimately, in these submissions there are no expressed natural justice concerns that would temper the admonition in s. 48.9(1) of the Act for the Tribunal to proceed as expeditiously as possible.\u201d I find that adjournments may be granted in the absence of the above noted \u201cnatural justice concerns\u201d.\n[22] In the instant motion, the \u201cadmonition\u201d to proceed as expeditiously as possible must be seen in the larger context. In cases such as the section 13 hate message ones (i.e., Abrams and Makow) and the Air Canada pilots cases (Vilven\/Kelly, Thwaites et al., and Bailie et al.), short term delay can achieve long term gain, and a better final result. In other words, allowing one case with the same or substantially similar issues to run its course through the administrative justice\/judicial system is fairer and more just and \u201cexpeditious\u201d in the long run to the parties and future parties than holding a hearing in each case, followed by judicial review applications and appeals. It is also more just in terms of the public interest, with finite resources of the taxpayer-funded Tribunal and courts. I do agree with the Commission\u2019s submission that, \u201cIt is therefore only in the most exceptional circumstances that the hearing of complaints should be suspended.\u201d This is such a case; \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d exist here.\n[23] I would also add that \u201cexpeditious\u201d means more than just \u201cdone with speed.\u201d The Canadian Oxford Dictionary defines \u201cexpeditious\u201d as \u201c\u2026acting or done with speed and efficiency\u2026\u201d As a legal term, in French, \u201cproc\u00e9dure exp\u00e9ditive\u201d is defined as \u201crapide et efficace\u201d (le Petit Robert 2012).\n[24] Class action-type, systemic cases like the instant one, with the same class of complainants (Air Canada pilots having reached 60 years of age), the same respondents, the same Commission, the same sections of the CHRA in issue, and the same or substantially similar factual and legal issues, call out for a unique approach from the typical single complainant\/single respondent CHRA case. These types of cases raise unique questions about quasi-judicial resource allocation and costs to the parties. In hindsight, which is indeed \u201c50-50\u201d, Air Canada\u2019s wish to run the Vilven\/Kelly case right through to its completion, both liability and remedy phases, followed by guidance from the Federal Courts in any judicial review\/appeal (including to the Supreme Court of Canada), would have been the best use of every one\u2019s resources, time and money. Instead, there has been bifurcation (including my own Order in the Bailie proceeding on consent of the parties to split liability and remedy) and duplication as the lis or core dispute in these cases (i.e., Air Canada\u2019s mandatory retirement policy for its pilots at age 60 and corresponding collective agreement provision) has been pursued through three streams of cases \u2013 Vilven\/Kelly; Thwaites et al.; and Bailie et al. Two of these streams flowed through the Tribunal to the courts, with judicial review applications launched by one or more parties on every Tribunal Decision. The History of the Proceedings summary above illustrates the labyrinth of Tribunal and judicial pathways in these streams. Bailie et al. is the third stream, where now a third panel is being called upon to deal with the same or substantially similar factual and legal issues. While the past is immutable, the future is indeed indeterminate. Should the Tribunal simply repeat the pattern? I think not.\n[25] I say this, understanding the important implications for the Bailie et al. Complainants. All of them are over 60 and many near 65 years of age. Thus, for many of them, an adjournment would effectively deny them reinstatement \u2013 to fly again as pilots-in-command or captains with Air Canada \u2013 if the final decision went their way. However, granting or not granting the adjournment in the context of this systemic, class action-type proceeding must employ a balancing exercise of all relevant competing interests, including the fair and just use of finite resources with a view to achieving ultimately the most \u201cexpeditious\u201d procession of this inquiry. I wish to add that nothing prevents the Complainants from seeking interim relief (i.e., reinstatement) in the Federal Court: Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canadian Liberty Net, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 626.\n[26] To this end, I have considered the following factors in this \u201cbalancing\u201d exercise:\n1. the legal issues in Vilven\/Kelly, Thwaites et al. and Bailie et al. are substantially the same: e.g., the constitutionality of section 15(1)(c) of the CHRA (\u201cnormal age of retirement\u201d defence); the merits of this defence; the merits of the section 15(1)(a) BFOR defence. Even the remedies are very similar in the three streams. And there is a similar \u201cprevention of future acts\u201d aspect. Indeed, in the Coalition Complainants\u2019 previous Notice of Motion for particulars and to strike pleadings (dismissed in 2011 CHRT 17), para. 11 reads in part:\nThe issues in this proceeding are largely similar, if not identical to the issues that the Tribunal heard in the Vilven-Kelly hearing, and in the Thwaites hearing. Were it not for the fact that the Tribunal\u2019s decision in the Thwaites hearing has yet to be rendered by the Tribunal [it has since been released: 2011 CHRT 11, with one final aspect outstanding], it would be correct to say that all of the issues in this proceeding have already been heard and decided before the Tribunal, and this hearing might not be required at all.\n2. The history of the Vilven\/Kelly and Thwaites inquiries show that every significant Tribunal decision has been judicially reviewed by one or more parties. And one Judgment of the Federal Court is awaiting the results of an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal. This suggests that any decision by me would not provide a final resolution to the case;\n3. Two separate panels (former Chair Sinclair and Member Craig) have reached the same ultimate conclusion (dismissal of the complaints), subject now to former Chair Sinclair\u2019s pending determination of the re-opened matter in Thwaites, but with a different conclusion and analysis on key legal issues: i.e., the BFOR defence. These Decisions are not binding on me or future panels, as the principle of stare decisis does not apply to Tribunal decisions. This conflicting state of affairs requires judicial \u201cclarity\u201d, not a third Tribunal panel\u2019s Decision;\n4. An adjournment with conditions allows the parties and me to monitor each judicial pronouncement, in order to re-assess whether the conditions have changed as to warrant lifting the adjournment and proceeding with Bailie et al.;\n5. The granting of an adjournment with conditions is preferable and less intrusive and determinative of rights than dismissing parts of a complaint based on res judicata, issue estoppel, or abuse of process. In a previous motion for particulars and to strike, the parties were asked if they intended to bring a motion to dismiss for abuse of process. The Coalition Complainants indicated that they would await the Ruling on particulars and to strike before making their decision. The Commission stated it would not \u201cfile a separate motion [for abuse of process] but will instead object to any attempt at adducing evidence that would attempt to contradict the decisions of the Federal Court [in the Vilven\/Kelly matter]\u201d; and\n6. The Bailie et al. complaints remain intact for adjudication, once judicial \u201cclarity\u2019 has been achieved.\n[27] I have followed the reasoning and approach of Member Lustig in Abrams and Makow, supra, dealing with the section 13 hate messages cases before the Tribunal, as stated in para. 9 and 8 of those Decisions, respectively. I note that in the hate messages cases, there too were conflicting Tribunal Decisions on the constitutionality of section 13: see Lemire, supra and Schnell v. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc., 2002 CanLII 1887. However, unlike Bailie et al., with the s. 13 cases, there was at least a Supreme Court of Canada Judgment from 1990, Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, 1990 3 S.C.R. 892 on the constitutionality of s. 13. Since the Tribunal in Makow and Abrams found that the interests of justice clearly favoured adjourning (notwithstanding the presence of a highly instructive Supreme Court of Canada authority), then the argument for adjourning in the present case is even stronger, given the absence of similar judicial direction.\n[28] As a result of my balancing the various interests and needs of the parties and the public interest, I have granted the motion to adjourn, and the Order follows herein.\nVI. Order [29] On February 28, 2012, I granted ACPA\u2019s motion to adjourn and made the following Order:\nACPA\u2019s motion to adjourn the proceeding pending completion of matters before the courts in the Vilven\/Kelly and Thwaites complaints is granted, with the following conditions:\n(1) ACPA shall keep the Tribunal apprised of the status of judicial review applications\/appeals in the Vilven\/Kelly and Thwaites matters, including any Reasons for Judgments; and\n(2) any party or the Tribunal may require the holding of a Case Management Conference Call after the release of Reasons for Judgment in any of the judicial reviews\/appeals referred to in clause (1) in order to re-assess the adjournment status herein.\nThe Case Management Conference scheduled for March 1 and 2, 2012 and the subsequent hearing dates are vacated. Reasons for Ruling will follow within 30 days.\nSigned by\nMatthew D.

Complaint\n[1] On February 28, 2003, Stephen Leung (the \u201cComplainant\u201d) filed a complaint #20030099 (\u201cComplaint B\u201d) with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d), alleging discrimination by the Respondent, Canada Revenue Agency, based on race and national\/ethnic origin contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, (\u201cCHRA\u201d), and retaliation, contrary to section 14.1 of the CHRA.\n[2] On December 23, 2010, the Commission referred Complaint B to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d).\nII. Motion by Respondent [3] On September 22, 2011, the Respondent filed a Notice of Motion with the Tribunal seeking:\n1. An Order striking out the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars, in whole or in part; or\n2. In the alternative, an Order limiting the Tribunal Inquiry to solely retaliation vis-a-vis the 2002 FI-04 competition; and\n3. An Order requiring the Complainant to provide witness statements pursuant to subparagraph 6(1)(f) of the Tribunal Rules of Procedure.\n[4] The stated grounds for the motion are:\n1. On July 4, 2011, the Complainant filed a Statement of Particulars with respect to his human rights complaint (CHRC File #20030099) referred to the Tribunal by the Commission.\n2. Many of the issues raised in the Statement of Particulars have been investigated by the Commission in previous complaints filed by the Complainant, and dismissed. The Complainant did not judicially review these decisions and the decision of the Commission to dismiss these complaints ought to stand.\n3. The Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision returned the matter to the investigation to conduct a supplementary investigation with respect to the 2002 FI04 classification only.\n[5] In support of its motion, the Respondent relies on the affidavit of Lisa Minarovich, sworn September 21, 2011.\n[6] In paragraph 1 of her affidavit, Ms. Minarovich, an employee of the Department of Justice, deposes that she \u201c\u2026 reviewed the Canadian Human Rights files associated with this Complaint and as such, have knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed\u201d. While Ms. Minarovich\u2019s affidavit summarizes the Commission\u2019s investigation and determination of the Complainant\u2019s complaints, and attaches as exhibits a large number of documents, presumably obtained during her review of the files, I am satisfied that Ms. Minarovich has no personal knowledge of the circumstances of the complaint presently before the Tribunal, nor has she any expertise to support the opinions expressed in her affidavit.\n[7] The Respondent asserts that the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars inappropriately seeks to raise issues that were previously dealt with by the Commission, and argues that these issues are res judicata or should be excluded by the application of the doctrine of issue estoppel.\nIII. Complainant\u2019s Response to the Motion [8] Complainant\u2019s counsel argues that the Motion of the Respondent is premature:\nSubmissions of this nature should be made at a hearing and not before. This is a time of disclosure. The time to debate evidence has not yet come. Both parties have the right during the hearing to object to evidence being led. At the current stage the adjudicator cannot gauge whether the evidence is arguably relevant or not. At hearing he can allow evidence in or not, giving it the weight it deserves.\nThey ask the adjudicator to look behind the complaint referred by the commission and reconstruct it. They would have the adjudicator, without having heard a lick of evidence, to go through the documents to essentially decide on the nature of the case. The motion is an attempt by the employer to argue their case before anybody has put any evidence in.\n[9] The Complainant also argues that the assertions in paragraphs 4, 13, 19, 22, 29 and 30 of Ms. Minarovich\u2019s affidavit are either misleading, misconstrued, or have omitted relevant matters.\nIV. Background [10] At all material times the Complainant was an employee of the Respondent.\n[11] The circumstances of Complaint B occurred between March 2001 and August 2002. The Commission referred Complaint B to the Tribunal on December 23, 2010.\n[12] On May 26, 2000, before the filing of Complaint B, the Complainant filed complaint #20000565 (\u201cComplaint A\u201d), alleging discrimination during the period October 1997 to May 2000, when two managerial positions were available to the Complainant. The Complainant sought each of these employment positions without success, triggering his allegation of discrimination by reason of race, national or ethnic origin and age, contrary to section 7 of the CHRA. The Commission investigated Complaint A and dismissed it.\n[13] On February 10, 2006, after the filing of Complaint B, the Complainant filed a complaint #2006307 (\u201cComplaint C\u201d), alleging ongoing retaliation by the Respondent, particularly by the\nRespondent\u2019s employee, Steven Hertzberg, in connection with the Commission\u2019s direction to the Complainant to engage in the Respondent\u2019s internal review processes in an attempt to resolve Complaint B. Paragraph 6 of Complaint C is significant:\nAs per CHRC\u2019s direction, I met with Hertzberg on February 14, 2005 to initiate internal review processes. At the meeting, instead of engaging in a constructive discussion of such processes, Hertzberg unilaterally suspended my employment, confiscated my ID card and building\/parking access card and banned me from entering the workplace. He indicated that I was too sick to work and forced me to go on indefinite sick leave.\n[14] Complaint C was screened out by the Commission without the benefit of an investigator\u2019s report.\nV. Circumstances of Complaint B\n[15] On or about August 2002, the Respondent refused the Complainant\u2019s request for promotion to a newly created management position of Assistant Director, Finance (FI-104). Thereafter, on February 28, 2003, the Complainant filed Complaint B.\n[16] Complaint B was investigated and dismissed by the Commission on the grounds that there was no evidence to support the Complainant\u2019s allegation of retaliation triggered by the Complainant\u2019s filing of Complaint A on May 26, 2000. Initially the Commission refused to refer Complaint B to the Tribunal, and dismissed it.\nA. Retaliation [17] S. 14.1 CHRA:\nIt is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n[18] Counsel for the Complainant summarized the evidentiary relationship and synergy of Complaints A, B and C:\nWhat is clear from a close look at the order of filing is that the three complaints followed logically one after another. Complaint B is based on race and now retaliation connected to race. Complaint C is based on further retaliation. All three complaints deal with the same workplace and individuals but have different manifestations of the problem he complained about.\nThe employer\u2019s motion implies that Mr. Leung is a serial complainer who keeps bringing back the same rejected issues time after time. This is an improper characterization and one that is belied by a closer look at the timeline of filing and the allegations made in the three complaints.\nIn fact, the timing of the employer\u2019s actions are questionable and the retaliation complaints in both instances are reactions to workplace actions emboldened by investigator\u2019s dismissals or sidestepping of Mr. Leung\u2019s complaints.\nIn order to prove his case at tribunal Mr. Leung must have the opportunity to refer what he sees as evidence of the wrongdoing. The employer well knows the difficulties if he is not allowed to present evidence involving the three complaints. That is the real purpose of the employer\u2019s motion \u2013 to restrict Mr. Leung\u2019s opportunity to substantiate his case.\n[19] Complainant\u2019s counsel emphasized the relevance of the circumstances in Complaint C in which the Complainant alleges further retaliation:\nas a result of a direction by the Commission sending him back for internal recourse to the same person he had complained about in Complaints A and B. The manager, Mr. Hertzberg, is the same person complained of in all three complaints He is the essential link.\nB. Judicial Review [20] The Complainant applied for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s dismissal of Complaint B. On June 4, 2008, the Federal Court dismissed the Complainant\u2019s application for judicial review.\n[21] The Complainant appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal. On February 11, 2009, the decision of the Federal Court was set aside. Appellate Justice Nadon stated:\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs, set aside the decision of the Federal Court and, rendering the decision which ought to have been rendered, I would allow the appellant\u2019s judicial review application with costs and I would return the matter to the Commission for reconsideration of the appellant\u2019s complaint in accordance with these Reasons.\n[22] Paragraphs 15 and 16 of the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision are relevant to this proceeding:\n[15] Thus, in my view, the investigator failed to properly investigate an issue that goes to the essence of the complaint, in that she failed to make a proper inquiry into the classification process which resulted in the appellant having to compete for the new position. It is difficult to understand why the record remains obscure on this matter, considering that the information required to clarify the matter should be readily available from the employer.\n[16] For example, what decisions were actually made in the fall of 2001 by one or more classification committees? Who were the members of these committees, were they the same persons or different ones? In my view, this information is crucial to determine whether there was retaliation or not on the part of the appellant\u2019s employer.\n[23] On December 23, 2010, almost two years after the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal, David Langtry, Acting Chief Commissioner of the Commission, referred Complaint B to the Chairperson of the Tribunal.\n[24] The Respondent did not seek judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision.\nVI. The Law [25] In Halifax (Regional Municipality) v. Nova Scotia (Human Rights Commission), 2012 SCC 10, released March 16, 2012, the Supreme Court of Canada, in a unanimous decision, clarified the nature of a decision by a human rights commission to dismiss or refer a complaint.\n[26] Mr. Justice Cromwell:\n[19] I respectfully agree with the Court of Appeal. The Commission\u2019s decision to refer a complaint to a board of inquiry is not a determination of whether the complaint falls with the Act. Rather, within the scheme of the Act, the Commission plays an initial screening and administrative role; it may, for example, decide to refer a complaint to a board of inquiry so that the board can resolve a jurisdictional matter.\n[20] The Act sets up a complete regime for the resolution of human rights complaints. Within this regime, the Commission performs a number of functions related to the enforcement and promotion of human rights. With regard to complaints, it acts as a kind of gatekeeper and administrator.\n[21] Where a complaint is not settled or otherwise determined, the Commission may appoint a board of inquiry to inquire into it: 32A(1). The Commission has a broad discretion as to whether or not to take this step. The Commission may do so if \u2018it is satisfied that, having regard to all circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry there into is warranted\u2019: Boards of Inquiry Regulations, N.S. reg. 221\/91. s. 1. There is no legislative requirement that the Commission determine that the matter is within its jurisdiction or that it passes some merit threshold before appointing a board of inquiry: the Commission must simply be \u2018satisfied\u2019 having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint that an inquiry is warranted.\n[22] Once appointed, a board of inquiry conducts a public hearing into the complaint and decides the matter. The board of inquiry has authority to determine any question of fact or law required to make a determination on whether there has been a contravention of the Act, and has the power to remedy such a contravention\n[23] What is important here is that a decision to refer a complaint to a board of inquiry is not a determination that the complaint is well founded or even within the purview of the Act. Those determinations may be made by the Board of Inquiry. In deciding to refer a complaint to a board of inquiry, the Commission\u2019s function is one of screening and administration, not of adjudication.\n[50] \u2026While no doubt the Commission, in deciding to refer for inquiry, has some quite limited role to screen the merits of the complaint, its task is not to decide the issues which underlie its decision to proceed to the next stage; these are left to the board of inquiry.\nVII. Assessing the merit of the Respondent\u2019s Motion [27] The Respondent\u2019s seeks to limit the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s Inquiry into Complaint B.\n[28] The Respondent argues that Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars is an attempt to \u201cresurrect allegations which were dealt with, and dismissed by the Commission in earlier complaints. The allegations in the Statement of Particulars are the same in subject matter and scope to the allegations contained in one or more of the human rights complaints filed by the Complainant.\u201d (underlining added)\n[29] The Respondent\u2019s position reflects a misunderstanding of the Tribunal\u2019s procedural rules and the purpose of Statements of Particulars. I agree with the characterization of Statements of Particular by the Complainant\u2019s counsel:\nSection 6 of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) sets out the necessity of disclosure and what should be contained in a \u2018Statement of Particulars\u2019. The purpose of the Statement of Particulars is not explicitly\nstated. However, its purpose can be derived from section 1(1) and 1(2). The purpose would be to disclose what case Mr. Leung intends to make. The Respondent will then know what case they have to meet.\nThe statement of particulars is not an \u2018Agreed Statement of Facts.\u2019 Parties do not have to agree with the particulars, the perceptions contained in the particulars, or what argument they believe will be derived from the particulars.\nIn fact Mr. Leung\u2019s Statement of Particulars meets the requirements set out in the Rules because he has provided those material facts he intends to rely on. The employer knows what case Mr. Leung intends to make.\n[30] I have examined the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars and conclude that it is within the expectations of the Tribunal\u2019s procedural requirements.\n[31] More importantly, the Respondent\u2019s pre-emptive attempt to limit the scope of the inquiry into the complaint reflects a misunderstanding of the investigatory and administrative roles of the Commission, and the fact, as recently clarified in the Halifax decision, that the Commission\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint, or to refer it to the Tribunal for hearing, is not an adjudicative decision, and is therefore not litigation which is subject to the doctrines of res judicata or issue estoppel.\n[32] The procedures involved in the investigation and disposition of a complaint filed with the Commission, and the decision by the Commission to either dismiss or refer it to the Tribunal, are all administrative in nature. The submission of a report by an appointed investigator to the Commission of his\/her findings, as required under s. 44, and the reasons for the discretion exercised by the Commission to either dismiss a complaint or refer it to the Tribunal for Inquiry, remain private within the Commission until either of the parties seeks judicial review.\n[33] The Commission\u2019s referral of a written complaint to the Tribunal, and its contemporaneous request that the Tribunal institute an inquiry into it, involves transmitting only the actual complaint and information identifying the parties. Thereafter, as provided in s. 51 of the CHRA, the Commission may become a party to the inquiry, adopting such position as, in its opinion, is in the public interest having regard to the nature of the complaint.\n[34] The Commission\u2019s decision to refer a complaint to the Tribunal has no effect on the procedures of the Tribunal, nor on the exercise of its adjudicative role, and the significant degree of independence exercised by Tribunal members conducting public inquiries.\n[35] The assigned presiding member will conduct the inquiry in public and, in due course thereafter, will provide the parties with a written decision. An essential aspect of a decision is the determination of credibility of each witness, entailing consideration of the consistency of evidence in chief and the manner in which each witness has responded to cross examination. The adjudicator may find it necessary to consider a witness\u2019 evidence against the probabilities arising from circumstances surrounding the alleged act of discrimination.\nVIII. Decision [36] Counsel for the Complainant has convinced me that the circumstances of Complaints A and C are relevant to the allegations of discrimination and retaliation in Complaint B. I accept his argument that:\nBecause Complaint A was dismissed does not mean that facts during the time frame of the dismissed complaint are not factual and usable in an inquiry into Complaint B. There can be common facts. Allegations particular to Complaint A may be dismissed but not facts. Only allegations from complaint B will be considered by the tribunal, but that does no mean the history leading up to Complaint B does not have to be considered. That would particularly be so in this case, because the retaliation complaint in Complaint B stems from the employer\u2019s action taken as a result of Complaint A.\n[37] Moreover, even though the Halifax decision may be determinative of the motion, I have also considered each of the Complainant\u2019s objections to various assertions in Ms. Minarovich\u2019s affidavit, which the Complainant\u2019s counsel argues are misleading, misconstrued or have omitted relevant information. I agree, and find Ms. Minarovich\u2019s affidavit unreliable and unpersuasive.\n[38] In accordance with the foregoing reasons the Respondent\u2019s Motion is dismissed.\nSigned by\nWallace G.

Conclusion. 15\n[1] This is a motion for adjournment pending the Federal Court\u2019s decision on an application for judicial review. The application for judicial review in question was filed by the Respondent with respect to a decision of the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal assigning the file to me as Member.\nI. The Facts A. The original decision [2] On January 27, 2010, as a Tribunal member, I rendered a decision in Malec et autres c. Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan, 2010 TCDP 2 (Malec). In that case, the Complainants, all employees at Uauitshitun School, in Nutashkuan, claimed to be victims of discrimination under policies related to isolated post allowances offered to certain school employees and implemented by the Conseil des Montagnais de Nutashkuan, the Respondent.\n[3] From 1990 to 2007, the isolated post allowance policy applied to \u201cteaching staff with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree and to professional employees with the same level of education\u201d. In 2007, the isolated post allowance policy was amended and since then has applied to employees who are not residents of Nutashkuan. The Complainants are all Aboriginal, and residents of Nutashkuan. They never received the isolated post allowance, either under the policy that was in effect from 1990 to 2007, or under the policy that has been in effect since 2007.\n[4] Ultimately, in my decision, I stated that the Complainants had been adversely differentiated against by the policy that had been in effect prior to 2007, as it made no distinction between resident and non-resident employees. In arriving at my decision, I applied the test set out in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU [1999] 3 SCR 3 [Meiorin] which calls for a two-step analysis:\n(1) Is there prima facie case of discrimination?\n(2) In the affirmative, is the prohibited ground of discrimination justified?\n[5] The first issue regarding whether there was prima facie case of discrimination was answered in the affirmative since the Aboriginal teachers at Uauitshitun School did not receive the isolated post allowance that was nonetheless given to the non-Aboriginal teachers living in Nutashkuan. With respect to the second step, I found that: \u201c[t]he Respondent did not submit any evidence to the Tribunal that justified why the allowance was not paid to Innu teachers at Uauitshitun School\u201d (Malec at para. 41).\nB. The Federal Court decision [6] On December 23, 2010, the Federal Court issued its decision in a judicial review of the decision in Malec (Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan v. Malec, 2010 FC 1325 (Conseil des Montagnais)). Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer allowed the application, set aside the Tribunal\u2019s decision and referred the matter back to \u201ca member or panel of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal for redetermination in accordance with\u201d the reasons for her decision (Conseil des Montagnais at p. 15).\n[7] The reasons in Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer\u2019s decision deal with the second part of the test in Meiorin, namely, the treatment of the evidence adduced to show that the prohibited ground of discrimination was justified. Specifically, the judge states at para. 32 to 36:\nit is not true that the employer failed to submit any evidence to justify the isolated post allowance policy. The Tribunal failed to take into account the testimony of Andr\u00e9 Leclerc, the former principal of Uauitshitun School. \u2026 during his testimony, when explaining the purpose of the isolated post allowance, Mr. Leclerc stated:\n[Translation]\n\u2026 it is to bring in staff in the hope that they would stay \u2026\nThe Tribunal, without a valid reason, also failed to assign any probative value to Ms. Malec\u2019s admission, during cross-examination, that her spouse, who was non-Aboriginal but living in the community, had received an isolated post allowance because he had been living outside the community at the time he was hired...\nNor did the Tribunal examine the statement by Genevi\u00e8ve T. N\u00e9ashit, an Aboriginal who acquired her status through marriage, who explained that she received the allowance because she lived outside the community \u2026\nThe Tribunal should have considered all of the testimony \u2026\nIt is one thing to say that a piece of evidence is insufficient to overturn a prima facie case of discrimination, but it is quite another to completely ignore, as is the case here, the evidence of bona fide justification that had been submitted. The Tribunal should have taken the applicant\u2019s explanations into account and then decided whether, under the applicable case law and having considered the totality of the evidence, these explanations were sufficient to overturn the prima facie case of discrimination.\n[8] Finally, given that the Federal Court had referred the matter back to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, on March 7, 2011, the Tribunal\u2019s registry requested written submissions from the Complainants, from the Respondent and from the Canadian Human Rights Commission in order to establish the procedures to be followed in the rest of the case.\nC. The procedures subsequent to the judicial review [9] In response to the Tribunal\u2019s request, the Complainants and the Canadian Human Rights Commission argued that there was no need for further evidence and that the matter should be heard by the same Member. By contrast, the Respondent requested that a new member or panel be assigned to the file and that the parties be allowed to adduce their evidence once again.\n[10] On September 29, 2011, the Tribunal\u2019s Chairperson issued her decision regarding the procedures to be followed. She assigned the file to me \u201cand [gave me] discretion to determine [my] own procedure\u201d (Malec et al v. Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan, Ruling, Docket T1318\/4808, September 29, 2011, at para. 13).\n[11] On October 26, 2011, the Respondent filed an application for judicial review of the Tribunal Chairperson\u2019s decision (Federal Court docket number T-1740-11). On February 16, 2012, the Respondent filed a notice of motion with the Tribunal requesting the adjournment of the proceeding before the Tribunal pending the Federal Court\u2019s decision on its application for judicial review.\nII. The Parties\u2019 Submissions A. The Respondent [12] In its arguments, the Respondent did not cite any case law in support of its motion for adjournment, but seemed to rely on the tripartite test set out in RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (A.G.), [1994] 1 SCR 311 (MacDonald) and Manitoba (Attorney General) v. Metropolitan Stores Ltd., [1987] 1 SCR 110 (Metropolitan Stores).\n[13] Regarding the first criterion for obtaining an adjournment, the Respondent argues that there is a [translation] \u201cprima facie case\u201d since the appointment of this Member, in its view, gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. The Respondent contends that [translation] \u201ccomments made\u201d by the Tribunal member in his decision are cause enough for this reasonable apprehension of bias, and thus concludes that having the same Member determine the matter would risk violating the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness.\n[14] The Respondent further submits that the continuation of the proceeding pending the Federal Court decision would cause it irreparable harm. Among other things, the Respondent claims that this could lead it to disclose evidence that would be detrimental to it if at any future second hearing. The Respondent argues that holding a hearing before the Tribunal would result in it incurring additional legal expenses and, finally, that it could be compelled by the Tribunal to pay the Complainants sums of money that would be difficult to recover in the event that the Federal Court were to rule in its favour.\n[15] Lastly, the Respondent maintains that the balance of convenience lies in its favour, but fails to provide any specific basis on which to justify this claim.\nB. The Canadian Human Rights Commission [16] For its part, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) opposes the Respondent\u2019s motion.\n[17] According to the Commission, the Tribunal should apply a different test than the one set out in MacDonald and Metropolitan Stores. In its view, since the Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c H-6 (Act) does not expressly grant the Tribunal the authority to adjourn a proceeding, the Tribunal cannot do so unless the lack of an adjournment would result in a denial of natural justice under section 48.9 of the Act.\n[18] In the Commission\u2019s opinion, holding a new hearing before the same Member raises no reasonable apprehension of bias. The Commission noted that there is a presumption that the trier of facts is impartial. According to the Commission, this presumption can only be rebutted by solid facts and not suspicions.\n[19] Thus, in the Commission\u2019s view, since there is no reasonable apprehension of bias, the adjournment sought is not warranted under any principle of natural justice.\nC. The Complainants [20] The Complainants concur with the Commission\u2019s reasons. They further emphasize the delays already incurred and call for an expeditious disposition of the matter.\nD. Respondent\u2019s reply [21] The Respondent, in response to the Commission\u2019s arguments, maintains that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to rule on a request for adjournment pursuant to Rules 3(1) and 1(6) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure adopted under the Act. The adjournment of a proceeding before the Tribunal is therefore, in the Respondent\u2019s view, not limited to cases in which there has been a denial of natural justice.\n[22] The Respondent confirms that the comments made by the Tribunal member in Malec and quoted by Justice Tremblay-Lamer in Conseil des Montagnais are the only facts alleged and that they provide a sufficient basis for a reasonable apprehension of bias.\n[23] Lastly, the Respondent claims that the Commission should not intervene in this motion. According to the Respondent, if the Commission wishes to intervene, it should [translation] \u201ctake up the cause\u201d for the Complainants. Otherwise, it should not intervene because it did not intervene at the hearing before the Tribunal. The Respondent did not cite any authority in support of this conclusion.\nIII. Analysis A. Request for adjournment: applicable test [24] In order to dispose of this motion, I must first determine the appropriate test to be applied in cases where an adjournment is requested. As the Commission pointed out, there are two schools of thought that emerge from the case law of the Tribunal in this regard.\n[25] On the one hand, some decisions apply the criteria set out in MacDonald and Metropolitan Stores. Thus, in Laurendeau v. Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 2004 CHRT 11 (Laurendeau), a motion for adjournment was filed pending judicial review of a preliminary objection regarding the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. The Tribunal explained the preferred approach in that decision:\nTo be granted an adjournment, the respondent had to demonstrate that its application met the three criteria affirmed in \u2026 Metropolitan Stores and in \u2026 MacDonald \u2026 as follows:\na) First, the respondent must establish that there is a serious question to be tried.\nb) Second, the respondent must convince the Tribunal that it would suffer irreparable harm if the remedy were refused. The term \u201cirreparable\u201d refers to the nature of the harm rather than the extent.\nc) Third, which is the balance of convenience, involves determining which party would suffer greater harm from the granting or refusal of the adjournment. ( At para. 14.)\n[26] The same approach was also taken in Canadian Telephone Employees\u2019 Association et al v. Bell Canada, 2002, No. T503\/2098. In that case, a motion for adjournment had been filed while a related decision regarding the Tribunal\u2019s impartiality and institutional independence awaited a ruling on an application for leave to appeal the matter to the Supreme Court of Canada. The motion for adjournment was dismissed, the Tribunal having applied the test set out in MacDonald and Metropolitan Stores in its decision.\n[27] On the other hand, a second school of thought in the case law holds that the Tribunal has the authority to grant an adjournment only where there would otherwise be a denial of natural justice. In L\u00e9ger v. CN, 1999, No. T527\/2299 (L\u00e9ger), an application for judicial review was filed challenging a decision of the Commission to refer a complaint to the Tribunal. In that case, the Respondent had asked the Tribunal to adjourn the proceeding until the Federal Court had ruled on its judicial review application. When it dismissed the motion, the Tribunal refused to apply the criteria set out in MacDonald and Metropolitan Stores by establishing a distinction between the powers of an administrative tribunal and those of a supervisory court:\nThe R.J.R. MacDonald tests apply to a different situation, namely, where a supervisory court is asked, pursuant to its statutory authority or its inherent jurisdiction, for interim injunctive relief. In my opinion, the exercise of the Tribunal\u2019s discretion is subject to the rules of procedural fairness and natural justice, and the regime of the Act. \u2026\nAs a response to section 2 [of the Act], numerous court decisions have established that allegations of discrimination are to be dealt with expeditiously and in a timely fashion. It is against this backdrop that \u2026 adjournment request must be measured (at para. 5).\n[28] In other words, since no power of adjournment is specified in the Act and since the purpose of the Act is to deal with complaints of discrimination expeditiously, only in matters of procedural fairness and natural justice would the Tribunal be allowed to exercise its discretion to grant an adjournment of a proceeding.\n[29] In Baltruweit v. Canadian Security Intelligence Service, 2004 CHRT 14 (Baltruweit), the Commission had referred a complaint to a conciliator in the hope of arriving at a settlement; failing a settlement within 60 days, the complaint would be referred to the Tribunal. The Respondent filed an application for judicial review and, in the interim, the conciliation was unsuccessful. The complaint was then referred to the Tribunal for hearing. Consequently, the Respondent asked the Tribunal to stay the proceeding until the final determination of its judicial review application before the Federal Court. Ultimately, the Tribunal dismissed the motion for adjournment and maintained its refusal to apply the test set out in MacDonald and Metropolitan Stores. The Tribunal embarks on an exhaustive explanation of this decision, which reflects the preferred approach taken in L\u00e9ger:\n[In MacDonald and Metropolitan Stores], the reviewing courts had the statutory authority to stay proceedings. As does the Federal Court, Trial Division. Under s. 18.2 of the Federal Court Act, the Federal Court may stay the proceedings of a federal tribunal pending review.\nThere is nothing in the Canadian Human Rights Act that confers \u2026the statutory power on the \u2026 Tribunal to stay its proceedings pending an application for judicial review. (At paras. 11 and 12.)\n[30] The Tribunal then proceeds to explain the applicable test:\nThe Act requires that proceedings before the Tribunal be conducted informally and expeditiously and also provides that this mandate of the Tribunal is subject to the rules of natural justice (s. 48.9(1)). \u2026\nIt is well established that administrative tribunals are masters of their own proceedings. As such, they possess significant discretion in deciding requests for adjournments. \u2026\nIt is clear then that this Tribunal, when exercising its discretion, must do so having regard to principles of natural justice. Some examples of natural justice concerns to which the Tribunal could respond to, would be unavailability of evidence, the need to adjourn to obtain counsel, or late disclosure by an opposite party. (At paras 14, 15 and 17.)\n[31] Finally, as was noted by the Commission, a similar line of reasoning as that found in L\u00e9ger and Baltruweit was adopted in a number of recent decisions: Marshall v. Cerescorp, 2011 CHRT 5, Marshall v. Cerescorp, 2011 CHRT 9 and Emmett v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2012 CHRT 3.\n[32] This second school of thought in the case law raises an important point when it asserts that administrative tribunals are masters of their own procedures. As the Respondent points out, Rule 1(6) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure adopted under the Act, bestows a great deal of discretion on Tribunal members in matters of procedure:\n1(6) The Panel retains the jurisdiction to decide any matter of procedure not provided for by these Rules.\n[33] Thus, the Tribunal is not required to apply the test set out in MacDonald and Metropolitan Stores, although it may use it as a guide or as a reference, depending on the circumstances and the parties\u2019 submissions. However, the process chosen by the Tribunal must comply with the provisions and the purpose of the Act, which is to eliminate discrimination, and which therefore implies a timely resolution of discrimination complaints. Moreover, subsection 48.9(1) of the Act affirms this desire to take corrective measures against discriminatory practices in a timely manner:\n48.9 (1) Proceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\n[34] Therefore, to obtain an adjournment, the Respondent in this case must convince the Tribunal that the continuation of this proceeding, without additional delays, would result in a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness. This approach seems all the more suitable, given that, if necessary, the Respondent may apply to the Federal Court for a stay of proceedings before the Tribunal. In fact, section 18.2 of the Federal Courts Act, RSC, 1985, c F-7 states the following:\n18.2 On an application for judicial review, the Federal Court may make any interim orders that it considers appropriate pending the final disposition of the application.\n[35] In the meantime, the Tribunal must give effect to the purpose and provisions of the Act, which require that complaints of discrimination be dealt with expeditiously while adhering to the principles of natural justice.\nB. Reasonable apprehension of bias [36] In support of its motion for adjournment, the Respondent contends that a reasonable apprehension of bias arises from the appointment of the Member. In this regard, the only facts raised by the Respondent in support of its allegation of a reasonable apprehension of bias are the portions from Malec cited by Justice Tremblay-Lamer in Conseil des Montagnais at paragraphs 31 and 32. In his reply, at paragraphs 8 and 9, the Respondent states:\n[translation]\n8. As for the claim by the Commission and the Complainants that the Respondent\u2019s arguments are not supported by specific facts, demonstrating that Member Doucet cannot rule on the complaint a second time, we refer the Tribunal to the Respondent\u2019s factum, a copy of which is attached hereto, placed in the Federal Court\u2019s judicial review docket;\n9. In the said factum, the Respondent provides a description of the facts and of the comments made by member Doucet in his decision, dated January 27, 2010, and highlighted by Justice Tremblay-Lamer in her judgment previously filed in the record\u2026\n[37] The facts and comments referred to by the Respondent are summarized by Justice Tremblay-Lamer in Conseil des Montagnais as follows:\nIn this regard, the Tribunal determined that no evidence had been adduced by the applicant to justify why this allowance had not been paid to the Respondents:\nThe burden is now on the respondent to show, on a balance of probabilities, that there was a bona fide justification to deny the Complainants the isolated post allowance. The respondent did not submit any evidence to justify this unfair treatment. Moreover, the respondent did not submit any evidence to show that the treatment was due to the permanent residence of the recipients rather than their race\/ethnic origin or national origin. The so-called \u201cadmissions\u201d by the Complainants have no probative value that would allow such a conclusion or practice. (Tribunal\u2019s decision, at para. 45). [Emphasis added.]\nHowever, it is not true that the employer failed to submit any evidence to justify the isolated post allowance policy. (At paras 31 and 32.)\n[38] In my opinion, these facts and comments do not provide a sufficient basis, in the circumstances, for a reasonable apprehension of bias.\n[39] Allegations of a reasonable apprehension of bias must be taken seriously, as they have major consequences for the reputations of both the justice system and the quasi-judicial system. Such allegations are not to be made lightly. This is why there is a presumption that the trier of facts, in this case the Tribunal member, is impartial. This presumption can only be rebutted by concrete facts and persuasive evidence.\n[40] In Arthur v. Canada (Attorney General), 2001 FCA 223, the court was faced with an allegation of a reasonable apprehension of bias. In its decision against the applicant, the court emphasized the seriousness of the allegation in question as well as the extent and nature of the evidence required:\nAn allegation of bias, especially actual and not simply apprehended bias, against a tribunal is a serious allegation. It challenges the integrity of the tribunal and of its members who participated in the impugned decision. It cannot be done lightly. It cannot rest on mere suspicion, pure conjecture, insinuations or mere impressions of an applicant or his counsel. It must be supported by material evidence demonstrating conduct that derogates from the standard. It is often useful, and even necessary, in doing so, to resort to evidence extrinsic to the case. (At para. 8).\n[41] In Committee for Justice and Liberty v. Canada (National Energy Board), [1978] 1 SCR 369, the Supreme Court established the applicable test for determining whether there is a reasonable apprehension of bias:\n[T]he apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable and right minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information. \u2026 [T]hat test is \u2026 what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically\u2014and having thought the matter through\u2014conclude. \u2026 (At paras 40 and 41.)\n[42] In light of the evidence submitted by the Respondent, a well informed person who has thought the matter through would likely not conclude that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias. The fact that a judge or tribunal member may have erred in law is not indicative of a prejudice or any degree of bias; at most it reveals an error in the assessment of the law and of the facts. Without additional evidence showing that the Member was biased and did not simply err in law, a well informed person could not conclude that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias.\n[43] For example, in Irvine v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2004 CHRT 9 (Irvine), the Tribunal had, in a previous decision (Irvine v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces), [2001] DCDP No 39), found that the Canadian Armed Forces had acted in a discriminatory manner when the complainant was medically released. In a judicial review (Irvine v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces), 2003 FCT 660), the Federal Court determined that the Tribunal had erred by failing to apply the Meiorin test in accordance with the principle of \u201cuniversality of service\u201d, a principle recognized by the case law and requiring every member of the Armed Forces to be fit to be \u201ca soldier first\u201d. The matter was referred back to the Tribunal for redetermination in accordance with the principles of universality of service.\n[44] However, in Irvine, the case referred back to the Tribunal was assigned to the same member. As with a number of cases, errors by a judge or member of an administrative tribunal do not, in and of themselves, constitute a reasonable apprehension of bias.\n[45] Given that the Respondent raises no facts other than those mentioned by Justice Tremblay-Lamer in Conseil des Montagnais, the evidence is insufficient to demonstrate a reasonable apprehension of bias. It therefore follows that the continuation of the proceeding before the same Tribunal member is not contrary to the principles of natural justice. Hence, the adjournment requested by the Respondent has no basis in law.\nC. Irreparable harm and balance of convenience [46] Since the Respondent based the arguments in his request on the test set out in MacDonald and Metropolitan Stores, it should be noted that the motion for adjournment would also have been dismissed had the tripartite test been applied.\n[47] Assuming there was a serious question, the Respondent has not, in my opinion, provided evidence of irreparable harm. In this regard, the Respondent claims that legal costs incurred as well as any sums of money the Tribunal may order to be paid constitute irreparable harm. However, it is well established that this kind of expenditure is more a question of inconvenience than irreparable harm (Laurendeau at para. 19).\n[48] The Respondent further alleges that it would suffer irreparable harm by risking the disclosure of evidence that could be prejudicial to it in any future hearing. This fear appears to be unfounded in the circumstances. The Federal Court referred the matter back to the Tribunal for redetermination and analysis based on existing evidence (Conseil des Montagnais at paras 32 to 38). Moreover, the facts outlined by the Respondent in no way suggest that the introduction of new evidence would be called for.\n[49] As regards the balance of convenience, in my view, the inconvenience to the Complainants by being denied their right to an expeditious resolution of their complaint, after several years of litigation, outweighs any inconvenience to the Respondent by having to be party to these proceedings.\nD. Commission\u2019s intervention [50] As for the Respondent\u2019s objection to the Commission\u2019s intervention, it is unfounded in law. Rule 1(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure clearly sets out the purpose of the rules, including:\n(a) all parties to an inquiry have the full and ample opportunity to be heard;\n[51] Rule 1(3) defines \u201cparty\u201d as follows:\n\u201cparty\u201d, in respect of an inquiry, means the Canadian Human Rights Commission, the complainant, and the person against whom the complaint was made;\n[52] In my opinion, Rule 1(3) implies that the Commission is a party to any proceedings before the Tribunal and may choose to intervene at any moment, pursuant to Rule 1 and notwithstanding Rule 8 on the adding of parties and interested parties. Furthermore, the Respondent cites no authority to the contrary. The Commission was entitled and remains entitled to intervene in these proceedings.\nIV. Conclusion [53] For the foregoing reasons, the Respondent\u2019s motion for adjournment is dismissed.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nApril 11, 2012\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1318\/4808\nStyle of Cause: \u00c9velyne Malec et al. v.

The Parties\u2019 Submissions. 5\nIV......... Order 6\nI. Background [1] This case (\u201cThwaites\u201d) involves sixty-nine Air Canada pilots (\u201cComplainants\u201d) whose employment was terminated for no reason other than that they had reached the mandatory retirement age of sixty. The Complainants filed complaints with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCHRC\u201d) alleging discrimination by Air Canada and Air Canada Pilots Association (\u201cACPA\u201d) (\u201cRespondents\u201d) on the basis of age.\n[2] The Tribunal hearing into the complaints was held in the months of October 2009 and January 2010. One of the issues raised by the Complainants was the constitutionality of s. 15(1)(c) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cCHRA\u201d). They served a Notice of Constitutional Question as required.\n[3] At the request of the Complainants, the Tribunal directed that the constitutionality question would not be considered by the Tribunal at this time. After the conclusion of the evidence on ss. 15(1)(c), 15(1)(a) and 15(2) of the CHRA, the parties, if so advised, could make submissions as to whether the Tribunal should hear evidence and argument on the constitutional question and if so, the Tribunal would set dates for the hearing of this question.\n[4] The Tribunal released its decision, 2011 CHRT 11, on August 10, 2011. In its decision, the Tribunal concluded that the Respondents could rely on s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA as a defense so that the mandatory retirement policy at age 60 did not amount to a discriminatory practice. Accordingly, the Tribunal dismissed the complaints.\n[5] Shortly after the release of the decision, the CHRC advised the Tribunal of the inconsistency of the dismissal of the complaints and the earlier directive of the Tribunal to defer the hearing of submissions on the constitutionality of s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA.\n[6] The CHRC filed a motion on September 9, 2011 with the Tribunal seeking an order to review and amend the Tribunal\u2019s decision (2011 CHRT 11) and to provide that the hearing resume to determine the question of the constitutional validity, applicability and operability of s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA. The Tribunal granted this motion on February 20, 2012. The Tribunal directed that the parties provide written submissions on this question.\n[7] The Complainants and the CHRC argue that the Federal Court decision, 2011 FC 120 (\u201cVilven # 2\u201d) is determinative of this issue and the complaints must therefore be upheld. The Respondents\u2019 position is that this Federal Court decision is not binding on the Tribunal. Further, the Respondents argue that the determination of the constitutional question by the Tribunal and the status of the complaints should be postponed until the Federal Court of Appeal issues its judgment on this question.\nII. Federal Court Decision 2011 FC 120 (Vilven # 2) [8] The genesis of Vilven # 2 is the Tribunal decision in the case of Vilven & Kelly v. Air Canada & ACPA, 2007 CHRT 36. In this case dealing with the mandatory retirement of Air Canada pilots, the Tribunal (\u201cVilven Tribunal\u201d) decided that s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA did not contravene s. 15(1) of the Charter. Vilven & Kelly applied to the Federal Court for judicial review of this decision. The Court found that s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA did contravene the Charter and remitted the matter to the Vilven Tribunal to determine whether s. 15(1)(c) could be justified under s. 1 of the Charter.\n[9] Following a hearing on this question, the Vilven Tribunal decided that s. 15(1)(c) was not saved under s. 1 of the Charter. The Respondents, Air Canada and ACPA sought judicial review of this decision.\n[10] The Federal Court dismissed the Respondents\u2019 application for judicial review on this question. In reaching this conclusion, the Court first noted that the Tribunal\u2019s finding on s. 1 of the Charter is reviewable against the standard of correctness. The Court reviewed in detail the reasoning of the Tribunal\u2019s s. 1 decision; reviewed the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s mandatory retirement jurisprudence; considered why the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in McKinney does not determine the results in this case; and finally engaged in an extensive analysis on the question of whether paragraph 15(1)(c) of the CHRA was justifiable under s. 1 of the Charter.\n[11] With respect to this latter question, the Court considered whether the four criteria required under the s. 1 Oakes analytical framework were satisfied. The Court did so on the basis of the Oakes jurisprudence and on the basis of the evidentiary record including the expert evidence that was before the Vilven Tribunal. In its reasons, the Court made it clear that it agreed with some but not all of the conclusions of the Tribunal with respect to the four Oakes tests.\n[12] In particular, the Court did not agree with the finding of the Vilven Tribunal which found that the Respondents had failed to satisfy any of the four branches of the Oakes test. Rather, the Court found that the Respondents were able to satisfy two branches of the Oakes test, namely, that the objectives of s. 15(1)(c) were pressing and substantial and that there was a rational connection between the legislative objective and the impugned legislation. However, the Court did find that the Tribunal was correct in its assessment of the proportionality criterion and the minimal impairment criterion.\n[13] Having done its own analysis of the issues relating to s. 1 of the Charter, the Court concluded,\nFor the reasons given in this case, I find that the Tribunal was correct in concluding that Air Canada and ACPA had not satisfied the onus on them to demonstrate that paragraph 15(1)(c) of the CHRA is saved under section 1 of the Charter. Air Canada and ACPA have not shown that the broadly-worded exception to the otherwise discriminatory practice of mandatory retirement contained in paragraph 15(1)(c) of the CHRA is a reasonable limit justifiable in a free and democratic society. (para. 351, Vilven # 2)\n[14] Shortly before the hearing on the judicial review applications, Vilven and Kelly filed a motion with the Federal Court to amend their memorandum of fact and law to include a request a declaration that s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA was inconsistent with the Charter and was of no force or effect by reason of s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n[15] The Court refused to grant this motion. The Court noted that, although it had the jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenges that may arise in a judicial review application and to grant declaratory relief, it must be the applicant who seeks the declaratory relief, not the respondent. And the Court can only grant such relief if the Court finds that the Tribunal erred in its conclusion, which was not the case here.\n[16] Further, even assuming that declaratory relief could be granted to a respondent, this was not a case for such an award. The reason for this was two-fold. First, the Court considered the motion to be a collateral attack on the Vilven Tribunal\u2019s remedy decision, 2010 CHRT 27 which was not before the Court.\n[17] Secondly, it was ACPA who served the Notice of Constitution Question relating to its judicial review application and the Attorneys General could not have anticipated that Vilven & Kelly would be seeking a general declaration of invalidity.\n[18] ACPA, supported by Air Canada, appealed the Federal Court decision in Vilven # 2 to the Federal Court of Appeal, requesting that the decision in Vilven # 2 be set aside, its application for judicial review be allowed and the decision of the Vilven Tribunal on the constitutionality of s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA be quashed.\n[19] Vilven & Kelly cross-appealed Vilven # 2, claiming that the Federal Court should have issued a declaration of invalidity once it decided that s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA was inconsistent with the Charter. They requested that the Court of Appeal dismiss ACPA\u2019s appeal and issue a declaration that s. 15(1)(c) is invalid and of no force and effect.\n[20] The appeal and cross-appeal were heard by the Federal Court of Appeal on November 22-23, 2011 and are under reserve.\nIII. The Parties\u2019 Submissions [21] The Complainants\u2019 position is that the Federal Court in Vilven # 2 decided that s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA is unconstitutional. That decision is binding on the Tribunal in this case and the complaints must be upheld. They argue that to find otherwise would run counter to the doctrines of stare decisis, res judicata (issue estoppel) and abuse of process.\n[22] The Respondents\u2019 submissions are to the contrary. The essence of their arguments are that the Court in Vilven # 2 did not determine that s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA violated the Charter. It went no further than to confirm that the Vilven Tribunal\u2019s decision was correct. Further, the Complainants are seeking in this case to reverse the Federal Court\u2019s decision denying their motion for a general declaration of invalidity and to reverse the Vilven Tribunal\u2019s refusal to grant a general cease and desist order.\n[23] I do not agree with the Respondents\u2019 arguments. It is clear that the Court engaged in an extensive, detailed, independent analysis of the issues raised in the judicial review applications (the Court\u2019s reasons on this issue amounted to three hundred paragraphs in the judgment of four hundred and ninety-three paragraphs). On this basis the Court concluded that the Respondents had not met the onus upon them under the Oakes test. Thus, the Court held that the Tribunal was correct and dismissed the judicial review applications.\n[24] I also disagree with the Respondents\u2019 assertion that the Complainants would achieve a general declaration of invalidity or a general cease and desist order, if this Tribunal finds that Vilven # 2 is binding on it. In such case, all the Tribunal can do is to refuse to apply s. 15(1)(c) to the facts of this case, which it has the power to do.\n[25] Having concluded that Vilven # 2 decided that s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA was not saved under s. 1 of the Charter, the question remains whether the decision is binding on this Tribunal. The Complainants say yes and rely on the principles of stare decisis, res judicata and abuse of process in support of their position.\n[26] Under the doctrine of stare decisis, courts and tribunals exercising inferior jurisdiction are required to follow the decisions of courts exercising superior jurisdiction. That is, courts and tribunals lower in the judicial hierarchy are bound by decisions of law by courts higher in the judicial hierarchy of the same jurisdiction. But it is only if an issue before a lower court comes within the scope of the ratio decidendi of a decision of a higher court that the lower court is bound to apply such ratio to the case before it.\n[27] Although there is much debate over how to determine the ratio decidendi of a particular decision, there is general acceptance of the view that the ratio decidendi derives from the facts that the court treats as material facts and the decision that is based upon them.\n[28] In my opinion, the material facts relied upon by the Court were those relating to the application of the Oakes test and the resulting decision based on these material facts constitute the ratio decidendi of Vilven # 2.\n[29] The issue before this Tribunal comes squarely within the ratio decidendi of Vilven # 2. There is nothing in the material facts on the record in the proceeding before this Tribunal to materially distinguish it from material facts relating to the constitutional issue in the proceeding of the Federal Court. The Federal Court\u2019s determination of the constitutionality of s. 15(1) involved the identical legal and fact situation as is present in this proceeding. Thus, I have concluded that the decision in Vilven # 2 is binding on this Tribunal with respect to the constitutionality of s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA.\nIV. Order [30] In view of the above, I hereby amend Tribunal decision 2011 CHRT 11 as follows:\n(a) Paragraph 182 of Tribunal decision 2011 CHRT 11 is deleted.\n(b) Paragraph 430 of the Tribunal decision 2011 CHRT 11 is deleted, and the following substituted therefore:\n[430] I have concluded that the Respondents cannot rely on the BFOR defence under s. 15(1)(a) of the CHRA. I have also concluded on the evidence adduced that the Complainants\u2019 employment was terminated at the \u201cnormal age of retirement\u201d within the meaning of s. 15(1)(c). However, given the fact that the Complainants\u2019 constitutional challenge to s. 15(1)(c) remains to be determined, I cannot make any dispositive finding in respect of the application of this provision. Nor am I in a position to make a final decision as to whether the complaints have been substantiated or not. Further submissions from the parties will be required in regard to the next steps to be taken in this proceeding.\n[31] Having considered the parties\u2019 submissions on the legal effect of the decision of the Federal Court in Vilven #2, and having concluded that this decision is binding on this Tribunal, I refuse to apply s. 15(1)(c) to the present case before the Tribunal, on the grounds that it is unconstitutional, giving rise as it does to a breach of s. 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which breach cannot be saved by s. 1.\n[32] Given that the Respondents have been unable to demonstrate the applicability of either of the justificatory defenses invoked, (s. 15(1)(a)\/15(2), and s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA), I find that the complaints have been substantiated.\n[33] I hereby reserve jurisdiction in this case to address any outstanding matters and issues.\nSigned by\nJ.

Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que pendant un concours relatif \u00e0 un emploi offert par l\u2019intim\u00e9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnablement s\u00e9v\u00e8re par rapport aux autres candidats participant au processus de s\u00e9lection, en ce sens qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 class\u00e9 au cinqui\u00e8me rang sur cinq candidats admissibles, que les quatre autres candidats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s mais que lui ne l\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 malgr\u00e9 la preuve que l\u2019on avait besoin de ses services et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour l\u2019emploi, et que l\u2019intim\u00e9 continue de chercher d\u2019autres candidats.\n[3] Dans la liste des documents inclus dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le plaignant a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il a l\u2019intention de se fonder sur des documents concernant des questions, des r\u00e9ponses et des outils d\u2019\u00e9valuation qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s dans le cadre du processus de s\u00e9lection en vue de montrer qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnablement s\u00e9v\u00e8re.\n[4] Le processus de s\u00e9lection a fait l\u2019objet de deux appels de la part du plaignant aupr\u00e8s du Comit\u00e9 d\u2019appel de la Commission de la fonction publique (le CACFP), appels pour lesquels des d\u00e9cisions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues le 17 ao\u00fbt 2006 et le 27 mars 2007 et dans le cadre desquels la question de savoir si le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnablement s\u00e9v\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e.\n[5] La position qu\u2019adopte l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans sa demande concernant la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision est expos\u00e9e dans la lettre dat\u00e9e du 23 novembre 2011 qu\u2019il a envoy\u00e9e au Tribunal :\n[traduction] La question de savoir si le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 correctement lors du processus de s\u00e9lection a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e \u00e0 deux reprises par le Comit\u00e9 d\u2019appel de la Commission de la fonction publique (le Comit\u00e9 d\u2019appel de la CFP). Apr\u00e8s le second appel du plaignant aupr\u00e8s de la CFP, le Comit\u00e9 d\u2019appel a clairement conclu que les candidats avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re raisonnable et que le plaignant n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnablement s\u00e9v\u00e8re par rapport aux autres candidats. Il est donc inutile que le Tribunal r\u00e9examine une fois de plus les \u00e9valuations du plaignant. Par ailleurs, comme le Comit\u00e9 d\u2019appel de la CFP est un comit\u00e9 d\u2019appel sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 charg\u00e9 de r\u00e9examiner les processus de s\u00e9lection afin d\u2019en garantir l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, il serait opportun que le Tribunal se fonde sur les conclusions du Comit\u00e9 d\u2019appel de la CFP.\n[6] Le 17 ao\u00fbt 2006, le CACFP a rendu sa premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision concernant l\u2019appel du plaignant contre les nominations effectu\u00e9es \u00e0 la suite du processus de s\u00e9lection. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, le CACFP examine l\u2019all\u00e9gation du plaignant en ces termes : [traduction] \u00ab All\u00e9gation no 1 - La notation de l\u2019entrevue a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9raisonnablement s\u00e9v\u00e8re, ce qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 une perte de points dans le cas de certaines questions \u00bb. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le plaignant contestait la notation des questions d\u2019entrevue nos 1, 6, 7, 8 et 9. Le CACFP a conclu que le jury de s\u00e9lection de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas agi de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnable dans son \u00e9valuation des r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es par le plaignant aux questions nos 1, 6 et 9. En ce qui concerne la question no 7, le CACFP a conclu que l\u2019avis du jury de s\u00e9lection \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que ce dernier avait utilis\u00e9 arbitrairement pour cette question un syst\u00e8me de notation d\u00e9favorable. Quant \u00e0 la question no 8, le CACFP a conclu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas fourni de preuve montrant que les r\u00e9ponses attendues correspondaient \u00e0 la question pos\u00e9e et que les r\u00e9ponses attendues mesuraient bel et bien les facteurs secondaires qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient cens\u00e9es mesurer. Par suite de cette d\u00e9cision, le CACFP a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de mettre en \u0153uvre des mesures correctives en vue de r\u00e9gler les probl\u00e8mes relev\u00e9s lors de l\u2019appel, dont les mesures suivantes : r\u00e9\u00e9valuer tous les candidats, veiller \u00e0 ce que le d\u00e9faut relev\u00e9 dans le cas des questions nos 7 et 8 ne se r\u00e9p\u00e8te pas et que les candidats d\u00e9j\u00e0 nomm\u00e9s \u00e0 ces postes ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient pas d\u2019un avantage indu et, s\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019apporter des changements \u00e0 la liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 par suite de cette r\u00e9\u00e9valuation, diffuser une liste modifi\u00e9e comportant les droits d\u2019appel appropri\u00e9s.\n[7] Apr\u00e8s la mise en \u0153uvre des mesures correctives, une nouvelle liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9e et le plaignant y a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 en tant que cinqui\u00e8me candidat retenu. Ce dernier a interjet\u00e9 appel de la mise en \u0153uvre des mesures correctives aupr\u00e8s du CACFP.\n[8] Le 27 mars 2007, le CACFP a rendu sa seconde d\u00e9cision sur l\u2019appel du plaignant contre les nominations effectu\u00e9es dans le cadre du processus de s\u00e9lection. Il a examin\u00e9 l\u2019all\u00e9gation du plaignant selon laquelle [traduction] \u00ab [c]omparativement aux autres candidats retenus, je crois qu\u2019on m\u2019a not\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnablement s\u00e9v\u00e8re, ce qui m\u2019a fait perdre des points dans le cas de certaines questions \u00bb. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le plaignant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que le jury de s\u00e9lection avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9raisonnablement s\u00e9v\u00e8re au moment de noter les r\u00e9ponses aux questions nos 1, 3 et 4 de son examen, comparativement aux autres candidats retenus. Le CACFP a dit avoir examin\u00e9 avec soin l\u2019examen \u00e9crit de tous les candidats retenus, y compris celui du plaignant, et n\u2019a vu aucune raison d\u2019intervenir. Il s\u2019est dit convaincu par les explications de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au sujet de la fa\u00e7on dont les notes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9es aux candidats, ainsi que de la raison pour laquelle le plaignant n\u2019avait pas obtenu un r\u00e9sultat aussi bon que celui des autres candidats. Se fondant sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve produits \u00e0 l\u2019audience, le CACFP s\u2019est dit persuad\u00e9 que le jury de s\u00e9lection s\u2019\u00e9tait acquitt\u00e9 de son obligation de veiller \u00e0 ce que les questions \u00e9valuent ce qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient con\u00e7ues pour \u00e9valuer, que les questions et les r\u00e9ponses attendues \u00e9taient li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 des crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite \u00e9tabli pour le poste en question et que le jury de s\u00e9lection pouvait montrer que les candidats avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s d\u2019une mani\u00e8re juste et \u00e9quitable.\n[9] En common law, les doctrines de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e, de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure et de la contestation indirecte \u00ab existent essentiellement pour pr\u00e9venir l\u2019in\u00e9quit\u00e9 en emp\u00eachant les \u201crecours abusifs\u201d \u00bb, ainsi qu\u2019il est mentionn\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Colombie\u2011Britannique (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) c. Figliola, 2011 CSC 52, au paragraphe 34 [Figliola]. Dans cet arr\u00eat, les principes sous-jacents de ces trois doctrines sont r\u00e9sum\u00e9s ainsi :\n\u2022 La capacit\u00e9 de se fier au caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif d\u2019une d\u00e9cision sert l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public et celui des parties (Danyluk, par. 18; Boucher, par. 35);\n\u2022 Le respect du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif d\u2019une d\u00e9cision judiciaire ou administrative renforce l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 des tribunaux judiciaires et administratifs ainsi que de l\u2019administration de la justice; \u00e0 l\u2019oppos\u00e9, la remise en cause de questions d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9es par un forum comp\u00e9tent peut miner la confiance envers l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me en cr\u00e9ant de l\u2019incoh\u00e9rence et en suscitant des recours faisant inutilement double emploi (Toronto (Ville), par. 38 et 51);\n\u2022 La contestation de la validit\u00e9 ou du bien-fond\u00e9 d\u2019une d\u00e9cision judiciaire ou administrative se fait au moyen de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019appel ou de contr\u00f4le judiciaire pr\u00e9vue par le l\u00e9gislateur (Boucher, par. 35; Danyluk, par. 74);\n\u2022 Les parties ne doivent pas \u00e9luder le m\u00e9canisme de r\u00e9vision pr\u00e9vu en s\u2019adressant \u00e0 un autre forum pour contester une d\u00e9cision judiciaire ou administrative (TeleZone, par. 61; Boucher, par. 35; Garland, par. 72);\n\u2022 En \u00e9vitant les causes inutiles, on \u00e9vite le gaspillage de ressources (Toronto (Ville), par. 37 et 51);\n(Figliola, au paragraphe 34)\nSe fondant sur ces principes, la Cour a conclu qu\u2019un tribunal ayant \u00e0 trancher si le fond d\u2019une plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e doit se demander :\n\u2022 s\u2019il existe une comp\u00e9tence concurrente pour statuer sur les questions relatives aux droits de la personne;\n\u2022 si la question juridique tranch\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure \u00e9tait essentiellement la m\u00eame que celle qui est soulev\u00e9e dans la plainte dont il est saisi;\n\u2022 si le processus ant\u00e9rieur, qu\u2019il ressemble ou non \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure que le tribunal pr\u00e9f\u00e8re ou utilise lui-m\u00eame, a offert la possibilit\u00e9 aux plaignants ou \u00e0 leurs ayants droit de conna\u00eetre les \u00e9l\u00e9ments invoqu\u00e9s contre eux et de les r\u00e9futer.\n(Figliola, au paragraphe 37)\n[10] La Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9galement ajout\u00e9 : \u00ab [i]l s\u2019agit, en d\u00e9finitive, de se demander s\u2019il est logique de consacrer des ressources publiques et priv\u00e9es \u00e0 la remise en cause de ce qui est essentiellement le m\u00eame litige \u00bb (Figliola, au paragraphe 37).\n[11] Suivant l\u2019application des principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Figliola, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9cemment infirm\u00e9 une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal parce que ce dernier n\u2019avait pas \u00ab [\u2026] [tenu] compte de l\u2019in\u00e9quit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rente au magasinage de forum \u00bb, dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Office des transports du Canada, 2011 CAF 332, au paragraphe 28.\n[12] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Figliola, s\u2019appuyant sur la d\u00e9cision rendue dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Tranchemontagne c. Ontario (Directeur du Programme ontarien de soutien aux personnes handicap\u00e9es), 2006 CSC 14, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00ab en l\u2019absence d\u2019une disposition expresse \u00e0 l\u2019effet contraire, tous les tribunaux administratifs ont une comp\u00e9tence concurrente en mati\u00e8re d\u2019application des mesures l\u00e9gislatives relatives aux droits de la personne \u00bb (Figliola, au paragraphe 45). Les appels du plaignant aupr\u00e8s du CACFP ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en vertu de l\u2019article 21 de la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique, aujourd\u2019hui abrog\u00e9e, L.R.C. 1985, ch. P\u201133 (la LEFP). Suivant l\u2019article 7.4 de cette loi, les comit\u00e9s \u00e9tablis en vue d\u2019entendre un appel en vertu de l\u2019article 21 disposent, relativement \u00e0 la question dont ils sont saisis, des pouvoirs d\u2019un commissaire nomm\u00e9 au titre de la partie II de la Loi sur les enqu\u00eates, L.R.C 1985, ch. 1\u201111. La LEFP et la Loi sur les enqu\u00eates ne comportent aucune disposition expresse qui \u00e9limine la comp\u00e9tence concurrente qu\u2019a le CACFP en mati\u00e8re d\u2019application de la Loi. C\u2019est donc dire que, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le CACFP poss\u00e8de la comp\u00e9tence concurrente pour trancher les questions relatives aux droits de la personne.\n[13] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite du processus de s\u00e9lection parce que [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019intim\u00e9 a not\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 la baisse afin de s\u2019assurer qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait pas de changement aux candidats d\u00e9j\u00e0 nomm\u00e9s \u00bb. Les d\u00e9tails de cette all\u00e9gation sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation des candidats qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite des mesures correctives que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a mises en \u0153uvre apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision du CACFP dat\u00e9e du 17 ao\u00fbt 2006. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que la d\u00e9cision du 27 mars 2007 du CACFP, qui a port\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation des candidats \u00e0 la suite des mesures correctives que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait mises en \u0153uvre, a \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9e par des commentaires d\u00e9favorables de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 propos du plaignant. Les autres all\u00e9gations sont li\u00e9es au fait que, peu apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 applicable au processus de s\u00e9lection de l\u2019intim\u00e9, ce dernier a continu\u00e9 de chercher des candidats ayant les qualifications du plaignant.\n[14] Dans le contexte de l\u2019emploi, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit que, dans les cas o\u00f9 un plaignant all\u00e8gue qu\u2019on lui a refus\u00e9 un emploi pour un motif de discrimination illicite, il faut \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie des \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\n[Traduction]\n(a) le plaignant avait les comp\u00e9tences voulues pour l\u2019emploi concern\u00e9;\n(b) le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9;\n(c) une personne qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mieux qualifi\u00e9e mais qui ne poss\u00e9dait pas la caract\u00e9ristique qui constitue le fondement de la plainte concernant les droits de la personne (c.-\u00e0-d. la race, la couleur de la peau, etc.) a par la suite obtenu le poste.\n(voir Shakes c. Rex Pak Limited (1982), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001, \u00e0 la page D\/1002 [Shakes])\n[15] Si l\u2019on applique l\u2019analyse expos\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Shakes aux all\u00e9gations du plaignant \u00e0 propos du processus de s\u00e9lection, on ne semble pas contester le fait que le plaignant avait les comp\u00e9tences voulues mais qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9, pour l\u2019emploi concern\u00e9. Cependant, le plaignant doit \u00e9galement prouver qu\u2019une personne qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mieux qualifi\u00e9e que lui mais qui ne poss\u00e9dait pas la caract\u00e9ristique distinctive de la race, de la couleur et du sexe a par la suite obtenu le poste. La preuve du plaignant \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab not\u00e9 \u00e0 la baisse \u00bb de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait pas de changement aux candidats d\u00e9j\u00e0 nomm\u00e9s. Il a fait essentiellement la m\u00eame all\u00e9gation que dans le cas de son second appel aupr\u00e8s du CACFP, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019on l\u2019a not\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnablement s\u00e9v\u00e8re, ce qui a occasionn\u00e9 une perte de points dans le cas de certaines questions. Dans sa d\u00e9cision du 27 mars 2007, le CACFP a pass\u00e9 en revue les examens \u00e9crits de tous les candidats retenus, y compris celui du plaignant, et il s\u2019est dit convaincu que leur \u00e9valuation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite de mani\u00e8re juste et \u00e9quitable. Le plaignant n\u2019a pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 devant le CACFP qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination, mais s\u2019il fallait que le Tribunal examine les all\u00e9gations du plaignant au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9valuation des candidats lors du processus de s\u00e9lection, il lui faudrait proc\u00e9der essentiellement \u00e0 la m\u00eame analyse que celle que le CACFP a faite dans sa d\u00e9cision du 27 mars 2007, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire comparer les examens de tous les candidats retenus \u00e0 celui du plaignant afin de d\u00e9cider si l\u2019\u00e9valuation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite de mani\u00e8re juste et \u00e9quitable. Le plaignant soutient maintenant que la d\u00e9cision du 27 mars 2007 du CACFP a \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9e par des commentaires d\u00e9favorables que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a faits \u00e0 son sujet, mais le r\u00f4le du Tribunal n\u2019est pas de proc\u00e9der \u00ab [\u2026] au \u201ccontr\u00f4le judiciaire\u201d de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019un autre tribunal ou au r\u00e9examen d\u2019une question d\u00fbment tranch\u00e9e pour voir si un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent pourrait en \u00e9merger \u00bb (Figliola, au paragraphe 38). Devant le CACFP, le plaignant a eu l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter ses arguments au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9valuation des candidats lors du processus de s\u00e9lection. Il n\u2019est donc pas logique de d\u00e9penser des ressources publiques et priv\u00e9es pour la remise en cause de ce qui constitue essentiellement la m\u00eame all\u00e9gation.\n[16] Par cons\u00e9quent, je fais droit par la pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9, \u00e0 savoir que les documents relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation des candidats ayant particip\u00e9 au processus de s\u00e9lection ne sont pas pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sente plainte et que le Tribunal ne sera pas saisi d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve se rapportant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 dans le cadre de ce processus. En bref, je n\u2019entendrai pas ou ne recevrai pas d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve portant sur la question de savoir si le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9 plus s\u00e9v\u00e8rement que les autres candidats ayant pris part au processus de s\u00e9lection.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

La plainte et le contexte [1] La plaignante, Mme Heather Lynn Grant, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) le 10 janvier 2008. Elle a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que son employeur, Manitoba Telecom Services Inc. (l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou MTS), a commis un acte discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H\u20116 (la LCDP) quand il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi et de garder \u00e0 son service une employ\u00e9e ayant moins d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 qu\u2019elle, en se fondant sur ses \u00e9valuations du rendement d\u00e9favorables. La plaignante all\u00e8gue que les commentaires d\u00e9favorables qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits dans les \u00e9valuations du rendement \u00e9taient li\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience dont elle est atteinte, le diab\u00e8te de type II. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 son rapport et les observations faites en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ce dernier, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en application du paragraphe 41(1) de la LCDP, de statuer uniquement sur le licenciement pr\u00e9sum\u00e9, ce qui inclut les \u00e9valuations du rendement de la plaignante dat\u00e9es de f\u00e9vrier 2006 et de janvier 2007. Le 30 d\u00e9cembre 2009, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la LCDP, la Commission a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) instruise la plainte.\n[2] La Commission n\u2019a pas pris part \u00e0 l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire, qui a eu lieu les 1er, 2 et 5 novembre 2010, ainsi que du 7 au 11 f\u00e9vrier 2011.\nII. Les faits [3] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 avec soin la totalit\u00e9 des observations et des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve des parties, y compris l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits, mes conclusions de fait sont les suivantes.\n[4] La plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 au service de MTS durant 26 ans, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son licenciement le 19 f\u00e9vrier 2007.\n[5] Entre l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2001 et le 19 f\u00e9vrier 2007, la plaignante a travaill\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de MTS \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentante r\u00e9gionale du soutien aux comptes (RRSC). Entre l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003 et la date de son licenciement, soit le 19 f\u00e9vrier 2007, la plaignante a travaill\u00e9 sous la supervision de Mme Ann Ukrainec. Au cours de cette derni\u00e8re p\u00e9riode, son rendement a \u00e9t\u00e9 officiellement \u00e9valu\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e (par l\u2019entremise de Mme Ukrainec) sur une base annuelle ou semestrielle au moyen d\u2019un document appel\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab Partenariat pour le rendement et les r\u00e9sultats \u00bb (l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement). L\u2019intim\u00e9e se sert des \u00e9valuations du rendement comme moyen d\u2019\u00e9valuer et de consigner le rendement de ses employ\u00e9s. Durant toute l\u2019ann\u00e9e, le sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat d\u2019un employ\u00e9 peut ajouter des commentaires \u00e0 ce document.\n[6] Durant ses ann\u00e9es de service aupr\u00e8s de MTS, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 membre de la Telecommunications Employees Association of Manitoba (le syndicat ou la TEAM) et r\u00e9gie par une convention collective n\u00e9goci\u00e9e par la TEAM et MTS (la convention collective).\n[7] Le 19 ao\u00fbt 2005, le m\u00e9decin de la plaignante, le Dr Barry Van Jaarsveld, du Bethesda Hospital de Steinbach (Manitoba), a diagnostiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle souffrait d\u2019hyperglyc\u00e9mie. Par la suite, vers le mois de septembre 2005, elle a re\u00e7u un diagnostic de diab\u00e8te de type II.\n[8] Les Lignes directrices de pratique clinique 2008 de l\u2019Association canadienne du diab\u00e8te d\u00e9finissent le diab\u00e8te comme suit : une glyc\u00e9mie \u00e0 jeun sup\u00e9rieure ou \u00e9gale \u00e0 7,0 mmol\/L ou bien une glyc\u00e9mie veineuse occasionnelle sup\u00e9rieure ou \u00e9gale \u00e0 11,1 mmol\/L ainsi que des sympt\u00f4mes du diab\u00e8te ou encore une glyc\u00e9mie de 11,1 mmol\/L ou plus deux heures apr\u00e8s l\u2019ingestion de 75 g de glucose dans le cadre d\u2019une \u00e9preuve d\u2019hyperglyc\u00e9mie provoqu\u00e9e. La glyc\u00e9mie (ou taux de glucose dans le sang) est mesur\u00e9e sous forme de valeurs instantan\u00e9es, pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 un moment pr\u00e9cis dans le temps, et sous forme de valeurs moyennes mesur\u00e9es au cours d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de 90 jours environ (test sur 90 jours). Les valeurs instantan\u00e9es sont mesur\u00e9es en laboratoire \u00e0 partir de sang veineux. Les mesures du glucose dans le sang capillaire sont prises par les patients eux-m\u00eames \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019un glucom\u00e8tre personnel. Le test de dosage de l\u2019h\u00e9moglobine glycosyl\u00e9e, ou test HbA1C, fournit des informations sur la glyc\u00e9mie au cours des trois mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents. Les sympt\u00f4mes d\u2019une hyperglyc\u00e9mie comprennent, notamment, les suivants : soif, faim accrue, mictions fr\u00e9quentes, infections urinaires, infections \u00e0 levures r\u00e9currentes, vision trouble, mictions fr\u00e9quentes la nuit, perte de poids, ass\u00e8chement de la bouche, malaises, mauvaise cicatrisation, infections, fatigue, \u00e9tat mental alt\u00e9r\u00e9, comprenant agitation, irritabilit\u00e9 inexpliqu\u00e9e, inattention, l\u00e9thargie extr\u00eame ou confusion. De nombreux sympt\u00f4mes sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 la perte de glucose dans les urines. Bien que le seuil de s\u00e9cr\u00e9tion du glucose dans les urines varie, en moyenne une glyc\u00e9mie sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 12 mmol\/L est associ\u00e9e \u00e0 une perte de glucose dans les urines ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 des sympt\u00f4mes d\u2019hyperglyc\u00e9mie. Il est possible de ramener le taux de glucose dans le sang \u00e0 un niveau normal gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une combinaison de divers traitements : suivre un r\u00e9gime diab\u00e9tique, perdre du poids et atteindre un poids corporel id\u00e9al, suivre un programme d\u2019exercices r\u00e9gulier, respecter la prise prescrite de m\u00e9dicaments oraux ou d\u2019insuline et changer ses habitudes de vie en vue de r\u00e9duire les facteurs de stress. Le taux de glucose dans le sang peut parfois atteindre un pic en raison d\u2019une maladie, d\u2019une infection ou du stress, m\u00eame si l\u2019affection est bien g\u00e9r\u00e9e. Ces pics ne ressortent pas automatiquement lors d\u2019un test sur 90 jours, comme le test HbA1C.\n[9] Le 26 septembre ainsi que les 13, 18 et 24 octobre 2005, la plaignante a consult\u00e9 de nouveau son m\u00e9decin, le Dr Van Jaarsveld. Apr\u00e8s la consultation du 24 octobre 2005, ce dernier a avis\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e par \u00e9crit que la plaignante ne pourrait pas travailler du 25 octobre au 30 novembre 2005 pour des raisons d\u2019ordre m\u00e9dical. Le Dr Van Jaarsveld a mentionn\u00e9 que la plaignante \u00e9tait une diab\u00e9tique nouvellement diagnostiqu\u00e9e et que, \u00e0 cause du stress qu\u2019elle subissait au travail, il lui \u00e9tait impossible de contr\u00f4ler sa glyc\u00e9mie. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible que cette p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9 soit prolong\u00e9e.\n[10] Du 25 octobre au 30 novembre 2005, la plaignante a pris un cong\u00e9 de maladie. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a embauch\u00e9 un coordonnateur en mati\u00e8re de retour au travail ind\u00e9pendant, Des Hathaway, pour aider la plaignante \u00e0 revenir au travail en servant de liaison entre cette derni\u00e8re, son m\u00e9decin et l\u2019intim\u00e9e, tant pendant son cong\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s son retour au travail. Des Hathaway a communiqu\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement avec la plaignante, son m\u00e9decin et l\u2019intim\u00e9e (par l\u2019entremise de Mme Ukrainec). Le 29 d\u00e9cembre 2005, Des Hathaway a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intention de l\u2019intim\u00e9e un bref rapport d\u2019une page dans lequel il a fait part de l\u2019avis du Dr Van Jaarsveld selon lequel la plaignante \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 retourner au travail sans restriction et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en mesure \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 de travailler pleinement, sans besoins sp\u00e9ciaux ou mesures d\u2019accommodement destin\u00e9s \u00e0 soutenir son r\u00e9tablissement et son retour au travail en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Le 30 novembre 2005, Des Hathaway a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Ann Ukrainec pour dire que la plaignante retournerait au travail le 1er d\u00e9cembre; cependant, \u00e0 cause de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 et du fait que son affection \u00e9tait impossible \u00e0 contr\u00f4ler, s\u2019il fallait qu\u2019elle se retrouve dans la m\u00eame situation que celle o\u00f9 elle se trouvait \u00e0 son d\u00e9part il y aurait un s\u00e9rieux risque que son affection s\u2019aggrave encore.\n[11] La plaignante est revenue au travail le 1er d\u00e9cembre 2005.\n[12] Le 14 mars 2006, le Dr Van Jaarsveld a \u00e9crit de nouveau \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour lui faire savoir que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce qu\u2019il avait compris, la plaignante subissait beaucoup de stress au travail. Il a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne semblait pas que la charge de travail avait une incidence sur son \u00e9tat. Il a \u00e9crit que le stress \u00e9tait un grave \u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u00e9clencheur pour la maladie dont elle souffrait et il recommandait vivement de muter la plaignante aux bureaux de l\u2019entreprise \u00e0 Brandon afin qu\u2019elle puisse \u00eatre proche de sa famille et de ses amis et b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier ainsi d\u2019un solide r\u00e9seau de soutien.\n[13] La sup\u00e9rieure de la plaignante, Ann Ukrainec, n\u2019a pas consenti au d\u00e9part \u00e0 ce que la plaignante soit mut\u00e9e aux bureaux de Brandon, mais, une fois que cette derni\u00e8re a obtenu l\u2019appui de son syndicat, la mutation a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e. Ann Ukrainec a donn\u00e9 son accord \u00e0 cette mesure \u00e0 la condition que la plaignante r\u00e8gle les sources de conflits potentiels de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle puisse appuyer avec succ\u00e8s le personnel des ventes dans le cadre d\u2019un travail d\u2019\u00e9quipe tr\u00e8s exigeant.\n[14] Vers le 13 avril 2006, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 mut\u00e9e de Steinbach \u00e0 Brandon; ces deux villes sont situ\u00e9es au Manitoba. Malgr\u00e9 la mutation, la plaignante a continu\u00e9 de travailler sous la supervision d\u2019Ann Ukrainec.\n[15] En 2005 et en 2006, dans ses \u00e9valuations du rendement, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet de commentaires d\u00e9favorables et de critiques de la part de sa sup\u00e9rieure, Ann Ukrainec.\n[16] Le 2 octobre 2006, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait l\u2019annonce d\u2019une importante initiative de r\u00e9duction des effectifs, dans le cadre de laquelle elle offrait aux employ\u00e9s membres de la TEAM un programme d\u2019encouragement \u00e0 la retraite volontaire (PERV). Ce programme permettait aux employ\u00e9s qui le voulaient de d\u00e9missionner en \u00e9change d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9.\n[17] Soixante-dix-sept employ\u00e9s de la TEAM ont offert volontairement de se pr\u00e9valoir du PERV, et l\u2019intim\u00e9e a accept\u00e9 soixante-treize offres.\n[18] Apr\u00e8s l\u2019initiative du PERV, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en raison de pressions exerc\u00e9es sur le march\u00e9, de continuer \u00e0 r\u00e9duire ses effectifs au Manitoba. L\u2019entreprise a cibl\u00e9 trente-cinq autres postes du service des ventes \u00e0 \u00e9liminer. Les dirigeants de ce service ont eu pour t\u00e2che de d\u00e9cider de quelle fa\u00e7on ils allaient r\u00e9duire le nombre de ses employ\u00e9s. Pour les postes de RRSC, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible d\u2019en \u00e9liminer jusqu\u2019\u00e0 trois sans que cela ait une incidence pr\u00e9judiciable sur le service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le. La r\u00e9gion de Brandon \u00e9tait sursouscrite, et elle comptait deux RRSC : la plaignante et Sharon Horner. MTS a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019une des deux serait licenci\u00e9e.\n[19] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 26.03.1 de la convention collective indique comment proc\u00e9der au licenciement d\u2019un employ\u00e9 qui occupe un poste \u00e0 plusieurs titulaires :\n[traduction] Dans le cas des postes \u00e0 plusieurs titulaires, s\u2019il n\u2019existe entre ces derniers aucune diff\u00e9rence sur le plan des comp\u00e9tences, des aptitudes, du rendement, des qualifications et du lieu de travail, le titulaire ayant le moins d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, selon la p\u00e9riode de service valid\u00e9e nette (PSVN), est le premier licenci\u00e9.\n[20] Dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits que les parties ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9, il est dit que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 26.03.1 de la convention collective exige que l\u2019on proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une comparaison des comp\u00e9tences, des aptitudes, du rendement, des qualifications et du lieu de travail des employ\u00e9s occupant un poste \u00e0 plusieurs titulaires. Un comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection (le comit\u00e9 de licenciement) form\u00e9 de membres non syndiqu\u00e9s, Brian Arnal, vice-pr\u00e9sident aux ventes, et Larry Goerzen, directeur des ventes, a eu pour t\u00e2che de choisir les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 licencier. Le comit\u00e9 de licenciement a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 le dossier personnel de la plaignante, lequel comprenait ses \u00e9valuations du rendement, et il en a fait de m\u00eame pour Sharon Horner. Il a compar\u00e9 les comp\u00e9tences, les aptitudes, les qualifications et le rendement des deux titulaires; il a \u00e9galement interrog\u00e9 leur gestionnaire imm\u00e9diat respectif qui, dans le cas de la plaignante, \u00e9tait Ann Ukrainec. Le comit\u00e9 de licenciement a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de licencier la plaignante et de conserver Sharon Horner, m\u00eame si la plaignante \u00e9tait l\u2019employ\u00e9e ayant le plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9. Il a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur le fait que le rendement de Sharon Horner \u00e9tait sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui de la plaignante.\n[21] Une fois que le comit\u00e9 de licenciement a tir\u00e9 sa conclusion, Don Rooney (directeur des relations de travail) a demand\u00e9 que Martin Shelest, qui, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, travaillait au service des ressources humaines de MTS, fasse une comparaison ind\u00e9pendante entre la plaignante et Mme Horner, sans en parler \u00e0 quiconque. M. Shelest a effectu\u00e9 cet examen et a fait savoir \u00e0 Don Rooney qu\u2019\u00e0 son avis, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 26.03.1 de la convention collective, il fallait licencier la plaignante avant Mme Horner.\n[22] Le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2007, la TEAM a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief pour le compte de la plaignante, all\u00e9guant que MTS avait enfreint l\u2019article 26 de la convention collective. Le fond du grief \u00e9tait que la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 licenci\u00e9e \u00e0 tort, en ce sens qu\u2019elle poss\u00e9dait des comp\u00e9tences, des aptitudes et des qualifications sup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 celles d\u2019au moins une autre employ\u00e9e qui n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 licenci\u00e9e et qui occupait un poste \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 celui de la plaignante.\n[23] La TEAM a renvoy\u00e9 le grief pour une audience d\u2019arbitrage. Le grief a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape pr\u00e9paratoire \u00e0 l\u2019audience, sans pr\u00e9judice aux droits que la LCDP conf\u00e9rait \u00e0 la plaignante.\nIII. Droit applicable et analyse [24] Il convient de mentionner au d\u00e9but de la pr\u00e9sente analyse que, durant l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a formul\u00e9 de nombreuses objections et la plaignante plusieurs autres. Certaines ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es par \u00e9crit, d\u2019autres l\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 de vive voix dans le cadre du dossier \u00e0 l\u2019audience, et d\u2019autres encore ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises \u00e0 r\u00e9flexion. Les objections soumises \u00e0 r\u00e9flexion ont toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es, et celles qui ont eu une incidence d\u00e9terminante sur l\u2019issue de l\u2019affaire sont analys\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re distincte dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. D\u2019autres objections, n\u2019ayant pas une incidence d\u00e9terminante sur l\u2019issue de la d\u00e9cision, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es en fonction de la valeur probante des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9s lors de la p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9flexion et elles ne sont pas analys\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re distincte dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, les objections ont toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9es et prises en consid\u00e9ration lors de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve soumis.\nA. La plaignante a \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination [25] Dans une instance engag\u00e9e devant le Tribunal, la partie plaignante doit \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Une preuve prima facie) \u00ab [\u2026] porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 \u00bb (Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Simpsons Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28). Pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une telle preuve, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que des consid\u00e9rations de nature discriminatoire soient le seul motif des actes en litige; il suffit que la discrimination ne soit qu\u2019un seul motif pour lequel l\u2019employeur a pos\u00e9 son geste ou pris sa d\u00e9cision (voir Holden c. Canadian National Railway Co. (1990), 112 N.R. 395 (C.A.F.), et Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Uzoaba, [1995] 2 C.F. 569). Cependant, les all\u00e9gations que formule la partie plaignante doivent \u00eatre cr\u00e9dibles pour qu\u2019il soit possible d\u2019\u00e9tayer la conclusion qu\u2019il existe une preuve prima facie (voir Dhanjal c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) (1997), 139 FTR 37 (C.F.)). Dans la d\u00e9cision Basi c. La Compagnie des Chemins de fer Nationaux du Canada (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029, au paragraphe 38481 (TCDP), le Tribunal a \u00e9crit :\nLa discrimination n\u2019est pas un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne qui se manifeste ouvertement, comme on serait port\u00e9 \u00e0 le croire. Il est rare en effet qu\u2019on puisse prouver par des preuves directes qu\u2019un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis intentionnellement.\n[26] Il faut donc qu\u2019un tribunal prenne en consid\u00e9ration la totalit\u00e9 des circonstances pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe de \u00ab subtiles odeurs de discrimination \u00bb. La jurisprudence reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il est difficile de prouver une all\u00e9gation de discrimination par une preuve directe.\n[27] Pour rendre une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 ce premier stade, le Tribunal doit se borner \u00e0 analyser les preuves testimoniales et documentaires que la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es, et faire abstraction des preuves que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fournies (voir Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204, au paragraphe 22 [Lincoln]). Essentiellement, toutefois, la plaignante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce doit \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien entre sa d\u00e9ficience et la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019a prise l\u2019employeur de la licencier (voir Roopnarine c. Banque de Montr\u00e9al, 2010 TCDP 5, au paragraphe 49).\n[28] Selon la plaignante, les sympt\u00f4mes de sa d\u00e9ficience ont eu une influence d\u00e9favorable sur son rendement au travail. L\u2019intim\u00e9e, m\u00eame si elle \u00e9tait au courant de cette d\u00e9ficience, a \u00e9valu\u00e9 son rendement de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9favorable dans ses \u00e9valuations du rendement, sans tenir compte des effets de sa d\u00e9ficience sur son rendement. La plaignante all\u00e8gue qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que ses \u00e9valuations du rendement ont servi \u00e0 comparer son rendement \u00e0 celui d\u2019une autre employ\u00e9e dans le but de d\u00e9cider laquelle serait licenci\u00e9e, sa d\u00e9ficience est un facteur qui a amen\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9cider de refuser de la garder \u00e0 son service. La plaignante all\u00e8gue \u00e9galement qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment cibl\u00e9e en vue du licenciement du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, elle soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9j\u00e0 cibl\u00e9 dans le pass\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s atteints d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience en vue d\u2019un licenciement et que, cela \u00e9tant, le fait de la licencier \u00e0 cause de son rendement \u00e9tait un pr\u00e9texte pour poser un geste discriminatoire. La plaignante all\u00e8gue sur ce fondement que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a viol\u00e9 l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP, dont le texte est le suivant :\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\n(a) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\n(b) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\n[29] La plaignante souffre d\u2019une maladie, le diab\u00e8te de type II. La d\u00e9ficience est au nombre des motifs de distinction illicite qui sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la LCDP, et elle est d\u00e9finie ainsi \u00e0 l\u2019article 25 : \u00ab [d]\u00e9ficience physique ou mentale, qu\u2019elle soit pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e [\u2026] \u00bb. \u00c9tant une d\u00e9ficience physique, le diab\u00e8te tombe donc sous le coup de cette d\u00e9finition. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, nul ne conteste que la plaignante souffre d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. La question en litige a plut\u00f4t trait au fait d\u2019\u00e9tablir un lien entre la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante et son licenciement. Autrement dit, cette d\u00e9ficience est-elle un facteur qui a influenc\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019a prise l\u2019intim\u00e9e de la licencier?\n[30] Quand le PERV a pris fin, l\u2019employeur a voulu comprimer encore plus ses effectifs et a entrepris un processus de licenciement con\u00e7u pour \u00e9liminer un poste \u00e0 Brandon, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 travaillait la plaignante apr\u00e8s sa mutation. Deux employ\u00e9es, la plaignante et Sharon Horner, occupaient un poste de RRSC, dont un a \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9 dans le cadre des mesures de licenciement.\n[31] Pour d\u00e9cider laquelle pouvait \u00eatre licenci\u00e9e \u00e0 Brandon, l\u2019employeur a pris en consid\u00e9ration les \u00e9valuations du rendement des deux titulaires afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y avait une diff\u00e9rence entre leur rendement respectif. La plaignante avait fait l\u2019objet de commentaires d\u00e9favorables dans ses \u00e9valuations du rendement de 2005 et de 2006, ce qui a eu une incidence n\u00e9gative sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement de la plaignante en vue de d\u00e9cider laquelle serait licenci\u00e9e.\n[32] D\u2019apr\u00e8s la plaignante, avant que l\u2019on diagnostique son \u00e9tat diab\u00e9tique, ses \u00e9valuations du rendement \u00e9taient favorables et les commentaires d\u00e9favorables qui figurent dans ses \u00e9valuations du rendement de 2005 et de 2006 sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience. Selon les rapports du m\u00e9decin de la plaignante qui figurent dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits, cette derni\u00e8re avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 contr\u00f4ler sa glyc\u00e9mie \u00e0 cause du stress, et cela l\u2019a amen\u00e9e \u00e0 prendre un cong\u00e9 de maladie du 25 octobre jusqu\u2019au 30 novembre 2005. Plus tard, le 16 mars 2006, le m\u00eame m\u00e9decin traitant, le Dr Van Jaarsveld, a \u00e9crit que le stress \u00e9tait un grave \u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u00e9clencheur dans le cas de la maladie dont souffrait la plaignante et que cette derni\u00e8re ressentait du stress au travail, surtout \u00e0 cause de sa sup\u00e9rieure. Les deux rapports m\u00e9dicaux font \u00e9tat des effets pr\u00e9judiciables du stress sur la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante et ils correspondent \u00e0 la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode dans laquelle ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9es les \u00e9valuations du rendement d\u00e9favorables. L\u2019argument que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a invoqu\u00e9, \u00e0 savoir que le m\u00e9decin n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin devant le Tribunal et qu\u2019il ne faudrait donc accorder aucun poids aux rapports m\u00e9dicaux, est sans fondement parce que ces rapports ont \u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9gr\u00e9s dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits et que le rapport dat\u00e9 du 16 mars 2006 a \u00e9galement servi de fondement \u00e0 la mutation de la plaignante \u00e0 Brandon.\n[33] Lori D. Berard, infirmi\u00e8re autoris\u00e9e (infirmi\u00e8re gestionnaire, Office r\u00e9gional de la sant\u00e9 de Winnipeg, Centre des sciences de la sant\u00e9 de Winnipeg, Groupe de recherche sur le diab\u00e8te, Personnel d\u00e9sign\u00e9, Universit\u00e9 du Manitoba, Service d\u2019endocrinologie de la Facult\u00e9 de m\u00e9decine) a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019experte devant le Tribunal au sujet de son opinion concernant l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de la plaignante et l\u2019effet qu\u2019il avait sur son rendement au travail. Mme Berard a \u00e9tabli un rapport \u00e0 la demande de la plaignante pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente instance; voici ce qu\u2019on peut y lire :\n[traduction] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que l\u2019apparition du diab\u00e8te n\u2019est pas imm\u00e9diate et radicale. Le diab\u00e8te de type 2 est souvent pr\u00e9sent lors des six \u00e0 neuf ans qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent le diagnostic.\nLe diagnostic du diab\u00e8te de type II peut \u00eatre une cause de stress, d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, de col\u00e8re, de culpabilit\u00e9 et de peur. Les patients peuvent passer par les stades de la perte (d\u00e9ni et isolement; col\u00e8re; n\u00e9gociation; d\u00e9pression et acceptation) tout en \u00e9tant encourag\u00e9s \u00e0 faire des changements propices \u00e0 de saines habitudes de vie, \u00e0 surveiller leur glyc\u00e9mie et \u00e0 commencer \u00e0 prendre des m\u00e9dicaments. Comme l\u2019indiquent les Lignes directrices de pratique clinique de 2008 de l\u2019Association canadienne du diab\u00e8te, dans le chapitre intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Aspects psychologiques du diab\u00e8te \u00bb : \u00ab [p]ratiquement tous les aspects de la prise en charge du diab\u00e8te et du contr\u00f4le de la glyc\u00e9mie qui en r\u00e9sulte sont associ\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u2019importantes exigences comportementales et \u00e0 des facteurs psychosociaux probl\u00e9matiques. Les probl\u00e8mes psychologiques li\u00e9s au diagnostic et\/ou aux exigences des soins auto-administr\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre divers, allant de l\u2019alt\u00e9ration de la qualit\u00e9 de vie \u00e0 des troubles d\u00e9pressifs et\/ou anxieux cliniquement significatifs. La section \u201cThe Vicious Symptom Cycle\u201d du document intitul\u00e9 \u201cLiving a Healthy Life with Chronic conditions\u201d comprend ce qui suit : maladie \u2013 muscles tendus \u2013 douleur \u2013 stress\/anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 \u2013 \u00e9motions difficiles \u2013 d\u00e9pression \u2013 fatigue [\u2026]. Facteurs d\u2019impact : le stress peut contribuer \u00e0 une \u00e9l\u00e9vation de la glyc\u00e9mie. Des choix d\u2019habitudes de vie malsaines, comme l\u2019ob\u00e9sit\u00e9, de mauvaises habitudes alimentaires et un manque d\u2019activit\u00e9 peuvent entra\u00eener une hausse de la glyc\u00e9mie \u00bb.\n[34] Selon Mme Berard, la plaignante a fait de s\u00e9rieux efforts pour am\u00e9liorer son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, au point de devenir une personne en tr\u00e8s bonne sant\u00e9. Cependant, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le stress peut contribuer \u00e0 une \u00e9l\u00e9vation de la glyc\u00e9mie, et a mentionn\u00e9 ceci :\n[traduction] Il est \u00e9tabli dans les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de stress lors de la phase initiale qui a suivi le diagnostic de diab\u00e8te et qu\u2019elle a eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 contr\u00f4ler sa glyc\u00e9mie, ce qui l\u2019a amen\u00e9e \u00e0 prendre un cong\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de 2005.\n[35] Mme Berard a examin\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement de la plaignante de 2005 et elle a fait les commentaires suivants :\n[traduction] Semble ne plus se concentrer sur le travail \u00e0 accomplir, difficult\u00e9 sur le plan des relations et de l\u2019\u00e9thique du travail; pourrait concorder avec un \u00e9tat psychologique alt\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 cause d\u2019un diab\u00e8te non contr\u00f4l\u00e9 et du stress caus\u00e9 par cette maladie.\n[36] Mme Berard a aussi analys\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement de 2006 de la plaignante :\n[traduction] Semble retrouver un peu d\u2019esprit d\u2019initiative face au travail \u00e0 accomplir \u2013 continue d\u2019avoir de la difficult\u00e9 avec le fait d\u2019\u00eatre dure et grossi\u00e8re, ce qui doit \u00eatre am\u00e9lior\u00e9 et cern\u00e9, et semble avoir des sautes d\u2019humeur qui la font passer de quelques journ\u00e9es sans probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 un d\u00e9sir de s\u2019isoler. Bien qu\u2019il semble que son diab\u00e8te soit bien g\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 ce stade-ci, il est possible qu\u2019elle ait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 faire face \u00e0 la situation et \u00e9prouve des sympt\u00f4mes de d\u00e9pression.\n[37] Il existe au moins trois moments dans le temps o\u00f9 les r\u00e9sultats ont montr\u00e9 que le taux de glucose dans le sang de la plaignante a atteint plus de 12 mmol\/L (valeur \u00e9lev\u00e9e) : le 19 ao\u00fbt 2005, le 7 septembre 2005 et le 26 septembre 2005. Un test HbA1C, pass\u00e9 le 13 octobre 2005, indique que la plaignante pr\u00e9sentait une glyc\u00e9mie \u00e9lev\u00e9e moyenne sur trois mois (de juillet \u00e0 octobre 2005). Il y aussi des indications que la plaignante pr\u00e9sentait une glyc\u00e9mie \u00e9lev\u00e9e et souffrait d\u2019un diab\u00e8te de type II non contr\u00f4l\u00e9 en date du 30 novembre 2005, m\u00eame si son affection avait \u00e9t\u00e9 diagnostiqu\u00e9e ant\u00e9rieurement et si elle suivait un traitement. Par\nailleurs, Mme Berard a mentionn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, m\u00eame si le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019un test HbA1C est normal, cela ne veut pas dire qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de variations quotidiennes dans le taux de glucose dans le sang, car ce type de test ne montrera pas les pics qui peuvent survenir dans une journ\u00e9e donn\u00e9e.\n[38] Je conclus que le m\u00e9decin traitant, qui a examin\u00e9 la plaignante et suivi l\u2019\u00e9volution de son \u00e9tat, et l\u2019experte, Lori Berard, ont tous deux \u00e9tabli que la plaignante \u00e9tait victime de stress et que ce facteur avait une incidence sur son taux de glucose dans le sang. Lori Berard a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les sympt\u00f4mes de l\u2019hyperglyc\u00e9mie comprennent la fatigue, un \u00e9tat psychologique alt\u00e9r\u00e9, dont de l\u2019agitation, une irritabilit\u00e9 inexpliqu\u00e9e, de l\u2019inattention, une l\u00e9thargie extr\u00eame ou de la confusion. Je conclus que l\u2019experte a pu d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien plus que probable entre le stress au travail qui avait une incidence sur le taux de glucose dans le sang de la plaignante et le comportement n\u00e9gatif de cette derni\u00e8re qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit dans les \u00e9valuations du rendement de 2005 et de 2006.\n[39] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 la plaignante se trouvait en cong\u00e9 de maladie sur l\u2019avis de son m\u00e9decin, Ann Ukrainec a \u00e9crit ce qui suit dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement de 2005 de la plaignante :\n[traduction] Objectif d\u2019examen de fin d\u2019ann\u00e9e : non atteint. Les communications avec l\u2019\u00e9quipe de Steinbach sont encore probl\u00e9matiques et les diff\u00e9rences n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en lumi\u00e8re parce que Heather trouve cela difficile, car elle ne voit aucun probl\u00e8me. Les rencontres individuelles avec les gestionnaires de comptes ne se sont pas poursuivies au cours du dernier trimestre comme l\u2019avait demand\u00e9 la gestionnaire imm\u00e9diate, ce qui ne fait que retarder les probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 r\u00e9gler.\n[40] Le 8 mars 2006, la plaignante s\u2019est entretenue avec Ann Ukrainec dans le cadre d\u2019une tentative pour s\u2019attaquer \u00e0 ses probl\u00e8mes de rendement et elle a donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 cette conversation en sugg\u00e9rant d\u2019apporter des changements \u00e0 ses \u00e9valuations du rendement dans un courriel envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 sa sup\u00e9rieure. La plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il fallait changer les commentaires inscrits dans les \u00e9valuations du rendement afin de tenir compte de ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9. Le courriel indique aussi que le manque de communication avec son \u00e9quipe imm\u00e9diate \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 sa maladie et au fait qu\u2019elle suivait les directives de son m\u00e9decin, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019elle devait amoindrir son stress pour am\u00e9liorer son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Ann Ukrainec a ajout\u00e9 seulement le commentaire suivant sur les rencontres individuelles; il appara\u00eet \u00e0 la neuvi\u00e8me et derni\u00e8re page de l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement de 2005, sans autre explication :\n[traduction] Heather a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 de maladie du 25 octobre au 2 d\u00e9cembre. Au d\u00e9but de 2005, Heather a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 le vif d\u00e9sir de faire un changement et de travailler dans un autre secteur qui, \u00e0 son avis, l\u2019aiderait \u00e0 se d\u00e9velopper et \u00e0 se tenir occup\u00e9e. Cela a dur\u00e9 jusqu\u2019au milieu de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 et, ensuite, la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de la perspective g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Heather s\u2019est transform\u00e9e en aversion et en une rupture de ses communications avec son \u00e9quipe imm\u00e9diate. A de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 communiquer avec son \u00e9quipe imm\u00e9diate, ne veut pas se retrouver dans un conflit quelconque pour faire part de ses sentiments profonds, ce qui aiderait les autres \u00e0 comprendre ce qui se passe avec les changements que l\u2019\u00e9quipe per\u00e7oit chez elle.\n[41] Cet \u00e9nonc\u00e9 concorde avec la fa\u00e7on dont la plaignante a d\u00e9crit ses relations avec son entourage apr\u00e8s que son m\u00e9decin eut recommand\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9vite les situations de stress, comme un conflit quelconque qui l\u2019obligerait \u00e0 faire part de ses sentiments profonds. Cela concorde aussi avec la fa\u00e7on dont la plaignante a d\u00e9crit les effets de son \u00e9tat \u00e0 la suite de son diagnostic et les raisons pour lesquelles elle a eu besoin de prendre cong\u00e9 du travail.\n[42] Pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existait un lien entre la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante et l\u2019\u00e9valuation de son rendement au travail, je n\u2019ai pas fond\u00e9 mes conclusions sur certains des arguments que la plaignante a invoqu\u00e9s au sujet de pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s \u00e9tats de d\u00e9pression, de la prise de m\u00e9dicaments et du cycle menstruel, et ce, pour deux raisons : ces faits \u00e9taient en litige et je n\u2019avais pas en main assez d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour tirer une conclusion sur eux. Mes conclusions concernant le lien entre la d\u00e9ficience et le rendement d\u00e9crit dans les \u00e9valuations du rendement de la plaignante reposent sur deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve importants :\n(1) les rapports m\u00e9dicaux du Dr Van Jaarsveld qui corroborent les informations qu\u2019a donn\u00e9es le t\u00e9moin expert de la plaignante \u00e0 propos de l\u2019effet n\u00e9gatif du stress sur le contr\u00f4le du taux de glucose dans le sang;\n(2) le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Lori Berard, qui \u00e9tait digne de foi, compte tenu surtout du fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019a jamais prononc\u00e9 de mots absolus tels que \u00ab toujours \u00bb et \u00ab jamais \u00bb, mais a plut\u00f4t employ\u00e9 des termes tels que \u00ab peut avoir caus\u00e9 ou concorde avec \u00bb. Elle a fait preuve de prudence et d\u2019objectivit\u00e9 et a sembl\u00e9 poss\u00e9der de vastes connaissances, non seulement sur la d\u00e9ficience et ses traitements, mais aussi sur les difficult\u00e9s auxquelles sont quotidiennement confront\u00e9es les personnes atteintes du diab\u00e8te de type II. De plus, elle poss\u00e8de une certaine expertise pour ce qui est d\u2019apprendre aux gens \u00e0 faire face \u00e0 ces probl\u00e8mes. Il est ressorti de la preuve produite par la plaignante qu\u2019il \u00e9tait plus que probable, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 elle a obtenu ses \u00e9valuations du rendement d\u00e9favorables, qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait victime de stress au travail, ce qui a aggrav\u00e9 son \u00e9tat diab\u00e9tique et provoqu\u00e9 ainsi des probl\u00e8mes de rendement.\n[43] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante \u2013 le diab\u00e8te de type II \u2013 a \u00e9t\u00e9 au moins l\u2019un des facteurs ayant contribu\u00e9 aux commentaires d\u00e9favorables qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits dans ses \u00e9valuations du rendement de 2005 et de 2006. En inscrivant des commentaires dans ces deux documents, la gestionnaire n\u2019a pas tenu compte de l\u2019effet de la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante sur son rendement. L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est servie des \u00e9valuations du rendement de 2005 et de 2006 pour comparer le rendement de la plaignante et celui de Sharon Horner en vue de d\u00e9cider laquelle serait licenci\u00e9e.\n[44] En ce qui concerne son all\u00e9gation selon laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment cibl\u00e9e en vue d\u2019un licenciement \u00e0 cause de sa d\u00e9ficience, la plaignante pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019apr\u00e8s sa mutation \u00e0 Brandon, Ann Ukrainec a continu\u00e9 de la surveiller. \u00c0 cet effet, elle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait qu\u2019Ann Ukrainec a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 un rapport concernant son rendement d\u00e9favorable et l\u2019a transmis \u00e0 Don Rooney le 9 novembre 2006. Ce rapport avait \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 par Larry Goerzen, juste apr\u00e8s que l\u2019intim\u00e9e eut annonc\u00e9 qu\u2019elle allait comprimer ses effectifs et juste apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu pour se pr\u00e9valoir du programme d\u2019encouragement \u00e0 la retraite volontaire. Le courriel comporte un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du point de vue d\u2019Ann Ukrainec sur les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de mauvais rendement et de probl\u00e8mes de communication de la plaignante. Ce rapport d\u00e9note peut-\u00eatre que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise pour cible en vue d\u2019un licenciement \u00e0 cause de son rendement, mais il n\u2019y est pas dit que sa d\u00e9ficience est le motif pour lequel elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9e. \u00c0 tout le moins, ce rapport \u00e9taye une fois de plus l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas tenu compte de l\u2019effet qu\u2019avait la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante sur son rendement.\n[45] La plaignante se fonde \u00e9galement sur le t\u00e9moignage de Larry Trach (directeur administratif au sein de la TEAM) \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son all\u00e9gation selon laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment cibl\u00e9e en vue d\u2019un licenciement du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience. M. Trach a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de la premi\u00e8re fois dans l\u2019histoire de MTS que cette entreprise proc\u00e9dait \u00e0 des licenciements apr\u00e8s avoir atteint avec succ\u00e8s ses objectifs de r\u00e9duction des effectifs dans le cadre d\u2019un PERV. Selon lui, ces licenciements \u00e9taient un acte de mauvaise foi parce que le syndicat avait convaincu certains des employ\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient sur le point de prendre leur retraite de se pr\u00e9valoir du PERV en vue de sauvegarder des emplois pour des employ\u00e9s plus jeunes. Au bout du compte, neuf membres additionnels de la TEAM ont \u00e9t\u00e9 licenci\u00e9s, dont la plaignante. M. Trach soutient qu\u2019\u00e0 cause de cela la TEAM s\u2019est sentie trahie. Il est bien possible que la TEAM ait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les licenciements effectu\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le PERV comme un acte de mauvaise foi, mais il n\u2019y a pas assez d\u2019indications dans le t\u00e9moignage de M. Trach que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise pour cible en vue d\u2019un licenciement du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience. L\u2019acte de mauvaise foi qu\u2019\u00e9voque M. Trach semble li\u00e9 aux relations de travail entre le syndicat et l\u2019employeur, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 une conduite discriminatoire de la part de l\u2019employeur.\n[46] M. Trach a \u00e9galement dit que, pour d\u00e9cider qui de la plaignante ou de Mme Horner serait licenci\u00e9e, c\u2019\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois que MTS comparait les comp\u00e9tences, les aptitudes, le rendement, les qualifications et le lieu de travail des titulaires. Selon lui, MTS avait pour habitude de licencier simplement l\u2019employ\u00e9 ayant le moins d\u2019anciennet\u00e9. C\u2019est ce que pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment l\u2019alin\u00e9a 26.03.1 de la convention collective. Cependant, comme les parties l\u2019ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits, c\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e0 la condition qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait pas de diff\u00e9rence entre les titulaires sur le plan des comp\u00e9tences, des aptitudes, du rendement, des qualifications et du lieu de travail. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, l\u2019employeur a conclu qu\u2019il y avait une diff\u00e9rence sur le plan du rendement entre les deux titulaires choisies pour \u00eatre licenci\u00e9es. Sans autres informations, je ne puis voir comment l\u2019employeur a cibl\u00e9 la plaignante en vue d\u2019un licenciement du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience juste parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas choisi la titulaire la moins ancienne.\n[47] Enfin, la plaignante pr\u00e9tend que MTS, \u00e0 la suite de son initiative de r\u00e9duction des effectifs, a embauch\u00e9 39 vendeurs de plus. Elle ajoute que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a form\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s au sein de l\u2019entreprise comme nouveaux RRSC environ un mois apr\u00e8s son licenciement et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9e, comme le pr\u00e9voit la disposition de rappel de la convention collective. Cependant, \u00e0 part cette all\u00e9gation, et sans limiter le genre de preuve que la plaignante aurait pu produire, peu d\u2019informations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies sur la nature des 39 recrues, sinon que l\u2019intim\u00e9e les a embauch\u00e9es pour travailler \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Manitoba, de m\u00eame que sur le fait de savoir si la plaignante aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre rappel\u00e9e ou sur celui de savoir si d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s ou, par-dessus tout, sur la mani\u00e8re dont la discrimination avait jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019employeur. L\u00e0 encore, sans la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment discriminatoire, la situation semble \u00eatre un probl\u00e8me de relations de travail entre le syndicat et l\u2019employeur, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019une question d\u2019acte discriminatoire. En d\u00e9finitive, je conclus que je n\u2019ai pas en main assez d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour corroborer cette all\u00e9gation au stade de la preuve prima facie.\n[48] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, la plaignante n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9e en vue d\u2019un licenciement du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience ou que la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019a prise l\u2019intim\u00e9e de licencier des employ\u00e9s \u00e9tait un pr\u00e9texte pour exercer de la discrimination. Cependant, la plaignante a \u00e9tabli prima facie que sa d\u00e9ficience a eu une incidence sur son rendement au travail et que l\u2019intim\u00e9e, bien qu\u2019\u00e9tant au courant de sa d\u00e9ficience, n\u2019a pas tenu compte des effets de sa d\u00e9ficience au moment d\u2019\u00e9valuer d\u00e9favorablement son rendement. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le rendement et l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement de la plaignante ont servi de fondement \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a prise de la licencier, il existe un lien entre la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante et la perte de son emploi. De ce fait, la plaignante a \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP, car il semble que sa d\u00e9ficience ait jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019a prise l\u2019intim\u00e9e de refuser de la garder \u00e0 son service.\nB. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que la conduite discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue n\u2019a pas eu lieu de la mani\u00e8re all\u00e9gu\u00e9e ou n\u2019\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire [49] Une fois que l\u2019on a \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a la possibilit\u00e9 de montrer que la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e discrimination n\u2019a pas eu lieu de la mani\u00e8re all\u00e9gu\u00e9e ou qu\u2019elle ne constituait pas un acte discriminatoire au sens de la LCDP (voir Maillet c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 TCDP 48, au paragraphe 4; et l\u2019article 15 de la LCDP).\n[50] L\u2019intim\u00e9e est d\u2019avis que la conduite discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue n\u2019a pas eu lieu de la mani\u00e8re all\u00e9gu\u00e9e. Elle soutient que les sympt\u00f4mes associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience dont souffre la plaignante n\u2019ont pas eu d\u2019incidence sur son rendement au travail ni sur ses \u00e9valuations du rendement. Selon elle, les \u00e9valuations du rendement de la plaignante font \u00e9tat d\u2019ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de probl\u00e8mes de rendement au travail qui ne sont pas li\u00e9s aux sympt\u00f4mes de son \u00e9tat diab\u00e9tique. Elle soutient donc qu\u2019elle a \u00e9valu\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re juste la plaignante dans le cadre du processus de licenciement et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e de licencier la plaignante \u00e0 cause du rendement sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019autre titulaire que l\u2019on envisageait de licencier.\nLa preuve d\u2019expert\n[51] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que les sympt\u00f4mes li\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante n\u2019ont pas eu d\u2019incidence sur son rendement. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de cet argument et en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la preuve d\u2019expert sur le diab\u00e8te de type II et ses sympt\u00f4mes que Mme Berard a fournie, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait compara\u00eetre la Dre Elizabeth Salamon, M.D., F.R.C.P. (C), endocrinologue.\n[52] La Dre Salamon a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, chez n\u2019importe qui, le taux de glucose dans le sang varie toute la journ\u00e9e. Le diab\u00e8te n\u2019est diagnostiqu\u00e9 que si le taux de glucose dans le sang est sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 11,2 mmol\/L. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que ces variations normales du taux de glucose dans le sang ne sont pas r\u00e9put\u00e9es causer le type de sympt\u00f4mes que l\u2019on a attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 la plaignante.\n[53] La Dre Elizabeth Salamon a souscrit aux informations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales que Mme Berard a fournies sur le diab\u00e8te. Cependant, dans le rapport qu\u2019elle a \u00e9tabli pour le compte de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en vue de la pr\u00e9sente audience, elle d\u00e9clare que les sautes d\u2019humeur, les probl\u00e8mes d\u2019attitude et la mauvaise \u00e9thique du travail ne sont pas des sympt\u00f4mes de l\u2019hyperglyc\u00e9mie. Selon elle, bien qu\u2019il soit possible de normaliser en quelques minutes le taux de glucose dans le sang, il peut y avoir des sympt\u00f4mes diff\u00e9rents qui peuvent prendre des heures, voire des jours, \u00e0 se r\u00e9gler. Comme\nelle l\u2019\u00e9crit : [traduction] \u00ab Une fois que le taux de glucose dans le sang s\u2019est stabilis\u00e9 dans la plage normale, il n\u2019y a souvent aucun sympt\u00f4me d\u2019hyperglyc\u00e9mie. Un taux de glucose dans le sang qui se situe syst\u00e9matiquement dans la plage normale ne devrait pas provoquer de tels sympt\u00f4mes. \u00bb\n[54] Selon la Dre Salamon, le dossier m\u00e9dical fourni d\u00e9bute par la consultation qu\u2019a faite Mme Grant \u00e0 la salle d\u2019urgence apr\u00e8s ses visites chez le m\u00e9decin en septembre 2005. Il n\u2019y a aucune information sur son \u00e9tat avant cette date-l\u00e0. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le dossier m\u00e9dical fourni, il est impossible de d\u00e9terminer si la plaignante pr\u00e9sentait des sympt\u00f4mes diab\u00e9tiques avant son diagnostic. Elle mentionne que la plaignante a pu avoir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des sympt\u00f4mes en septembre, voire en ao\u00fbt 2005. Elle mentionne \u00e9galement dans son rapport que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 fort probablement asymptomatique au cours d\u2019une partie des mois d\u2019octobre, novembre et d\u00e9cembre 2005. Elle constate qu\u2019il y a en septembre 2005 des taux \u00e9lev\u00e9s de glucose dans le sang qui sont sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 12; le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019un test HbA1C effectu\u00e9 en octobre 2005 est \u00e9lev\u00e9, ce qui d\u00e9note qu\u2019il y a eu des taux \u00e9lev\u00e9s de glucose dans le sang pendant les trois mois ant\u00e9rieurs. Le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019un autre test HbA1C effectu\u00e9 le 6 janvier 2006, de 6,2 %, \u00e9tait normal, ce qui d\u00e9note que la majeure partie des taux de glucose dans le sang au cours des trois mois ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 janvier \u00e9taient normaux. Elle mentionne aussi que les taux autod\u00e9clar\u00e9s de glucose dans le sang de la plaignante se situaient dans la plage normale ou quasi normale le 12 janvier 2006, ainsi qu\u2019il est indiqu\u00e9 dans le dossier et comme l\u2019a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 Mme Berard.\n[55] Quant \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 que le taux de glucose dans le sang de la plaignante ait connu des pics, la Dre Salamon mentionne dans son second rapport (\u00e0 la suite d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de questions pos\u00e9es par la plaignante \u00e0 son experte, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9 que certaines des questions ne figuraient pas dans le rapport d\u2019expert. Le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019experte de la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9, mais il est rest\u00e9 sous serment. La plaignante a produit un rapport modifi\u00e9; la Dre Salamon a examin\u00e9 ce document et fait part de ses r\u00e9ponses dans un second rapport, avant son t\u00e9moignage et avant le contre-interrogatoire de l\u2019experte de la plaignante) : [traduction] \u00ab L\u2019examen que j\u2019ai fait du dossier m\u00e9dical de Mme Grant ne pr\u00e9sente aucun \u201cpic\u201d du taux de glucose dans le sang.\nCependant, lorsqu\u2019elle s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la salle d\u2019urgence, on a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9sentait un taux \u00e9lev\u00e9 de glucose dans le sang, mais ce taux est le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que l\u2019on note dans le dossier fourni \u00bb.\n[56] La Dre Salamon a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019un employeur peut prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement dans le cas d\u2019un employ\u00e9 atteint du diab\u00e8te : [traduction] \u00ab accorder \u00e0 cet employ\u00e9 du temps pour consulter un m\u00e9decin et se rendre \u00e0 d\u2019autres rendez-vous aupr\u00e8s d\u2019une \u00e9quipe de soins de sant\u00e9, veiller \u00e0 ce que l\u2019employ\u00e9 puisse prendre des pauses-repas r\u00e9guli\u00e8res et limiter le travail par postes si possible ou, \u00e0 tout le moins, assurer un roulement raisonnable des heures de poste \u00bb. La Dre Salamon mentionne aussi : [traduction] \u00ab dans la mesure du possible, s\u2019assurer que le diab\u00e9tique n\u2019effectue pas d\u2019heures suppl\u00e9mentaires impr\u00e9vues et, dans la mesure du possible, lui permettre de vivre \u00e0 un endroit o\u00f9 des aides familiaux et professionnels externes sont disponibles si l\u2019on juge ces aides utiles. Ces mesures pourraient aider n\u2019importe qui \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer son taux de glucose dans le sang. \u00c0 la demande de la patiente et de son m\u00e9decin, MTS a bel et bien pris les dispositions n\u00e9cessaires pour qu\u2019elle soit mut\u00e9e \u00e0 un autre bureau o\u00f9 elle serait plus proche d\u2019aides familiales \u00bb.\n[57] D\u2019apr\u00e8s la Dre Salamon, les personnes atteintes du diab\u00e8te de type II peuvent accomplir tout ce qu\u2019elles veulent, et elle a donn\u00e9 de nombreux noms de personnes connues, comme des athl\u00e8tes, des chanteurs, des artistes et des politiciens, et a \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 diverses professions, comme des m\u00e9decins, des enseignants et des avocats. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 que ces personnes accomplissaient toutes tr\u00e8s bien leurs activit\u00e9s professionnelles. Ces r\u00e9ponses sur la fa\u00e7on dont vivent les gens atteints du diab\u00e8te de type II et sur les difficult\u00e9s auxquelles ils peuvent \u00eatre confront\u00e9s ne sont pas convaincantes. Je comprends ce qu\u2019elle a tent\u00e9 de faire valoir, que le fait d\u2019\u00eatre diab\u00e9tique n\u2019emp\u00eache pas de vivre pleinement sa vie, mais elle n\u2019a pas laiss\u00e9 entendre qu\u2019elle connaissait ces personnes ou leurs dossiers m\u00e9dicaux. M\u00eame si les personnes qu\u2019elle a mentionn\u00e9es peuvent accomplir bien des choses, nous n\u2019avons aucune information sur ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 quand leur \u00e9tat a \u00e9t\u00e9 diagnostiqu\u00e9, sur la fa\u00e7on dont elles g\u00e8rent le stress et sur l\u2019effet de ce stress sur leur \u00e9tat. M\u00eame la plaignante se rendait au travail, et n\u2019importe qui pourrait dire qu\u2019elle souffre du diab\u00e8te de type II, mais qu\u2019elle continue de travailler. Je suis d\u2019avis que les conclusions de la Dre Salamon \u00e0 propos de la mani\u00e8re dont vivent les personnes atteintes du diab\u00e8te de type II et des difficult\u00e9s auxquelles elles peuvent \u00eatre confront\u00e9es ne sont pas convaincantes et font abstraction des diff\u00e9rences individuelles qu\u2019il peut y avoir entre les personnes aux prises avec un \u00e9tat diab\u00e9tique. La Dre Salamon a elle-m\u00eame reconnu que, dans le cas du diab\u00e8te, tout est individualis\u00e9. Ces genres de r\u00e9ponses ne traitent pas non plus des effets psychologiques ou sociaux que le diab\u00e8te de type II peut avoir sur une personne souffrant de cette maladie.\n[58] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les \u00e9valuations du rendement de la plaignante, la Dre Salamon a ni\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait un lien quelconque entre le rendement au travail de la plaignante et les sympt\u00f4mes du diab\u00e8te de type II. Elle a conclu que la plaignante exer\u00e7ait un excellent contr\u00f4le sur son taux de glucose. Elle a signal\u00e9 que le Dr Van Jaarsveld avait qualifi\u00e9 la plaignante de [traduction] \u00ab diab\u00e9tique dont l\u2019\u00e9tat est bien contr\u00f4l\u00e9 \u00bb. En revanche, elle a exprim\u00e9 des opinions diff\u00e9rentes de celles du Dr Van Jaarsveld quant aux effets du stress sur l\u2019\u00e9tat de la plaignante, car elle n\u2019a trouv\u00e9 aucune mention pr\u00e9cise des sympt\u00f4mes dans le rapport. La Dre Salamon a reconnu avoir examin\u00e9 les documents m\u00e9dicaux fournis, mais elle n\u2019a pas discut\u00e9 avec le Dr Van Jaarsveld des rapports ou de l\u2019\u00e9tat de la plaignante. Elle croit que les probl\u00e8mes de communication et de relations que la plaignante avait au sein de son \u00e9quipe, ainsi que les commentaires d\u00e9favorables que cela a suscit\u00e9s dans ses \u00e9valuations du rendement, ne sont pas li\u00e9s \u00e0 des taux \u00e9lev\u00e9s de glucose dans le sang.\n[59] La Dre Salamon a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les \u00e9valuations relatives au mauvais rendement de la plaignante qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites dans les \u00e9valuations du rendement ont eu lieu quand le taux de glucose dans le sang \u00e9tait \u00e0 la fois \u00e9lev\u00e9 (comme l\u2019indique le r\u00e9sultat anormal de son test HbA1C) et normal (comme l\u2019indique le r\u00e9sultat normal de son test HbA1C). Les \u00e9valuations ne d\u00e9crivent pas un fait important que l\u2019on pourrait attribuer \u00e0 un pic glyc\u00e9mique isol\u00e9, mais plut\u00f4t des probl\u00e8mes de comportement r\u00e9currents qui, associ\u00e9s \u00e0 des pics glyc\u00e9miques, se seraient traduits par une aggravation du contr\u00f4le du taux de glucose. Cela ne se refl\u00e8te pas du tout dans l\u2019am\u00e9lioration de ses r\u00e9sultats au test HbA1C. Cela d\u00e9note que le taux de glucose dans le sang n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un facteur dans le mauvais rendement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9.\n[60] La Dre Salamon a mentionn\u00e9 que les notes du m\u00e9decin indiquent \u00e0 maintes reprises que la patiente est stress\u00e9e par son travail et au travail et que rien n\u2019est dit au sujet d\u2019autres sympt\u00f4mes ordinaires de l\u2019hyperglyc\u00e9mie. Elle a toutefois reconnu que le dossier m\u00e9dical indique qu\u2019en novembre 2005 l\u2019\u00e9tat de la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas contr\u00f4l\u00e9 et que son taux de glucose dans le sang \u00e9tait \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00e0 la m\u00eame \u00e9poque o\u00f9 elle subissait du stress. Cela nuance ce qu\u2019elle a \u00e9crit dans le rapport d\u2019expert qu\u2019elle a \u00e9tabli avant son t\u00e9moignage :\n[traduction] Bien que le dossier m\u00e9dical indique que Mme Grant a subi un stress d\u00e9crit comme un stress au travail lors des visites au bureau \u00e0 l\u2019automne de 2005, le r\u00e9sultat du test HbA1C de Mme Grant a continu\u00e9 de baisser, passant d\u2019un taux \u00e9lev\u00e9 de 8,6 % \u00e0 un taux normal ou quasi normal de 6,2 % au cours de la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode. Ce serait le contraire qui se passerait si le stress causait une \u00e9l\u00e9vation du taux de glucose dans le sang. Comme il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9vation correspondante des taux \u00e0 cause du stress :\ncela n\u2019aurait pas eu d\u2019effet sur son aptitude \u00e0 accomplir ses fonctions;\nil n\u2019y aurait pas de rapport avec le mauvais rendement indiqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement.\n[61] M\u00eame si son rapport indique que Mme Grant a pu avoir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des sympt\u00f4mes d\u2019hyperglyc\u00e9mie en septembre et peut-\u00eatre en ao\u00fbt 2005, la Dre Salamon a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune information m\u00e9dicale ne permet de d\u00e9terminer si la plaignante pr\u00e9sentait des sympt\u00f4mes avant le mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2005. Cependant, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aussi que le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019un test HbA1C effectu\u00e9 en octobre 2005 \u00e9tait \u00e9lev\u00e9, ce qui donne \u00e0 penser que le taux de glucose dans le sang avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 pendant les trois mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents. La p\u00e9riode de trois mois ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 octobre 2005 inclurait juillet 2005. C\u2019est en juillet 2005 que la plaignante a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 faire l\u2019objet de commentaires dans ses \u00e9valuations du rendement au sujet d\u2019une [traduction] \u00ab coupure \u00bb dans ses communications. La Dre Salamon a reconnu que lorsqu\u2019une personne ressent les sympt\u00f4mes d\u2019un taux \u00e9lev\u00e9 de glucose dans le sang, cette personne a souvent l\u2019impression de [traduction] \u00ab ne pas se sentir bien \u00bb et que cela peut avoir une incidence sur sa vie de tous les jours. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aussi que le fait de ne pas se sentir bien et celui de ne pas vouloir socialiser constituent un lien raisonnable; il faudrait toutefois que ce lien soit associ\u00e9 \u00e0 des taux \u00e9lev\u00e9s de glucose dans le sang. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ses patients ne lui d\u00e9crivent pas les sympt\u00f4mes en d\u00e9tail quand ils la consultent, mais qu\u2019ils d\u00e9crivent plut\u00f4t leur \u00e9tat en disant qu\u2019ils ne sentent pas bien. La Dre Salamon a plus tard d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que bien que la plaignante ait consult\u00e9 son m\u00e9decin traitant parce qu\u2019elle ne se sentait pas bien, rien n\u2019est dit dans le rapport au sujet des sympt\u00f4mes pr\u00e9cis qui sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019hyperglyc\u00e9mie.\n[62] Le rapport de la Dre Salamon indique qu\u2019il y a au moins trois moments dans le temps o\u00f9 le taux de glucose dans le sang de la plaignante est \u00e9lev\u00e9 et que, compte tenu du r\u00e9sultat du test HbA1C effectu\u00e9 en octobre 2005, il y a une indication que la plaignante pr\u00e9sentait \u00e9galement un taux \u00e9lev\u00e9 de glucose dans le sang en juillet 2005. Apr\u00e8s avoir pris en consid\u00e9ration la preuve de la Dre Salamon ainsi que celle de Mme Berard, je conclus qu\u2019une personne atteinte du diab\u00e8te de type II peut manifester des probl\u00e8mes communicationnels ou sociaux \u00e0 cause des sympt\u00f4mes de son \u00e9tat surtout lors des moments de stress, et que la plaignante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des taux \u00e9lev\u00e9s de glucose dans le sang \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 son employeur a mentionn\u00e9 que des probl\u00e8mes de communication avaient une incidence d\u00e9favorable sur son rendement.\nLes \u00e9valuations du rendement\n[63] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plaignante n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 licenci\u00e9e du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience, mais simplement \u00e0 cause de son mauvais rendement, comme en t\u00e9moignent ses \u00e9valuations du rendement qui, soutient l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ne sont nullement vici\u00e9s ou partiaux comme la plaignante veut le laisser croire.\n[64] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 toutes les \u00e9valuations du rendement de la plaignante de 1999 \u00e0 2006, lesquelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits. Comme l\u2019intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue que la plaignante a des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de mauvais rendement, et que ceux-ci ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 son licenciement, il est pertinent et essentiel d\u2019examiner le contenu de ces documents pour arriver \u00e0 une conclusion appropri\u00e9e.\n[65] Il ressort de la preuve que les \u00e9valuations du rendement qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en consid\u00e9ration au moment de la comparaison entre les deux titulaires en vue de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un licenciement \u00e9taient celles qui s\u2019appliquaient \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9tendant de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003 au milieu de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2006. Avant cette p\u00e9riode, il y a fort peu de commentaires sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 que la plaignante am\u00e9liore son rendement au travail. Les paragraphes qui suivent analysent plus en d\u00e9tail les \u00e9valuations du rendement de la plaignante qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies pour la p\u00e9riode allant de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003 au milieu de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2006.\n[66] Les commentaires que Mme Ukrainec a consign\u00e9s dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement de 2003 de la plaignante sont, en r\u00e9sum\u00e9, les suivants :\n[traduction] Heather est tr\u00e8s franche et assez confiante dans ses fonctions. Semble autosuffisante et en a fait la preuve en assumant la responsabilit\u00e9 de son ordinateur personnel quand il a fallu qu\u2019elle proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une mise \u00e0 niveau pour r\u00e9pondre aux exigences en mati\u00e8re de formation de son poste.\nS\u2019est adapt\u00e9e ais\u00e9ment aux changements, partage de plein gr\u00e9 ses connaissances et fait des changements assez facilement quand il le faut.\nAimerais voir une relation de travail plus solide entre elle-m\u00eame et son gestionnaire de compte imm\u00e9diat, car cela am\u00e9liorerait son milieu de travail au jour le jour.\n[67] M\u00eame s\u2019il ressort du dernier commentaire qu\u2019une relation plus solide entre la plaignante et son gestionnaire de compte aurait un effet b\u00e9n\u00e9fique sur son milieu de travail, dans l\u2019ensemble les commentaires sont positifs et ne d\u00e9notent pas l\u2019existence de probl\u00e8mes de rendement.\n[68] Les commentaires tir\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement de 2004 qui figurent dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits indiquent ceci :\n[traduction] Prend part aux r\u00e9unions et a fait savoir qu\u2019elle est en mesure de prendre du travail suppl\u00e9mentaire.

[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[75] Selon moi, ce commentaire est manifestement trompeur aux yeux de la personne qui lit l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement. La raison pour laquelle la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l\u2019une des rencontres individuelles \u00e9tait qu\u2019elle se trouvait en cong\u00e9 de maladie \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7u depuis peu son diagnostic de diab\u00e8te et qu\u2019elle avait besoin de stabiliser son \u00e9tat. Ann Ukrainec a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ne pas avoir inclus dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement le fait que la plaignante \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie entre le 25 octobre et le 2 d\u00e9cembre parce que les dossiers de sant\u00e9 \u00e9taient distincts des \u00e9valuations du rendement. Cette explication n\u2019est pas convaincante. Le fait de ne pas avoir mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019un cong\u00e9 de maladie \u00e9tait la raison pour laquelle la plaignante avait manqu\u00e9 l\u2019une des rencontres individuelles a une incidence d\u00e9favorable sur son rendement au travail. Pris hors contexte, le commentaire semble indiquer que la plaignante est insubordonn\u00e9e, ce qui n\u2019est pas le cas. Ainsi qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, apr\u00e8s une r\u00e9union avec le syndicat et la plaignante, Ann Ukrainec a convenu d\u2019indiquer dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement de 2005 que la plaignante \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie du 25 octobre au 2 d\u00e9cembre 2005. Cependant, aucun contexte n\u2019est mentionn\u00e9 au sujet des motifs de ce cong\u00e9 et du stress que subissait la plaignante; le cong\u00e9 de maladie n\u2019est pas non plus mentionn\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant la raison pour laquelle la plaignante a manqu\u00e9 les rencontres individuelles.\n[76] Ann Ukrainec a \u00e9crit le commentaire d\u00e9favorable qui suit dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation de fin d\u2019ann\u00e9e 2005 :\n[traduction] Le client Puratone est insatisfait du soutien de Heather et Loewen Windows trouve que Heather ne l\u2019appuie parfois pas; j\u2019ai pris l\u2019initiative de demander \u00e0 Loewen Windows de faire part de tout probl\u00e8me \u00e0 Winnipeg (gestionnaire imm\u00e9diate).\nLa plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 mise au courant de ce fait avant qu\u2019il soit consign\u00e9 dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement.\n[77] Sous la m\u00eame rubrique, Ann Ukrainec a \u00e9crit :\n[traduction] A form\u00e9 un client additionnel en d\u00e9cembre 2005, centre Penner Building.\nCela s\u2019est pass\u00e9 apr\u00e8s le retour de la plaignante de son cong\u00e9 de maladie.\n[78] Sous l\u2019objectif fix\u00e9 au milieu de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2005, on peut lire la mention : [traduction] \u00ab D\u00e9lais respect\u00e9s \u00bb.\n[79] L\u2019objectif fix\u00e9 pour la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2005 indique : [traduction] \u00ab Objectif non atteint \u00bb.

La complexit\u00e9 de notre travail et la charge de travail continueront d\u2019augmenter, ce qui exige que les ventes d\u2019entreprise soient dot\u00e9es de personnes tr\u00e8s performantes de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 pouvoir r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces besoins.

Je me concentrerai donc sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation semestrielle que comporte cette \u00e9valuation du rendement. La plaignante a accompli les quatre premiers mois de travail, de janvier \u00e0 avril, \u00e0 Steinbach, et elle a travaill\u00e9 ensuite \u00e0 Brandon. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, Ann Ukrainec a \u00e9crit les commentaires qui suivent :\n[traduction] Mut\u00e9e \u00e0 Brandon depuis mai 2006, Heather a \u00e9t\u00e9 extr\u00eamement occup\u00e9e \u00e0 aider \u00e0 prendre en charge trois gestionnaires de compte afin d\u2019aider les nouvelles recrues qui se sont jointes \u00e0 notre \u00e9quipe.

Elle semble avoir des sautes d\u2019humeur qui la font passer de quelques journ\u00e9es se passant bien, o\u00f9 elle ex\u00e9cute ses fonctions de mani\u00e8re acceptable, \u00e0 de nombreux jours o\u00f9 elle veut \u00eatre isol\u00e9e de l\u2019\u00e9quipe et de ceux avec lesquels elle doit travailler directement sur une base quotidienne.\nHeather est une personne qui est tout \u00e0 fait en mesure d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter les fonctions d\u2019un RSC mais, au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00e9coul\u00e9e, son rendement n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 constant et elle continue de montrer qu\u2019il existe une barri\u00e8re entre elle-m\u00eame et la plupart des membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipe. Cette derni\u00e8re a appris \u00e0 ressentir que cela prend trop de temps et d\u2019\u00e9nergie et cela a eu sur eux un effet n\u00e9gatif.\nM\u00eame si j\u2019ai fait l\u2019essai de rencontres individuelles pour engager la discussion avec Heather sur n\u2019importe quel sujet dont elle voudrait parler, elle reste isol\u00e9e et ne r\u00e9pond que de mani\u00e8re succincte aux questions qui lui sont pos\u00e9es.\nJe recommanderais que Heather continue de recevoir une aide professionnelle externe qui la ferait parler de ce qu\u2019il faudrait faire pour faire partie d\u2019une \u00e9quipe, car elle ne semble pas vouloir s\u2019exprimer de mani\u00e8re ouverte et honn\u00eate avec son \u00e9quipe imm\u00e9diate dans les r\u00e9gions.\n[97] Comme preuve d\u2019autres probl\u00e8mes de communication avec les membres de son \u00e9quipe, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait valoir aussi que la plaignante a eu des difficult\u00e9s avec Rob Lagemodi\u00e8re, un coll\u00e8gue de travail que l\u2019on n\u2019a pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 ajouter \u00e0 la liste des t\u00e9moins apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience (voir Heather Lynn Grant c. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2011 TCDP 1). Je conclus, en me fondant sur les t\u00e9moignages des deux parties, que le probl\u00e8me existait entre ces deux personnes. Par ailleurs, ce probl\u00e8me n\u2019est pas suffisant pour conclure que les commentaires n\u00e9gatifs faits dans les \u00e9valuations du rendement de 2005 et de 2006 de la plaignante d\u00e9notaient l\u2019existence d\u2019un probl\u00e8me constant de rendement ou de communication. Je ne suis pas d\u2019avis\nqu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment important dans la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. S\u2019il l\u2019\u00e9tait, cela aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 un aspect important dont il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 question dans les \u00e9valuations du rendement ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 celles de 2005-2006.\n[98] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement soumis au tribunal le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019Ann Ukrainec. Celle-ci, selon elle, a eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir de la plaignante des informations sur les probl\u00e8mes au travail. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la plaignante ne donnait que des r\u00e9ponses succinctes aux questions pos\u00e9es et ne disait gu\u00e8re plus que : [traduction] \u00ab Je suppose qu\u2019il va falloir que je change \u00bb. Cependant, je conclus que cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas parce qu\u2019Ann Ukrainec ne comprenait pas la plaignante et que cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019avait pas l\u2019impression que des communications quelconques am\u00e9lioreraient les choses. Mme Ukrainec a admis avoir re\u00e7u et lu le courriel que Des Hathaway avait envoy\u00e9 le 30 novembre 2005, avant le retour au travail de la plaignante le 1er d\u00e9cembre 2005, m\u00eame si elle savait que si la plaignante revenait au travail dans la m\u00eame situation que celle o\u00f9 elle se trouvait \u00e0 son d\u00e9part, il y avait un grand risque que son \u00e9tat empire. Ann Ukrainec a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne pensait pas devoir faire preuve de retenue pour le r\u00e8glement des probl\u00e8mes de rendement de la plaignante. Selon elle, le comportement de la plaignante a chang\u00e9 et ses communications ont arr\u00eat\u00e9 quand on lui a refus\u00e9 un poste de consultante en communication d\u2019entreprise (CCE). Cependant, elle a plus tard d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin de la rupture des communications de la plaignante ainsi que de son changement de comportement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 son diagnostic a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli. M\u00eame si elle \u00e9tait au courant de l\u2019\u00e9tat de la plaignante et des changements de comportement que cet \u00e9tat occasionnait, et m\u00eame si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e des effets du stress sur son \u00e9tat, Mme Ukrainec n\u2019a pas cru que la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante avait une incidence sur son rendement; \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle croyait qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une excuse. Le fait que la plaignante ait d\u00fb solliciter l\u2019aide de son syndicat pour obtenir une mutation \u00e0 Brandon, apr\u00e8s que son m\u00e9decin eut recommand\u00e9 que cela soit fait \u00e0 titre de mesure d\u2019accommodement, illustre aussi le genre de compr\u00e9hension qu\u2019elle a eue de la part de son employeur. Avant la mutation, dans une lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante en date du 13 avril 2006 et incluse dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits, Ann Ukrainec a \u00e9crit :\n[traduction] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, la r\u00e9union avait pour objet de veiller \u00e0 ce que les parties soient toutes sur la m\u00eame longueur d\u2019onde quant aux d\u00e9tails entourant votre mutation ainsi qu\u2019aux attentes futures de l\u2019entreprise. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, votre mutation a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019avis m\u00e9dical de votre praticien de la sant\u00e9, de pair avec votre engagement \u00e0 r\u00e9gler proactivement les conflits potentiels d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui vous permettra de soutenir avec succ\u00e8s le personnel des ventes dans le cadre d\u2019un travail d\u2019\u00e9quipe stimulant. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, on vous a encourag\u00e9e \u2013 et vous vous \u00eates engag\u00e9e \u2013 \u00e0 communiquer ouvertement avec moi-m\u00eame, votre gestionnaire, en vue de g\u00e9rer dor\u00e9navant les conflits potentiels.\n\u00c0 cette fin, je suis heureuse que vous deveniez membre de l\u2019\u00e9quipe des ventes de Brandon et je vous souhaite tout le succ\u00e8s possible l\u00e0 o\u00f9 vous travaillerez.\n[99] Cela illustre que la mutation a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e davantage comme une faveur que comme une mesure d\u2019accommodement li\u00e9e \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante. M\u00eame si les circonstances de la mutation ne font pas partie du licenciement, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019elles en \u00e9tablissent le contexte et \u00e9tayent la pr\u00e9tention de la plaignante selon laquelle son employeur n\u2019a pas pris sa d\u00e9ficience au s\u00e9rieux. Ann Ukrainec a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne croyait pas que le contenu de la lettre de mutation causerait du stress \u00e0 la plaignante lorsqu\u2019elle a indiqu\u00e9 quelles \u00e9taient les attentes de l\u2019employeur apr\u00e8s la mutation.\n[100] Dans l\u2019ensemble et pour tous les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, de m\u00eame qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re ce dernier \u00e0 celui d\u2019Ann Ukrainec.\n[101] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait valoir aussi que la plaignante aurait d\u00fb d\u00e9poser un grief au sujet d\u2019un probl\u00e8me quelconque avec ses \u00e9valuations du rendement et que, comme elle ne l\u2019avait pas fait, il fallait en tirer une inf\u00e9rence d\u00e9favorable. Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 si l\u2019employeur pensait qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 stressant pour la plaignante de d\u00e9poser un grief au sujet du contenu de ses \u00e9valuations du rendement, Don Rooney (directeur des relations de travail chez MTS) a dit qu\u2019il ne comprenait pas pourquoi la plaignante aurait trouv\u00e9 stressant de d\u00e9poser un grief pour corriger une situation. M. Shelest (service des ressources humaines) a lui aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Selon lui, l\u2019employeur, lorsqu\u2019un gestionnaire l\u2019avisait qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 avait des probl\u00e8mes de rendement, \u00e9tablissait souvent un plan d\u2019action afin d\u2019aider cet employ\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir un meilleur rendement. Cependant, aucun plan d\u2019action n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli pour aider la plaignante \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer son rendement, pas plus que sa d\u00e9ficience n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en consid\u00e9ration \u00e0 ce stade. L\u00e0 encore, je suis d\u2019avis que les commentaires de M. Rooney ainsi que le fait qu\u2019aucun plan d\u2019action n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli \u00e9tayent la pr\u00e9tention de la plaignante, \u00e0 savoir que son employeur n\u2019a pas pris au s\u00e9rieux sa d\u00e9ficience au moment d\u2019examiner ses probl\u00e8mes de rendement au travail.\n[102] En me fondant sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j\u2019arrive apr\u00e8s avoir lu les \u00e9valuations du rendement ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 2005 est que la plaignante n\u2019avait pas de probl\u00e8mes de rendement. Bien qu\u2019il soit indiqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement de 2004 qu\u2019il fallait que la plaignante s\u2019am\u00e9liore un peu dans ses communications avec autrui, rien ne semble suffisamment important pour amener \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019elle avait eu dans le pass\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes de communication avec des membres de son \u00e9quipe. Des probl\u00e8mes de communication sont devenus plus \u00e9vidents dans les \u00e9valuations du rendement de 2005 et de 2006, mais ils co\u00efncident avec le diagnostic de la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante ainsi qu\u2019avec les efforts que celle-ci a faits pour amoindrir l\u2019effet du stress sur son \u00e9tat. La plaignante a tent\u00e9 de r\u00e9gler ces probl\u00e8mes avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e et de faire changer ses \u00e9valuations du rendement, mais sa d\u00e9ficience n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un facteur qui influen\u00e7ait son rendement.\n[103] La LCDP a pour objet de donner effet au principe suivant :\nle droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\n(Article 2 de la LCDP)\n[104] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, de pair avec ce principe, la Convention des Nations Unies relative aux droits des personnes handicap\u00e9es, adopt\u00e9e le 13 d\u00e9cembre 2006 lors de la soixante et uni\u00e8me s\u00e9ance de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale par la r\u00e9solution A\/RES\/61\/106 sign\u00e9e par le Canada le 30 mars 2007 et ratifi\u00e9e par lui le 11 mars 2010, indique, \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a h) de son pr\u00e9ambule :\nReconnaissant \u00e9galement que toute discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le handicap est une n\u00e9gation de la dignit\u00e9 et de la valeur inh\u00e9rentes \u00e0 la personne humaine.\n[105] Dans le contexte de l\u2019emploi, pour garantir que les employ\u00e9s b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient tous de chances \u00e9gales \u00e0 celles des autres employ\u00e9s, un employeur est tenu de prendre des mesures raisonnables, sans s\u2019imposer de contrainte excessive, pour composer avec les besoins d\u2019un employ\u00e9 (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Central Okanagan School District No 23 c.

Pour examiner si un employeur s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 de son obligation d\u2019accommodement envers un employ\u00e9, \u00ab il peut souvent se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler utile, en pratique, d\u2019examiner s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, d\u2019abord, la proc\u00e9dure, s\u2019il en est, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e pour \u00e9tudier la question de l\u2019accommodement \u00bb (Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c.

Les mesures de redressement [108] Les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leurs conclusions finales par \u00e9crit, j\u2019ai r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit de poser des questions additionnelles qui pourraient d\u00e9couler de leurs observations et je traiterai de cette affaire dans le cadre de chacune des mesures de redressement demand\u00e9es qui n\u00e9cessitent de plus amples \u00e9claircissements.\n[109] Lorsqu\u2019une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP est jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, le Tribunal a le pouvoir r\u00e9parateur de rendre une ordonnance en vertu des paragraphes 53(2), (3) et (4) de la LCDP.\n[110] L\u2019objet de la LCDP est de nature r\u00e9paratrice et \u00ab [\u2026] ne vise pas \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la faute ni \u00e0 punir une conduite \u00bb (Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84, au paragraphe 13 [Robichaud]). L\u2019objet premier de la loi consiste plut\u00f4t \u00e0 \u00ab [\u2026] d\u00e9celer les actes discriminatoires et \u00e0 les supprimer \u00bb (Robichaud, au paragraphe 13). Le Tribunal est saisi de litiges complexes et \u00e9motifs, ce qui exige qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab fasse preuve d\u2019innovation et de souplesse pour mettre au point des mesures de redressement efficaces, et la Loi est structur\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 favoriser cette souplesse \u00bb (Grover c. Canada (Conseil national de recherches \u2013 CNR) (1994), 80 F.T.R. 256 (C.F. 1re inst.)). Bien que le Tribunal b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie en vertu de l\u2019article 53 d\u2019une certaine souplesse et d\u2019un certain pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en mati\u00e8re de redressement, ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire n\u2019est pas sans limites. Dans le contexte d\u2019une analyse de la limite impos\u00e9e \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019indemniser en vertu de la LCDP, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 268 [Chopra] :\nLa premi\u00e8re limite a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue unanimement par les membres formant la Cour dans Morgan : il doit exister un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre l\u2019acte discriminatoire et la perte all\u00e9gu\u00e9e. La deuxi\u00e8me limite, consacr\u00e9e par la Loi m\u00eame, consiste dans le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner l\u2019indemnisation de la totalit\u00e9 ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte discriminatoire. L\u2019exercice de ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire doit ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 des principes.\n(Chopra, au paragraphe 37)\n[111] Pour dire les choses de fa\u00e7on plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale :\n[\u2026] les ordonnances de redressement doivent \u00eatre li\u00e9es au litige ou au sujet de la plainte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e : le \u00ab cadre de la plainte \u00bb ou le \u00ab sujet r\u00e9el \u00bb. Le redressement doit \u00eatre \u00e9gal \u00e0 l\u2019acte discriminatoire. Les ordonnances doivent aussi \u00eatre raisonnables et le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en mati\u00e8re de redressement doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 en fonction de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e.\n(Hughes c. \u00c9lections Canada, 2010 TCDP 4 [Hughes], au par. 50)\n[112] Pour ce qui est de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des ordonnances de redressement, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne ou d\u2019autres parties peuvent y prendre part sur le plan de la consultation ou de la surveillance. La participation d\u2019autres acteurs d\u00e9montre que le Tribunal a un r\u00f4le juridictionnel \u00e0 jouer qui se traduit mal dans les aspects techniques ou sp\u00e9cifiques de l\u2019application d\u2019une ordonnance, qui affecte souvent le fonctionnement au jour le jour d\u2019un gouvernement intim\u00e9 ou d\u2019une entreprise intim\u00e9e (voir Hugues, au paragraphe 51). Compte tenu de ces principes, voici mes motifs concernant le redressement de la discrimination exerc\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 de la TEAM\n[113] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a tent\u00e9 de faire ajouter la TEAM en tant que partie intim\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire au motif qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait solidairement responsable de tout acte discriminatoire. Le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, mais a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il lui \u00e9tait loisible de faire valoir dans ses observations la responsabilit\u00e9 solidaire de la TEAM (voir Heather Lynn Grant c. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2010 TCDP 26). Se fondant sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Renaud, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la TEAM est solidairement responsable de tout acte discriminatoire r\u00e9sultant de l\u2019administration et de l\u2019application de bonne foi de la convention collective. Cependant, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019acte discriminatoire ne r\u00e9sulte pas de l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 26.03.1 de la convention collective; la conclusion de l\u2019existence d\u2019une discrimination a trait \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9valu\u00e9 le rendement de la plaignante et au r\u00f4le que ces \u00e9valuations ont jou\u00e9 dans son licenciement. La TEAM n\u2019est pas intervenue dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement de la plaignante et on n\u2019a pas produit assez de preuves pour donner \u00e0 penser que la TEAM a \u00e9t\u00e9 partie \u00e0 l\u2019acte discriminatoire. Cela \u00e9tant, rien ne permet de tenir la TEAM solidairement responsable de la discrimination exerc\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nL\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral\n[114] La plaignante demande la somme de 20 000 $ pour le pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019elle a subi par suite de l\u2019acte discriminatoire, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP. Elle soutient qu\u2019il convient de lui accorder le montant maximal pr\u00e9vu par cette disposition parce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a manifestement fait montre d\u2019un manque d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat et de compr\u00e9hension \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa situation. Elle a v\u00e9cu beaucoup de stress, tant pendant la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant la fin de son emploi aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qu\u2019au cours de la poursuite de la pr\u00e9sente plainte relative aux droits de la personne. Enfin, elle dit qu\u2019elle a droit au montant maximal \u00e0 cause de la mani\u00e8re trompeuse dont l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de la licencier et a produit des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de la plainte.\n[115] Quand une personne subit un pr\u00e9judice moral, aucune somme d\u2019argent ne peut l\u2019effacer. Le pr\u00e9judice moral li\u00e9 \u00e0 un acte discriminatoire est de nature subjective et il varie d\u2019une personne \u00e0 une autre. Les cicatrices psychologiques sont parfois longues \u00e0 gu\u00e9rir et peuvent se r\u00e9percuter sur l\u2019estime de soi. Du point de vue de la personne victime d\u2019un acte discriminatoire, il y a lieu d\u2019accorder d\u2019importantes sommes d\u2019argent pour tenir compte de ce que cette personne a subi ainsi que pour rendre justice. Cela dit, lorsqu\u2019une preuve \u00e9tablit l\u2019existence d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice moral, il faut tenter de l\u2019indemniser (voir Cruden c. Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement international et Sant\u00e9 Canada, 2011 TCDP 13, au paragraphe 170). Cependant, 20 000 $ est le montant maximal que le Tribunal peut accorder en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) et il ne le fait que dans les cas les plus flagrants.\n[116] Selon la preuve m\u00e9dicale contenue dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits et le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante, cette derni\u00e8re a bel et bien souffert d\u2019un stress li\u00e9 \u00e0 la discrimination qu\u2019elle a subie. Son employeur a \u00e9valu\u00e9 son rendement de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 un moment o\u00f9 elle avait besoin de compr\u00e9hension et de mesures d\u2019accommodement de sa part. Il lui a fallu plut\u00f4t se tourner vers son syndicat pour obtenir de l\u2019aide.\n[117] De ce fait, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de payer la somme de 10 000 $ au titre du pr\u00e9judice moral que la plaignante a subi par suite de son licenciement.\nL\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019un acte discriminatoire de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e\n[118] La plaignante souhaite obtenir de l\u2019intim\u00e9e une indemnit\u00e9 d\u2019un montant de 20 000 $, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP. Elle sollicite le montant maximal que pr\u00e9voit cette disposition parce qu\u2019elle veut que le Tribunal fasse clairement comprendre que l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est comport\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re compl\u00e8tement inappropri\u00e9e.\n[119] L\u2019objectif de la LCDP est de rem\u00e9dier aux actes discriminatoires, et non pas de les punir (Robichaud, au paragraphe 13). L\u2019existence d\u2019un acte discriminatoire d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 est subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00ab [\u2026] une intention ou un comportement [\u2026] d\u00e9nu\u00e9 de prudence, ou encore, un m\u00e9pris des cons\u00e9quences de ce comportement \u00bb (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Collins, 2011 CF 1168, au paragraphe 33). L\u00e0 encore, l\u2019octroi du montant maximal que pr\u00e9voit cette disposition est \u00e0 r\u00e9server aux cas les plus graves.\n[120] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9 dans l\u2019analyse portant sur la preuve prima facie de la plaignante, il n\u2019y a pas eu assez de preuves pour indiquer que cette derni\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9e en vue d\u2019un licenciement du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience ou que l\u2019intim\u00e9e entendait agir de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire \u00e0 son endroit. Cependant, m\u00eame si elle \u00e9tait au courant de la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re suffisante les effets que cette d\u00e9ficience avait sur sa conduite au travail au moment d\u2019\u00e9valuer son rendement. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas non plus tenu compte des commentaires que la plaignante a faits en r\u00e9ponse aux \u00e9valuations du rendement d\u00e9favorables. Essentiellement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab d\u00e9nu\u00e9[e] de prudence \u00bb relativement \u00e0 l\u2019obligation qu\u2019elle avait d\u2019envisager au moins de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement en faveur de la plaignante. Compte tenu de toutes les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal accorde \u00e0 Mme Grant la somme de 10 000 $ sous cette rubrique.\nLa r\u00e9int\u00e9gration et la perte de salaire\n[121] La plaignante sollicite :\n(1) la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration dans ses fonctions au m\u00eame endroit ou \u00e0 un poste cot\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e9quivalente au m\u00eame endroit;\n(2) une indemnit\u00e9 au titre du salaire perdu, des cotisations de retraite perdues, des prestations perdues dans le cadre du r\u00e9gime d\u2019actionnariat des employ\u00e9s, des prestations perdues dans le cadre du r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration variable, ainsi que des primes perdues relativement aux ventes de groupe;\n(3) le r\u00e9tablissement de sa p\u00e9riode de service valid\u00e9e nette et de la pension connexe (y compris les cotisations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e entre la date du licenciement et la date de la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration).\n[122] L\u2019objectif vis\u00e9 dans ce cas-ci est de remettre le plus possible la plaignante dans la situation o\u00f9 elle se serait trouv\u00e9e si l\u2019acte discriminatoire n\u2019avait pas eu lieu. Je demeurerai saisie du dossier et donnerai aux parties l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter des observations sur la fa\u00e7on dont elles souhaitent traiter de cette mesure de redressement particuli\u00e8re et complexe.\nLes dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats sp\u00e9ciaux\n[123] La plaignante sollicite des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats sp\u00e9ciaux pour les d\u00e9penses qu\u2019elle a support\u00e9es, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, j\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 que je demeurerais saisie du dossier au cas o\u00f9 une question se poserait \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019audience ou apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9ception des observations \u00e9crites des parties; je reporterai donc ma d\u00e9cision sous cette rubrique jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 les parties auront pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations additionnelles sur les mesures de redressement qui n\u00e9cessitent des \u00e9claircissements.\nLes d\u00e9pens\n[124] Avant que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada rende sa d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CSC 53, la plaignante a fait valoir qu\u2019elle voulait pr\u00e9senter des observations sur la question des d\u00e9pens si sa plainte \u00e9tait accueillie. Depuis que la Cour supr\u00eame a rendu sa d\u00e9cision, aucuns d\u00e9pens ne peuvent \u00eatre accord\u00e9s. Cela \u00e9tant, la plaignante peut pr\u00e9senter des observations sur ses frais ordinaires, mais non sur les d\u00e9pens. Je reporterai le prononc\u00e9 de ma d\u00e9cision sous cette rubrique jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 les parties auront pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations additionnelles sur les mesures de redressement qui n\u00e9cessitent des \u00e9claircissements.\nLes int\u00e9r\u00eats\n[125] La plaignante a demand\u00e9 des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur toute indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(4) de la LCDP. Je reporterai le prononc\u00e9 de ma d\u00e9cision sous cette rubrique jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 les parties auront pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations additionnelles sur les mesures de redressement qui n\u00e9cessitent des \u00e9claircissements.\nLa mesure de redressement visant l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public\n[126] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP, la plaignante sollicite \u00e9galement une ordonnance portant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e mette en \u0153uvre des mesures appropri\u00e9es, en consultation avec la Commission, destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes discriminatoires semblables. Je conclus que l\u2019intim\u00e9e manque de connaissances sur son obligation d\u2019accommodement. Il est ressorti de la preuve que, chez MTS, la direction ne conna\u00eet pas tr\u00e8s bien la LCDP et les obligations des employeurs \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. J\u2019ordonne donc \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de s\u2019efforcer, avec le concours de la Commission, de renseigner les membres de la haute direction, comme les directeurs et les chefs du service des relations de travail, sur l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement et la LCDP. L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019efforcera, avec le concours de la Commission, de veiller \u00e0 disposer d\u2019une politique appropri\u00e9e sur l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement et, sinon, elle en \u00e9tablira une ou modifiera sa politique actuelle. L\u2019intim\u00e9e consultera le syndicat dans le cadre de ce processus afin de tenir compte du point de vue des employ\u00e9s. Cette mesure de redressement doit \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nV. L\u2019ordonnance [127] Ayant conclu que la plainte dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est fond\u00e9e, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(2) de la LCDP, le Tribunal rend l\u2019ordonnance suivante :\n\u2022 L\u2019intim\u00e9e accordera \u00e0 la plaignante une indemnit\u00e9 d\u2019un montant de 10 000 $ au titre du pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019elle a subi par suite de l\u2019acte discriminatoire commis.\n\u2022 L\u2019intim\u00e9e accordera \u00e0 la plaignante une indemnit\u00e9 d\u2019un montant de 10 000 $ pour avoir commis l\u2019acte discriminatoire de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n\u2022 L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019efforcera, avec le concours de la Commission, de renseigner les membres de la haute direction, comme les directeurs et les chefs du service des relations de travail, sur l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement et la LCDP. L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019efforcera, avec le concours de la Commission, de veiller \u00e0 disposer d\u2019une politique appropri\u00e9e sur l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement et, sinon, elle en \u00e9tablira une ou modifiera sa politique actuelle. L\u2019intim\u00e9e consultera le syndicat dans le cadre de ce processus afin de tenir compte du point de vue des employ\u00e9s. Cette mesure de redressement sera ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n\u2022 Dans les deux semaines suivant la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, les parties feront part au Tribunal de leurs disponibilit\u00e9s en vue de la tenue d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique ou d\u2019une demi-journ\u00e9e d\u2019audience pour pr\u00e9senter des observations additionnelles et r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 toute question ou donner des \u00e9claircissements sur les mesures de redressement susmentionn\u00e9es. Les parties devront avoir en main tous les documents et renseignements pertinents dont elles auront besoin pour cette conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique ou cette audience.\n[128] Le Tribunal continuera de r\u00e9server sa comp\u00e9tence et demeurera saisi de l\u2019affaire jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 les parties auront pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leurs observations additionnelles sur les mesures de redressement accord\u00e9es et le Tribunal se sera prononc\u00e9 sur elles.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nJuge administrative\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 26 avril 2012\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal: T1452\/7809\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause: Heather Lynn Grant c.

La plainte [1] Le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2010, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi), la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) instruise trois plaintes distinctes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par Mme Leslie Palm (la plaignante) \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019International Longshore and Warehouse Union, section locale 500 (l\u2019ILWU, ou le syndicat), de M. Cliff Willicome et de M. Richard Wilkinson, respectivement (les trois sont appel\u00e9s les \u00ab intim\u00e9s \u00bb). La plaignante soutient que le syndicat a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit et l\u2019a harcel\u00e9e du fait de son sexe, ce qui est contraire aux articles 9, 10 et 14 de la Loi. Elle soutient par ailleurs que MM. Willicome et Wilkinson l\u2019ont harcel\u00e9e du fait de son sexe, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 14 de la Loi.\n[2] Dans sa plainte, la plaignante pr\u00e9tend que la conduite discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9e a port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 son bien-\u00eatre. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, elle a consult\u00e9 son m\u00e9decin de famille, qui lui a prescrit des m\u00e9dicaments pour contrer l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, la d\u00e9pression et le stress dont elle \u00e9tait victime du fait des actes discriminatoires commis. Par ailleurs, elle soutient avoir demand\u00e9 une aide additionnelle pour son \u00e9tat affectif par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire du programme d\u2019aide aux employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ILWU, et, pour cela, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 une psychologue agr\u00e9\u00e9e, Mme Joan Shultz. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la plaignante, Mme Shultz est en mesure de fournir des documents exposant le r\u00e9cit des faits qu\u2019elle a v\u00e9cus, ainsi que l\u2019effet de ces derniers sur son \u00e9tat affectif. La mesure de redressement que la plaignante souhaite obtenir du Tribunal comprend ce qui suit : 712,64 $ pour des m\u00e9dicaments, 56 029,15 $ pour la perte de salaire, 28 117,98 $ pour les services de consultants, ainsi que 20 000 $ pour le pr\u00e9judice moral subi. Dans la liste des documents pertinents qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses plaintes, la plaignante invoque un privil\u00e8ge \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des [traduction] \u00ab notes m\u00e9dicales \u00bb et des [traduction] \u00ab notes financi\u00e8res \u00bb.\nII. La requ\u00eate [3] Le 18 juillet et le 9 ao\u00fbt 2011, les intim\u00e9s ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des avis de requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019obtenir du Tribunal quatre ordonnances concernant la communication de documents :\n[traduction]\n1. une ordonnance du Tribunal portant que Mme Palm produise une liste de tous les sp\u00e9cialistes des soins de sant\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a consult\u00e9s pour ses sympt\u00f4mes ou son traitement de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, de la d\u00e9pression, du stress, de l\u2019insomnie ou de tout autre probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 dont elle impute la faute aux intim\u00e9s, et qu\u2019elle remette aux parties tous les documents m\u00e9dicaux cens\u00e9ment pertinents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession;\n2. un subp\u0153na duces tecum du Tribunal ordonnant \u00e0 chacun de ces sp\u00e9cialistes des soins de sant\u00e9 de remettre aux avocates des intim\u00e9s le contenu de l\u2019ensemble des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, des notes d\u2019\u00e9tude clinique, des avis, des rapports de consultation, des analyses, des r\u00e9sultats de test, des r\u00e9sultats d\u2019examen de laboratoire et tout autre renseignement, sous forme imprim\u00e9e ou \u00e9lectronique, que poss\u00e8dent ou que gardent ces sp\u00e9cialistes des soins de sant\u00e9 et qui ont cens\u00e9ment trait \u00e0 n\u2019importe quel sympt\u00f4me ou traitement de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, de la d\u00e9pression, du stress, de l\u2019insomnie ou de tout autre probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 dont fait \u00e9tat la plaignante par suite de l\u2019ordonnance susmentionn\u00e9e;\n3. que Mme Palm produise tous les documents qui sont cens\u00e9ment li\u00e9s \u00e0 ses demandes concernant la perte de salaire, les m\u00e9dicaments, les frais de consultants ou le pr\u00e9judice moral subi;\n4. que Mme Palm produise tous les documents qui sont cens\u00e9ment li\u00e9s aux plaintes initiales qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de la Commission \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du syndicat, de la British Columbia Maritime Employers Association et de Western Stevedoring.\n[4] Une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance a eu lieu le 8 d\u00e9cembre 2011 au sujet des requ\u00eates des intim\u00e9s. La plaignante a confirm\u00e9 n\u2019avoir jamais r\u00e9pondu par \u00e9crit \u00e0 ces requ\u00eates. En ce qui concerne la premi\u00e8re de leurs requ\u00eates, la plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 que le Dr Nahid Mehraein, Mme Joan Shultz et la Dre Kathryn Fung sont les sp\u00e9cialistes des soins de sant\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a consult\u00e9s pour ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9. Elle a \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9 que le Dr Mehraein produira un dossier m\u00e9dical concernant la p\u00e9riode allant du mois de janvier 2008 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2009, mais elle a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il se pouvait qu\u2019elle ait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir ses dossiers des autres sp\u00e9cialistes mentionn\u00e9s et qu\u2019une ordonnance du Tribunal serait peut-\u00eatre utile \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Tant la plaignante que la Commission ont exprim\u00e9 des doutes au sujet de la confidentialit\u00e9 des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux de la plaignante s\u2019ils \u00e9taient communiqu\u00e9s. Une autre conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e au 13 d\u00e9cembre 2011.\n[5] Pour relever plusieurs questions qui seraient soulev\u00e9es, selon eux, lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance pr\u00e9vue pour le 13 d\u00e9cembre ainsi que pour y r\u00e9pondre, les intim\u00e9s ont \u00e9crit au Tribunal le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2011. Ils ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans leur lettre que la quatri\u00e8me de leurs requ\u00eates concerne tous les documents que d\u00e9tiennent la plaignante et la Commission au sujet des plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre la British Columbia Maritime Employers Association et Western Stevedoring (les employeurs). Selon eux, ils ont adress\u00e9 aussi cette demande de communication \u00e0 la Commission en reconnaissance du fait que la plaignante se repr\u00e9sente elle-m\u00eame et parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un moyen pratique d\u2019amoindrir le fardeau que repr\u00e9sente pour cette derni\u00e8re une communication potentiellement importante de documents.\n[6] Une autre conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance a eu lieu le 13 d\u00e9cembre 2011. Lors de cette derni\u00e8re, les intim\u00e9s ont convenu de modifier la quatri\u00e8me de leurs requ\u00eates ainsi : que Mme Palm ou la Commission produise tous les documents qui sont cens\u00e9ment li\u00e9s aux plaintes initiales que Mme Palm a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de la Commission \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du syndicat, de la British Columbia Maritime Employers Association et de Western Stevedoring. Les parties ont \u00e9galement convenu que, si une ordonnance de communication concernant les anciens dossiers \u00e9tait rendue, on fournisse \u00e0 l\u2019avocat des employeurs la liste des documents avant leur communication.\n[7] Le 10 f\u00e9vrier 2012, les intim\u00e9s ont \u00e9crit au Tribunal pour demander qu\u2019il rende l\u2019ordonnance additionnelle suivante :\n[traduction]\n5. que la Commission ne communique aux employeurs ou \u00e0 leur avocat aucun des documents contenus dans les dossiers que tient la Commission dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Cette derni\u00e8re peut communiquer \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de l\u2019employeur une liste de documents. Si cet avocat se pose des questions sur la communication de l\u2019un quelconque des documents \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 notre bureau, la Commission peut les lui fournir.\n[8] Une autre conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue pour traiter de la lettre du 10 f\u00e9vrier 2012 des intim\u00e9s, mais le 15 mars 2012 le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 aux parties une lettre les informant qu\u2019il avait examin\u00e9 toute la correspondance re\u00e7ue et qu\u2019il se prononcerait sur les requ\u00eates sans tenir une autre conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique. Aucune des parties ne s\u2019est oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 ce que le Tribunal proc\u00e8de de cette fa\u00e7on.\nIII. Les principes de communication de la preuve [9] Le droit \u00e0 une audition \u00e9quitable exige que \u00ab [\u2026] l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 soit inform\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es contre lui et ait la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre \u00bb (Charkaoui c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2007 CSC 9, au paragraphe 53). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les parties doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de prendre connaissance de la preuve de la partie adverse afin de pouvoir r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 tout \u00e9l\u00e9ment pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 leur cause (voir Ruby c. Canada (Solliciteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2002 CSC 75, au paragraphe 40). Pour donner \u00e0 une partie la possibilit\u00e9 de le faire, il faut que les renseignements pertinents qui sont en la possession ou sous le contr\u00f4le de la partie adverse lui soient communiqu\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on pleine et enti\u00e8re.\n[10] Pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il convient de communiquer des documents ou non, le Tribunal a \u00e9tabli un processus en trois \u00e9tapes : 1) d\u00e9terminer si les renseignements sont d\u2019une \u00ab pertinence possible \u00bb, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que la partie qui demande la production des renseignements ou des documents doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il existe un lien entre les renseignements ou les documents demand\u00e9s et les questions en litige; 2) sans examiner les documents, d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe une raison imp\u00e9rieuse de pr\u00e9server le caract\u00e8re confidentiel de ces derniers; 3) si le Tribunal n\u2019est pas en mesure de r\u00e9gler la question sans examiner les documents, il doit dans ce cas les examiner et d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu de les produire (voir Day c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale), (6 d\u00e9cembre 2002), T627\/1501 et T628\/1601, d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate no 3, au paragraphe 7 (TCDP); et Guay c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2004 TCDP 34, au paragraphe 44 [Guay]).\n[11] Le Tribunal a reconnu qu\u2019un plaignant a droit au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e et \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 de ses dossiers m\u00e9dicaux (voir Beaudry c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), (24 juillet 2002), T694\/8201, d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate no 1, au paragraphe 7 (TCDP) [Beaudry]; McAvinn c. Strait Crossing Bridge Ltd., (3 janvier 2001), T558\/1600, d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate no 3, au paragraphe 3 (TCDP) [McAvinn]). Toutefois, ce droit peut cesser d\u2019exister quand cette personne invoque son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 (voir McAvinn, au paragraphe 4 (TCDP), Guay, au paragraphe 45, et Syndicat canadien des communications, de l\u2019\u00e9nergie et du papier et Femmes Action c. Bell Canada, 2005 TCDP 9, aux paragraphes 9 \u00e0 11). Dans les cas o\u00f9 il a ordonn\u00e9 que l\u2019on communique des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, le Tribunal a eu recours aux proc\u00e9dures qui suivent pour prot\u00e9ger le respect de la vie priv\u00e9e et la confidentialit\u00e9 des renseignements :\n\u2022 \u00e9tudier en d\u00e9tail les documents afin de d\u00e9terminer lesquels d\u2019entre eux sont bel et bien li\u00e9s aux troubles m\u00e9dicaux en question (voir Guay, McAvinn et Beaudry);\n\u2022 imposer des conditions \u00e0 propos de ceux qui peuvent voir les documents et les copier ( voir Shiv Chopra c. Sant\u00e9 Canada, 2007 TCDP 10, Micheline Montreuil c. Forces canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 45, et Beaudry).\nIV. Analyse A. La communication des documents m\u00e9dicaux [12] Selon les intim\u00e9s, la plaignante a invoqu\u00e9 son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 dans son argumentation et, de ce fait, par souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers eux, Mme Palm se doit de communiquer ses renseignements m\u00e9dicaux de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils connaissent les arguments qu\u2019ils doivent r\u00e9futer et puissent se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l\u2019audition. Ils ajoutent que, compte tenu des faits importants qu\u2019elle invoque dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions ainsi que des mesures de redressement qu\u2019elle sollicite, la plaignante a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 tout droit de confidentialit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 tout privil\u00e8ge \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses renseignements m\u00e9dicaux cens\u00e9ment pertinents.\n[13] Au vu des all\u00e9gations susmentionn\u00e9es de la plaignante, je conviens qu\u2019elle a invoqu\u00e9 son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 et qu\u2019il y a lieu de produire les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux pertinents de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que les intim\u00e9s puissent r\u00e9pondre convenablement aux all\u00e9gations relatives aux effets de la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conduite discriminatoire sur le bien-\u00eatre de la plaignante. Cela dit, durant la gestion de l\u2019instance, la plaignante a fourni une liste des sp\u00e9cialistes qu\u2019elle a consult\u00e9s \u00e0 cause des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 dont elle impute la faute aux intim\u00e9s. Elle a \u00e9galement dit que le Dr Mehraein produira un dossier m\u00e9dical portant sur la p\u00e9riode allant du mois de janvier 2008 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2009. M\u00eame si elle a dit qu\u2019elle pourrait avoir de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir les dossiers des deux autres sp\u00e9cialistes qu\u2019elle a nomm\u00e9s, elle s\u2019est engag\u00e9e \u00e0 tenter de les obtenir, mais a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019une ordonnance du Tribunal serait peut-\u00eatre utile \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je crois qu\u2019il suffit d\u2019ordonner simplement \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019obtenir et de communiquer tous les documents m\u00e9dicaux pertinents qui se rapportent \u00e0 sa demande. Comme les intim\u00e9s auront alors acc\u00e8s \u00e0 tous les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux pertinents, je conclus qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 ce stade-ci de d\u00e9livrer un subp\u0153na duces tecum, qui obligerait les sp\u00e9cialistes \u00e0 remettre des documents aux intim\u00e9s. Pour prot\u00e9ger la confidentialit\u00e9 des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux de la plaignante, j\u2019impose des conditions \u00e0 l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ces documents, comme il est indiqu\u00e9 dans la directive qui suit.\nB. La divulgation de documents li\u00e9s aux demandes relatives \u00e0 la perte de salaire, aux m\u00e9dicaments, aux frais des consultants et au pr\u00e9judice moral subi [14] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et sa demande de mesures de redressement, la plaignante a fourni un document qui indique son salaire, son indemnit\u00e9 de vacances, les prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 re\u00e7ues en 2008 et en 2009, de m\u00eame qu\u2019un montant de d\u00e9penses li\u00e9 aux m\u00e9dicaments et aux consultants. Selon les intim\u00e9s, la plaignante n\u2019a pas fourni de pr\u00e9cisions sur ces demandes et elle n\u2019a communiqu\u00e9 aucun document qui corrobore les montants qu\u2019elle r\u00e9clame. Ils ajoutent que la plaignante est oblig\u00e9e de communiquer ces documents et qu\u2019aucun privil\u00e8ge ne s\u2019y rattache.\n[15] Comme la plaignante a demand\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e pour sa perte de salaire, ses d\u00e9penses de m\u00e9dicaments, ses frais de consultants et le pr\u00e9judice moral subi, je conviens qu\u2019il y aurait lieu de communiquer tous les documents pertinents qu\u2019elle d\u00e9tient au sujet de ces demandes. Cela permettra aux intim\u00e9s d\u2019examiner ses demandes de redressement et cela pourrait aider le Tribunal \u00e0 concevoir une mesure de redressement appropri\u00e9e et \u00e9quitable si la plainte est justifi\u00e9e. La plaignante invoque un privil\u00e8ge \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des [traduction] \u00ab notes financi\u00e8res \u00bb, mais, au cours des conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de gestion d\u2019instance, elle n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi il ne fallait pas communiquer les documents se rapportant \u00e0 ses demandes d\u2019indemnisation. J\u2019ordonne donc que tous les documents pertinents qui ont trait aux demandes de la plaignante relatives \u00e0 sa perte de salaire, aux d\u00e9penses de m\u00e9dicaments, aux frais de consultants et au pr\u00e9judice moral subi soient communiqu\u00e9s aux intim\u00e9s, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la directive qui suit.\nC. La divulgation des documents concernant les plaintes initiales que Mme Palm a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de la Commission [16] Selon les intim\u00e9s, Mme Palm a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 initialement trois plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la Commission : une contre la British Columbia Maritime Employers Association, une contre Western Stevedoring et une autre encore contre l\u2019ILWU. Apr\u00e8s que la Commission eut rejet\u00e9 ces plaintes, Mme Palm en a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 cinq autres : les trois plaintes actuelles contre les intim\u00e9s et les plaintes \u2013 maintenant r\u00e9gl\u00e9es \u2013 contre les employeurs. Selon les observations des intim\u00e9s, la plaignante se doit de produire tous les documents li\u00e9s aux plaintes initiales et ult\u00e9rieures qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de la Commission \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du syndicat et des employeurs. Les intim\u00e9s soutiennent que, m\u00eame si les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre la British Columbia Maritime Employers Association et Western Stevedoring sont maintenant r\u00e9gl\u00e9es, les plaintes initiales et ult\u00e9rieures sont cens\u00e9ment pertinentes car les demandes que la plaignante a formul\u00e9es contre les employeurs sont essentiellement les m\u00eames que celles qu\u2019elle a formul\u00e9es contre les intim\u00e9s. Ceux-ci ajoutent que la plaignante, pour soutenir sa plainte initiale contre le syndicat, s\u2019est express\u00e9ment fond\u00e9e sur les d\u00e9tails de sa plainte contre Western Stevedoring.\n[17] Dans Leslie Palm c. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, section locale 500 et Willicome et Wilkinson, 2011 TCDP 12 [Palm] \u2013 une d\u00e9cision en mati\u00e8re de divulgation ant\u00e9rieurement rendue dans le cadre de cette m\u00eame affaire \u2013 le Tribunal a conclu que les cinq plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par la plaignante contre son employeur, l\u2019association des employeurs, le syndicat, M. Wilkinson et M. Willicome, m\u00eame si elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas identiques, pr\u00e9sentaient une ressemblance frappante. Le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 que l\u2019on communique les dispositions du r\u00e8glement de la plainte de la plaignante contre son employeur et l\u2019association des employeurs. Cependant, cette communication n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e uniquement sur la similitude des plaintes. Le Tribunal a conclu que \u00ab les dispositions du r\u00e8glement portant sur le d\u00e9gagement de responsabilit\u00e9 peuvent affecter directement les r\u00e9sultats des plaintes de Mme Palm contre M. Wilkinson et M. Willicome \u00bb (Palm, au paragraphe 17). Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement conclu que \u00ab les dispositions du r\u00e8glement portant tant sur la perte de salaire que sur les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires sont pertinentes et n\u00e9cessaires afin d\u2019\u00e9viter qu\u2019il y ait double r\u00e9paration en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question et pour permettre une certaine forme de proportionnalit\u00e9 dans les plaintes interd\u00e9pendantes en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me question \u00bb (Palm, au paragraphe 17). Enfin, le Tribunal a conclu que \u00ab [t]outes les dispositions du r\u00e8glement portant sur la plainte de Mme Palm en mati\u00e8re de discrimination syst\u00e9mique sont tant pertinentes que n\u00e9cessaires afin d\u2019atteindre un r\u00e9sultat juste vu les circonstances \u00bb (Palm, au paragraphe 18). Comme le d\u00e9notent ces passages extraits de Palm, la communication des dispositions de r\u00e8glement \u00e9tait pertinente \u00ab [\u2026] pour rendre une d\u00e9cision juste au sujet des plaintes [\u2026] \u00bb (Palm, au paragraphe 17).\n[18] Dans leur demande de communication actuelle, hormis le fait de mentionner que les plaintes de la plaignante contre les employeurs sont essentiellement les m\u00eames que celles dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas mentionn\u00e9 en quoi les renseignements contenus dans les plaintes initiales et ult\u00e9rieures que la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de la Commission ont un rapport avec l\u2019une quelconque des questions qui sont actuellement en litige. Dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal, la plaignante a expos\u00e9 le fondement de sa plainte et fourni une liste des documents pertinents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession et qui se rapportent \u00e0 ses all\u00e9gations. \u00c0 part leur demande de communication de documents m\u00e9dicaux et d\u2019autres documents li\u00e9s aux demandes de redressement de la plaignante, les intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas dit qu\u2019ils ignorent les \u00e9l\u00e9ments auxquels ils doivent r\u00e9pondre ou qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas assez de renseignements pour pouvoir r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gations de la plaignante. Par ailleurs, la Commission a fourni une liste de tous les documents pertinents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession au sujet des plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre les intim\u00e9s. En ce sens, je conclus que la demande de communication des intim\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est conjecturale. Je ne suis pas convaincu que les documents relatifs aux plaintes initiales contre le syndicat ou aux plaintes initiales et ult\u00e9rieures contre l\u2019employeur que Mme Palm a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de la Commission seront vraisemblablement pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sente instruction. Il n\u2019est donc pas n\u00e9cessaire de traiter du point no 5 de la demande de communication des intim\u00e9s.\nV. La directive\/l\u2019ordonnance [19] Conform\u00e9ment aux motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, j\u2019ordonne ce qui suit :\n1. me Palm remettra aux intim\u00e9s une liste contenant les noms et les adresses de tous les sp\u00e9cialistes des soins de sant\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a consult\u00e9s pour les sympt\u00f4mes ou les traitements de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, de la d\u00e9pression, du stress, de l\u2019insomnie ou de tout autre probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 dont elle impute la faute aux intim\u00e9s, et ce, au plus tard dans les six semaines qui suivront la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n2. Mme Palm obtiendra et remettra aux intim\u00e9s tous les documents m\u00e9dicaux, y compris l\u2019ensemble des notes d\u2019\u00e9tude clinique, des avis, des rapports de consultation, des analyses, des r\u00e9sultats de test, des r\u00e9sultats d\u2019examen de laboratoire et tout autre renseignement, sous forme imprim\u00e9e ou \u00e9lectronique, qui sont en la possession ou sous le contr\u00f4le des sp\u00e9cialistes des soins de sant\u00e9 et qui ont trait \u00e0 tout sympt\u00f4me ou \u00e0 tout traitement de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, de la d\u00e9pression, du stress, de l\u2019insomnie ou de tout autre probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 par la plaignante et dont elle impute la faute aux intim\u00e9s, et ce, au plus tard dans les six semaines qui suivront la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n3. Pour prot\u00e9ger le droit de Mme Palm \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 de ses dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, les documents seront communiqu\u00e9s aux avocates des intim\u00e9s; ils ne pourront \u00eatre transmis \u00e0 qui que ce soit d\u2019autre sans avoir obtenu au pr\u00e9alable l\u2019autorisation du Tribunal et sans en avoir avis\u00e9 Mme Palm. Les documents ne pourront servir qu\u2019aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente instruction et devront \u00eatre remis \u00e0 la plaignante \u00e0 la conclusion de cette derni\u00e8re.\n4. Mme Palm remettra aux intim\u00e9s tous les documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession et qui ont trait \u00e0 ses demandes concernant la perte de salaire, les m\u00e9dicaments, les frais de consultants ou le pr\u00e9judice moral subi, et ce, au plus tard dans les six semaines qui suivront la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSusheel Gupta\nVice-pr\u00e9sident du tribunal\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 24 mai 2012\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal: T1625\/17110, T1626\/17210, T1627\/17310\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause: Leslie Palm c.

La d\u00e9cision. 106\nI. Le contexte [1] Il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de trois plaintes qu\u2019a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es Marlo Nastiuk (Mme Nastiuk), une pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e aux soins en \u00e9tablissement qui \u00e9tait au service de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Couchiching (PNC), \u00e0 son centre de gu\u00e9rison Giizhikaandag (CGG), lequel est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Fort Frances (Ontario), et ce, sous la supervision et la direction de l\u2019intim\u00e9, Thomas Sinclair (M. Sinclair), le directeur administratif du CGG.\n[2] Le 1er mai 2009, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (L.R.C. 1985, ch. H 6) (la LCDP), la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) instruise la plainte no 20060869, re\u00e7ue le 25 juillet 2006, de Mme Nastiuk contre la PNC, ainsi que la plainte no 20061038 contre M. Sinclair; Mme Nastiuk all\u00e9guait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination li\u00e9e \u00e0 des gestes de harc\u00e8lement sexuel en milieu de travail au sens de l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP; ces gestes auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9s entre les mois de mars 2005 et juillet 2006.\n[3] Le 15 septembre 2009, la Commission a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une seconde demande d\u2019instruction concernant une troisi\u00e8me plainte (no 20080128), re\u00e7ue le 31 mars 2008, de Mme Nastiuk contre la PNC \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de repr\u00e9sailles, au sens de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP; ces repr\u00e9sailles auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9es [TRADUCTION] \u00ab \u00e0 partir du 16 ao\u00fbt 2006 \u00bb.\nA. La port\u00e9e de l\u2019enqu\u00eate [4] Le 1er mars 2010, la membre instructrice Kerry Lynne D. Findlay, c.r., a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 instruire les trois plaintes que Mme Nastiuk avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9es. L\u2019instruction s\u2019est poursuivie du 2 au 5 mars, du 31 mai au 4 juin et du 14 au 18 juin \u00e0 Fort Frances (Ontario).\n[5] Dans les discussions men\u00e9es au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audition, la membre instructrice Findlay a expliqu\u00e9 quelle \u00e9tait la port\u00e9e de l\u2019instruction :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : Une autre chose, Mme Nastiuk, est-il clair pour vous que nous sommes ici pour traiter des plaintes relatives au harc\u00e8lement sexuel et aux repr\u00e9sailles, et non \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience?\nMme Nastiuk : Oui, je suppose. Je le comprends, m\u00eame si, pour moi, ces \u2013 cette d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue, cette orientation per\u00e7ue en fait partie, mais, oui, je le comprends.\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : Fort bien, parce qu\u2019il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate du Tribunal avant aujourd\u2019hui, et c\u2019est \u00e0 cela que nous nous limitons, n\u2019est-ce pas?\nMme Nastiuk : Oui.\nTranscription : page 28, lignes 18 \u00e0 25; page 29, lignes 1 \u00e0 6.\n[6] Mme Nastiuk et M. Sinclair n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par un avocat lors de l\u2019instruction; la PNC a \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Me Chantelle Bryson (Me Bryson). Le Tribunal a re\u00e7u les observations finales des parties, ainsi que la r\u00e9ponse de Mme Nastiuk aux observations finales des intim\u00e9s avant le 11 ao\u00fbt 2010.\nB. La r\u00e9cusation de l\u2019arbitre [7] Le 6 juillet 2011, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 du Tribunal en raison de sa r\u00e9cente \u00e9lection en tant que d\u00e9put\u00e9e, Mme Findlay s\u2019est r\u00e9cus\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 l\u2019affaire, sans rendre de d\u00e9cision. L\u2019affaire a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9e \u00e0 nouveau au vice-pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal, Susheel Gupta.\n[8] Apr\u00e8s que le dossier lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9, le vice-pr\u00e9sident a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aux parties deux options concernant le traitement du dossier :\ni. fixer des dates pour la tenue d\u2019une instruction tout \u00e0 fait nouvelle, avec rappel des t\u00e9moins, production de preuves documentaires et pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019arguments tant oraux qu\u2019\u00e9crits; laisser ensuite la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal suivre son cours jusqu\u2019\u00e0 une d\u00e9cision finale; cette instruction serait pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par le vice-pr\u00e9sident;\nii. si les parties y consentent, sans d\u00e9lai, permettre au vice-pr\u00e9sident et \u00e0 un membre \u00e0 temps plein du Tribunal d\u2019\u00e9couter la totalit\u00e9 des enregistrements de l\u2019instruction et d\u2019examiner avec soin tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments documentaires pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au Tribunal qui font partie du dossier de l\u2019instruction et permettre au Tribunal de rendre une d\u00e9cision finale.\n[9] Au 15 novembre 2011, le Tribunal avait re\u00e7u une r\u00e9ponse de toutes les parties, qui, par souci d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et d\u2019\u00e9conomie, avaient choisi l\u2019option ii. Toutefois, \u00e0 cause de responsabilit\u00e9s additionnelles au Tribunal et d\u2019affaires personnelles \u00e0 domicile, le vice-pr\u00e9sident a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que, pour des raisons d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et de c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9, il serait dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des parties qu\u2019il se d\u00e9siste de l\u2019affaire. Le vice pr\u00e9sident s\u2019est d\u00e9sist\u00e9 le 9 mars 2012 et a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente, Shirish Chotalia, en vue d\u2019une nouvelle d\u00e9signation. Le 13 mars 2012, la pr\u00e9sidente Shirish Chotalia a assign\u00e9 l\u2019affaire \u00e0 un autre membre du Tribunal, Wallace Gilby Craig.\nC. Le membre instructeur Wallace Gilby Craig [10] Le 13 mars 2012, j\u2019ai re\u00e7u une transcription de la totalit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par tous les t\u00e9moins qui avaient comparu, soit en personne soit par conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, devant Mme Findlay. De plus, j\u2019ai re\u00e7u copie de toutes les pi\u00e8ces qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en preuve, de m\u00eame que les arguments \u00e9crits que les parties avaient produits \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019instruction.\n[11] Entre le 13 mars et le 30 avril 2012, j\u2019ai lu les 3 500 pages de transcription des d\u00e9bats, j\u2019ai examin\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail les preuves documentaires pertinentes que Mme Findlay avait re\u00e7ues, j\u2019ai \u00e9tudi\u00e9 les arguments \u00e9crits que les parties avaient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et j\u2019ai rendu la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nII. La preuve prima facie de la plaignante [12] Je fais tout d\u2019abord r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au t\u00e9moignage de Mme Gail Roach-Leforte, t\u00e9moin de la plaignante, parce que ce t\u00e9moignage d\u00e9crit le lieu de travail au CGG ainsi que les circonstances entourant les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante quant aux actes discriminatoires commis et aux repr\u00e9sailles exerc\u00e9es par les intim\u00e9s.\n[13] Mme Roach-Leforte a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir travaill\u00e9 dans le domaine du bien-\u00eatre de l\u2019enfance pendant seize ans \u00e0 divers postes aupr\u00e8s de plusieurs organismes : pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e aux cas, pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e aux soins en \u00e9tablissement, gestionnaire de cas aupr\u00e8s de jeunes victimes d\u2019abus sexuels, pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e aux placements familiaux sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s, instructrice de niveau coll\u00e9gial, et elle travaille actuellement comme travailleuse sociale. Mme Roach-Leforte a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler au CGG (le centre de traitement en \u00e9tablissement de la PNC) \u00e0 la fin de 2004, \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9e occasionnelle sur appel fournissant des services individuels aupr\u00e8s de jeunes r\u00e9sidant au centre de traitement.\n[14] Douglas Broman a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin par Mme Nastiuk; il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019en 2005 il travaillait au centre de traitement de la PNC, o\u00f9 il s\u2019occupait \u00e0 titre individuel de jeunes en difficult\u00e9 et que, au d\u00e9but de 2006, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 gestionnaire de cas par int\u00e9rim.\nA. Le programme du CGG [15] Le centre de gu\u00e9rison Giizhikaandag (CGG) est administr\u00e9 par la PNC; il s\u2019agit d\u2019un centre de traitement en \u00e9tablissement pour jeunes d\u00e9linquants sexuels. Le centre offre ou organise des th\u00e9rapies, des traitements psychiatriques, des services m\u00e9dicaux, une formation scolaire ainsi que des renvois vers des services communautaires.\n[16] En d\u00e9cembre 2004, la directrice administrative par int\u00e9rim du CGG, Estelle Simard, a inform\u00e9 Mme Roach-Leforte que le programme de traitement \u00e9tait un \u00e9chec et qu\u2019elle d\u00e9missionnait. Venant tout juste de prendre connaissance du curriculum vit\u00e6 de Mme Roach-Leforte, elle a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re de demander au chef de la PNC de l\u2019embaucher \u00e0 titre de gestionnaire des programmes au CGG.\n[17] Quand Me Bryson, l\u2019avocate de la PNC, lui a demand\u00e9 de fournir des d\u00e9tails expliquant pourquoi le programme du CGG \u00e9tait sur le point de s\u2019\u00e9crouler en 2004, Mme Roach-Leforte a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le minist\u00e8re provincial avait fait \u00e9tat de 33 violations li\u00e9es \u00e0 la tenue de livres, \u00e0 des questions de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, au fait que les aliments ne concordaient pas avec les menus, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 des appareils d\u2019\u00e9clairage cass\u00e9s. Pour ce qui \u00e9tait des cas de violation ou d\u2019inobservation relatifs au travail, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le minist\u00e8re \u00e9tait insatisfait de la gestion des cas et du fait que les rapports n\u2019\u00e9taient pas sign\u00e9s ou que leur contenu semblait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 coup\u00e9-coll\u00e9, et qu\u2019il voulait que l\u2019on cr\u00e9e un guide sur la prestation des services.\n[18] Mme Roach-Leforte et trois autres personnes se sont donc pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es devant le chef et le conseil pour leur pr\u00e9senter la proposition qu\u2019elle prenne en charge le programme. Le chef et le conseil ont accept\u00e9 de lui accorder un certain nombre de mois pour essayer de remettre le programme sur ses rails. Mme Roach-Leforte les a inform\u00e9s qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas d\u2019exp\u00e9rience en tant que directrice administrative et qu\u2019elle allait avoir besoin de conseils au sujet des fonctions financi\u00e8res et administratives de son nouveau poste.\n[19] Quelques semaines plus tard, \u00e0 la fin de d\u00e9cembre 2004 ou au d\u00e9but de janvier 2005, le chef McPherson a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Roach-Leforte et lui a dit qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait engag\u00e9e pour g\u00e9rer le programme et que la PNC avait obtenu les services d\u2019un consultant, M. Sinclair, qui allait travailler avec elle pendant une p\u00e9riode de six semaines \u00e0 trois mois peut-\u00eatre. Mme Roach Leforte a accept\u00e9 la nomination, s\u2019attendant \u00e0 recevoir de l\u2019aide en vue d\u2019apprendre les fonctions financi\u00e8res et administratives. Lors de ses discussions avec le chef au sujet du consultant et de son propre r\u00f4le, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu qu\u2019elle serait la gestionnaire de programme du CGG. Elle s\u2019attendait \u00e0 \u00eatre nomm\u00e9e directrice administrative en temps voulu. Cependant, au printemps de 2005, le r\u00f4le que jouait M. Sinclair \u00e0 titre de consultant avait pris fin et il \u00e9tait devenu \u00e9vident aux yeux de tous les employ\u00e9s du CGG, y compris Mme Roach-Leforte et Mme Nastiuk, que c\u2019\u00e9tait lui qui \u00e9tait devenu le directeur administratif du CGG, et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait responsable de la totalit\u00e9 des activit\u00e9s et comptable seulement devant l\u2019administrateur de bande et, par l\u2019entremise de ce dernier, envers le chef et le conseil.\n[20] Quand l\u2019avocate de la PNC lui a demand\u00e9 d\u2019expliquer quelles \u00e9taient ses fonctions et celles de M. Sinclair, Mme Roach-Leforte a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que tous deux s\u2019occupaient de d\u00e9finir clairement les t\u00e2ches des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s au CGG, y compris la gestionnaire de programme, le gestionnaire de cas et les chefs d\u2019\u00e9quipe. Cependant, il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident que Mme Roach-Leforte devait sauver et g\u00e9rer le programme existant, tout en travaillant avec M. Sinclair pour restructurer le programme d\u2019une mani\u00e8re que la PNC, les autorit\u00e9s provinciales et un organisme de financement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral jugeraient satisfaisante.\nB. L\u2019embauche de Mme Nastiuk comme employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein [21] Le 10 septembre 2004, un mois apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu son dipl\u00f4me de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 du Manitoba, Mme Nastiuk est entr\u00e9e au service du CGG. Le baccalaur\u00e9at \u00e8s arts qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9croch\u00e9, avec mineure en psychologie et majeure en sociologie et criminologie, \u00e9tait le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019une lutte acharn\u00e9e qui avait dur\u00e9 huit ans, aggrav\u00e9e par des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9, une fibromyalgie aux effets d\u00e9bilitants, une narcolepsie et une hernie discale. Mme Nastiuk a travaill\u00e9 comme conseill\u00e8re de rel\u00e8ve occasionnelle au CGG jusqu\u2019en f\u00e9vrier 2005.\n[22] Au d\u00e9but du mois de janvier 2005, Mme Roach-Leforte a convoqu\u00e9 une r\u00e9union du personnel du CGG. Comme elle l\u2019a dit, elle a fait aux employ\u00e9s un la\u00efus d\u2019encouragement afin de leur remonter le moral. Elle leur a dit que l\u2019examen du minist\u00e8re \u00e9tait chose du pass\u00e9, qu\u2019elle ne voulait pas qu\u2019ils perdent leurs emplois et qu\u2019ils formaient une \u00e9quipe qui devait renouveler son engagement; de plus, un consultant s\u2019en venait et les aiderait \u00e0 devenir une organisation plus professionnelle.\n[23] Mme Roach-Leforte a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Sinclair que Mme Nastiuk soit charg\u00e9e de travailler avec eux en vue de concevoir un nouveau programme :\n[TRADUCTION] [\u2026] Tom et moi [\u2026] la premi\u00e8re semaine [\u2026] nous avons pass\u00e9 de nombreuses heures, probablement 10, 12 heures par jour [\u2026] je connais les soins en \u00e9tablissement, j\u2019ai fait ce travail durant plusieurs ann\u00e9es, mais \u2013 et je savais comment faire fonctionner un ordinateur et je savais comment [\u2026] cr\u00e9er des documents, mais ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vraiment mon fort, et je savais que vous l\u2019\u00e9tiez, je veux dire la plaignante, et j\u2019ai donc sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Tom que j\u2019avais vraiment besoin d\u2019aide sur ce plan et j\u2019ai pens\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait \u2013 une mauvaise utilisation de votre comp\u00e9tence et de votre instruction, et j\u2019ai pens\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait bon que vous vous joigniez \u00e0 nous et que vous m\u2019aidiez \u00e0 mettre au point un bon nombre de ces nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments.\nTranscription : page 976, lignes 12 \u00e0 25; page 977, ligne 1.\n[\u2026] Je ne me souviens pas s\u2019il y a eu une entrevue, \u00e0 part celle qu\u2019il y a eu pour vous (Mme Nastiuk) faire venir. Je crois qu\u2019on vous a simplement appel\u00e9 au b\u00e2timent et qu\u2019on vous a parl\u00e9 de, vous savez, pensez-vous \u00eatre capable de faire ceci, et vous avez convenu que oui et \u00e7a m\u2019a soulag\u00e9e. Tout ce dont je me souviens, c\u2019est que j\u2019allais avoir un peu d\u2019aide pour une t\u00e2che tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s lourde.\nTranscription : page 979, lignes 3 \u00e0 10, 24 et 25; page 980, lignes 1 \u00e0 10.\n[24] L\u2019embauche \u00e0 temps plein de Mme Nastiuk a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par M. Sinclair, et Mme Nastiuk, dans son t\u00e9moignage, a d\u00e9crit cela comme un travail intensif pendant les premi\u00e8res semaines. C\u2019\u00e9tait le premier emploi de Mme Nastiuk dans le domaine des services sociaux aupr\u00e8s d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation. Mme Roach-Leforte a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, pour les trois d\u2019entre eux, les heures de travail \u00e9taient extr\u00eamement longues.\n[TRADUCTION]\nMe Bryson : Que faisiez-vous donc ensemble, vous tous?\nMme Roach-Leforte : Beaucoup de discussion. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas sur place durant les longues heures o\u00f9 je travaillais, je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas toujours dans ce b\u00e2timent. J\u2019avais d\u2019autres t\u00e2ches \u00e0 accomplir.\nIl fallait que je sois \u00e0 l\u2019autre programme \u2013 c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, directement sur place, et nous avions aussi beaucoup de rencontres avec le personnel. Le moral \u00e9tait \u00e0 son plus bas, et je sais qu\u2019une bonne part de ce que nous faisions, c\u2019\u00e9tait essayer d\u2019avoir beaucoup de r\u00e9unions d\u2019\u00e9quipe et tenter de rassurer le personnel \u2013 ce que je peux vous dire, c\u2019est que le programme \u00e9tait fini, cela ne faisait aucun doute.\nMais je crois que nous tentions d\u2019insuffler en eux l\u2019espoir qu\u2019on redonnait vie au programme, parce que je crois que c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas.\nMe Bryson : Et le programme existe toujours, n\u2019est-ce pas?\nMme Roach-Leforte : Il existe toujours.\nTranscription : page 1119, lignes 1 \u00e0 23.\n[25] Mme Roach-Leforte a d\u00e9crit en particulier le chaos qui r\u00e9gnait ces premiers temps, o\u00f9 ils faisaient de dix \u00e0 douze heures de travail par jour dans une salle de conf\u00e9rence :\n[TRADUCTION] Durant toute cette p\u00e9riode nous n\u2019avions pas de bureau, nous passions le plus clair de notre temps \u2013 il y avait des papiers \u00e9parpill\u00e9s sur la table de conf\u00e9rence et dans le bureau de M. Sinclair et nous \u2013 nous ne faisions qu\u2019\u00e9taler nos documents et nos piles de t\u00e2ches diff\u00e9rentes.\nTranscription : page 981, lignes 14 \u00e0 19.\nC. Le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement du bureau [26] \u00c0 la fin du mois de mars 2005, apr\u00e8s avoir discut\u00e9 avec Mme Nastiuk de l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 pratique de leur situation, Mme Roach-Leforte a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Sinclair, et elle soutient qu\u2019il a accept\u00e9 l\u2019id\u00e9e, que Mme Nastiuk et elle d\u00e9m\u00e9nagent du b\u00e2timent \u00ab est \u00bb du CGG \u00e0 un bureau vacant situ\u00e9 dans le b\u00e2timent \u00ab central \u00bb. Mme Roach-Leforte a am\u00e9nag\u00e9 un bureau en s\u2019attendant \u00e0 ce que Mme Nastiuk soit elle aussi d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elles puissent continuer de travailler ensemble au remaniement du programme du CGG. Cependant, Mme Nastiuk ne l\u2019a pas rejointe; elle a plut\u00f4t \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e au bureau de M. Sinclair, o\u00f9 ce dernier a fait installer pour elle une table et un ordinateur. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Sinclair a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait aucune comp\u00e9tence en informatique et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait indispensable qu\u2019une personne comp\u00e9tente dans ce domaine travaille avec lui.\nMme Nastiuk a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Roach-Leforte :\n[TRADUCTION] O\u00f9 est-ce que j\u2019ai fini par me retrouver?\nVous n\u2019avez pas pu d\u00e9m\u00e9nager, et \u2013 mais j\u2019ai constat\u00e9 \u2013 j\u2019ai simplement constat\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait des choses qui vous arrivaient. \u00c0 un certain moment, vous \u00eates entr\u00e9e dans mon bureau et vous \u00eates en quelque sorte laiss\u00e9e tomber sur la chaise et vous avez dit : oh, il faut juste que je m\u2019\u00e9loigne de cette folie pendant un certain temps ou de sa folie pendant un certain temps. Et c\u2019\u00e9tait vraiment difficile pour nous parce que nous \u00e9tions \u2013 nous n\u2019\u00e9tions tout simplement pas capables d\u2019accomplir le travail que nous devions faire ensemble.\nTranscription : page 987, lignes 11 \u00e0 20.\n[27] Mme Nastiuk a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019au cours de ces premi\u00e8res semaines elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se sentir mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise vis-\u00e0-vis de M. Sinclair \u00e0 cause des questions qu\u2019il posait sur ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents :\n[TRADUCTION] Il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 faire des commentaires, comme : oh, j\u2019ai fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 son \u00e9pouse, pendant que nous \u00e9tions en train de fumer une cigarette \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur, et il y avait des hommes qui se joignaient \u00e0 nous, ou alors il parlait de personnes diff\u00e9rentes ou bien, oh, j\u2019ai fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 sa conjointe.\nEt, ensuite, il parlait de la fa\u00e7on dont les femmes l\u2019appr\u00e9ciaient, et cela m\u2019a toujours frapp\u00e9e, parce que je ne le connaissais pas vraiment, je n\u2019\u00e9tais qu\u2019une employ\u00e9e sur appel, une employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps partiel, et cela me paraissait tout simplement d\u00e9plac\u00e9. Et je ne r\u00e9agissais pas \u2013 ou je ne faisais pas vraiment de commentaires sur ce qu\u2019il disait. Je gardais une certaine distance.\nTranscription : page 150, lignes 5 \u00e0 16.\n[28] Quand Mme Nastiuk a d\u00e9crit son sentiment de frustration \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du fait d\u2019\u00eatre affect\u00e9e au bureau de M. Sinclair :\n[TRADUCTION] D\u2019autres employ\u00e9s allaient et venaient et faisaient ce qu\u2019ils voulaient, et moi, j\u2019avais l\u2019impression qu\u2019il fallait toujours que je sois l\u00e0 et disponible la plupart du temps durant la journ\u00e9e. Cela, je veux dire, dans n\u2019importe quel lieu de travail, je suppose que \u2013 vous savez, c\u2019est en quelque sorte normal, mais la fa\u00e7on dont tous les autres pouvaient avoir plus de libert\u00e9 et ne pas avoir \u00e0 lui rendre des comptes de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on m\u2019aga\u00e7ait en quelque sorte.\n[\u2026]\nEt ensuite, un soir, il m\u2019a demand\u00e9 de travailler tard, et nous sommes rest\u00e9s au bureau jusqu\u2019\u00e0 22 h. Je crois que c\u2019\u00e9tait entre les mois de mars ou d\u2019avril [\u2026], mais je n\u2019en suis pas absolument s\u00fbre parce qu\u2019il y avait tant de longues journ\u00e9es de travail que l\u2019on ne peut pas vraiment revenir en arri\u00e8re et d\u00e9terminer exactement quel jour c\u2019\u00e9tait.

C\u2019est une expression que j\u2019emploie, avec, par exemple, les chiens de mes parents, ce n\u2019est qu\u2019une expression \u2013 ou avec les filles au travail. C\u2019est tout simplement ce que nous nous disons quand nous ne nous sommes pas vues depuis un certain temps. Et, vous savez, quand on travaille de mani\u00e8re isol\u00e9e, tr\u00e8s souvent \u00e0 cause de la s\u00e9paration et de l\u2019emplacement des diff\u00e9rents bureaux et b\u00e2timents.\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : A-t-il laiss\u00e9 entendre que cela voulait effectivement dire quelque chose?\nEh bien, il a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ce commentaire, et je lui ai dit, ouais, mais cela ne voulait rien dire. C\u2019est comme la fois o\u00f9 j\u2019\u00e9tais dans le bureau de Gail au mois de juin.\nEt il a continu\u00e9 en disant quelque chose comme, non, mais ne vous m\u2019\u00e9coutez pas, et moi j\u2019ai r\u00e9pondu quelque chose comme cela ne voulait rien dire et quelque part dans la discussion, il a fait remarquer que je l\u2019int\u00e9ressais \u2013 il me trouvait attrayante et il s\u2019int\u00e9ressait \u00e0 moi en tant que femme. Mais je \u2013 vraiment \u2013 je pense \u2013 je sais seulement que je n\u2019ai rien dit. Je ne voulais pas l\u2019entendre, je ne voulais pas avoir affaire \u00e0 \u00e7a, je ne voulais pas avoir \u00e0 le lui dire directement. C\u2019est juste que \u2013 je ne l\u2019ai pas fait parce que j\u2019\u00e9tais vraiment inqui\u00e8te au sujet de mon revenu.\nJe crois que j\u2019\u00e9tais toujours \u2013 je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas encore salari\u00e9e.

La promotion de Mme Nastiuk [31] Mme Roach-Leforte a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019au CGG les fonctions de gestion de cas avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par divers membres du personnel, qu\u2019\u00e0 une occasion ces fonctions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9es \u00e0 tous les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux soins et, \u00e0 une autre, elles l\u2019avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 aux chefs d\u2019\u00e9quipe. Quand le programme du CGG a \u00e9t\u00e9 remani\u00e9, c\u2019est le gestionnaire de cas qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 des fonctions d\u00e9crites. Mme Roach-Leforte a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle esp\u00e9rait que le CGG puisse avoir un gestionnaire de cas pour tous les jeunes qui suivaient des traitements :\n[TRADUCTION] [\u2026] ces fonctions seraient plus une responsabilit\u00e9 de type \u00ab travail social \u00bb. Les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux soins en \u00e9tablissement travailleraient avec les jeunes, ils prendraient note de certaines choses. Ils discuteraient avec le gestionnaire de cas des sujets de pr\u00e9occupation, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de sujets de tous les jours, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de sujets li\u00e9s au comportement, le clinicien consulterait le gestionnaire de cas \u00e0 propos des choses qui se passaient sur le plan du travail clinique qui \u00e9tait fait aupr\u00e8s de leurs jeunes.\nTranscription : page 1010, lignes 6 \u00e0 15.\n[32] Mme Nastiuk et un autre membre du personnel ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leur candidature pour le nouveau poste de gestionnaire de cas, et ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9s par M. Sinclair et Barbara Delsig. Mme Nastiuk a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisie et nomm\u00e9e gestionnaire de cas le 20 juillet 2005.\n[33] Mme Nastiuk a d\u00e9crit quelle \u00e9tait la nature de son travail lorsqu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 officiellement nomm\u00e9e gestionnaire de cas au CGG :\n[TRADUCTION] J\u2019ai donc simplement commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 faire beaucoup de recherches sur Internet et \u00e0 mettre les morceaux ensemble. [\u2026] M. Sinclair m\u2019a aid\u00e9e \u00e0 mettre au point un syst\u00e8me de gestion de cas responsable. J\u2019ai rencontr\u00e9 Paula Isler (ph.), la r\u00e9sidente aupr\u00e8s du minist\u00e8re des Services sociaux et communautaires. Elle s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour un examen \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Elle m\u2019a remis ce qu\u2019elle appelait sa bible, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qu\u2019elle avait de la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille et elle a dit que c\u2019\u00e9tait ma bible. C\u2019est ce qui guide ce que je fais, c\u2019est ce qui guidera ce que vous ferez, et nous avons eu toute une discussion sur le sujet.\nTranscription : page 186, lignes 13 \u00e0 25.\n[TRADUCTION] Donc, cela m\u2019a aid\u00e9e \u00e0 mettre au point le syst\u00e8me que j\u2019avais, et je crois que M. Broman jugeait qu\u2019il y avait un \u2013 syst\u00e8me de gestion de cas que l\u2019on pouvait \u2013 que quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre pouvait reprendre et suivre.\nJ\u2019ai travaill\u00e9 dur \u2013 bien, je ne peux pas dire, j\u2019ai vraiment travaill\u00e9 dur. C\u2019\u00e9tait un travail stimulant, mais il demandait beaucoup de temps, beaucoup d\u2019\u00e9nergie. J\u2019avais les fonctions de gestion de cas ordinaires, je passais beaucoup de temps avec M. Sinclair, et cette ch\u00e8re Gail, elle parle beaucoup. Je passais donc beaucoup de temps \u00e0 \u00e9couter d\u2019autres personnes parler de leurs r\u00e9alisations au travail. Ou de \u2013 Gail surtout, une chose dont elle \u00e9tait vraiment fi\u00e8re et dont elle s\u2019\u00e9tait occup\u00e9e durant la journ\u00e9e ou des probl\u00e8mes, et c\u2019est ainsi que \u2013 ouais, ma journ\u00e9e \u00e9tait longue, et le travail \u00e9tait \u2013 il me semblait que j\u2019\u00e9tais responsable aussi d\u2019une grande partie de la planification des traitements \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque.\nDonc, pendant que j\u2019avais \u00e0 m\u2019occuper de toute la partie administrative, il fallait aussi que je passe assez de temps avec les gar\u00e7ons pour \u00e9valuer ce qu\u2019ils faisaient, et je crois avoir assez bien r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 jongler avec toutes ces t\u00e2ches diff\u00e9rentes et aucune formation sur la gestion de cas. Cependant, je crois que j\u2019ai appris, mais il y avait encore des pi\u00e8ces qui me manquaient, des pi\u00e8ces pour lesquelles je ne pouvais pas obtenir d\u2019aide ou de conseils.\nJe pourrais dire, je suppose que c\u2019\u00e9tait \u2013 tr\u00e8s accaparant. J\u2019avais mon travail et, quand je rentrais \u00e0 la maison, on aurait juste dit, j\u2019avais encore mon \u2013 quelque chose li\u00e9 au travail. Il y avait beaucoup \u2013 j\u2019avais l\u2019impression que l\u2019on m\u2019imposait beaucoup d\u2019attentes et de pression. Je voulais faire du bon travail, mais essentiellement je suis une personne assez d\u00e9brouillarde. Je travaille tr\u00e8s bien de fa\u00e7on ind\u00e9pendante.\nTranscription : page 187, lignes 1 \u00e0 19; page 188, lignes 5 \u00e0 22.\n[34] Mme Nastiuk a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Roach-Leforte de quoi sa transition [TRADUCTION]\n\u00ab avait l\u2019air dans le contexte tout entier du CGG \u00bb.\n[TRADUCTION] Mme Roach-Leforte : [\u2026] d\u2019un point de vue administratif, votre transition a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s positive en ce sens que vous aviez les comp\u00e9tences n\u00e9cessaires pour mettre sur pied des choses comme celles-l\u00e0, le minist\u00e8re nous laissait savoir que cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment se d\u00e9roulait tr\u00e8s bien, elle aimait bien le plan. Elle voyait d\u2019un bon \u0153il bien des changements que nous faisions. [\u2026] Pour ce qui \u00e9tait de l\u2019\u00e9quipe cependant \u2013 il y a eu quelques sentiments n\u00e9gatifs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du fait que l\u2019on vous avait donn\u00e9 le poste. Vous \u00e9tiez la plus qualifi\u00e9e, vous aviez un dipl\u00f4me, Joe avait un dipl\u00f4me, mais elle avait travaill\u00e9 plus longtemps dans le cadre du programme, et je crois qu\u2019il y avait seulement \u2013 je crois qu\u2019il y a eu au d\u00e9part beaucoup d\u2019amertume \u00e0 ce sujet. Mais, comme bien des choses, je sais, de mon point de vue, j\u2019ai toujours essay\u00e9 de b\u00e2tir des ponts et, chaque fois qu\u2019il y avait des commentaires n\u00e9gatifs j\u2019essayais de ramener les membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipe ensemble et de passer en revue les probl\u00e8mes. L\u2019un des autres probl\u00e8mes cependant \u00e9tait d\u00fb au changement de style de gestion de cas; les gens \u00e9taient vraiment contrari\u00e9s par \u00e7a.\nTranscription : page 1013, lignes 11 \u00e0 25; page 1014, lignes 1 \u00e0 11.\n[35] Mme Roach-Leforte a dit que le milieu de travail \u00e9tait plus positif lors des premiers jours de travail concernant la mise au point du nouveau programme. Quand l\u2019avocate de la PNC a demand\u00e9 combien de temps le personnel \u00e9tait rest\u00e9, elle a toutefois d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2005, la situation avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se d\u00e9grader.\n[TRADUCTION] Et cela a dur\u00e9 \u2013 disons que cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 assez irr\u00e9gulier parce que je ne dis pas que c\u2019est la faute \u00e0 M. Sinclair, mais quand M. Sinclair est arriv\u00e9, cela a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une tout autre combinaison, c\u2019est devenu un changement au programme et ensuite, quand Mme Nastiuk a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e \u00e0 la gestion de cas \u2013 ou \u00e0 la partie gestion, cela a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un autre changement. Et ensuite, les changements ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se produire, mais cela a d\u00e9but\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9, cette suspicion qui s\u2019infiltrait chez les gens. On faisait des promesses au sujet de petites choses \u2013 vous savez, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments du programme et ensuite, ces promesses ne se concr\u00e9tisaient pas, ou alors on mettait des choses en marche et ensuite elles \u00e9taient jet\u00e9es \u00e0 la poubelle ou \u2013 vous savez, le r\u00f4le \u00e9tait, vous savez, tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s (inaudible) et la planification, oh mon Dieu, quel cauchemar, c\u2019est donc dire que les choses ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 empirer vers l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9, je crois.\nTranscription : page 1136, lignes 12 \u00e0 25; page 1137, lignes 1 \u00e0 5.\nF. Les rapports entre Mme Nastiuk et M. Sinclair au cours de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2005 [36] Mme Nastiuk a parl\u00e9 de la tension qui a pris naissance entre elle-m\u00eame et les autres membres du personnel. Cela a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Sinclair \u00e0 agir comme interm\u00e9diaire, une situation que Mme Nastiuk a, selon ses dires, trouv\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement frustrant.\n[TRADUCTION] Oh, oui. Ouais, \u00e7a \u2013 c\u2019est arriv\u00e9 principalement au d\u00e9but du programme de gestion de cas. J\u2019\u00e9tais au courant qu\u2019il y avait des probl\u00e8mes avec le personnel, mais d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce que je comprenais, et je n\u2019ai pas l\u2019impression d\u2019\u00eatre \u2013 mes capacit\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9valuation sont assez bonnes, M. Sinclair avait l\u2019habitude de le dire, et mon patron actuel dit cela. Et le sentiment que j\u2019avais \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du personnel \u2013 certains des probl\u00e8mes avec le personnel, il y avait beaucoup de ressentiment de la part de certains des membres du personnel de longue date comme Brian, Nicky. Ils avaient du ressentiment face au fait que certains des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps partiel et sur appel grimpaient dans la hi\u00e9rarchie et qu\u2019eux-m\u00eames restaient au bas de l\u2019\u00e9chelle. Et ils esp\u00e9raient en quelque sorte que Jill obtiendrait le poste de gestionnaire de cas et il y avait juste \u2013 ou Krista, la s\u0153ur de Brian, elle n\u2019acceptait vraiment pas le fait que je travaillais \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tage avec M. Sinclair et Gail.\nC\u2019est donc l\u00e0 \u2013 c\u2019est, selon moi, de cette fa\u00e7on qu\u2019une bonne partie de cette situation a commenc\u00e9, et quelque part l\u00e0-dedans, je ne sais pas comment les choses ont fait pour mal tourner. Il y a peut-\u00eatre eu quelques id\u00e9es de ma part. Je me souviens que j\u2019avais l\u2019habitude de faire la remarque, parce que \u2013 cela les ennuyait tellement, alors j\u2019essayais de dire, eh bien, c\u2019est essentiellement une bonne chose parce que j\u2019ai acquis beaucoup de comp\u00e9tences et de connaissances gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 mes \u00e9tudes.\nCela s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00eatre la pire chose que j\u2019aurais pu dire parce que cela a \u00e9rig\u00e9 une barri\u00e8re encore plus haute. Et, dans tout cela, le fait que je ne pouvais pas faire affaire avec le personnel de premi\u00e8re ligne, que je ne pouvais pas faire affaire avec le superviseur de quart ou le superviseur d\u2019\u00e9quipe, que je devais faire affaire directement avec lui pour les comptes rendus que j\u2019aurais d\u00fb recevoir du personnel de premi\u00e8re ligne, du superviseur de quart ou des chefs d\u2019\u00e9quipe, ou quelle que soit le nom qu\u2019on leur donnait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque.\nLes renseignements sur la fa\u00e7on dont les gar\u00e7ons, la fa\u00e7on dont les groupes \u00e9voluaient, toutes les informations de ce genre devaient passer par M. Sinclair. Oh, une autre raison pour devoir aller \u00e0 son bureau, et c\u2019\u00e9tait tr\u00e8s frustrant. [\u2026] Cela aurait eu lieu les premiers jours de juillet, quand on m\u2019a dit que le poste \u00e9tait \u00e0 moi, en juillet 2005.\nTranscription : page 190, lignes 24 \u00e0 25; page 191, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 192, lignes 1 \u00e0 13 et 22 \u00e0 24.\n[37] Mme Nastiuk a parl\u00e9 avec beaucoup d\u2019intensit\u00e9 du travail qu\u2019elle faisait au CGG, notamment des difficult\u00e9s qu\u2019elle avait avec M. Sinclair \u00e0 cause de ce qu\u2019elle percevait \u00eatre son engouement envers elle :\n[TRADUCTION] Et le genre d\u2019attention et d\u2019intensit\u00e9 de concentration de M. Sinclair, je devais faire face \u00e0 \u00e7a et je \u2013 je le savais. \u00c0 un certain point, il faut enlever les \u0153ill\u00e8res, il faut arr\u00eater de minimiser, il faut arr\u00eater de nier, de d\u00e9tourner, de rationaliser \u2013 en fait, je ne peux pas dire nier, mais rationaliser.\nIl fallait que je fasse quelque chose parce que j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par la mani\u00e8re dont M. Sinclair se comportait, c\u2019\u00e9tait lui qui \u00e9tait aux commandes, il avait l\u2019habitude d\u2019obtenir ce qu\u2019il voulait.\nComment faire pour faire face \u00e0 cela et garder mon emploi et essayer de r\u00e9sister \u2013 essayer de faire en sorte que cela arr\u00eate, de sorte que finalement \u2013 il m\u2019a fallu un certain temps. J\u2019\u00e9tais assez nerveuse, mais j\u2019en ai finalement parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Gail Roach-Leforte, et c\u2019\u00e9tait elle la gestionnaire de programme pour Giizhikaandag. Et, vous savez, je \u2013 je lui ai dit que \u2013 je lui ai dit qu\u2019il semblait penser qu\u2019il existait un lien d\u2019amiti\u00e9, et que je ne comprenais pas vraiment d\u2019o\u00f9 cela venait (inaudible) parce que moi je ne le ressentais pas, et que moi \u2013 il s\u2019arr\u00eatait chez moi et cela \u2013 je ne le voulais pas.\nJ\u2019avais tout simplement l\u2019impression que je ne pouvais pas \u2013 je ne pouvais pas fuir le travail, \u00e0 la maison, et c\u2019\u00e9tait alors \u2013 je ne sais pas quel est le mot exact pour le dire. C\u2019\u00e9tait effrayant. C\u2019\u00e9tait vraiment effrayant parce que \u2013 et aussi pour dire \u2013 juste avant cela, je venais tout juste de finir plusieurs ann\u00e9es d\u2019aide du Programme ontarien de soutien aux personnes handicap\u00e9es. J\u2019\u00e9tais partie (inaudible) pour une aide au logement. Je me sentais tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s vuln\u00e9rable.\nEt j\u2019ai dit en quelque sorte \u00e0 Gail, je crois qu\u2019il s\u2019int\u00e9resse \u00e0 moi \u2013 plus que comme une employ\u00e9e, et que lorsqu\u2019il r\u00e9alisera que ce n\u2019est pas ce que je veux et je \u2013 je ne lui donnais aucune indication que c\u2019\u00e9tait ce que je voulais, rien. Pour moi, cet espace personnel \u2013 comment dire \u2013 j\u2019avais peur que si je devais le lui dire directement, parce que sinon il ne semblait pas le comprendre, cela aurait mis mon emploi en p\u00e9ril.\nDonc \u2013 vous savez, j\u2019ai juste continu\u00e9 \u00e0 le subir \u2013 \u00e0 me replier sur moi-m\u00eame, \u00e0 t\u00e2cher d\u2019\u00e9viter, \u00e0 cr\u00e9er une distance, \u00e0 ne pas m\u2019engager, \u00e0 ne pas \u00eatre \u00e9motive, \u00e0 ne pas r\u00e9agir, qu\u2019il allait tout simplement s\u2019en remettre et passer \u00e0 autre chose.\nTranscription : page 188, lignes 22 \u00e0 25; page 189, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 190, lignes 1 \u00e0 19.\n[38] Quand Mme Nastiuk s\u2019est souvenue de la date du 20 juillet 2005 comme celle o\u00f9 elle est [TRADUCTION] \u00ab techniquement \u00bb devenue gestionnaire de cas avec plein salaire, elle a aussit\u00f4t fait un commentaire confus, que l\u2019on peut attribuer au stress et \u00e0 la confusion qu\u2019elle \u00e9prouvait face au fait d\u2019avoir \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner sans l\u2019aide et les conseils d\u2019un avocat comp\u00e9tent :\n[TRADUCTION] Cela a tout simplement paru comme si soudain \u2013 comme, je veux dire, comme si \u2013 comme si tout \u00e0 coup c\u2019\u00e9tait comme s\u2019il \u2013 je suppose que la fa\u00e7on de l\u2019expliquer, c\u2019est comme s\u2019il avait fondu sur moi et c\u2019\u00e9tait comme si je le lui avais dit \u00e0 lui et non pas au \u2013 juste au titulaire du poste.\n[39] Mme Nastiuk a ensuite d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n[TRADUCTION] Et je ne veux pas dire qu\u2019il me demandait des faveurs sexuelles, ou des faveurs sexuelles ou alors, ce genre de choses, c\u2019\u00e9tait juste comme si tout \u00e0 coup il a pens\u00e9 simplement que nous \u00e9tions, comme \u2013 comme s\u2019il y avait tout simplement un lien ou \u2013 c\u2019\u00e9tait plus que comme une relation directeur administratif\/superviseur\/gestionnaire de cas.\nTranscription : page 183, lignes 6 \u00e0 18.\n[40] Lors de son interrogatoire de Mme Roach-Leforte, Mme Nastiuk a demand\u00e9 si elle lui avait fait part de ses pr\u00e9occupations, et Mme Roach-Leforte a r\u00e9pondu :\n[TRADUCTION] [\u2026] Oui, vous l\u2019avez fait.

[\u2026] Je ne m\u2019attendais pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 entendre ce dont vous \u00eates venue vous plaindre \u00e0 moi.\nTranscription : page 1015, lignes 5 \u00e0 24.\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : Et de quoi s\u2019agissait-il?\nEh bien, je savais que Mme Nastiuk se sentait tr\u00e8s mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise \u00e0 la simple id\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9voquer cette question avec moi et elle \u2013 au d\u00e9but elle a vraiment tourn\u00e9 autour du pot. Elle m\u2019a d\u2019abord pos\u00e9 des questions. Je crois qu\u2019elle essayait d\u2019\u00e9valuer peut-\u00eatre num\u00e9ro un, si j\u2019\u00e9tais \u2013 si j\u2019allais v\u00e9ritablement lui pr\u00eater l\u2019oreille. Num\u00e9ro deux, si \u2013 si c\u2019\u00e9tait tout simplement une chose naturelle qui arrivait \u00e0 tout le monde.\nPar exemple, elle avait demand\u00e9 si M. Sinclair m\u2019avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pos\u00e9 des questions personnelles au sujet de choses que j\u2019avais v\u00e9cues et je lui ai dit, ouais, je lui ai parl\u00e9 de certaines choses. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, il n\u2019y avait rien de si personnel que \u00e7a, je lui ferais part de choses que je publierais de toute fa\u00e7on.\nEt, vous savez, ces questions me sont en quelque sorte venues \u00e0 l\u2019esprit, j\u2019ai dit pourquoi, qu\u2019est-ce qui se passe? Et, l\u00e0 encore, en tournant un peu autour du pot, elle a parl\u00e9 de la mesure dans laquelle elle se sentait mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise. Je ne me souviens pas des moindres d\u00e9tails, mais l\u2019essentiel \u00e9tait qu\u2019il y avait des choses qui vous arrivaient et qui vous mettaient tr\u00e8s mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise, des choses que vous n\u2019appr\u00e9ciez pas, des choses au sujet desquelles vous ne saviez pas quoi faire. Et, vous connaissez certains des d\u00e9tails, je me souviens juste de vous avoir dit, vous savez, il faut que vous fassiez quelque chose \u00e0 ce sujet, je suppose que vous veniez me demander conseil, mais j\u2019avais sugg\u00e9r\u00e9, je crois, que vous en parliez au chef ou au chef et au conseil.\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : Quand cette conversation a-t-elle eu lieu?\nC\u2019\u00e9tait au cours de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9. En juillet ou en ao\u00fbt 2005.\nIl y a eu plusieurs de ces discussions \u2013 nous en parlions parfois au travail, parfois nous \u2013 je sais que nous \u2013 vous et moi sommes all\u00e9es au lac \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 pour nous \u00e9loigner du programme et vous m\u2019avez parl\u00e9 de quelques pr\u00e9occupations [\u2026]\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : Vous a-t-elle donn\u00e9 des d\u00e9tails quelconques \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0?\nOuais, elle a parl\u00e9 de M. Sinclair, vous savez, du fait qu\u2019il se pr\u00e9sentait \u00e0 son domicile, elle a parl\u00e9 de, vous savez, les heures tardives. Il y a bien des choses que j\u2019ai vues avec lesquelles je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas \u00e0 l\u2019aise.\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : Comme quoi?\nUn jour, nous tenions une r\u00e9union du personnel et je me trouvais dans le b\u00e2timent central, c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9, et \u2013 et M. Sinclair m\u2019avait appel\u00e9e pour le rejoindre au \u2013 \u00e0 son b\u00e2timent afin de passer en revue des notes de l\u2019ordre du jour avant une r\u00e9union du personnel, et donc quand j\u2019y suis all\u00e9e, Mme Nastiuk se trouvait dans son bureau, \u00e0 genoux, en train d\u2019arranger l\u2019ourlet de ses pantalons et \u2013 oh mon Dieu, je vois encore le tableau. C\u2019\u00e9tait perturbant pour moi de voir que, et \u2013\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : Que voulez-vous dire par \u00ab arranger \u00bb?\nElle \u00e9tait \u00e0 genoux, en train d\u2019ajuster l\u2019ourlet, et ensuite il s\u2019est en quelque sorte tourn\u00e9 vers moi, s\u2019est esclaff\u00e9 et a dit, vous savez, je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas \u00e0 l\u2019aise dans mes pantalons, ils \u00e9taient trop longs. Et, ensuite, il le lui a fait refaire parce qu\u2019il a dit, oh, je pense maintenant qu\u2019ils sont trop courts, ou quelque chose du genre.\nEt je n\u2019ai pas - je n\u2019ai rien dit \u00e0 ce moment, j\u2019ai juste \u2013 c\u2019\u00e9tait tr\u00e8s perturbant. Et quand j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 plus tard \u00e0 Marlo, plus tard \u00e0 Mme Nastiuk, de quoi s\u2019agissait-il? Pourquoi faisiez-vous cela? Pourquoi avez-vous fait cela? Et elle a juste dit qu\u2019elle avait l\u2019impression qu\u2019elle devait le faire. Je lui ai donc dit \u2013 je crois lui avoir dit que cela correspond \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on de faire dont elle parlait, et c\u2019\u00e9tait juste plus, vous savez, une partie d\u2019une discussion que \u2013 de plusieurs discussions que nous avions eues. Et d\u2019une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente je lui avais sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019aller voir le chef et le conseil, c\u2019est du harc\u00e8lement, vous savez, peut-\u00eatre que vous devriez vous en plaindre \u00e0 la Commission des droits de la personne, ce n\u2019est pas correct, peut-\u00eatre que vous devriez vous adresser \u00e0 la Commission des relations de travail.\nMais j\u2019ai dit aussi qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait \u2013 elle se sentait intimid\u00e9e. Vous savez, personnellement, jamais je ne fausserais des comptes rendus et jamais je ne me mettrais \u00e0 quatre pattes pour arranger l\u2019ourlet de quelqu\u2019un; pour moi c\u2019est [\u2026] ce n\u2019\u00e9tait tout simplement pas correct.\nTranscription : pages 1016 \u00e0 1020.\n[41] Quand Mme Nastiuk lui a pos\u00e9 une question au sujet du comportement de M. Sinclair \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du CGG, Mme Roach-Leforte a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n[TRADUCTION] Un grand nombre de (vos) pr\u00e9occupations \u00e9taient centr\u00e9es sur le fait qu\u2019il se pr\u00e9sentait chez vous dans la soir\u00e9e, sans s\u2019annoncer, pour des motifs non li\u00e9s au travail. En fait, je me souviens d\u2019\u00eatre pass\u00e9e en automobile pr\u00e8s de chez vous, pas directement devant, mais sur l\u2019avenue Crow et d\u2019avoir vue que sa camionnette s\u2019y trouvait, et je vous en avais parl\u00e9 le lendemain, et vous m\u2019avez dit qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 et que Tiffany, votre fille, se trouvait l\u00e0 et que vous lui avez dit ou chuchot\u00e9, vous savez, reste ici.\nL\u00e0 encore, m\u00eame si chaque fois que vous aviez parl\u00e9 de choses comme celle-l\u00e0 je vous disais \u2013 je vous demandais, vous savez, de faire quelque chose \u00e0 ce sujet, vous devez faire quelque chose \u00e0 ce sujet. Dites-lui que, vous savez, que vous ne voulez pas que cela se passe ou que ce n\u2019est pas professionnel, mais vous aviez peur de le faire.\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : Vous souvenez-vous du moment o\u00f9 cela a eu lieu \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s?\n[\u2026] \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 [\u2026] 2005.\nTranscription : page 1027, lignes 12 \u00e0 25; page 1028, lignes 1 \u00e0 13.\n[42] Selon Mme Nastiuk, elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Roach-Leforte de garder ces confidences pour elle, car elle ne savait pas encore comment \u00ab qualifier \u00bb la conduite de M. Sinclair \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 faire de recherches sur Internet sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel.\n[TRADUCTION] Je suppose qu\u2019\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque-l\u00e0 environ, je me demandais, qu\u2019est ce qui peut bien se passer, parce que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas comme \u2013 vous savez, j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 consulter le site Web \u2013 le site Web des droits de la personne, quelle est la d\u00e9finition, de quoi s\u2019agit-il? Parce que \u00e7a ne figurait pas dans les exemples flagrants de harc\u00e8lement sexuel ou de ce genre de comportement que l\u2019on trouve sur ces sites, cela ne correspondait pas tout \u00e0 fait, mais on aurait dit simplement \u2013 c\u2019\u00e9tait presque plus difficile d\u2019y faire face et plus encore \u2013 je ne sais pas comment \u2013 c\u2019\u00e9tait tr\u00e8s d\u00e9rangeant. C\u2019\u00e9tait une v\u00e9ritable violation.\nMais j\u2019allais sur le site Web et je cherchais les informations. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u2013 comme, mis \u00e0 part, vous savez, les regards concupiscents, les commentaires sur la perte de poids, ce genre de choses. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas comme des attouchements ou le fait de dire que vous devez avoir des relations sexuelles avec moi sinon [\u2026], vous devez sortir avec moi pour d\u00eener sinon [\u2026], ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas les genres de comportement que l\u2019on voit \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s sur le site.\nAlors donc, de quoi s\u2019agit-il, et c\u2019\u00e9tait juste \u2013 ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u2013 \u00e7a ne semblait pas correct. Je savais que c\u2019\u00e9tait r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible. Ce comportement me mettait vraiment \u00e0 l'envers, mais, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi, il ne semblait pas correspondre aux crit\u00e8res que l\u2019on voit affich\u00e9s \u2013 il s\u2019agissait d\u2019exemples.\nTranscription : page 193, lignes 1 \u00e0 25.\n[43] Mme Nastiuk a ensuite relat\u00e9 que d\u2019autres choses avaient commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se produire, de petites choses : elle avait amen\u00e9 un parapluie au travail, et ensuite M. Sinclair en avait achet\u00e9 un; il savait qu\u2019elle faisait du patin \u00e0 roues align\u00e9es, il \u00e9tait all\u00e9 s\u2019en acheter une paire. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait une sorte de symbiose et que cela la mettait tout \u00e0 l\u2019envers. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, vers cette \u00e9poque, en juillet ao\u00fbt 2005, elle a d\u00e9couvert qu\u2019elle avait une l\u00e9g\u00e8re calvitie. Elle a soutenu que M. Sinclair t\u00e9l\u00e9phonait beaucoup et s\u2019arr\u00eatait souvent chez elle, toujours au sujet du travail, mais que sa visite tournait in\u00e9vitablement \u00e0 des questions personnelles que Mme Nastiuk assimilait \u00e0 de la psychanalyse; elle avait le sentiment que les choses qu\u2019il disait n\u2019avaient pas de sens, elles ne justifiaient pas le fait qu\u2019il se pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 son domicile.\n[44] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage direct, Mme Nastiuk a fait quelques all\u00e9gations tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9rales, ce qui a incit\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sidente \u00e0 lui demander de donner des exemples pr\u00e9cis :\n[TRADUCTION] Et je sais que c\u2019\u00e9tait vers le 23 ao\u00fbt quand \u2013 il me t\u00e9l\u00e9phonait beaucoup, me donnait beaucoup d\u2019informations, s\u2019arr\u00eatait encore chez moi souvent. Il \u00e9tait toujours question du travail. Cela se transformait en questions sur moi-m\u00eame, mais m\u00eame cela n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u2013 c\u2019est devenu plus intense. Cette partie de ce comportement est devenue plus intense \u00e0 l\u2019automne.\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : Plus intense, voulez-vous dire plus personnel ou plus fr\u00e9quent?\nMme Nastiuk : Je ne dirais pas plus souvent, mais c\u2019\u00e9tait comme s\u2019il essayait de bien se faire comprendre et c\u2019\u00e9tait comme si cela avait chang\u00e9 et c\u2019\u00e9tait plus comme une psychanalyse, mais cette psychanalyse c\u2019est comme \u2013 et il commen\u00e7ait toujours par parler du travail et ensuite \u00e7a se transformait en cela et c\u2019\u00e9tait comme, qu\u2019est-ce que vous faites? Je me disais, pourquoi faites-vous cela?\nEt tout ce qu\u2019il disait n\u2019avait tout simplement aucun sens. Pour moi, ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas logique. Jamais je n\u2019avais entendu quelqu\u2019un me dire ces choses auparavant, et cela \u2013 ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas logique.\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : Et quand vous dites ces choses, quelles sont ces choses?\nMme Nastiuk : Ces choses \u2013 je ne me souviens pas exactement de ce que ces choses \u00e9taient parce qu\u2019elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas logiques, elles me mettaient en col\u00e8re. Elles n\u2019avaient pas leur place dans ma vie pour nos conversations. Elles ne justifiaient pas le fait qu\u2019il se pr\u00e9sente chez moi. C\u2019\u00e9tait simplement \u2013 je n\u2019allais pas \u2013 c\u2019\u00e9tait incongru. Pourquoi est-ce que je m\u2019en souviendrais?\nApr\u00e8s, \u00e0 la fin, quand j\u2019ai finalement commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 mettre les choses ensemble et \u00e0 enlever tout simplement mes \u0153ill\u00e8res et \u00e0 faire face \u00e0 la situation, je me suis dit que c\u2019\u00e9tait plus de la projection. C\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019impression que \u00e7a faisait.\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : Pouvez-vous m\u2019en donner un exemple?\nMme Nastiuk : Pas vraiment. Non \u2013 pas vraiment \u2013 et je sais que j\u2019ai essay\u00e9 d\u2019y penser, mais, pour moi, c\u2019\u00e9tait incongru, je ne pouvais \u2013 je ne pouvais pas m\u2019en souvenir. [\u2026]\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : [\u2026], mais je veux dire les choses qu\u2019il vous a dites que \u2013 vous employez des mots forts comme horrible et inappropri\u00e9 [\u2026] psychanalyse et ceci, mais vous ne donnez aucun d\u00e9tail [\u2026]\nMme Nastiuk : Je me souviens juste exactement de la fa\u00e7on dont je me sentais, cela me mettait en col\u00e8re. Cela me f\u00e2chait de savoir qu\u2019il se pr\u00e9sentait chez moi en faisant cela. Je ne sais m\u00eame pas si \u2013 apr\u00e8s un temps, c\u2019\u00e9tait juste \u2013 j\u2019\u00e9tais tout simplement furieuse et effray\u00e9e et la seule \u2013 il y a une conversation dont je me souviens ou des commentaires qu\u2019il a faits parce que les autres \u00e9taient tout simplement hors de propos.\nTranscription : page 196, lignes 7 \u00e0 25; page 197, lignes 1 \u00e0 23; page 198, lignes 8 \u00e0 22.\n[45] M\u00eame si elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises qu\u2019elle souffrait en silence, et qu\u2019il lui \u00e9tait impossible de confronter M. Sinclair et de lui demander d\u2019arr\u00eater quand il faisait des commentaires personnels qu\u2019elle jugeait offensants \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, Mme Nastiuk a dit aussi qu\u2019il arrivait parfois que M. Sinclair et elle aient des conversations personnelles normales et qu\u2019il y avait d\u2019autres occasions o\u00f9 elle le contredisait.\nG. Les faits survenus au cours de l\u2019automne 2005 [46] Selon Mme Roach-Leforte, le milieu de travail a continu\u00e9 de se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer et, de ce fait, sa relation avec Mme Nastiuk au cours des mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt \u00e0 octobre 2005 en a souffert.\n[TRADUCTION] \u00c0 mon avis? Le milieu de travail dans son ensemble a sembl\u00e9 devenir de nouveau tr\u00e8s n\u00e9gatif. Ce qui \u00e9tait \u2013 je veux dire, en r\u00e9trospective je crois que je peux l\u2019expliquer, mais \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, vous savez, les gens \u00e9taient en train de devenir \u2013 vous savez, ils commen\u00e7aient \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer le programme de mani\u00e8re vraiment positive, nous accomplissions des choses dans le programme qui faisaient du milieu de travail un endroit agr\u00e9able, mais la situation devenait plus n\u00e9gative.\nJe sais que M. Sinclair vous (Mme Nastiuk) a laiss\u00e9 entendre d\u2019autres choses. Il allait vous envoyer suivre pour cela une formation, et vous aviez fait des commentaires sur la mani\u00e8re \u2013 je n\u2019en suis pas s\u00fbre \u2013 de quel programme pr\u00e9cis ou partie de programme il s\u2019agissait, mais qu\u2019il allait vous faire voyager davantage, et d\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 il vous disait, vous savez, que je me plaignais de vous et que je me plaignais de votre travail. Et vous, vous me posiez la question, est-ce que j\u2019ai fait quelque chose de mal, et je vous disais non, ou, vous savez, rien dont je ne suis au courant.\nJe pense donc que \u2013 je n\u2019ai pas \u2013 je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas \u2013 je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas \u2013 j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 devenir tr\u00e8s m\u00e9fiante au sujet de ce qui \u00e9tait la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, qui disait quoi? Et vous et moi avons continu\u00e9 de parler de choses, mais c\u2019\u00e9tait \u2013 je ne savais pas si M. Sinclair, il me disait des choses, et vous disiez ensuite non, pour ces choses. Et il vous disait des choses et je vous disais non, et nous \u00e9tions donc en train de devenir tr\u00e8s \u2013 comment dire, empoisonn\u00e9es je suppose, juste le milieu de travail.\nTranscription : page 1029, lignes 13 \u00e0 25; page 1030, lignes 1 \u00e0 19.\n[47] En octobre 2005, Mme Roach-Leforte et Mme Nastiuk sont all\u00e9es \u00e0 Madison (Wisconsin) pour assister \u00e0 une conf\u00e9rence d\u2019une semaine sur la violence sexuelle et, pendant ce temps, elles ont pu r\u00e9tablir en partie leur relation :\n[TRADUCTION] (Mme Roach-Leforte) [\u2026] et je crois que le simple fait d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9loign\u00e9e comme cela vous a permis de me parler davantage de ce qui vous pr\u00e9occupait.

Vers la fin de cette conversation, M.

Sinclair au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, des r\u00e9unions qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas souvent li\u00e9es au travail, ainsi que du fait qu\u2019il a continu\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9senter chez elle, ce qui, selon ses dires, lui donnait l\u2019impression qu\u2019il essayait de la manipuler. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, elle s\u2019est souvenue d\u2019avoir assist\u00e9 \u00e0 une conf\u00e9rence \u00e0 Dryden (Ontario) en compagnie d\u2019autres membres du CGG.

Mme Nastiuk lui a dit qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas certaine qu\u2019il serait capable de proc\u00e9der de la bonne fa\u00e7on, mais elle a n\u00e9anmoins accept\u00e9, \u00e0 contrec\u0153ur, de le faire. \u00c0 son avis, cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 un fiasco.\n[TRADUCTION] J\u2019avais le sentiment que j\u2019\u00e9tais celle qui avait tort face aux deux, et je sentais bien que les choses n\u2019allaient pas dans la bonne direction.

[\u2026] J\u2019ai dit que je ne pouvais pas continuer. Je suis partie et \u2013 tr\u00e8s contrari\u00e9e, et cela a mis fin \u00e0 cette affaire.

Tout d\u2019abord, les installations de soins en \u00e9tablissement sont des endroits parfois tr\u00e8s explosifs. Nous travaillons avec un groupe d\u2019enfants agit\u00e9s, extr\u00eamement en col\u00e8re, de sorte que le personnel subit beaucoup de pression, et le personnel ne peut pas se d\u00e9fouler sur les enfants, ce qui fait que parfois les employ\u00e9s ont tendance \u00e0 \u2013 se d\u00e9fouler les uns sur les autres. Je ne connais pas d\u2019autre fa\u00e7on de le dire. C\u2019est un endroit assez difficile o\u00f9 travailler et \u2013 il y avait beaucoup de tension, pas juste \u2013 il y avait beaucoup de luttes internes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tage, comprenez-vous, des gens qui avaient leur propre opinion sur la fa\u00e7on dont un pensionnaire doit \u00eatre trait\u00e9, et ce genre de choses. Cela contribuait donc \u00e0 un degr\u00e9 de tension qui rendait les choses parfois tr\u00e8s inconfortables. Nous devons faire la distinction entre un comportement apparent et ce qu\u2019un jeune ressent vraiment, et c\u2019est \u00e0 cela que servent les employ\u00e9s professionnels tandis qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tage lui-m\u00eame, ils ont affaire aux comportements r\u00e9els du jeune \u00e0 mesure que le temps avance. [\u2026] et il y avait beaucoup de, comment dirais-je, de coups de poignard dans le dos, beaucoup d\u2019insultes \u00e0 propos de presque tout le monde l\u00e0-bas. Vous savez, la situation \u00e9tait telle qu\u2019il y avait des fois o\u00f9 je rentrais \u00e0 la maison assez frustr\u00e9 par l\u2019atmosph\u00e8re qui y r\u00e9gnait.\nTranscription : page 60, ligne 25; page 61, lignes 1 \u00e0 22, 24 et 25; page 62, lignes 1 \u00e0 4.\n[59] M.

Apr\u00e8s bien des discussions sur l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 elle pourrait accomplir son travail, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu qu\u2019elle aurait un bureau \u00e0 domicile :\n[TRADUCTION] Nous avons achet\u00e9 tout ce qu\u2019il fallait pour que je fasse le travail.

Sinclair avait besoin pour un cours de c\u00e9ramique. Elle s\u2019est souvenue d\u2019avoir commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler au projet au d\u00e9but du mois de f\u00e9vrier, qu\u2019elle se sentait mieux, moins stress\u00e9e, mais ses espoirs se sont att\u00e9nu\u00e9s quand elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 demander \u00e0 M.

L\u2019autre chose, par contre, je l\u2019avais d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu auparavant \u00e9liminer graduellement des postes, et une fa\u00e7on de le faire serait de \u2013 j\u2019ai pens\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait peut \u00eatre une fa\u00e7on d\u2019essayer de se d\u00e9barrasser de moi : si j\u2019acceptais le poste, que le programme ne passait pas et qu\u2019il avait promis la gestion de cas \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre, je n\u2019aurais pas de travail.\nEt, pour moi, toutes ces options \u00e9taient possibles.

La conduite de M. Sinclair a inclus une s\u00e9rie de violations importunes et s\u2019\u00e9tendant au-del\u00e0 du lieu de travail et de nature avilissante, persistante et abusive. Cela s\u2019est sold\u00e9 par la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un milieu psychologique et \u00e9motionnel n\u00e9gatif et inacceptable pour le travail.\n[77] \u00c0 la suite d\u2019un certain nombre de conversations entre Mme Nastiuk et le chef McPherson, une r\u00e9union de m\u00e9diation a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e au 22 juin 2006 :\n[TRADUCTION] Apr\u00e8s un certain nombre de conversations entre le chef McPherson et moi, ceci a \u00e9t\u00e9 le point culminant de cela, et j\u2019ai dress\u00e9 cette liste de certaines choses dont je voulais qu\u2019on traite \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation informelle dont il m\u2019avait parl\u00e9.\nEt pour savoir en fait comment cela est arriv\u00e9, nous avons eu un certain nombre d\u2019appels.

Et il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord avec moi pour ce qui est des choses qui figuraient ici.\n[\u2026] \u00c0 la fin de la r\u00e9union, le chef McPherson m\u2019a dit qu\u2019il y avait un travail que j\u2019avais \u00e0 faire, mais qu\u2019aucun changement ne serait apport\u00e9 parce que cela reviendrait \u00e0 admettre que Tom \u00e9tait coupable et il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 faire cela, et il a fait un commentaire sur, par exemple, si que je vous donnais 5 000 $, cela reviendrait \u00e0 admettre qu\u2019il est coupable et \u00e7a, je ne peux pas le faire.\nL\u2019un des derniers commentaires a \u00e9t\u00e9 que je devais lui en reparler plus tard et dire ce que je voulais. Mais je suis sortie de l\u00e0 en me disant, eh bien, il vient de me dire qu\u2019il ne va rien faire de toute fa\u00e7on, donc je me suis adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission.\nTranscription : page 274, lignes 13 \u00e0 25; page 275, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 276, lignes 1 \u00e0 9.\n[78] Selon Mme Roach-Leforte, la plainte de Mme Nastiuk n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la premi\u00e8re que la PNC avait re\u00e7ue contre M. Sinclair. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Roach-Leforte a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019en mai 2006, peu avant la rencontre de Mme Nastiuk avec le chef McPherson, elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la PNC contre M. Sinclair, \u00e0 propos de ce qui \u00e9tait, selon elle, un comportement non professionnel de la part de M. Sinclair \u00e0 son \u00e9gard et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des membres du personnel.\n[79] Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de Dale Morrisseau, le gestionnaire de la PNC, Mme Roach-Leforte a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le comportement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas aussi marqu\u00e9 ou aussi constant que celui avec lequel Mme Nastiuk devait composer, et que les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par d\u2019autres membres du personnel n\u2019avaient pas trait \u00e0 du harc\u00e8lement sexuel, mais plut\u00f4t au pouvoir et au contr\u00f4le que M. Sinclair exer\u00e7ait sur le programme du CGG.\n[80] Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aussi que la raison pour laquelle elle ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas adress\u00e9e au chef McPherson pour le compte de Mme Nastiuk \u00e9tait qu\u2019elle aussi avait peur pour son emploi. (Transcription : page 1127, lignes 5 \u00e0 25; page 1128, lignes 1 \u00e0 24).\nM. Les plaintes [81] Le 25 juillet 2006, Mme Nastiuk a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte no 20060869 contre la PNC et la plainte no 20061038 contre M. Sinclair, all\u00e9guant avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement sexuel au travail entre les mois de mars 2005 et de juillet 2006.\n[82] Mme Nastiuk est partie en cong\u00e9 de maladie du 1er au 4 juin 2006, elle a pris ensuite trois semaines de vacances et a \u00e9t\u00e9 absente du travail jusqu\u2019au 28 janvier 2007. En octobre 2006, Mme Nastiuk a rencontr\u00e9 le chef et le conseil et a produit des demandes \u00e9crites qui, selon ses dires, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas des exigences, mais avaient pour but de servir de fondement \u00e0 des n\u00e9gociations ou \u00e0 une m\u00e9diation au sujet de sa plainte. \u00c9tait incluse dans sa demande, \u00e0 titre de compromis, une d\u00e9claration indiquant qu\u2019elle accepterait un nouvel emploi aupr\u00e8s de la PNC, mais pas au CGG.\n[83] Pendant que cela se passait, Mme Nastiuk a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de prestations d\u2019assurance emploi compte tenu du fait qu\u2019elle avait fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un cong\u00e9diement d\u00e9guis\u00e9 :\n[TRADUCTION] Me Bryson : Vous nous dites donc qu\u2019\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un cong\u00e9diement d\u00e9guis\u00e9 de la part de M. Sinclair?\nMme Nastiuk : Les circonstances, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un cong\u00e9diement d\u00e9guis\u00e9.\nMe Bryson : De la part de qui?\nMme Nastiuk : Il y avait des raisons pour lesquelles je ne pouvais pas retourner au centre de gu\u00e9rison, et M. Sinclair en \u00e9tait responsable en grande partie. La fa\u00e7on dont le programme avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 pour fonctionner, tout cela en faisait partie. C\u2019\u00e9tait \u2013\nMe Bryson : Mais je vous le demande, qui vous a cong\u00e9di\u00e9? C\u2019est cela que je vous demande.\nMme Nastiuk : C\u2019\u00e9tait un cong\u00e9diement d\u00e9guis\u00e9. Je suis partie.\nMe Bryson : Mais par qui? M. Sinclair ou le chef et le conseil [\u2026] ?\nMme Nastiuk : Eh bien, ce serait les deux parce que Couchiching n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u00e0 pour faire preuve de diligence raisonnable. M. Sinclair \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 diriger le programme, \u00e0 embaucher et \u00e0 cong\u00e9dier comme bon lui semblait.\nTranscription : page 628, lignes 4 \u00e0 25; page 629, ligne 1.\n[84] Pendant toute cette p\u00e9riode, Mme Nastiuk a fait plusieurs tentatives pour trouver un autre travail. Le 24 octobre 2006, elle a pass\u00e9 une entrevue pour un poste d\u2019agente de probation au minist\u00e8re de la Justice du Manitoba. On lui a dit qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait bien d\u00e9brouill\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue. Cependant, la personne-ressource charg\u00e9e du processus d\u2019embauche, Rose Bear, a par la suite inform\u00e9 Mme Nastiuk qu\u2019il lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible d\u2019obtenir des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences de M. Sinclair et que cela \u00e9tait essentiel au processus, car il \u00e9tait le directeur administratif du CGG. Mme Nastiuk a aussi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature, sans succ\u00e8s toutefois, aux postes de conseill\u00e8re en \u00e9tudes postsecondaires, administratrice du logement, travailleuse des services familiaux et adjointe en \u00e9ducation sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e, tous des postes qu\u2019offrait la PNC.\n[85] En d\u00e9cembre 2006, Mme Nastiuk a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au gestionnaire de la PNC, Dale Morrisseau, une liste de conditions dans lesquelles elle retournerait travailler au CGG \u00e0 titre de gestionnaire de cas, en n\u2019ayant, notamment, aucun contact direct avec M. Sinclair.\n[TRADUCTION] Me Bryson : Tr\u00e8s bien. Je veux que ce soit clair. \u00c0 partir du moment en juin 2006 o\u00f9 vous avez port\u00e9 cette affaire \u00e0 l\u2019attention de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Couchiching, M. Sinclair n\u2019a jamais eu de contact ind\u00e9pendant avec vous de nouveau, chez vous \u00e0 la maison ou par votre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone r\u00e9sidentiel, n\u2019est-ce pas?\nMme Nastiuk : Durant le mois de juin, je crois qu\u2019il y a \u2013\nMe Bryson : Non, ce que je veux dire, c\u2019est apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union avec le chef en juin \u2013 fin juin 2006?\nMme Nastiuk : Non, je ne m\u2019en souviens pas.\nMe Bryson : Donc, le seul contact que vous auriez eu avec M. Sinclair apr\u00e8s ce stade aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 au moment o\u00f9 vous seriez revenue au travail, au CGG, est-ce exact?\nMme Nastiuk : Oui.\nMe Bryson : Et cela c\u2019\u00e9tait conform\u00e9ment aux conditions dont vous aviez convenu avec M. Morrisseau et M. Sinclair, est-ce exact?\nMme Nastiuk : M. Morrisseau a souscrit aux conditions que j\u2019avais r\u00e9dig\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment aux instructions de la Commission ou suivant sa recommandation.\nTranscription : page 641, lignes 3 \u00e0 25; page 642, lignes 1 et 2.\n[86] Mme Nastiuk est ensuite retourn\u00e9e travailler au CGG, une exp\u00e9rience qu\u2019elle a qualifi\u00e9e de traumatisante. Selon elle, malgr\u00e9 les conditions de l\u2019entente concernant son retour au travail, M. Sinclair a persist\u00e9 \u00e0 envahir ses limites personnelles et la PNC n\u2019a rien fait de concret pour faire obstacle \u00e0 ses agissements et \u00e0 ses omissions :\n[TRADUCTION] Mme Nastiuk : Je suis partie \u00e0 cause de la fa\u00e7on dont M. Sinclair me rabaissait et avait totalement chang\u00e9 les responsabilit\u00e9s de ma \u2013 description de t\u00e2ches et parce que je m\u2019\u00e9tais rendu compte au cours des quelques semaines pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes que les choses s\u2019aggravaient encore et je savais que je \u2013 je ne me sentais pas en s\u00e9curit\u00e9, notamment avec la m\u00e9diation qui s\u2019en venait. Et je me disais que les choses allaient juste empirer \u2013 je savais que les choses allaient empirer et c\u2019est pourquoi je suis partie.\nMe Bryson : Et comment le saviez-vous?\nMme Nastiuk : Parce que c\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9vident. Il y avait une constante. Chaque \u2013 quand il \u00e9tait \u2013 c\u2019\u00e9tait comme \u2013 quand je suis revenue au cours de 2007, de temps en temps je sortais de mon bureau et il \u00e9tait l\u00e0, assis droit \u2013 dans un fauteuil juste \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de mon bureau et je me disais, eh bien, bon Dieu, cela est tout \u00e0 fait contraire \u00e0 l\u2019entente, et je recevais plus tard un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de Krista Dezaso et je d\u00e9couvrais qu\u2019en fait elle s\u2019\u00e9tait entretenue avec M. Sinclair plus t\u00f4t ce jour-l\u00e0. Pour moi, c\u2019\u00e9tait donc de l\u2019intimidation.\nMe Bryson : Vous n\u2019avez pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief \u00e0 ce sujet aupr\u00e8s de la PNC, n\u2019est-ce pas?\nMme Nastiuk : Je ne pouvais pas d\u00e9poser un grief pour tout, mais je suis s\u00fbre d\u2019avoir discut\u00e9 de ce genre de choses, pas chaque fois, cela arrivait trop souvent et je ne pouvais pas toujours arr\u00eater et appeler Dale et dire, Dale [\u2026]\nMais assez souvent je le laissais savoir \u00e0 Dale, soit par \u00e9crit, soit par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Et apr\u00e8s un certain temps, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 probablement plus facile de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner tout simplement, plut\u00f4t que de remplir tous les documents.\nMe Bryson : Mais vous n\u2019avez pas t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u2013\nMme Nastiuk : \u00c0 quoi bon? Rien ne marchait, m\u00eame si j\u2019en informais Dale. Les choses ne s\u2019am\u00e9lioraient pas, elles empiraient.\nTranscription : page 663, lignes 14 \u00e0 25; page 664, 1 \u00e0 25; page 665, lignes 102.\n[87] En ao\u00fbt 2007, agissant en vertu de son pouvoir d\u2019administrateur de bande, M. Morrisseau a autoris\u00e9 Mme Nastiuk \u00e0 s\u2019absenter du travail jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019une m\u00e9diation pr\u00e9alablement organis\u00e9e avec la Commission des droits de la personne ait lieu. Tant M. Morrisseau que Mme Nastiuk esp\u00e9raient recourir \u00e0 une m\u00e9diation de la Commission en vue de r\u00e9gler sa plainte tout enti\u00e8re.\n[88] Vers le 15 ao\u00fbt 2007, M. Morrisseau a transmis des conditions de r\u00e8glement, obtenues par voie de m\u00e9diation, au chef et au conseil; cependant, \u00e0 sa grande surprise ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 celle de Mme Nastiuk, le r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9. Au cours de la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode et par co\u00efncidence, M. Sinclair a mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi qu\u2019il exer\u00e7ait au sein de la PNC, ayant trouv\u00e9 un emploi qui lui convenait davantage aupr\u00e8s d\u2019une autre Premi\u00e8re Nation.\n[89] Mme Nastiuk n\u2019est pas retourn\u00e9e au travail et a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte de cong\u00e9diement d\u00e9guis\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de Ressources humaines et D\u00e9veloppement des comp\u00e9tences Canada en novembre 2007.\nN. La plainte de repr\u00e9sailles [90] Le 31 mars 2008, Mme Nastiuk a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte de repr\u00e9sailles contre la PNC en vertu de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP, all\u00e9guant que les repr\u00e9sailles avaient eu lieu [TRADUCTION] \u00ab \u00e0 partir du 16 ao\u00fbt 2006 \u00bb.\n[91] Mme Nastiuk soutient que la PNC \u00e9tait tenue d\u2019offrir un lieu de travail sain et s\u00fbr et qu\u2019elle ne l\u2019avait pas fait. Elle all\u00e8gue aussi que la PNC n\u2019a pas pu pr\u00e9venir sa plainte, ni r\u00e9agi convenablement \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re, m\u00eame si elle \u00e9tait au courant des d\u00e9tails pr\u00e9cis. Selon Mme Nastiuk, la PNC n\u2019a pr\u00e9vu aucune mesure de pr\u00e9vention et a omis de prendre des mesures correctives concr\u00e8tes et d\u2019att\u00e9nuer les cons\u00e9quences et les pr\u00e9judices qu\u2019elle a subis.\nIII. La r\u00e9ponse de M. Sinclair [92] M. Sinclair est un Ojibway, n\u00e9 et \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00e0 Fort Frances, le septi\u00e8me de neuf enfants. Il a grandi dans une famille o\u00f9 la m\u00e8re \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s bonne et le p\u00e8re violent. Il a travaill\u00e9 dans le domaine de la construction pour un entrepreneur en ma\u00e7onnerie, a appris le m\u00e9tier et a lanc\u00e9 sa propre entreprise tout en travaillant pour cet entrepreneur. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, il \u00e9tait au milieu de la vingtaine, mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re de deux enfants. Us\u00e9 par le travail physique, M. Sinclair a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher comment devenir conseiller et il y est arriv\u00e9 :\n[TRADUCTION] C\u2019est ainsi que depuis les trente derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, je consacre ma vie \u00e0 travailler aupr\u00e8s des membres, des enfants et des familles des Premi\u00e8res nations, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 mettre sur pied des services de gu\u00e9rison pour mon peuple. Et j\u2019ai mis au point de nombreux programmes et services au fil des ans.\nTranscription : page 2079, lignes 22 \u00e0 25; page 2080, ligne 1.\n[93] \u00c0 la fin de 2005, M. Sinclair a re\u00e7u un appel du chef McPherson, qui lui demandait d\u2019aider \u00e0 r\u00e9gler une crise de gestion qui avait \u00e9clat\u00e9 au centre de gu\u00e9rison Giizhikaandag de la Bande, \u00e0 Fort Frances. En moins d\u2019une semaine, il avait pass\u00e9 en revue le programme du CGG, ses r\u00e9sultats et ses renseignements financiers, et il avait \u00e9tabli un plan de restructuration.\n[94] Le plan de restructuration a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au minist\u00e8re de la province, en compagnie du chef McPherson et de Mme Roach-Leforte. Le CGG a obtenu une licence provisoire lui permettant de continuer de fonctionner pendant trois mois; cependant, sa client\u00e8le serait limit\u00e9e \u00e0 quatre jeunes en traitement, plut\u00f4t que le nombre maximal habituel de huit.\nA. Le travail avec Mme Nastiuk [95] M. Sinclair a d\u00e9crit la situation \u00e0 laquelle il \u00e9tait confront\u00e9 ainsi que la fa\u00e7on dont il a travaill\u00e9 avec Mme Roach-Leforte et Mme Nastiuk :\n[TRADUCTION] [\u2026] Ma personne-ressource principale \u00e9tait Gail Roach-Leforte. [\u2026] Donc, au tout d\u00e9but, il y avait Gail et moi-m\u00eame qui examinions le travail qu\u2019il fallait faire pour am\u00e9liorer le service et apporter des changements aux services fournis au centre de gu\u00e9rison Giizhikaandag.\nJ\u2019avais maintenant besoin d\u2019une personne pour s\u2019occuper du traitement de texte, de la dactylographie. Il y avait des travaux de d\u00e9veloppement que je devais faire, mais nous avions quatre gar\u00e7ons en traitement et j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la meilleure fa\u00e7on de le faire, de me permettre de faire mon travail \u00e9tait de demander \u00e0 Gail de s\u2019occuper du volet \u00ab traitement \u00bb, de se concentrer principalement sur le volet \u00ab traitement \u00bb, le programme existant, et, moi, je m\u2019occuperais du travail, du travail de d\u00e9veloppement en vue d\u2019am\u00e9liorer le service. Et c\u2019est ce qui est arriv\u00e9.\nUne partie de ce travail se faisait avec le traitement de texte. Moi, je suis nul devant un ordinateur et en dactylographie. J\u2019ai toujours eu des membres du personnel qui faisaient ce travail. Et j\u2019ai fait savoir \u00e0 Gail que j\u2019avais besoin de quelqu\u2019un, il fallait que j\u2019engage quelqu\u2019un qui pouvait le faire et bien le faire. Elle a recommand\u00e9 Marlo Nastiuk, qui \u00e9tait \u2013 travaillait au Giizhikaandag comme pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e de rel\u00e8ve.\nGail et Marlo s\u2019\u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 rencontr\u00e9es auparavant [\u2026] Gail a dit qu\u2019elle savait que Marlo voulait faire davantage d\u2019heures de travail et avait d\u2019excellentes comp\u00e9tences en mati\u00e8re de dactylographie, et je me suis donc organis\u00e9 pour que Marlo vienne me rencontrer. Cela a eu lieu. Nous avons parl\u00e9 du travail qu\u2019il fallait faire. Et \u2013 comme, un guide de proc\u00e9dures et d\u2019autres documents et ainsi de suite qu\u2019il fallait am\u00e9liorer. Et c\u2019\u00e9tait \u2013 nous \u2013 nous nous sommes entendus et elle a convenu qu\u2019elle ferait ce travail l\u00e0.\nTranscription : page 2097, lignes 8 \u00e0 25; page 2098, lignes 1 \u00e0 7 et 12 \u00e0 20.\n[96] M. Sinclair a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait, \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de son bureau, une vaste pi\u00e8ce dans laquelle se trouvait une table habituellement utilis\u00e9e pour les r\u00e9unions du personnel et les conf\u00e9rences. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le premier poste de travail de Mme Nastiuk se trouvait dans cette pi\u00e8ce, \u00e0 une table distincte situ\u00e9e dans le coin, o\u00f9 elle avait son ordinateur et du mat\u00e9riel de bureau :\n[TRADUCTION] [\u2026] des r\u00e9unions avaient encore lieu dans cette zone externe et elle s\u2019effor\u00e7ait de faire son travail dans le coin de cette m\u00eame pi\u00e8ce pendant que certaines r\u00e9unions se d\u00e9roulaient, elle est venue me voir et m\u2019a dit : c\u2019est impossible. Cela ne fonctionne pas. Et Mme Nastiuk a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que, dans mon bureau, si je d\u00e9pla\u00e7ais quelques \u00e9l\u00e9ments du mobilier, elle pourrait installer son mat\u00e9riel dans mon bureau, dans le coin de mon bureau, et \u00e7a, c\u2019est Mme Nastiuk qui l\u2019a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[\u2026] c\u2019\u00e9tait une situation fort inusit\u00e9e. Je m\u2019en m\u00e9fiais. Elle en a parl\u00e9 davantage et, en fait, c\u2019est la fa\u00e7on dont mon \u00e9pouse et moi-m\u00eame travaillons lorsque j\u2019effectue, \u00e0 partir de chez moi, du travail de d\u00e9veloppement. [\u2026]\nJ\u2019ai accept\u00e9 que sa table de travail soit situ\u00e9e dans le coin de mon bureau et que cela lui permette de quitter l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 les r\u00e9unions avaient lieu et \u2013 c\u2019est cela qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9.\n[\u2026] le bureau de Marlo a fini par \u00eatre am\u00e9nag\u00e9 dans l\u2019autre b\u00e2timent apr\u00e8s un certain temps. [\u2026]\nTranscription : page 2108, lignes 5 \u00e0 17; page 2109, lignes 2 \u00e0 5, 22 et 23.\n[97] M. Sinclair a parl\u00e9 de son arrangement de travail avec Mme Nastiuk au cours des trois premiers mois de restructuration du programme du CGG :\n[TRADUCTION] [\u2026] Je passais en revue les feuilles, j\u2019effectuais des changements pour ce nouveau programme, je les lui remettais, elle apportait les changements \u00e0 l\u2019ordinateur. Et le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu pour la restructuration de ce programme \u00e9tait de trois mois [\u2026] il fallait qu\u2019il y ait une quantit\u00e9 consid\u00e9rable de travail parce que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas juste le guide de proc\u00e9dures. Il y avait des changements qui avaient lieu dans d\u2019autres secteurs du programme.\nIl y avait des rapports, et il n\u2019y avait pas eu de directeur depuis un certain temps. Il y avait des rapports qu\u2019il fallait \u00e9tablir, qui \u00e9taient en retard. Il y avait donc du rattrapage \u00e0 faire dans certains secteurs; en m\u00eame temps, il y avait de nouveaux travaux de d\u00e9veloppement qui se produisaient [\u2026] c\u2019\u00e9tait vraiment occup\u00e9 [\u2026]\nMais, en plus de cela, il y avait d\u2019autres travaux qui se d\u00e9roulaient. Il y avait des documents qui \u00e9taient en retard, et parfois nous mettions de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le travail relatif au guide de proc\u00e9dures et nous accomplissions d\u2019autres t\u00e2ches qu\u2019il fallait effectuer. Il y avait donc aussi du rattrapage. [\u2026]\nTranscription : page 2110, lignes 19 \u00e0 25; page 2111, lignes 1 \u00e0 7 et 21 \u00e0 25; page 2112, ligne 1.\n[98] M. Sinclair a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait eu des conversations personnelles avec Mme Nastiuk au cours des trois premiers mois de restructuration du programme du CGG :\n[TRADUCTION] Vous savez, il arrivait que nous arr\u00eations de travailler, que nous prenions un caf\u00e9, et que nous bavardions. Et \u00e7a n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 long \u2013 il ne m\u2019a pas fallu longtemps pour me rendre compte que Mme Nastiuk [\u2026] avait d\u2019excellentes comp\u00e9tences. [\u2026] Elle avait \u00e0 c\u0153ur le travail qu\u2019il fallait accomplir.\nTravailler toute la journ\u00e9e et prendre une pause au souper ou prendre une pause avec les gar\u00e7ons ou qui que ce soit d\u2019autre pour souper, sortir et aller chercher du poulet ou autre chose et le ramener pour souper, des choses comme celles-l\u00e0 arrivaient et le travail se poursuivait dans \u2013 dans la soir\u00e9e. Prendre une pause, prendre un caf\u00e9 et \u2013 parfois parler.\nIl n\u2019a pas fallu longtemps pour se rendre compte que cette \u2013 personne, vous savez, avec ce nouveau dipl\u00f4me, elle \u00e9tait \u2013 cherchait du travail, mais n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u2013 et elle m\u2019a fait savoir qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas eu de succ\u00e8s [\u2026] Mais il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident qu\u2019elle avait des comp\u00e9tences et [\u2026] qu\u2019elle apprenait rapidement.\nPendant nos pauses, nous parlions surtout du travail. Du travail qui se faisait, du travail qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, mais il y avait aussi des fois o\u00f9 nous parlions d\u2019une \u00e9mission de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision ou d\u2019un autre sujet, comprenez-vous? Nos pauses-caf\u00e9 duraient dix, quinze minutes, et nous retournions au travail. La plupart du temps, le travail durait jusqu\u2019\u00e0 18 h 30 ou 19 h pour ce manuel ou d\u2019autres documents qu\u2019il fallait \u00e9tablir \u2013 terminer.\nTranscription : page 2113, lignes 10 \u00e0 25; page 2114, lignes 1 \u00e0 17.\n[99] M.

Elle parlait de \u2013 vous savez, elle avait une fille et nous pouvions parler de sa fille. Et il y avait mon \u00e9pouse et mon fils \u00e0 Thunder Bay, et mes enfants et mes petits-enfants \u00e0 Sault Ste. Marie. Je crois donc qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que nous, comment dire, travaillions ensemble, le fait d\u2019apprendre \u00e0 se conna\u00eetre au cours d\u2019une certaine p\u00e9riode a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un certain sentiment d\u2019aise.\nIl est arriv\u00e9 des fois o\u00f9, vous savez, au lieu de faire une pause pour souper \u2013 j\u2019ailais au poste d\u2019essence et l\u00e0 \u2013 il y avait des repas de poulet et que l\u2019on pouvait pr\u00e9parer. Et, vous savez, j\u2019y allais, j\u2019en achetais et je le ramenais et le souper \u00e9tait pr\u00eat tout de suite. Apr\u00e8s le souper, le travail se poursuivait pendant une heure \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s. [\u2026] Cet arrangement a dur\u00e9 \u2013 voyons voir. C\u2019est en f\u00e9vrier que j\u2019ai embauch\u00e9 Mme Nastiuk.

Sinclair a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019au cours de cette p\u00e9riode tr\u00e8s mouvement\u00e9e de trois mois, il faisait de temps \u00e0 autre des mises \u00e0 jour \u00e0 un comit\u00e9 de restructuration form\u00e9 du chef, du conseiller Dick Bird, de Mme Roach-Leforte, ainsi que d\u2019un membre du personnel qui r\u00e9digeait le proc\u00e8s-verbal de la r\u00e9union.\n[101] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Sinclair a d\u00e9crit de quelle fa\u00e7on il avait restructur\u00e9 le personnel et les r\u00f4les des employ\u00e9s, dot\u00e9 les postes vacants et pris les dispositions n\u00e9cessaires pour que des consultants professionnels soient disponibles; il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 un nouveau poste de gestionnaire de cas parce que l\u2019habitude qu\u2019avait le CGG de recourir \u00e0 des travailleurs de premi\u00e8re ligne pour produire des rapports donnait lieu \u00e0 des incoh\u00e9rences qu\u2019il attribuait \u00e0 leurs comp\u00e9tences r\u00e9dactionnelles diff\u00e9rentes. Il est vraisemblable qu\u2019il ait souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019avis de Mme Roach-Leforte \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. En fin de compte, Mme Nastiuk est devenue la premi\u00e8re gestionnaire de cas au CGG. M.

Les relations de Mme Nastiuk avec le personnel du CGG [102] En r\u00e9ponse aux all\u00e9gations de Mme Nastiuk selon lesquelles le milieu de travail au CGG \u00e9tait hostile, tant l\u2019avocate de la PNC que M.

Les probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 de Mme Nastiuk \u2013 Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Sinclair [TRADUCTION] M. Sinclair : Durant ces premiers mois de travail, apr\u00e8s avoir embauch\u00e9 Mme Nastiuk, celle-ci m\u2019a inform\u00e9 de quelques probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u2014 dont elle souffrait et qui pouvaient avoir une incidence sur son travail. Cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 appr\u00e9ci\u00e9.\nJe \u2013 je \u2013 elle m\u2019a inform\u00e9 qu\u2019elle souffrait de fibromyalgie, et comme je ne connaissais pas tr\u00e8s bien cette affection, elle m\u2019a renseign\u00e9 sur ce qu\u2019\u00e9tait la fibromyalgie. Et la raison pour laquelle j\u2019en parle, c\u2019est que Mme Gail Roach-Leforte et moi \u00e9tions tous deux inquiets au sujet de Mme Nastiuk \u2013 elle travaillait trop, apportait trop de travail \u00e0 la maison et ne se reposait pas comme il faut, et cela allait se r\u00e9percuter davantage sur son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Et nous l\u2019avons donc arr\u00eat\u00e9e. Lorsque nous la voyions sortir de son b\u00e2timent avec une pile de travail en main pour la soir\u00e9e, nous lui faisions savoir que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une chose que nous voulions qu\u2019elle fasse. Et, m\u00eame au travail, \u00e0 cause de la fibromyalgie, elle travaillait durant les heures de repas. C\u2019\u00e9tait une personne qui avait tr\u00e8s \u00e0 c\u0153ur, c\u2019est certain, le travail qu\u2019il fallait faire, mais c\u2019\u00e9tait au point de \u2013 de n\u00e9gliger sa \u2013 sa propre sant\u00e9.\nEt ainsi, vous savez, nous devions \u2013 il fallait que je lui dise de ne pas rester au bureau \u00e0 l\u2019heure du d\u00eener, mais si vous \u2013 elle voulait rester au bureau, cela n\u2019allait pas marcher. Elle devait faire une promenade, et les personnes souffrant de fibromyalgie doivent faire de l\u2019exercice. Vous devriez \u2013 faire une promenade, vous d\u00e9tendre, vous \u00e9loigner du lieu de travail et ainsi de suite.\nDonc \u2013 en tant que superviseur, je crois qu\u2019une attention sp\u00e9ciale avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e pour aider cette employ\u00e9e \u2013 et pour l\u2019aider \u00e0 rester au travail en lui rappelant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait cens\u00e9e prendre soin d\u2019elle. Et cela est arriv\u00e9 \u2013 je sais, c\u2019est \u00e0 \u2013 ces choses sont arriv\u00e9es un certain nombre de fois.\nTranscription : page 2159, lignes 22 \u00e0 25; page 2160, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 2161, lignes 1 \u00e0 6.\nD.

Sinclair a pos\u00e9 des questions tr\u00e8s pertinentes \u00e0 la plaignante, lui pr\u00e9sentant, au sujet des rapports qu\u2019ils entretenaient, une version qui diff\u00e9rait de ce qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage direct. En agissant ainsi, il a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Nastiuk la possibilit\u00e9, au cours de son propre t\u00e9moignage, d\u2019adh\u00e9rer ou non \u00e0 sa version.\n[104] Un point important dans le contre-interrogatoire de M. Sinclair a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 quand celui ci a attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention de Mme Nastiuk sur la pi\u00e8ce C 2, onglet 71, sous la section intitul\u00e9e [TRADUCTION] \u00ab Humiliation \u00bb, et il lui en a lu un passage.\n[TRADUCTION] \u00ab M. Sinclair a tout fait pour me subjuguer mentalement, \u00e9motionnellement, spirituellement et physiquement en cr\u00e9ant une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 son \u00e9gard parce qu\u2019il est parvenu \u00e0 convaincre d\u2019autres membres du personnel \u00e0 me prendre en aversion et \u00e0 me marginaliser. \u00bb C\u2019est tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieux. Mme Nastiuk, comment ai je fait cela?\nMme Nastiuk : Quelle partie? Cela n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s \u2013\nM. Sinclair : Parce qu\u2019il est parvenu \u00e0 convaincre d\u2019autres membres du personnel \u00e0 me prendre en aversion, cette partie-l\u00e0. Cela concerne \u2013\n[\u2026]\nMme Nastiuk : Tr\u00e8s bien. O\u00f9 est-ce que je commence avec \u00e7a? Nous \u00e9tions mont\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tage pour travailler avec vous et avec Gail, les membres du personnel avaient l\u2019impression que je b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiais d\u2019un traitement sp\u00e9cial que d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s devraient \u2013 auraient d\u00fb probablement \u00eatre choisis, car ils \u00e9taient l\u00e0 depuis plus longtemps. Un traitement sp\u00e9cial? M\u2019apporter du caf\u00e9 et des biscuits, me garder dans votre bureau pendant de longues heures, et vous saviez qu\u2019au rez-de-chauss\u00e9e, les employ\u00e9s voyaient cela d\u2019un mauvais \u0153il \u2013 ce genre de choses. Quand je vous ai demand\u00e9 de r\u00e9gler certains de ces probl\u00e8mes, vous avez refus\u00e9. Et plus tard, au fil du temps, il y a eu une sorte de \u2013 je ne sais pas si triangulation est le mot exact, nous monter les uns contre les autres.\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : Quand vous dites \u00ab nous \u00bb, de qui s\u2019agit-il?\nMme Nastiuk : Divers employ\u00e9s. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, cela \u2013 ce n\u2019est pas juste \u00e0 moi que cela est arriv\u00e9, c\u2019est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s, et ceux-ci voyaient \u00e7a d\u2019un mauvais \u0153il et vous mettiez en marche ce processus, mais, dans ce cas-ci, dans mon cas je suppose, M. Sinclair a fait remarquer que les employ\u00e9s ne m\u2019appr\u00e9ciaient pas; quand j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 g\u00e9rer les cas, il m\u2019a donc dit de m\u2019adresser directement \u00e0 lui pour les rapports, les informations dont j\u2019avais besoin pour les gar\u00e7ons pour mon plan de soins. Je ne m\u2019adressais pas directement au personnel. Il y avait \u2013 voici un exemple : un jour je suis all\u00e9e au travail et mon classeur de gestion de cas avait disparu. J\u2019ignorais o\u00f9 il se trouvait, ce classeur, qui est cens\u00e9 \u00eatre verrouill\u00e9 en tout temps.\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : Est-ce qu\u2019il ressemble \u00e0 un classeur \u00e0 dossiers?\nMme Nastiuk : Comme un classeur en m\u00e9tal. Il y avait deux tiroirs (inaudible), quelques \u00e9tag\u00e8res contenant des dossiers sur les gar\u00e7ons et, en dessous, il y avait quelques tiroirs. Je regardais partout, essayant de deviner o\u00f9 les dossiers de cas se trouvaient. Diane Bart (ph.) est arriv\u00e9e et elle m\u2019en a parl\u00e9 et m\u2019a demand\u00e9 comment je me sentais? Et je lui ai dit que \u2013 je suppose qu\u2019\u00e0 ce stade j\u2019ai dit, tr\u00e8s bien, c\u2019est juste un autre \u2013 un autre coup port\u00e9 contre moi.\nM. Sinclair : O\u00f9 \u00e9tait le classeur?\nMme Nastiuk : Eh bien, quand je suis descendue au rez-de-chauss\u00e9e j\u2019ai vu qu\u2019il se trouvait devant le bureau du personnel. Diane et \u2013 Diane Morrison et Georgina (inaudible) \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, et Mike Henderson \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent lui aussi, et j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 qui avait d\u00e9plac\u00e9 le classeur. Et ils n\u2019ont pas vraiment dit grand-chose, mais pendant que je m\u2019\u00e9loignais ils ont fait un \u2013 ou Georgina a fait un commentaire : pourquoi est-ce qu\u2019il faudrait obtenir sa permission ou quelque chose du genre, qui est-elle pour d\u00e9cider si on va prendre le classeur ou non. Et j\u2019ai fait demi-tour, je suis rentr\u00e9e de nouveau dans le bureau, Mike se trouvait juste l\u00e0 et j\u2019ai dit depuis quand est-ce que le personnel se permet d\u2019entrer dans \u2013 un b\u00e2timent \u00e0 bureaux et de d\u00e9placer le mobilier? Et on n\u2019en a jamais parl\u00e9 et il y a un certain nombre de choses comme celle-l\u00e0 dont on n\u2019a jamais parl\u00e9.\nLes employ\u00e9s ont vu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible de me manquer de respect, on n\u2019en a jamais parl\u00e9. M\u00eame si vous posez directement la question \u00e0 M. Sinclair, cela n\u2019est jamais arriv\u00e9. Sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 tout simplement : trouvez-moi un nouveau classeur \u00e0 dossiers. Je ne dis pas que toutes les difficult\u00e9s que j\u2019ai eues avec le personnel \u00e9taient dues \u00e0 M. Sinclair, et j\u2019en ai parl\u00e9 hier, mais je crois, ou au cours des derniers jours quand j\u2019ai fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait de parler de mon instruction, en essayant \u2013 en pensant que ce serait utile et j\u2019ai r\u00e9alis\u00e9 que cela ne l\u2019\u00e9tait pas, que c\u2019\u00e9tait pr\u00e9judiciable.\nM. Sinclair : L\u2019exemple que vous avez donn\u00e9 ne r\u00e9pond pas vraiment \u00e0 la question, le sc\u00e9nario du classeur \u00e0 dossiers.\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : C\u2019est juste.\nMme Nastiuk : Eh bien, j\u2019ignore ce qui se passait en coulisse, mais il y avait s\u00fbrement des probl\u00e8mes. C'est-\u00e0-dire que je ne peux pas parler \u00e0 ceux parce que personne, jamais \u2013 eux tous \u2013 je peux parler de \u2013\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : Eh bien, je ne \u2013 j\u2019essaie d\u2019aider au bon d\u00e9roulement de cette affaire, pas d\u2019y faire obstacle, mais quand on vous a pos\u00e9 la question \u2013\nMme Nastiuk : Tr\u00e8s bien.\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : \u2013 vous avez donn\u00e9 quelques exemples. Vous avez dit que lorsqu\u2019on vous a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tage ou que vous avez d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tage, cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 per\u00e7u comme un traitement sp\u00e9cial, vous deviez rester dans le bureau durant de longues heures, il vous apportait du caf\u00e9 ou du th\u00e9 et des biscuits. Quand vous avez demand\u00e9 qu\u2019il r\u00e8gle ces probl\u00e8mes et ensuite d\u2019autres choses comme le classeur, il a refus\u00e9 ou rien ne s\u2019est tout simplement pass\u00e9, le fait qu\u2019il s\u2019est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 de la triangulation, qu\u2019il vous a mont\u00e9e contre d\u2019autres membres du personnel, et le fait que cela s\u2019est pass\u00e9 avec des membres du personnel autres que vous-m\u00eame \u00e9galement. Avez-vous quelque chose \u00e0 ajouter \u00e0 cela?\nMme Nastiuk : Hum \u2013\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : Et vous avez dit \u00e9galement que vos probl\u00e8mes avec le personnel n\u2019\u00e9taient pas tous de sa faute, mais vous dites que c\u2019est lui qui a fait ces choses-l\u00e0?\nMme Nastiuk : Oui. Je ne sais pas, comme, je n\u2019en suis pas tout \u00e0 fait s\u00fbre, mais je sais qu\u2019il y a eu cet effet apr\u00e8s mes contacts avec M. Sinclair, surtout Brian, Diane et Ida, c\u2019est comme s\u2019ils pensaient tous qu\u2019ils pouvaient avoir mon poste, et que tous me traitaient \u2013 ils \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s impolis, irrespectueux. Leur comportement n\u2019a pas cess\u00e9, en fait \u00e0 la longue il a empir\u00e9, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que Dale intervienne avec Ida au moins et qu\u2019il nous a emp\u00each\u00e9s, Barb et moi, de participer aux r\u00e9unions. C\u2019est comme si le manque de respect ne faisait qu\u2019empirer.

Sinclair : Qu\u2019est-ce que cela a \u00e0 voir avec la sexualit\u00e9?\nMme Nastiuk : Eh bien, c\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9plac\u00e9. Selon moi, c\u2019\u00e9tait comme si vous me disiez quelque chose \u00e0 votre sujet, cela semblait tout \u00e0 fait d\u00e9plac\u00e9. Cela \u2013\nM. Sinclair : En quoi \u2013\nMme Nastiuk : \u2013 me mettait mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise.\nM. Sinclair : Tr\u00e8s bien. Dans quel contexte, ces choses que vous avez mentionn\u00e9es, dans quel contexte et o\u00f9 cela a-t-il eu lieu?\nMme Nastiuk : Cela arrivait habituellement dans votre bureau, pendant que nous nous trouvions \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur.\nM. Sinclair : Non, je fais r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux commentaires que vous venez tout juste de faire. O\u00f9 est-ce que cela est arriv\u00e9. O\u00f9 est-ce que cela a eu lieu?\nMme Nastiuk : Oh, j\u2019ai fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 son \u00e9pouse, oh, j\u2019ai fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 sa conjointe, les femmes m\u2019appr\u00e9cient, ces commentaires-l\u00e0?\nM. Sinclair : Dans une conversation que nous avons eue vous et moi? Le contexte est important, Mme Nastiuk.\nMme Nastiuk : Le contexte?\nM. Sinclair : Dire une chose comme celle-l\u00e0 c\u2019est pr\u00e9judiciable, comprenez-vous, \u00e7a peut \u00eatre tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9judiciable. C\u2019est donc clair, dans quelle conversation et o\u00f9 a-t-elle eu lieu cette conversation qui est claire comme de l\u2019eau de roche?\nMme Nastiuk : Pendant que nous nous trouvions \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de votre bureau, en haut de l\u2019escalier. Vous avez fait ce commentaire, je me souviens d\u2019au moins un type entrant dans le centre dans lequel \u00e9tait plac\u00e9 un de ses enfants et vous avez dit : oh, j\u2019ai fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 son \u00e9pouse. Je ne me souviens pas du contexte exact.\nM. Sinclair : Qui \u00e9tait cette personne, le savez-vous?\nMme Nastiuk : Dick Spencer. Dick Spencer.\nM. Sinclair : Et quelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 ma r\u00e9ponse quant au moment o\u00f9 j\u2019aurais fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 son \u00e9pouse?\nMme Nastiuk : C\u2019est ce que vous avez dit.\nM. Sinclair : \u00c9tait-il mari\u00e9? \u00c9tait-elle mari\u00e9e?\nMme Nastiuk : Je n\u2019en ai aucune id\u00e9e.\nM. Sinclair : \u00c9tions-nous adolescents?\nMme Nastiuk : Je n\u2019en ai aucune id\u00e9e. Tout ce que vous avez dit, c\u2019est : j\u2019ai fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 son \u00e9pouse.\nM. Sinclair : Vous ne vous souvenez d\u2019aucune r\u00e9ponse de ma part \u00e0 ce commentaire?\nMme Nastiuk : Une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 quoi? Vous avez fait le commentaire, pourquoi voudriez vous y r\u00e9pondre? Je n\u2019y ai pas r\u00e9pondu. J\u2019ai juste pris un certain recul.\nM. Sinclair : Dites-vous tout au sujet de ce commentaire, ou omettez-vous quelque chose, Mme Nastiuk? Passez-vous sous silence une partie de ce que j\u2019ai dit?\nMme Nastiuk : Ces commentaires au sujet d\u2019avoir fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 son \u00e9pouse, ou oh, j\u2019ai fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 sa conjointe, ces commentaires sortaient de nulle part, selon mon souvenir. Il est possible que, parfois, vous parliez de l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 vous \u00e9tiez jeune et profitiez de (inaudible).\nM. Sinclair : \u00c0 ce moment particulier, est-ce de cela que je parlais?\n[\u2026]\nMme Nastiuk : Le contexte de l\u2019ensemble \u2013 ou pas des conversations, parce que c\u2019\u00e9tait juste vous qui parliez et qui me disiez, vous faisiez r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je crois, aux ann\u00e9es 60, quand vous \u00e9tiez donc plus jeune, avec certains de ces commentaires. Et vous appr\u00e9ciiez vraiment la libert\u00e9 des ann\u00e9es 60. Je ne vous ai pas demand\u00e9 de clarifier ce que vous disiez, je n\u2019ai rien dit en retour, vous parliez tout bonnement et vous m\u2019avez dit \u00e7a.\nM. Sinclair : Mme Nastiuk, vous parlez de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 l\u00e0, tr\u00e8s bien. Et o\u00f9 cette conversation a-t-elle eu lieu? Vos souvenirs sont en train de revenir, o\u00f9 cette conversation \u2013\nMme Nastiuk : Votre bureau.\nM. Sinclair : \u2013 a-t-elle eu lieu?\nMme Nastiuk : Votre bureau ou parfois les commentaires \u2013 c\u2019est surtout dans votre bureau, mais, comme, le oh, j\u2019ai fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 son \u00e9pouse, sa conjointe, je me souviens davantage de ceux-l\u00e0 \u2013 c\u2019est arriv\u00e9 dans votre bureau, mais plus souvent \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur, lorsque nous \u00e9tions debout en train de fumer une cigarette au haut de l\u2019escalier. Et, une fois, vous aviez dit que les femmes vous appr\u00e9ciaient, les femmes non autochtones aussi, lorsque nous nous trouvions dans votre v\u00e9hicule le 7 avril 2006, devant ma maison. \u00c7a, c\u2019\u00e9tait apr\u00e8s m\u2019avoir tout dit au sujet de mon lesbianisme et des relations avec les hommes, des activit\u00e9s sexuelles avec les hommes.\nM. Sinclair : Le 7 avril, quelle ann\u00e9e?\nMme Nastiuk : Le 7 avril, c\u2019\u00e9tait un vendredi, en 2006. C\u2019\u00e9tait le jour o\u00f9 vous avez dit que des gens (inaudible) de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de STAT allaient \u00eatre l\u00e0. C\u2019\u00e9tait le jour o\u00f9 j\u2019avais un rendez-vous avec le sp\u00e9cialiste de la vue chez le Dr Ludke. Cette date peut \u00eatre v\u00e9rifi\u00e9e. Cela (inaudible), mais vous aviez fait ce commentaire avant.\nM. Sinclair : Et je vous ai raccompagn\u00e9e en automobile jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la maison ce jour-l\u00e0, n\u2019est-ce pas?\nMme Nastiuk : Oui, effectivement.\nM. Sinclair : Et comment est-ce arriv\u00e9? \u00c9tiez-vous \u2013 vous aviez un v\u00e9hicule?\nMme Nastiuk : Je vous avais dit au moins un mois plus t\u00f4t que j\u2019avais rendez-vous chez un sp\u00e9cialiste de la vue ou \u2013 cela faisait au moins deux semaines que je vous avais laiss\u00e9 savoir que j\u2019avais un rendez-vous avec le sp\u00e9cialiste de la vue parce que vous avez dit qu\u2019il y aurait \u2013 peut-\u00eatre que c\u2019\u00e9tait juste quelques jours auparavant, mais je savais que vous saviez avant ce jour-l\u00e0 que j\u2019avais un rendez vous avec le sp\u00e9cialiste de la vue et, ensuite, la veille, ou deux jours avant, vous m\u2019avez dit que vous alliez rencontrer les gens du Trait\u00e9 no 3 le 7 avril pour pr\u00e9senter l\u2019unit\u00e9 de STAT, et qu\u2019il fallait donc que je vous envoie tout par courriel le 6. Et cela m\u2019a un peu surprise parce que je savais qu\u2019on allait me mettre des gouttes dans les yeux et que je ne serais donc pas en mesure de conduire; c\u2019est donc Tiffany qui m\u2019a conduite jusqu\u2019au centre parce que j\u2019ai dit, eh bien, je pourrais m\u2019organiser pour \u00eatre disponible pour fournir les informations ou combler les manques d\u2019information n\u00e9cessaires lors de la pr\u00e9sentation.\nJe m\u2019y suis donc pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, il n\u2019y avait l\u00e0 personne du Trait\u00e9 no 3, vous \u00e9tiez en pleine conf\u00e9rence de cas je crois et je ne savais pas quoi faire parce que Tiffany \u00e9tait, c\u2019\u00e9tait (inaudible) et Tiff avait mon v\u00e9hicule, je ne savais pas comment la joindre, vous avez offert de me ramener \u00e0 la maison.\nM. Sinclair : Vous \u00e9tiez l\u00e0 pour une r\u00e9union \u2013 est-ce exact, vous \u2013\nMme Nastiuk : Je me suis en quelque sorte invit\u00e9e moi-m\u00eame \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9sentation sur l\u2019unit\u00e9 de STAT. Vous aviez accept\u00e9 que je m\u2019y pr\u00e9sente.\n[\u2026]\nM. Sinclair : Tr\u00e8s bien. Dans tout ce que vous avez \u00e9crit, vous parlez de commentaires de nature sexuelle et vous y faites r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 de nombreuses occasions. Cependant, vous n\u2019avez pas parl\u00e9 du contexte dans lequel \u2013 et o\u00f9 cela est arriv\u00e9 : est-ce exact?\nMme Nastiuk : Je ne me souviens pas de ce qu\u2019il y a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment dans mes documents. J\u2019ignore pourquoi je le devrais. Je ne me souviens d\u2019aucune discussion r\u00e9elle, juste que vous me le disiez tout le temps.\n[\u2026]\nM. Sinclair : (\u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente) Sa r\u00e9ponse, vous l\u2019avez entendue, et elle n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans quel contexte c\u2019\u00e9tait \u2013 cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait ou dans quelle conversation \u2013 o\u00f9 la conversation a eu lieu, elle n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cela.\nMme Nastiuk : Oui, je l\u2019ai fait; votre bureau, ou \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur au haut de l\u2019escalier, \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de votre \u2013 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tage dans votre b\u00e2timent.\nM. Sinclair : Eh bien, il y a bien des conversations qui ont eu lieu \u00e0 cet endroit \u2013 s\u00fbrement, Mme Nastiuk, mais c\u2019est de cette conversation particuli\u00e8re dont nous parlons.\nMme Nastiuk : Excusez-moi, quelle conversation?\nM. Sinclair : Au sujet des commentaires que, selon vous, j\u2019ai faits moi-m\u00eame qui \u00e9taient des commentaires de nature sexuelle. Et il est tr\u00e8s important de bien pr\u00e9ciser o\u00f9 cela a eu lieu et quel genre de conversation il y a eu. Nous travaillions donc dans une installation qui traitait des d\u00e9linquants sexuels; est-ce exact?\nMme Nastiuk : Qui traitait des jeunes ayant des comportements sexuels inappropri\u00e9s ou qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9s.\nM. Sinclair : Pour un comportement inappropri\u00e9 \u2013\nMme Nastiuk : Sexuel \u2013 des comportements sexuels inappropri\u00e9s.\nM. Sinclair : Tr\u00e8s bien. Donc il \u00e9tait courant dans ce lieu de travail de parler de sexualit\u00e9 et de d\u00e9linquance sexuelle; est-ce exact?\nMme Nastiuk : Pas de sexualit\u00e9.\nM. Sinclair : Que ces jeunes hommes avaient \u2013 ou ont eu, excusez-moi, avant de fr\u00e9quenter le centre de traitement?\nMme Nastiuk : Ce serait habituel lors de la phase d\u2019entretien, au cours du processus de planification du traitement, essentiellement au cours de ces deux processus. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre pas toujours directement \u00e0 l\u2019arriv\u00e9e, mais, cette phase, quand, vous savez, on essaie de r\u00e9unir des informations pour voir ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9, pour obtenir les renseignements de base sur ce qui se passait avec eux.\nM. Sinclair : Mme Nastiuk, en tant que gestionnaire de cas vous \u00eates souvent le premier point de contact des travailleurs sociaux et\/ou des membres de la famille; n\u2019est-ce pas exact?\nMme Nastiuk : C\u2019est exact.\nM. Sinclair : Et vous \u00eates souvent la premi\u00e8re personne qui entend cela de la bouche de ces personnes, ainsi que les infractions sexuelles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commises?\nMme Nastiuk : Pas toujours. Par exemple, je me souviens que vous et moi nous trouvions \u00e0 Canora et que vous aviez rencontr\u00e9 le gar\u00e7on et j\u2019avais rencontr\u00e9 la travailleuse, et vous \u00eates revenu me raconter une partie de ces informations, ou des informations du gar\u00e7on sur ses comportements, ce qu\u2019il vous avait dit.\nM. Sinclair : Donc, ce genre de conversation \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s fr\u00e9quent dans ce lieu de travail, n\u2019est-ce pas, Mme Nastiuk?\nMme Nastiuk : Au sujet des gar\u00e7ons, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, dans un certain contexte. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une chose dont je parlais tout bonnement et \u2013 ou m\u00eame dont je me souviens d\u2019avoir parl\u00e9 avec d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s au hasard tout simplement. Il y a habituellement un lieu et un contexte pour cela.\nM. Sinclair : Vous souvenez-vous d\u2019une conversation qui a eu lieu un soir, quand vous m\u2019avez invit\u00e9 \u00e0 votre maison, Mme Nastiuk, pour arranger votre appareil de chauffage et apr\u00e8s \u2013 votre appareil de chauffage manquait de mazout et, apr\u00e8s, je suis entr\u00e9 et vous aviez fait du caf\u00e9 et vous m\u2019avez invit\u00e9 \u00e0 rester? Vous souvenez-vous de cela, Mme Nastiuk?\nMme Nastiuk : Non.\nM. Sinclair : Vous ne vous en souvenez pas du tout, Mme Nastiuk?\nMme Nastiuk : Non. [\u2026]\nM. Sinclair : Regardez-moi Mme Nastiuk, voulez-vous? La soir\u00e9e en particulier dont je vous parle, Mme Nastiuk, et je reviens \u00e0 un commentaire fait plus t\u00f4t au sujet de la discussion sexuelle, ce soir-l\u00e0 est si important que vous pouvez vous en rappeler \u00e0 ce stade-ci, parce que le contexte de la conversation est clair une fois qu\u2019on en parle.\nMme Nastiuk : Nous n\u2019avons jamais eu de discussions au sujet de commentaires de nature sexuelle quand nous \u00e9tions dans ma maison, et je ne me souviens m\u00eame pas que cela ait eu lieu \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de ma maison \u00e0 part le 7 avril quand vous avez commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 parler du fait que j\u2019\u00e9tais une lesbienne, ainsi que de mes activit\u00e9s sexuelles avec des hommes et les relations avec les hommes. [\u2026]\nM. Sinclair : Mme Nastiuk, lorsqu\u2019une personne fait un commentaire et que le contexte dans lequel il se situe n\u2019est pas donn\u00e9, et que ce commentaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, est-ce que cela pourrait \u00eatre pr\u00e9judiciable? [\u2026] Pr\u00e9judiciable pour moi [\u2026] dans ce cas particulier?\nMme Nastiuk : Je ne sais pas comment r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cela. Dans d\u2019autres \u2013 d\u2019autres situations, d\u2019autres gens je veux dire \u2013 des variables, cela d\u00e9pend d\u2019un tas de variables diff\u00e9rentes.\nM. Sinclair : Et bien, dans ce cas particulier, je suis (inaudible) accus\u00e9 ici de harc\u00e8lement sexuel, et pour moi il est tr\u00e8s important que ces questions soient \u00e9claircies. Le contexte dans lequel les commentaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits, le simple fait de dire que ceci c\u2019est ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit au sujet de commentaires sexuels ou d\u2019une conversation sexuelle, sans donner d\u2019autres informations pour l\u2019\u00e9claircir, ne croyez-vous pas que ce serait pr\u00e9judiciable \u2013 que cela pourrait \u00eatre pr\u00e9judiciable, Mme Nastiuk?\nMme Nastiuk : Je suppose que je reviendrais \u00e0 la fois o\u00f9 j\u2019\u00e9tais assise seule dans votre bureau et que vous avez commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 parler et \u2013 \u00e0 parler de vous m\u00eame et \u00e0 faire ces commentaires, et que vous n\u2019avez absolument pas tenu compte de la g\u00eane que je ressentais et du fait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait inappropri\u00e9 pour vous de me faire ces commentaires, et toute cette affaire d\u2019ignorer tout simplement ma r\u00e9action ou mon manque de r\u00e9action.\nM. Sinclair : Avez-vous jamais dit, Tom, ne dites pas \u00e7a? Ne parlez pas de \u00e7a? Est-ce que vous me l\u2019avez jamais dit, Mme Nastiuk?\nMme Nastiuk : Pas avant \u2013 je vous l\u2019ai bien dit, mais pas avant la fin de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019automne.\nM. Sinclair : De quelle ann\u00e9e s\u2019agirait-il Mme Nastiuk?\nMme Nastiuk : 2005.\nM. Sinclair : Et combien de fois est-ce que je l\u2019ai dit \u2013 est-il arriv\u00e9 que je dise quelque chose et que vous ne m\u2019ayez jamais rien dit? [\u2026] Est-ce que cela arrivait souvent?\nMme Nastiuk : Je pense que c\u2019\u00e9tait fr\u00e9quent, que les employ\u00e9s \u2013 qu\u2019ils connaissaient cet air que vous aviez et ils savaient qu\u2019il ne fallait pas r\u00e9agir, r\u00e9pondre, s\u2019exprimer. C\u2019\u00e9tait fr\u00e9quent.\nM. Sinclair : L\u2019air que j\u2019avais? Et bien, Mme Nastiuk, vous savez, je fais des efforts pour essayer d\u2019\u00e9claircir dans quel contexte vous avez fait des commentaires sur le fait que j\u2019avais eu des propos de nature sexuelle.\nMme Nastiuk : Je crois l\u2019avoir dit. Vous \u00e9tiez dans votre bureau et vous faisiez ce genre de commentaires. Ou alors, nous \u00e9tions debout, hors du bureau, au haut de l\u2019escalier de votre b\u00e2timent et vous faisiez des commentaires. Je ne \u2013 et ensuite, \u00e0 part le 7 avril, il y a eu le trajet en automobile, je crois que nous revenions au centre et vous avez rapidement chang\u00e9 \u2013 je ne sais pas ce que c\u2019\u00e9tait \u2013 ce qui se disait, juste que \u2013 je ne crois pas qu\u2019il y avait un v\u00e9ritable contexte, vous avez tout \u00e0 coup commenc\u00e9 \u2013 vous m\u2019avez dit que vous aviez particip\u00e9 \u00e0 un groupe de formation quelque part et que vous vous \u00e9tiez tous assis en cercle et prononc\u00e9 toutes les expressions famili\u00e8res que vous connaissiez pour p\u00e9nis et vagin et cela m\u2019a mis instantan\u00e9ment en col\u00e8re. C\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9plac\u00e9. Pour quelqu\u2019un qui travaille dans le domaine des services sociaux depuis 20, 25 ans, si vous croyez que la supervision, la formation, le fait d\u2019\u00eatre seuls dans un v\u00e9hicule apr\u00e8s m\u2019avoir t\u00e9moign\u00e9 de force de vos attentions pendant tout ce temps je \u2013 il n\u2019y a pas de contexte pour cela. Parler du fait que ma grand-m\u00e8re avait une r\u00e9putation, quel contexte peut-il y avoir pour cela?\nM. Sinclair : Vous avez dit qu\u2019il \u00e9tait question du fait que j\u2019avais assist\u00e9 \u00e0 une formation, est-ce exact? N\u2019est-ce pas ce que vous venez juste de dire, Mme Nastiuk? [\u2026] Vous venez juste de mentionner que \u2013 que c\u2019\u00e9tait dans un contexte particulier, vous avez situ\u00e9 ce contexte, voyez-vous, que j\u2019avais particip\u00e9 \u00e0 une formation et que, dans cette formation, il \u00e9tait question de professionnels qui aidaient des gens qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes d\u2019abus sexuels, cela vous ne l\u2019avez pas dit, mais vous avez inclus une partie de cela dans le contexte quand vous avez dit que je suivais une formation quand cela est arriv\u00e9 \u2013 quand \u2013 voyez vous ce que je veux dire?\nMme Nastiuk : Je me souviens de l\u2019avoir dit, oui.\nM. Sinclair : Voyez-vous ce que je veux dire?\nMme Nastiuk : Et c\u2019est sorti de nulle part. Il y avait \u2013 c\u2019est le contexte que vous voulez, mais mon contexte \u00e0 moi \u00e9tait que j\u2019\u00e9tais seule dans le v\u00e9hicule avec vous et que vous avez fait cette remarque. C\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9plac\u00e9. Nous ne parlions pas de questions d\u2019ordre sexuel. Je n\u2019ai jamais parl\u00e9 de questions d\u2019ordre sexuel avec vous et, tout \u00e0 coup, voil\u00e0 que vous commencez \u00e0 faire ce genre de commentaires, surtout avec tout le reste. Ouais, j\u2019\u00e9tais tr\u00e8s \u2013 j\u2019en avais vraiment assez.\nM Sinclair : Tr\u00e8s bien, Mme Nastiuk. Est-ce que vous et moi avons jamais \u00e9chang\u00e9 des informations en tant que deux membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui ont subi, comment dire, des choses pr\u00e9judiciables dans leur enfance? Est-ce que vous et moi avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9chang\u00e9 des informations comme celles-l\u00e0, ouvertement et volontairement?\nMme Nastiuk : Je n\u2019ai pas \u00e9chang\u00e9 ce genre d\u2019informations ouvertement et volontairement avec vous. C\u2019\u00e9tait toujours vous qui me posiez des questions sur mes ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents familiaux ou ma fibromyalgie. Vous disiez ouvertement \u2013 je crois que j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 abord\u00e9 la question de ce dont vous aviez parl\u00e9, que les femmes vous appr\u00e9ciaient et que vous aimiez les ann\u00e9es 60, la libert\u00e9 des ann\u00e9es 60, vous parliez de votre \u2013 vous essayiez de parler de vos relations et ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une chose volontaire, c\u2019\u00e9tait moi qui \u00e9tais oblig\u00e9e de m\u2019asseoir et de vous \u00e9couter ou vous qui tentiez d\u2019obtenir de moi des informations, au point o\u00f9 je [\u2026] juste pour que vous arr\u00eatiez [\u2026] je me mettais en col\u00e8re, je vous r\u00e9pondais quelque chose et je me retirais ensuite. Il y a peut-\u00eatre bien eu quelques conversations qui \u2013 quand les choses \u00e9taient plus amicales, mais, comprenez-vous, sans aborder \u2013 des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents d\u2019abus ou des informations personnelles.\nM. Sinclair : Est-il fr\u00e9quent chez les membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations de s\u2019asseoir ces jours-ci, avec toutes les activit\u00e9s de gu\u00e9rison qui ont lieu au sein de nos Premi\u00e8res Nations et de nos collectivit\u00e9s, de parler de questions de gu\u00e9rison? Mme Nastiuk, est-ce une chose fr\u00e9quente, assez fr\u00e9quente ces jours-ci?\nMme Nastiuk : Dans des groupes, j\u2019ai entendu dire que c\u2019est fr\u00e9quent, des cercles d\u2019\u00e9change.\nM. Sinclair : Croyez-vous que c\u2019est le seul endroit o\u00f9 ces choses se passent? Se partagent?\nMme Nastiuk : Les sueries \u2013 c\u2019est \u2013 c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, j\u2019ai particip\u00e9 \u2013 c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 quelques cercles de discussion, des cercles de partage auxquels Nicky et Marty avaient particip\u00e9 avec les gar\u00e7ons, mais vous n\u2019\u00e9tiez pas pr\u00e9sent. [\u2026]\nM. Sinclair : Avez-vous jamais partag\u00e9 des informations sur votre famille et sur votre enfance avec vous-m\u00eame, Mme Nastiuk?\nMme Nastiuk : Oui, nous \u00e9tions en auto \u2013 je pense que j\u2019ai parl\u00e9 de cette balade en auto jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la ferme d\u2019\u00e9levage de wapitis, etc., et vous \u00e9tiez insistant et j\u2019ai finalement fait un commentaire. Et il y a eu aussi une autre fois dont vous parliez, oh, oui, je me souviens d\u2019avoir vu des parents \u2013 (inaudible) des parents avec cinq petits enfants \u00e0 leur remorque. Et je vous ai vu il y a de cela plusieurs ann\u00e9es et \u2013 et oh, quoi d\u2019autre? Je \u2013 parfois la conversation \u00e9tait amicale, et cela a peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 la m\u00eame conversation, vous me posiez des questions sur mes relations avec mes parents, et je vous avais dit que c\u2019\u00e9tait meilleur avec mon p\u00e8re qu\u2019avec ma m\u00e8re.\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : Je vous entends mal.\nMme Nastiuk : J\u2019ai effectivement dit \u00e0 M. Sinclair que ma relation avec mon p\u00e8re \u00e9tait meilleure qu\u2019avec ma m\u00e8re, mais jamais je n\u2019ai dit cela de moi-m\u00eame. C\u2019\u00e9tait juste une tentative constante pour me faire parler de moi-m\u00eame.\nM. Sinclair : Mme Nastiuk, le contexte dans lequel les conversations ont eu lieu est fort important, sinon cela peut para\u00eetre comme une simple conversation sexuelle. S\u2019il en est question dans le contexte de la gu\u00e9rison de membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations, alors \u2013 ces commentaires, une conversation comme celle que nous avons eue, vous et moi. Vous rappelez-vous cela, Mme Nastiuk, les fois o\u00f9 des informations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 partag\u00e9es?\nMme Nastiuk : Non.\nTranscription : page 1276, lignes 12 \u00e0 25; page 1277, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 1278, lignes 1 \u00e0 25, page 1279, lignes 1 \u00e0 12 et 21 \u00e0 25; page 1280, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 1281, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 1282, lignes 1 \u00e0 16; page 1284, lignes 4 \u00e0 14, page 1285, lignes 4 \u00e0 25; page 1286, ligne 1 \u00e0 25; page 1287, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 1288, lignes 1 \u00e0 5 et 9 \u00e0 23; page 1289, lignes 18 \u00e0 21; page 1290, lignes 10 \u00e0 11 et 14 \u00e0 25; page 1291, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 1292, lignes 2 \u00e0 25; page 1293, lignes 1 \u00e0 13 et 15 \u00e0 25; page 1294, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 1295, lignes 1 \u00e0 18 et 23 \u00e0 25; page 1296, lignes 1 \u00e0 5 et 17 \u00e0 25; page 1297, lignes 1 \u00e0 23.\n(iii) Les appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques [106] M. Sinclair a parl\u00e9 de questions li\u00e9es au CGG, il avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 de nombreuses fois \u00e0 Mme Nastiuk et elle l\u2019avait appel\u00e9 assez r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement; les appels de Mme Nastiuk commen\u00e7aient par des questions relatives au travail, mais, parfois, il \u00e9tait ensuite question de sujets personnels. Certains des appels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits \u00e0 son domicile \u00e0 Thunder Bay, mais la plupart du temps, c\u2019\u00e9tait lorsqu\u2019il vivait au domicile de sa m\u00e8re \u00e0 Fort Frances.\n[TRADUCTION] La pr\u00e9sidente : Tr\u00e8s bien. Et \u00eates-vous en train de dire que ces appels ont commenc\u00e9 d\u00e8s le moment o\u00f9 elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler avec vous ou [\u2026] lorsqu\u2019elle s\u2019est sentie plus \u00e0 l\u2019aise, plus tard.\nM. Sinclair : Pas au d\u00e9but. Apr\u00e8s \u2013 une fois qu\u2019elle s\u2019est sentie plus \u00e0 l\u2019aise, vous savez, et que nous avions du temps pour parler simplement de \u2013 elle parlait de sa fille et je parlais de mes enfants. Et je pense qu\u2019il y avait un sentiment d\u2019aise dans \u2013 dans le fait de parler de \u2013 \u00e7a devait \u00eatre la premi\u00e8re fois pour nous deux.\nTranscription : page 2135, lignes 10 \u00e0 12 et 15 \u00e0 22.\n(iv) Les visites au domicile de Mme Nastiuk [TRADUCTION] M. Sinclair : Et ce soir l\u00e0, apr\u00e8s avoir jet\u00e9 un coup d\u2019\u0153il \u00e0 la chaudi\u00e8re, quand je suis mont\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tage, Mme Nastiuk avait fait du caf\u00e9 et m\u2019a invit\u00e9 \u00e0 rester pour en prendre une tasse. Je suis donc all\u00e9 dans son salon et juste \u2013 il y avait un divan et en face du divan un fauteuil et il y avait un poste de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision et une table de salon entre le fauteuil et le divan. Et \u2013 et je ne suis pas s\u00fbr des autres meubles qu\u2019il y avait, mais je me suis assis sur le bord du divan, sur le coin du divan, et Mme Nastiuk a apport\u00e9 le caf\u00e9 et s\u2019est assise dans le fauteuil. Et je pense qu\u2019il y avait une table de salon entre les deux. Et je me suis assis au mauvais endroit sur ce divan, parce qu\u2019elle avait un chat qui \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s bien portant, un chat ob\u00e8se, et j\u2019ai fini par m\u2019asseoir \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 le chat avait l\u2019habitude de se coucher, et le chat est arriv\u00e9 et m\u2019a fait comprendre que je ne devais pas m\u2019asseoir \u2013 m\u2019asseoir l\u00e0. Et c\u2019\u00e9tait amusant et [\u2026] je crois que je me suis d\u00e9plac\u00e9 \u00e0 cause du chat. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, c\u2019\u00e9tait ce soir-l\u00e0, comme si c\u2019\u00e9tait seulement du lieu de travail. Il y avait une raison pour laquelle j\u2019\u00e9tais all\u00e9 chez elle \u2013 \u00e0 son domicile. Elle a offert du caf\u00e9. Nous nous sommes assis et nous avons parl\u00e9, et nous avons parl\u00e9 comme deux membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations, et \u2013 \u00e0 cause des choses dont nous parlions. C\u2019\u00e9tait un \u00e9change c\u2019\u00e9tait personnel et un \u00e9change personnel de certaines des [\u2026] de ce que c\u2019\u00e9tait que de grandir dans ma maison et elle m\u2019a fait part de ce que c\u2019\u00e9tait que de grandir dans la sienne \u2013 sa maison.\nTranscription : page 2151, lignes 8 \u00e0 24; page 2152, lignes 2, 3 et 5 \u00e0 13.\nDonc, ce que je veux faire, c\u2019est \u2013 c\u2019est faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 cela et situer la conversation dans son juste contexte. Des informations communiqu\u00e9es par moi-m\u00eame sur \u2013 les abus que j\u2019ai v\u00e9cus dans mon enfance et \u2013 et la raison pour laquelle je voulais le faire, c\u2019\u00e9tait que, dans toutes les informations que Mme Nastiuk a donn\u00e9es, elle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une conversation de \u2013 de nature sexuelle. Et bien, lorsque l\u2019on situe cela dans son juste contexte comme \u2013 comme j\u2019essaie de le faire ici \u2013 cela brosse un tableau de deux personnes qui sont assises et qui se parlent. Ce n\u2019est pas \u2013 ce n\u2019est pas moi qui fais des commentaires de nature sexuelle qui sont m\u00e9prisants ou \u2013 qui la visent, elle.\nTranscription : page 2152, lignes 24 et 25; page 2153, lignes 1 \u00e0 10.\n(v) La r\u00e9paration de l\u2019automobile de Mme Nastiuk [TRADUCTION] M. Sinclair : Quand je travaillais \u00e0 Giizhikaandag, j\u2019\u00e9tais en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e9loign\u00e9 de ma famille durant deux semaines \u00e0 la fois. Et il y avait un certain nombre d\u2019employ\u00e9s, de sexe f\u00e9minin, qui avaient des v\u00e9hicules et moi \u2013 j\u2019ai offert de r\u00e9parer les v\u00e9hicules de trois employ\u00e9es. Mme Nastiuk en \u00e9tait une, Mme Gail Roach-Leforte \u00e9tait la deuxi\u00e8me et Mme Barb Dalsig \u00e9tait la troisi\u00e8me.\nEt, pour pouvoir r\u00e9parer la voiture de Mme Nastiuk, elle se trouvait \u00e0 son domicile. La voiture se trouvait sur la route, la route principale qui passait devant sa maison. Et j\u2019y ai jet\u00e9 un coup d\u2019\u0153il et j\u2019ai essay\u00e9 de la r\u00e9parer et je n\u2019ai pas pu le faire. Il fallait trouver des pi\u00e8ces de rechange. Et, dans le cas de Mme Gail Roach-Leforte, son v\u00e9hicule, j\u2019ai laiss\u00e9 le mien chez elle. J\u2019ai pris son v\u00e9hicule et je me suis rendu chez mon neveu, et j\u2019ai eu son v\u00e9hicule pour la journ\u00e9e enti\u00e8re. Elle revenait, semble-t-il, de Winnipeg, s\u2019\u00e9tait arr\u00eat\u00e9e pour faire l\u2019entretien de son v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 Winnipeg, avait mis \u2013 le v\u00e9hicule avait besoin d\u2019huile, mais au lieu de mettre l\u2019huile dans le moteur, elle l\u2019avait mis dans \u2013 l\u00e0 o\u00f9 va le liquide du radiateur et l\u2019huile s\u2019\u00e9tait r\u00e9pandue dans tout le moteur. Et moi \u2013 il m\u2019a fallu un jour pour le d\u00e9monter et le purger et \u2013 et lui ramener son auto. Dans le cas de Mme Dalsig, son v\u00e9hicule se trouvait tout simplement dans le terrain de stationnement. Il y avait un feu qu\u2019il fallait changer, et ce sont l\u00e0 mes souvenirs de cette affaire.\nDonc, il n\u2019est pas juste question du v\u00e9hicule de Mme Nastiuk. J\u2019ai offert mon aide \u00e0 d\u2019autres membres du personnel \u2013 des membres de sexe f\u00e9minin.\nTranscription : page 2158, lignes 18 \u00e0 25; page 2159, lignes 1 \u00e0 20.\n(vi) L\u2019aide apport\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Nastiuk pour l\u2019achat d\u2019une automobile [TRADUCTION] M. Sinclair : \u00ab Elle \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 ce jour-l\u00e0. Et elle m\u2019a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 [\u2026] elle a dit : o\u00f9 \u00eates-vous? Et je lui ai dit que je me trouvais dans l\u2019ouest de la ville. Et j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 : pourquoi? Elle a dit, eh bien, je suis chez le concessionnaire Ford. J\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 un v\u00e9hicule et j\u2019aimerais que vous y jetiez un coup d\u2019\u0153il et que vous l\u2019essayiez. Et j\u2019ai dit : tr\u00e8s bien.\nJe suis all\u00e9 chez le concessionnaire Fort, on m\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le vendeur. Il a mis les plaques sur le v\u00e9hicule, je me suis assis derri\u00e8re le volant et, tous les trois, nous sommes all\u00e9s faire un tour [\u2026] nous avons fait demi-tour et sommes revenus au garage.\nEt j\u2019ai dit \u00e0 Mme Nastiuk que je pensais que c\u2019\u00e9tait un bon v\u00e9hicule. C\u2019\u00e9tait un petit VUS. Et elle l\u2019a finalement achet\u00e9. Et je me suis servi de cela comme exemple qu\u2019elle se sentait, vous savez, libre de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner et de demander un peu d\u2019aide [\u2026]\nTranscription : page 2902, lignes 1 \u00e0 20.\n(vii) Le commentaire sexuel sur le \u00ab lesbianisme \u00bb all\u00e9gu\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] M. Sinclair : C\u2019\u00e9tait une apr\u00e8s-midi de \u2013 vers la fin de l\u2019automne. C\u2019\u00e9tait une apr\u00e8s-midi o\u00f9 il tombait un m\u00e9lange de pluie et de neige. Mme Nastiuk devait se rendre au Centre d\u2019acc\u00e8s aux services de sant\u00e9, qui se trouve dans la r\u00e9serve et o\u00f9 les gens peuvent recevoir des services m\u00e9dicaux.\nC\u2019est aussi un endroit o\u00f9 l\u2019on amenait les gar\u00e7ons de notre programme pour leurs \u2013 leurs examens de sant\u00e9, etc.\nEt cette apr\u00e8s-midi-l\u00e0, Mme Nastiuk est all\u00e9e au Centre d\u2019acc\u00e8s aux services de sant\u00e9. Elle est revenue vers trois heures de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi et, cette apr\u00e8s-midi l\u00e0, quand elle est revenue, Fern et moi \u00e9tions sortis pour fumer une cigarette. Et c\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 que \u2013 que \u2013 nous finissions notre cigarette [\u2026] que Marlo est arriv\u00e9e [\u2026] et m\u2019a demand\u00e9 si elle pouvait me parler. Fern est donc partie, et est retourn\u00e9e dans le b\u00e2timent, et Mme Nastiuk et moi sommes rest\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur, sur le haut du palier de l\u2019escalier. Elle s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e contre l\u2019int\u00e9rieur des escaliers et je me trouvais appuy\u00e9 contre \u2013 debout contre l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 [\u2026] et elle avait l\u2019air tr\u00e8s perplexe et elle a simplement demand\u00e9, et ce qu\u2019elle m\u2019a demand\u00e9 c\u2019est ce que je ferais si elle \u00e9tait lesbienne? Juste \u2013 ce sont l\u00e0 les mots exacts. Et j\u2019\u00e9tais l\u00e0, debout, et \u2013 et je n\u2019ai rien dit au d\u00e9but. Et ensuite, j\u2019ai \u2013 je ne l\u2019ai pas interrog\u00e9e. Je n\u2019ai pas pos\u00e9 de questions sur ce qu\u2019elle venait juste de d\u00e9clarer. Cela m\u2019a certainement pris par surprise et j\u2019avais besoin d\u2019un peu de temps pour r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir et r\u00e9pondre. Et ma r\u00e9ponse a \u00e9t\u00e9 la suivante : il y a une loi qui prot\u00e8ge les personnes contre la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019orientation sexuelle, et ces personnes ne peuvent pas \u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9es \u00e0 cause de leur orientation sexuelle.

Mme Nastiuk est entr\u00e9e dans le bureau un matin. J\u2019\u00e9tais \u00e0 mon bureau. Ses cheveux \u00e9taient encore humides, et elle est entr\u00e9e et je pouvais sentir le shampoing. Et je lui ai dit que je pouvais sentir ses cheveux. En v\u00e9rit\u00e9, j\u2019ai dit un peu plus que cela. Tr\u00e8s bien. Elle a fait un commentaire sur l\u2019odeur des cheveux. J\u2019ai dit que je pouvais sentir ses cheveux. Ils sentent comme le shampoing que j\u2019utilise. C\u2019est l\u00e0 tout ce que j\u2019ai dit.\nTranscription : page 2900, lignes 4 \u00e0 19.\nE. La rencontre avec le chef McPherson [108] En r\u00e9ponse aux questions de Me Bryson, l\u2019avocate de la PNC, M. Sinclair a expliqu\u00e9 que, le 14 juin 2006, on l\u2019avait appel\u00e9 pour assister \u00e0 une r\u00e9union au CGG avec le chef McPherson, Mme Nastiuk et George Emes.\n[TRADUCTION] Me Bryson : [\u2026] Il semble y avoir bien des d\u00e9saccords sur ce que le chef McPherson a dit. Vous souvenez-vous qu\u2019il ait dit \u00e0 Mme Nastiuk qu\u2019aucune mesure d\u2019adaptation ne serait prise pour vous (Mme Nastiuk) au sujet du lieu de travail, arr\u00eat complet?\nM. Sinclair : Pas du tout. [\u2026]\nTranscription : page 3068, lignes 12 \u00e0 17.\nM. Sinclair : [\u2026] Et donc la chef a demand\u00e9 le \u2013 son \u2013 comment elle voulait que l\u2019on proc\u00e8de. Et elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle voulait que l\u2019on traite de ses pr\u00e9occupations et de ses lettres.\nJe sais qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019on approchait de la fin de la r\u00e9union, le chef McPherson lui a demand\u00e9 ce que l\u2019on pouvait faire pour r\u00e9gler l\u2019affaire et elle \u00e9tait sur le point de partir et il a demand\u00e9 qu\u2019elle lui fasse part plus tard de la fa\u00e7on dont elle voulait continuer, comprenez-vous, comment r\u00e9gler l\u2019affaire \u00e0 l\u2019interne. Et M. Emes et elle ont quitt\u00e9 la pi\u00e8ce.\nMe Bryson : Vous souvenez-vous si elle a fait des suggestions quelconques \u00e0 cette r\u00e9union?\nM. Sinclair : Non, je ne m\u2019en souviens pas. [\u2026] Oh, il y a un commentaire dont je me souviens.

C\u2019est deux l\u00e0 en 2006.

J\u2019ai vu ce que Mme Nastiuk produisait et cela lui prenait quelques heures pour le faire. Elle en a produit beaucoup. Elle mettait beaucoup d\u2019efforts dans ce travail. Elle a fait beaucoup de travail. Je n\u2019avais personne avec moi, pas d\u2019avocat, aucun employ\u00e9 judiciaire. Je suis ici tout seul.

Sinclair depuis longtemps, probablement une quarantaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es, et que, pendant toute cette p\u00e9riode, jamais on ne l\u2019avait mis au courant d\u2019une all\u00e9gation d\u2019irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de nature sexuelle \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de M.

Il a de plus expliqu\u00e9 que quand le centre de gu\u00e9rison de la PNC a connu sa crise de gestion, cela allait obliger la PNC \u00e0 le fermer, \u00e0 faire en sorte qu\u2019un autre organisme l\u2019administre, ou \u00e0 le restructurer.\nA. La connaissance de la plainte de Mme [115] Me Bryson, l\u2019avocate de la PNC, a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 quel moment les plaintes de Mme Nastiuk ont \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es \u00e0 son attention pour la premi\u00e8re fois.\n[TRADUCTION] Le chef McPherson : Au d\u00e9part, j\u2019ai eu un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de sa part dans lequel elle demandait un \u2013 si j\u2019avais le temps de la rencontrer en juin 2006, je crois que c\u2019\u00e9tait.

Elle les a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et m\u2019a demand\u00e9 si je voulais bien prendre le temps de les lire tout de suite.\nMe Bryson : Et les avez-vous lus?\nLe chef McPherson : Oui. Il y \u00e9tait question, je pense de quelques all\u00e9gations pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es au sujet de M. Sinclair, mais il \u00e9tait surtout question de ses sentiments. Chaque page faisait allusion \u00e0 ses sentiments. Comment elle se sentait \u00e0 un moment pr\u00e9cis. Comment elle se sentait \u00e0 cause de ceci, comment elle se sentait \u00e0 cause de cela, etc.\nEt comme j\u2019ai dit, cela \u2013 c\u2019\u00e9tait ce qui ressortait principalement des documents, c\u2019\u00e9tait la mani\u00e8re dont elle se sentait \u00e0 des moments diff\u00e9rents. [\u2026] C\u2019\u00e9tait contre \u2013 contre M. Sinclair.

Sinclair avait commis des actes r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles?\nLe chef McPherson : Je ne me souviens pas d\u2019avoir pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 5 000 $, mais cette position concorde avec la fa\u00e7on dont je fonctionne, le fait d\u2019offrir de l\u2019argent \u00e0 Mme Nastiuk aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 une reconnaissance de culpabilit\u00e9 de ma part \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Sinclair et je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 le faire.\nMe Bryson : Vous rappelez vous si Mme Nastiuk vous a demand\u00e9 de faire quoi que ce soit lors de cette r\u00e9union?\nLe chef McPherson : Non, elle allait m\u2019en reparler plus tard.\nTranscription : page 2933, lignes 13 \u00e0 24; page 2936, lignes 21 \u00e0 25; page 2937, lignes 1 \u00e0 7.\n[116] Dans son contre-interrogatoire du chef McPherson, Mme Nastiuk a pos\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie de questions et j\u2019en ai choisi plusieurs concernant la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union organis\u00e9e par le chef McPherson et \u00e0 laquelle ont pris part Mme Nastiuk, M.

Sinclair \u00e9tait coupable et vous n\u2019\u00e9tiez pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire. Et ensuite, vous m\u2019avez dit de revenir vous dire ce que je voulais. Vous en rappelez vous?\nLe chef McPherson : Je me souviens de vous avoir demand\u00e9 ce qu\u2019il fallait faire pour r\u00e9gler ce probl\u00e8me et du fait que vous alliez m\u2019en reparler. [\u2026]\nMme Nastiuk : Je ne me souviens pas de \u00ab ce qu\u2019il fallait faire pour r\u00e9gler \u00bb parce que vous m\u2019aviez d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit que l\u2019on ne pouvait effectuer aucun changement ni prendre de mesure d\u2019adaptation parce que cela reviendrait \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre que Tom \u00e9tait coupable et vous n\u2019\u00e9tiez pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 faire cela.\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : vous ne pouvez pas lancer simplement des d\u00e9clarations en l\u2019air comme \u00e7a.

Avez-vous d\u00e9clar\u00e9 cela \u00e0 cette r\u00e9union?\nLe chef McPherson : Je me souviens d\u2019avoir dit que je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 \u00eatre le juge, c\u2019est vrai. Le juge et jury sur cette question particuli\u00e8re et je vous ai effectivement demand\u00e9 de me faire part plus tard de ce qui \u00e9tait, selon vous, une solution valable \u00e0 cette affaire.\n[\u2026]\nMme Nastiuk : Vous souvenez-vous de m\u2019avoir dit quelque chose qui n\u2019indiquait pas que je ne voulais pas retourner au travail? Mais je voulais retourner au travail et tout ce que j\u2019ai retir\u00e9 de cette r\u00e9union, c\u2019est que M. Sinclair avait toujours un emploi et que vous n\u2019alliez rien faire du tout pour m\u2019aider \u00e0 retourner au lieu de travail en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et \u00e0 r\u00e9gler ces probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, donc \u2013\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : Est-ce exact?

Et, s'il vous pla\u00eet, de me revenir l\u00e0-dessus le plus rapidement possible.\nMme Nastiuk : Tr\u00e8s bien, au sujet du commentaire dont je me souviens, lorsque vous avez dit qu\u2019aucun changement ne serait fait, qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait pas de mesures d\u2019adaptation parce que cela reviendrait \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre que Tom \u00e9tait coupable pour ensuite me dire que je devais revenir \u2013 vous vouliez que je vous fasse part plus tard de ce que je voulais. Pouvez-vous voir en quoi cela cr\u00e9ait pour moi une situation vraiment difficile? C\u2019est \u00e0 dire, que pourrais-je demander?\nLe chef McPherson : Bien, si, en fait, les all\u00e9gations sont v\u00e9ridiques, je peux concevoir que ce serait \u2013 que cela cr\u00e9erait une situation pour vous, mais \u00e0 ce stade et \u00e0 ce jour nous ne savons pas si les all\u00e9gations sont vraies, de sorte que ce serait une r\u00e9ponse hypoth\u00e9tique de ma part.

En tant qu\u2019employeur, n\u2019\u00e9tiez-vous pas conscient que vous aviez l\u2019obligation de me prendre au s\u00e9rieux?\nLe chef McPherson : Si je convoquais de nouveau la r\u00e9union \u2013 c\u2019est la raison pour laquelle je vous ai demand\u00e9 ce que serait une solution \u00e0 la situation selon votre propre point de vue. Je pensais que je vous prenais au s\u00e9rieux en convenant de tenir une r\u00e9union en vue d\u2019\u00e9laborer une solution au probl\u00e8me et en me demandant de me revenir l\u00e0-dessus.\n[\u2026]\nMme Nastiuk : Tr\u00e8s bien.

Morrisseau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il semblait ne pas y avoir d\u2019incident de harc\u00e8lement sexuel particulier, que ce que Mme Nastiuk lui avait mentionn\u00e9 \u00e9tait un fait g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, qui revenait sous une forme ou sous une autre. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait interrog\u00e9 d\u2019autres personnes et que, lors d\u2019autres r\u00e9unions avec Mme Nastiuk et M.

Sinclair les mettait mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise; quelques commentaires sur le fait que son opinion \u00e0 mon \u00e9gard \u00e9tait inappropri\u00e9e.

Le retour au travail de Mme Nastiuk [126] Pour ce qui est du fait que Mme Nastiuk lui a parl\u00e9 en octobre 2006 de son retour au travail au CGG, M. Morrisseau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le seul moment dont il se rappelait \u00e9tait la p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9cembre 2006 \u2013 janvier 2007, qu\u2019elle voulait retourner au travail \u00e0 des conditions bien pr\u00e9cises et qu\u2019elle lui avait remis une lettre contenant des conditions de retour au travail.\n[TRADUCTION] Me Bryson : Nous sommes donc encore \u2013 nous avons parl\u00e9 du num\u00e9ro un et du num\u00e9ro deux. Nous nous trouvons \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 18 de la pi\u00e8ce C-1, il s\u2019agit de la lettre que Mme Nastiuk vous a adress\u00e9e, \u00e0 la page 1 sur 4.

Morrisseau : Non, c\u2019est ce que le pr\u00e9f\u00e9rais, en fait, parce que tout aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 par \u00e9crit.\nMe Bryson : M.

Est ce que vous vous opposiez au fait que Mme Nastiuk ne se rende pas \u00e0 l\u2019autre b\u00e2timent o\u00f9 \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 le bureau de M. Sinclair, sauf pour les r\u00e9unions du personnel ou du CGG?\nM. Morrisseau : Je n\u2019avais pas de probl\u00e8me avec \u00e7a. Son bureau se trouvait dans l\u2019autre b\u00e2timent et elle \u00e9tait capable d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter ses fonctions dans son bureau.\nMe Bryson : Et M. Sinclair a-t-il eu des objections qu\u2019il \u2013 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard dont il vous a fait part?\nM. Morrisseau : Non.\nMe Bryson : Juste pour clarifier les choses, avez-vous pass\u00e9 en revue ces conditions avec M. Sinclair \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9?\nM. Morrisseau : Oui.\nMe Bryson : Tr\u00e8s bien, parfait. Parfait. Et est-ce que chacun d\u2019entre vous \u2013 et par chacun, je veux dire vous, Mme Nastiuk et M.

Sinclair devait \u00e9viter Mme Nastiuk et ne pas chercher volontairement \u00e0 la voir?\nM. Morrisseau : Dans le cas de celui-l\u00e0, je pense que nous voulions que les rapports soient professionnels, conform\u00e9ment aux conditions que nous essayions d\u2019\u00e9tablir ici.\nMe Bryson : Et par professionnels, voulez-vous dire n\u2019importe quel rapport ou le fait qu\u2019ils ne devaient avoir des rapports que de nature professionnelle?\nM. Morrisseau : Oui. Des rapports li\u00e9s au travail, et id\u00e9alement en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une tierce partie s\u2019il y avait de tels rapports.\nTranscription : page 2581, lignes 5 \u00e0 25; page 2582, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 2583, lignes 1 et 2.\n[127] Dans le processus d\u00e9crit plus t\u00f4t au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9laboration des conditions de retour au travail, M. Sinclair ne voulait pas que Mme Nastiuk ait des contacts avec le minist\u00e8re provincial et M. Morrisseau s\u2019est dit d\u2019accord parce que M. Sinclair \u00e9tait le porte-parole du CGG dans les rapports avec le minist\u00e8re des Services sociaux et communautaires. Enfin, M. Morrisseau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les conditions qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies en vue du retour au travail de Mme Nastiuk n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9es par les parties, mais qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient plut\u00f4t verbales.\nG. Le d\u00e9faut all\u00e9gu\u00e9 de la PNC de prot\u00e9ger Mme Nastiuk [128] M.

Morrisseau : Oui.\nMe Bryson : Et avez-vous le sentiment d\u2019avoir r\u00e9pondu comme il faut \u00e0 chacun de ces griefs?\nM. Morrisseau : Je croyais que oui. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire \u2013 une fois de plus, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire \u2013 je pense que Marlo aurait d\u00fb assumer une bonne part de la responsabilit\u00e9 des interactions du personnel.

N\u2019est-ce pas exact?\nMme Nastiuk : Nous parlions effectivement une fois par mois, oui, nous le faisions.\nMe Bryson : Et cela, vous le faisiez volontairement, est-ce exact?\nMme Nastiuk : Il y avait tant de choses qui se passaient au travail qu\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible d\u2019arr\u00eater et d\u2019intercepter quelqu\u2019un tout le temps. Nous essayions de le minimiser, et il s\u2019agissait donc d\u2019une situation forc\u00e9e.

Sinclair a toutefois d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait autoris\u00e9 Mme Nastiuk \u00e0 acheter un sous-v\u00eatement masculin pour le jeune en question, un sous-v\u00eatement qui \u00e9tait fait d\u2019un tissu que ce dernier appr\u00e9cierait peut-\u00eatre. Me Bryson a interrog\u00e9 M. Morrisseau sur cet incident :\n[TRADUCTION] Me Bryson : Et durant votre conversation avec Mme Nastiuk \u00e0 propos du fait d\u2019avoir quitt\u00e9 le lieu de travail, a-t-elle parl\u00e9 d\u2019un probl\u00e8me concernant l\u2019achat d\u2019un sous-v\u00eatement f\u00e9minin pour un jeune de sexe masculin qui \u00e9tait soign\u00e9 et \u2013 d\u2019une discussion \u00e0 ce sujet?\nM. Morrisseau : Il \u2013 cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 un sujet litigieux. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Tom Sinclair l\u2019avait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 aller acheter des culottes pour le jeune en question. J\u2019ai parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Tom de cette affaire parce que je me suis dit, eh bien, cela semble tout \u00e0 fait inappropri\u00e9. Ce sont des d\u00e9linquants sexuels. Et j\u2019en ai parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Tom et il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne lui avait absolument pas donn\u00e9 l\u2019autorisation de faire cela. Et je ne lui ai certainement pas donn\u00e9 l\u2019autorisation de le faire.\n[\u2026]\nElle se disait qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 d\u2019un sujet de pr\u00e9occupation constant, non seulement pour elle, mais pour le centre de gu\u00e9rison. La question de savoir qui \u00e9tait responsable de \u2013 d\u2019autoriser ces \u2013 l\u2019achat d\u2019un sous-v\u00eatement f\u00e9minin pour le client.\nMe Bryson : Donc, avez-vous tir\u00e9 une conclusion quelconque sur \u2013 sur cette question de sous-v\u00eatement.\nM. Morrisseau : Eh bien, seules mes propres d\u00e9cisions. Je ne peux pas \u2013 c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, d\u2019apr\u00e8s \u2013 c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire \u2013 c\u2019est une autre de ces affaires o\u00f9 chacun a une version diff\u00e9rente des faits.

Pour moi, personnellement, je ne vois pas en quoi cela pourrait \u00eatre avantageux pour une personne qui est un d\u00e9linquant sexuel.\nMe Bryson : Avez-vous parl\u00e9 \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre, \u00e0 l\u2019un des autres membres du personnel du CGG au sujet de cette question en particulier?\nM. Morrisseau : Je crois en avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Nicky Morrisseau parce qu\u2019elle m\u2019avait envoy\u00e9 la lettre de \u2013 essentiellement, c\u2019\u00e9tait une lettre de plainte.

L\u2019abandon, par Mme Nastiuk, de son poste [132] Le 17 ao\u00fbt 2007, M. Sinclair a quitt\u00e9 le CGG pour un autre emploi dans une collectivit\u00e9 diff\u00e9rente. Malgr\u00e9 son d\u00e9part, Mme Nastiuk n\u2019est pas retourn\u00e9e au travail. M. Morrisseau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne voyait aucune justification \u00e0 son absence, pas plus qu\u2019il n\u2019avait autoris\u00e9 son absence apr\u00e8s que le chef et le conseil eut rejet\u00e9 la proposition de r\u00e8glement de sa plainte par voie de m\u00e9diation avec la Commission.\n[133] M. Morrisseau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le chef et le conseil se sont occup\u00e9s de l\u2019absence de Mme Nastiuk du CGG en octobre ou en novembre 2007 en concluant qu\u2019elle avait abandonn\u00e9 son poste. Cela a laiss\u00e9 M. Morrisseau dans un \u00e9tat de confusion parce que [TRADUCTION] \u00ab [\u2026] c\u2019\u00e9tait une position difficile, le fait de me trouver au milieu de cette bataille. Je n\u2019y avais aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00bb. Transcription : page 2678, lignes 11 \u00e0 14.\n[134] Cependant, M. Morrisseau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019une fois que le chef et le conseil ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que Mme Nastiuk avait abandonn\u00e9 son poste, il n\u2019\u00e9tait plus habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 dire \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re qu\u2019elle avait encore un travail qu\u2019elle devait reprendre.\n[135] Me Bryson a pos\u00e9 un certain nombre de questions sur la d\u00e9cision du chef et du conseil selon laquelle Mme Nastiuk avait abandonn\u00e9 l\u2019emploi qu\u2019elle exer\u00e7ait aupr\u00e8s du CGG.\n[TRADUCTION] Me Bryson : Et si un employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 pendant une longue p\u00e9riode [\u2026] faudrait-il pour cela l\u2019autorisation du chef et du conseil ou juste celle de Dale?\nLe chef McPherson : Il l\u2019approuverait, mais nous serions au courant.\nMe Bryson : Vous souvenez-vous apr\u00e8s \u2013 ou vous souvenez-vous que Dale Morrisseau se soit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au chef et au conseil apr\u00e8s que ceux-ci eurent consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait abandonn\u00e9 son poste et dise que Mme Nastiuk voulait de nouveau revenir au travail? Ce serait vers le mois de novembre 2007.\nLe chef McPherson : Je ne m\u2019en souviens pas parce que, \u00e0 ce moment, comme je l\u2019ai dit, nous \u00e9tions d\u2019avis qu\u2019elle avait abandonn\u00e9 son emploi. [\u2026] Eh bien, le \u2013 comme je l\u2019ai dit (inaudible) les probl\u00e8mes sont du ressort de l\u2019administrateur de bande. Pour ce qui est de l\u2019abandon du poste, nous avons convenu avec M. Morrisseau qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait tout simplement pas l\u00e0, de sorte que le poste n\u2019\u00e9tait pas occup\u00e9, et qu\u2019en ce qui concernait l\u2019abandon, nous \u00e9tions tous d\u2019accord pour dire qu\u2019elle avait d\u00fb l\u2019abandonner. Quand on ne se pr\u00e9sente pas au travail, on ne se pr\u00e9sente pas au travail.\nTranscription : page 2947, lignes 12 \u00e0 25; page 2948, lignes 1 et 9 \u00e0 16.\n[136] Lors du contre-interrogatoire de la plaignante, l\u2019avocate de la PNC a demand\u00e9 avec insistance \u00e0 Mme Nastiuk de fournir une preuve quelconque, pas juste une croyance injustifi\u00e9e, que M. Sinclair ou la PNC \u00e9taient intervenus dans les efforts qu\u2019elle avait faits pour trouver un autre emploi, sa r\u00e9ponse a \u00e9t\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] \u00ab on m\u2019a dit le contraire \u00bb. Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] \u00ab Par qui? \u00bb, Mme Nastiuk a demand\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] \u00ab Est-ce que je dois r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cela? \u00bb. La pr\u00e9sidente a dit que oui. Ce simple \u00e9change de questions et de r\u00e9ponses, \u00e0 la page 687 de la transcription, a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie de quelque trente-cinq questions dont la plupart se sont sold\u00e9es par des r\u00e9ponses vagues ou de simples d\u00e9robades. L\u2019\u00e9change a atteint un point culminant \u00e0 la page 695 :\n[TRADUCTION] Me Bryson : Bien, vous avez all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019il vous a \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible d\u2019obtenir du travail dans l\u2019ensemble du territoire vis\u00e9 par le Trait\u00e9 no 3 \u00e0 cause de rumeurs que la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Couchiching avait r\u00e9pandues sur votre compte; n\u2019est-ce pas vrai?\nMme Nastiuk : Oui.\nMe Bryson : Et vous avez dit qu\u2019il vous a fallu trouver un travail \u00e0 un endroit o\u00f9 vous devez maintenant payer de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu \u00e0 cause de cela. N\u2019est-ce pas vrai?\nMme Nastiuk : Ouais.\nMe Bryson : Donc, ne croyez-vous pas qu\u2019il est raisonnable de produire une preuve que c\u2019est bien ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9?\nMme Nastiuk : Je ne sais pas comment je pourrais le faire \u2013 des gens l\u2019ont dit et je ne vais quand m\u00eame pas faire compara\u00eetre ces gens en cour.\nMe Bryson : Tr\u00e8s bien. Vous nous demandez donc d\u2019admettre que ces choses sont vraies sans que personne vienne t\u00e9moigner sous serment qu\u2019elles sont v\u00e9ridiques, et vous voulez recevoir 160 000 $ pour cela, est-ce exact?\nMme Nastiuk : Oui.\nTranscription : page 695, lignes 11 \u00e0 25; page 696, lignes 1 \u00e07.\n[137] Ensuite, Me Bryson et Mme Nastiuk ont poursuivi leur \u00e9change dans le cadre d\u2019une autre s\u00e9rie d\u2019au moins cinquante questions portant sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation de Mme Nastiuk selon laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la PNC, avait r\u00e9pandu des rumeurs qui l\u2019emp\u00eachaient de trouver du travail, et que, selon elle, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une fa\u00e7on de faire que l\u2019on pouvait remonter aux [TRADUCTION] \u00ab personnes d\u00e9tenant le pouvoir \u00bb.\n[TRADUCTION] Mme Nastiuk : Je ne soul\u00e8ve pas vraiment le probl\u00e8me, je ne fais pas de difficult\u00e9s, il s\u2019agit en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019un probl\u00e8me global qui remonte aux personnes qui d\u00e9tiennent le pouvoir \u00e0 Couchiching. Je ne pense pas que l\u2019on puisse pointer du doigt une personne en particulier parce que les gens qui d\u00e9tiennent le pouvoir \u2013 c\u2019est une norme accept\u00e9e qu\u2019on \u2013 c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, qu\u2019est-ce qui va \u00eatre fait?

Pour ce qui est de Dan et de Chuck, je n\u2019allais pas faire une all\u00e9gation absolue contre deux personnes. Je formulais une all\u00e9gation contre Couchiching, les personnes qui d\u00e9tenaient le pouvoir, parce que les personnes qui ne le faisaient pas auraient d\u00fb le faire et auraient pu assumer la responsabilit\u00e9 et s\u2019\u00e9lever contre tout cela et dire : c\u2019est assez.\nTranscription : page 710, lignes 8 \u00e0 25.\nMe Bryson : Tr\u00e8s bien. Je ne tiens pas \u00e0 m\u2019\u00e9tendre beaucoup plus longtemps sur la question, alors je vais juste en faire ici un r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Donc, d\u2019apr\u00e8s notre discussion, n\u2019est il pas exact de dire que vous n\u2019avez aucune preuve directe de qui que ce soit sur le fait que le chef et le conseil aient dit quelque chose de n\u00e9gatif \u00e0 votre sujet que vous avez entendu directement ou que vous n\u2019avez aucun t\u00e9moin qui puisse dire que cela vous a emp\u00each\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir un autre travail? N\u2019est-ce pas vrai?\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : Je crois qu\u2019elle a r\u00e9pondu cela \u00e0 plusieurs reprises.

McDougall, 2008 CSC 53, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a clarifi\u00e9 le droit concernant la norme de preuve dans les affaires civiles : ni plus ni moins que la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve.\n[139] La preuve doit toujours \u00eatre claire et convaincante afin de satisfaire au crit\u00e8re de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve.\n[140] La Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que, en premi\u00e8re instance, le juge ne doit pas consid\u00e9rer le t\u00e9moignage du t\u00e9moin en vase clos. Il doit plut\u00f4t examiner l'ensemble de la preuve pour d\u00e9terminer l'incidence des contradictions sur les questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 touchant au c\u0153ur du litige.\n[141] Les remarques de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l'arr\u00eat McDougall s'inscrivent dans la foul\u00e9e de ce qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9 dans le contexte des droits de la personne. Dans Discrimination and the Law (W. Tarnopolsky, Thomson Carswell, 2006), on donne l'exemple de la d\u00e9cision Van Berkel c. MPI Security Ltd. (1997), 28 C.H.R.R. D\/504 (B.C.H.R.C.), dans laquelle le membre instructeur Kenneth Attafuah affirme :\n[TRADUCTION] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ces principes juridiques, la coh\u00e9rence du t\u00e9moignage de chacun des t\u00e9moins a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e en regard de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve compte tenu des circonstances actuelles entourant l'emploi de la plaignante avec [l'entreprise intim\u00e9e] et ses interactions avec [l'individu intim\u00e9]. J'ai \u00e9galement examin\u00e9 la preuve sous l'angle de la plausibilit\u00e9 dans les circonstances et \u00e9valu\u00e9 les motifs des t\u00e9moins. En outre, j'ai port\u00e9 attention \u00e0 leurs pouvoirs d'observation, \u00e0 leur capacit\u00e9 de se souvenir, ainsi qu'\u00e0 leur attitude et \u00e0 leur comportement sous serment, de m\u00eame qu'\u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont ils ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Enfin, j'ai examin\u00e9 si leur t\u00e9moignage manquait de coh\u00e9sion ou s'il y avait des incoh\u00e9rences et des contradictions importantes.

Inq.) \u00e0 la page D\/2280, expose la norme de preuve dans les affaires de harc\u00e8lement sexuel :\n[TRADUCTION] Le plaignant doit prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve, qu'on a contrevenu [\u2026] au code des droits de la personne. Cette preuve se fait en deux volets : (1) prouver que la conduite all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de l'intim\u00e9 s'est produite; (2) prouver qu'il s'agissait de harc\u00e8lement sexuel dans les circonstances (par exemple, que les incidents ont eu lieu sans le consentement libre du plaignant). Si le plaignant produit une preuve qui satisfait \u00e0 ces deux exigences, il incombe alors \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 d'apporter une preuve \u00e9tablissant que les actes n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 commis ou qu'ils ne constituaient pas du harc\u00e8lement sexuel. [\u00c0 la page 15 57.]\n[143] Une fois que le plaignant, dans une affaire de harc\u00e8lement sexuel, a \u00e9tabli sa preuve prima facie, le fardeau de la preuve passe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, mais le fardeau g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de prouver les all\u00e9gations selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve incombe toujours au plaignant.\n[144] Les articles 14 et 14.1 de la LCDP sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9s ainsi :\n14(1) Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu :\na) lors de la fourniture de biens, de services, d'installations ou de moyens d'h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public;\nb) lors de la fourniture de locaux commerciaux ou de logements;\nc) en mati\u00e8re d'emploi.\n(2) Pour l'application du paragraphe (1) et sans qu'en soit limit\u00e9e la port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le harc\u00e8lement sexuel est r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre un harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite.\n14.1 Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\n[145] Le harc\u00e8lement sexuel en milieu de travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 largement d\u00e9fini comme \u00e9tant une conduite de nature sexuelle non sollicit\u00e9e qui a un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le milieu de travail ou qui a des cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9judiciables en mati\u00e8re d'emploi pour les victimes de harc\u00e8lement : Janzen c. Platy Enterprises Ltd., [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1252, \u00e0 la page 1284 (C.S.C.) Le premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment \u00e0 \u00e9tablir est que la conduite \u00e9tait non sollicit\u00e9e. Un examen de la r\u00e9action de la plaignante au moment o\u00f9 l'incident ou les incidents se sont produits d\u00e9terminera si la conduite \u00e9tait non sollicit\u00e9e. Si la plaignante, soit express\u00e9ment, soit par son comportement, montre que la conduite \u00e9tait non sollicit\u00e9e, le premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment est prouv\u00e9. Si la preuve d\u00e9montre que la plaignante a souscrit \u00e0 la conduite, alors la plainte sera rejet\u00e9e. Le deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la d\u00e9finition exige que la conduite soit de nature sexuelle. Tant la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, dans l'arr\u00eat Janzen, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, que les tribunaux des droits de la personne ont reconnu qu'une vaste gamme de conduites, y compris les insultes d'ordre sexuel, les remarques sexistes, les commentaires concernant l'apparence d'une personne, sa tenue vestimentaire ou ses habitudes sexuelles, peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant de \u00ab nature sexuelle \u00bb. La d\u00e9cision doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur les faits propres \u00e0 l'affaire, compte tenu de la norme de la personne raisonnable dans les m\u00eames circonstances : Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), [1999] A.C.F. no 757, aux paragraphes 32 \u00e0 40 (C.F.) (Franke).\n[146] Dans certaines circonstances, un seul incident suffit peut-\u00eatre pour cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail hostile, mais le harc\u00e8lement exige souvent la pr\u00e9sence d'un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de persistance ou de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition. Pour d\u00e9terminer si la conduite est suffisamment grave ou persistante pour empoisonner le milieu de travail, il faut appliquer la norme objective de la \u00ab personne raisonnable \u00bb : d\u00e9cision Franke, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 43 \u00e0 46.\n[147] Dans le cas o\u00f9 un employeur a mis en place une politique compl\u00e8te et efficace concernant le harc\u00e8lement sexuel, l'employ\u00e9 doit avertir l'employeur de la conduite offensante all\u00e9gu\u00e9e afin de lui donner l'occasion de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la situation : Franke, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 47 \u00e0 50.\n[148] Dans le cas o\u00f9 l'acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par un employ\u00e9, l'article 65 de la LCDP est \u00e9galement pertinent :\nSous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (2), les actes ou omissions commis par un employ\u00e9, un mandataire, un administrateur ou un dirigeant dans le cadre de son emploi sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s, pour l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par la personne, l'organisme ou l'association qui l'emploie.\nLa personne, l'organisme ou l'association vis\u00e9 au paragraphe (1) peut se soustraire \u00e0 son application s'il \u00e9tablit que l'acte ou l'omission a eu lieu sans son consentement, qu'il avait pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour l'emp\u00eacher et que, par la suite, il a tent\u00e9 d'en att\u00e9nuer ou d'en annuler les effets.\n[149] Pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la disposition de disculpation du paragraphe 65(2), l'employeur doit \u00e9tablir selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve qu'il n'a pas consenti aux actes de l'employ\u00e9, qu'il a pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour emp\u00eacher les actes et que, par la suite, il a tent\u00e9 d'en att\u00e9nuer ou d'en annuler les effets.\nVI. L\u2019\u00e9valuation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 [150] Dans l'arr\u00eat R. c. R.E.M., 2008 CSC 51, rendu en m\u00eame temps que McDougall, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, la juge en chef McLachlin a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les conclusions de fait sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 sont fond\u00e9es sur des facteurs difficiles \u00e0 expliquer :\nBien qu'il soit utile que le juge tente d'exposer clairement les motifs qui l'ont amen\u00e9 \u00e0 croire un t\u00e9moin plut\u00f4t qu'un autre, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ou sur un point en particulier, il demeure que cet exercice n'est pas n\u00e9cessairement purement intellectuel et peut impliquer des facteurs difficiles \u00e0 \u00e9noncer. De plus, pour expliquer en d\u00e9tail pourquoi un t\u00e9moignage a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9, il se peut que le juge doive tenir des propos peu flatteurs sur le t\u00e9moin. Or, le juge voudra peut-\u00eatre \u00e9pargner \u00e0 l'accus\u00e9, qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour nier le crime, la honte de subir des commentaires n\u00e9gatifs sur son comportement, en plus de celle de voir son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9cart\u00e9 et d'\u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable. Bref, l'appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 est un exercice difficile et d\u00e9licat qui ne se pr\u00eate pas toujours \u00e0 une \u00e9nonciation compl\u00e8te et pr\u00e9cise. [Au paragraphe 49.]\nA. La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de Mme Nastiuk [151] Pour \u00e9valuer la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la plaignante, Mme Nastiuk, j\u2019ai analys\u00e9 et \u00e9tudi\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail son t\u00e9moignage afin d\u2019en d\u00e9terminer la vraisemblance, j\u2019ai examin\u00e9 si son t\u00e9moignage contenait des incoh\u00e9rences et des contradictions importantes, j\u2019ai \u00e9valu\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage par rapport \u00e0 la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s et aux circonstances qui existaient au lieu de travail du CGG durant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 elle y avait travaill\u00e9 et, en particulier, j\u2019ai pris en consid\u00e9ration la relation qu\u2019elle entretenait avec le directeur administratif du CGG, l\u2019intim\u00e9, M. Sinclair, les rapports qu\u2019elle avait eus avec l\u2019administrateur de bande, Dale Morrisseau, de m\u00eame que ses interactions avec d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s du CGG.\n[152] M. Broman, un ancien employ\u00e9 du CGG, a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin par la plaignante; il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il r\u00e9gnait une certaine tension au sein du lieu de travail au CGG : [TRADUCTION] \u00ab Tout d\u2019abord, les installations de soins en \u00e9tablissement sont des endroits parfois tr\u00e8s explosifs. Nous travaillons avec un groupe d\u2019enfants agit\u00e9s, extr\u00eamement en col\u00e8re, de sorte que le personnel subit beaucoup de pression, et le personnel ne peut pas se d\u00e9fouler sur les enfants, ce qui fait que parfois les employ\u00e9s ont tendance \u00e0 \u2013 se d\u00e9fouler les uns sur les autres. [\u2026] C\u2019est un endroit assez difficile o\u00f9 travailler [\u2026] il y avait beaucoup de luttes internes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tage [\u2026] des gens qui avaient leur propre opinion sur la fa\u00e7on dont un pensionnaire doit \u00eatre trait\u00e9 [\u2026] Cela contribuait donc \u00e0 un degr\u00e9 de tension qui rendait les choses parfois tr\u00e8s inconfortables [\u2026] et il y avait beaucoup de [\u2026] coups de poignard dans le dos, beaucoup d\u2019insultes \u00e0 propos de presque tout le monde l\u00e0-bas. Vous savez, la situation \u00e9tait telle qu\u2019il y avait des fois o\u00f9 je rentrais \u00e0 la maison assez frustr\u00e9 par l\u2019atmosph\u00e8re qui y r\u00e9gnait \u00bb.\n[153] Une autre circonstance importante qui entoure les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement sexuel de la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 la rupture de la relation de travail entre la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9, M. Sinclair, rupture qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 chez elle sa profonde aversion \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. Du point de vue de Mme Nastiuk, la d\u00e9gradation de leur relation a d\u00e9but\u00e9 aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler avec M. Sinclair \u00e0 mettre sur pied un nouveau programme pour le CGG, et cette d\u00e9gradation d\u00e9coule des choses dites \u00e0 Mme Nastiuk lors de banales conversations entre les deux, des commentaires qui l\u2019ont mise [TRADUCTION] \u00ab mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise \u00bb. Je conclus que cette aversion \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Sinclair a d\u00e9form\u00e9 son objectivit\u00e9 et sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner factuellement chaque fois qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9crit comme du harc\u00e8lement sexuel des incidents o\u00f9 le comportement \u00e9tait per\u00e7u comme [TRADUCTION] \u00ab inappropri\u00e9 \u00bb.\n[154] Au d\u00e9but, Mme Nastiuk a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de M. Sinclair et, pendant un temps, a partag\u00e9 son bureau. Je conclus que cette situation a cr\u00e9\u00e9 chez elle un grave probl\u00e8me \u00e9motionnel, qui l\u2019a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 croire qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 son service au point que cela l\u2019a priv\u00e9e des libert\u00e9s habituelles dont jouissaient tous ses coll\u00e8gues au travail. Elle a aussi commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 sentir que son travail englobait tout, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait soumis \u00e0 la pression d\u2019attentes \u00e9lev\u00e9es et aggrav\u00e9es par [TRADUCTION] \u00ab le genre d\u2019attention et d\u2019intensit\u00e9 de concentration de M. Sinclair [\u2026] Il fallait que je fasse quelque chose parce que j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par la mani\u00e8re dont M. Sinclair se comportait, c\u2019\u00e9tait lui qui \u00e9tait aux commandes, il avait l\u2019habitude d\u2019obtenir ce qu\u2019il voulait \u00bb.\n[155] Mme Nastiuk n\u2019a pas dit \u00e0 M. Sinclair de mettre fin \u00e0 ces commentaires anecdotiques sur lui m\u00eame ou \u00e0 ses questions concernant sa vie priv\u00e9e et elle a soutenu que si elle l\u2019avait fait, cela aurait pu mettre en p\u00e9ril son emploi. M\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait officiellement employ\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de gestionnaire de cas au CGG et travaillait dans un b\u00e2timent diff\u00e9rent, Mme Nastiuk consid\u00e9rait quand m\u00eame qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait entich\u00e9 d\u2019elle : [TRADUCTION] \u00ab Et je ne veux pas dire qu\u2019il me demandait des faveurs sexuelles, ou des faveurs sexuelles ou alors, ce genre de choses, c\u2019\u00e9tait juste comme si tout \u00e0 coup il a pens\u00e9 simplement que nous \u00e9tions, comme \u2013 comme s\u2019il y avait tout simplement un lien ou \u2013 c\u2019\u00e9tait plus que comme une relation directeur administratif\/superviseur\/gestionnaire de cas \u00bb.\n[156] \u00c0 maintes reprises au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Nastiuk a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 une propension \u00e0 se consid\u00e9rer comme irr\u00e9prochable, pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses all\u00e9gations de discrimination, mais sur le plan du lieu de travail et de ses interactions avec les autres membres du personnel. Quand on l\u2019a interrog\u00e9 sur le fait que le personnel ne l\u2019appr\u00e9ciait pas, elle a r\u00e9pondu :\n[TRADUCTION] [\u2026] certains des probl\u00e8mes avec le personnel, il y avait beaucoup de ressentiment de la part de certains des anciens membres du personnel de longue date [\u2026] Ils avaient du ressentiment face au fait que certains des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps partiel et sur appel grimpaient dans la hi\u00e9rarchie et qu\u2019eux-m\u00eames restaient au bas de l\u2019\u00e9chelle [\u2026] C\u2019est donc l\u00e0 \u2013 c\u2019est, selon moi, de cette fa\u00e7on qu\u2019une bonne partie de cette situation a commenc\u00e9, et quelque part l\u00e0-dedans, je ne sais pas comment les choses ont fait pour mal tourner. Il y a peut-\u00eatre eu quelques id\u00e9es de ma part. Je me souviens que j\u2019avais l\u2019habitude de faire la remarque, parce que \u2013 cela les ennuyait tellement, alors j\u2019essayais de dire, eh bien, c\u2019est essentiellement une bonne chose parce que j\u2019ai acquis beaucoup de comp\u00e9tences et de connaissances gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 mes \u00e9tudes. Cela s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00eatre la pire chose que j\u2019aurais pu dire parce que cela a \u00e9rig\u00e9 une barri\u00e8re encore plus haute.\n[157] Plus tard dans son t\u00e9moignage sur le fait que M. Sinclair lui avait dit que le personnel ne voulait pas travailler avec elle, Mme Nastiuk a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] \u00ab [\u2026] ces genres de comportements et d\u2019interactions n\u2019\u00e9taient pas dus \u00e0 moi ou \u00e0 une chose qui se passait avec eux. C\u2019\u00e9taient eux les responsables, comme si quelque chose se passait [\u2026] deux personnes avaient du ressentiment. Elles voulaient un bureau et elles voulaient un titre et je crois que presque tout le monde au centre le savait \u00bb.\n[158] Les mauvaises relations que Mme Nastiuk entretenait avec le personnel ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un arrangement dans le cadre duquel les informations dont elle avait besoin des travailleurs qui s\u2019occupaient des jeunes devaient lui \u00eatre transmises par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de M. Sinclair, un fait qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9plor\u00e9 comme \u00ab une autre raison pour devoir aller \u00e0 son bureau, et c\u2019\u00e9tait tr\u00e8s\nfrustrant \u00bb.\n[159] \u00c0 ce stade de sa p\u00e9riode d\u2019emploi aupr\u00e8s du CGG, Mme Nastiuk a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 faire des recherches dans des sites Web ax\u00e9s sur les droits de la personne afin de savoir comment d\u00e9finir ce qu\u2019elle vivait. [TRADUCTION] \u00ab Parce que \u00e7a ne figurait pas dans les exemples flagrants de harc\u00e8lement sexuel ou de ce genre de comportement que l\u2019on trouve sur ces sites, cela ne correspondait pas tout \u00e0 fait, mais on aurait dit simplement \u2013 c\u2019\u00e9tait presque plus difficile d\u2019y faire face et plus encore \u2013 je ne sais pas comment \u2013 c\u2019\u00e9tait tr\u00e8s d\u00e9rangeant. C\u2019\u00e9tait une v\u00e9ritable violation [\u2026]. Alors donc, de quoi s\u2019agit-il, [\u2026] c\u2019\u00e9tait juste \u2013 ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u2013 \u00e7a ne me semblait pas correct. Je savais que c\u2019\u00e9tait r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible. Ce comportement me mettait vraiment \u00e0 l'envers, mais, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi, il ne semblait pas correspondre aux crit\u00e8res que l\u2019on voit affich\u00e9s \u2013 il s\u2019agissait d\u2019exemples \u00bb.\n[160] Dans certains cas durant son t\u00e9moignage direct, Mme Nastiuk a formul\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9rales, ce qui a incit\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sidente \u00e0 lui demander de donner des exemples pr\u00e9cis :\n[TRADUCTION] Mme Nastiuk : [\u2026] Jamais je n\u2019avais entendu quelqu\u2019un me dire ces choses auparavant, et cela \u2013 ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas logique.\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : Et quand vous dites ces choses, quelles sont ces choses?\nMme Nastiuk : Ces choses \u2013 je ne me souviens pas exactement de ce que ces choses \u00e9taient parce qu\u2019elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas logiques, elles me mettaient en col\u00e8re. [\u2026] Pourquoi est ce que je m\u2019en souviendrais? Apr\u00e8s, \u00e0 la fin, quand j\u2019ai finalement commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 mettre les choses ensemble et \u00e0 enlever tout simplement mes \u0153ill\u00e8res et \u00e0 faire face \u00e0 la situation, je me suis dit que c\u2019\u00e9tait plus de la projection. C\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019impression que \u00e7a faisait.\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : Pouvez-vous m\u2019en donner un exemple?\nMme Nastiuk : Pas vraiment. Non \u2013 pas vraiment \u2013 et je sais que j\u2019ai essay\u00e9 d\u2019y penser, mais, pour moi, c\u2019\u00e9tait incongru, je ne pouvais \u2013 je ne pouvais pas m\u2019en souvenir. [\u2026]\nLa pr\u00e9sidente : [\u2026], mais je veux dire les choses qu\u2019il vous a dites que \u2013 vous employez des mots forts comme \u00ab horrible \u00bb et \u00ab inappropri\u00e9 \u00bb [\u2026] psychanalyse et ceci, mais vous ne donnez aucun d\u00e9tail [\u2026]\nMme Nastiuk : Je me souviens juste exactement de la fa\u00e7on dont je me sentais, cela me mettait en col\u00e8re.\nTranscription : page 196, ligne 25; page 197, lignes 1 \u00e0 7 et 11-23; page 198, lignes 8 \u00e0 10 et 13 \u00e0 17.\n[161] Tout en d\u00e9clarant \u00e0 maintes reprises qu\u2019elle souffrait en silence, incapable d\u2019affronter M. Sinclair et d\u2019exiger qu\u2019il cesse de lui faire des commentaires personnels qu\u2019elle jugeait offensants, Mme Nastiuk a reconnu qu\u2019il lui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 d\u2019avoir des conversations personnelles normales avec lui et que, parfois, elle contestait ce qu\u2019il disait. Cela incluait, notamment, un incident survenu au cours de l\u2019automne 2005, en dehors sa maison, quand M. Sinclair avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 lui parler de son clan et, apr\u00e8s que Mme Nastiuk se fut mise en col\u00e8re et l\u2019eut arr\u00eat\u00e9, il \u00e9tait parti dans son v\u00e9hicule et \u00e9tait plus tard revenu pour s\u2019excuser de son comportement. Mme Nastiuk a \u00e9galement convenu qu\u2019elle avait discut\u00e9 avec M. Sinclair de l\u2019achat possible d\u2019une des automobiles qui lui appartenaient. Mme Nastiuk a relat\u00e9 une autre conversation avec M. Sinclair, au cours de l\u2019automne 2005 dans laquelle il avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 parler de la r\u00e9putation de f\u00eatarde qu\u2019avait la grand-m\u00e8re de Mme Nastiuk. Elle avait aussit\u00f4t r\u00e9agi et mis fin \u00e0 la conversation.\n[162] Au d\u00e9but du contre-interrogatoire auquel Me Bryson a soumis Mme Nastiuk, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli qu\u2019apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union infructueuse avec le chef McPherson en juin 2006, Mme Nastiuk a pris un cong\u00e9 de maladie du 19 juin au 4 octobre 2006. Durant cette p\u00e9riode, Mme Nastiuk a fourni aux intim\u00e9s des demandes \u00e9crites destin\u00e9es \u00e0 servir de fondement \u00e0 des n\u00e9gociations ou \u00e0 une m\u00e9diation concernant ces plaintes. En m\u00eame temps, Mme Nastiuk a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de prestation d\u2019assurance-emploi pour cause de cong\u00e9diement d\u00e9guis\u00e9. Quand Me Bryson l\u2019a interrog\u00e9e en vue de pr\u00e9ciser les circonstances de son cong\u00e9diement d\u00e9guis\u00e9, Mme Nastiuk a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] \u00ab Il y avait des raisons pour lesquelles je ne pouvais pas retourner au centre de gu\u00e9rison, et M. Sinclair en \u00e9tait responsable en grande partie. La fa\u00e7on dont le programme avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 pour fonctionner, tout cela en faisait partie \u00bb. Quand Me Bryson a insist\u00e9 pour qu\u2019elle dise si c\u2019\u00e9tait M. Sinclair ou le chef et le conseil qui avaient mis fin \u00e0 son emploi, Mme Nastiuk a r\u00e9pondu : [TRADUCTION] \u00ab ce serait les deux parce que Couchiching n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u00e0 pour faire preuve de diligence raisonnable. M. Sinclair \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 diriger le programme, \u00e0 embaucher et \u00e0 cong\u00e9dier comme bon lui semblait \u00bb.\n[163] \u00c0 un autre moment au cours du contre-interrogatoire, Mme Nastiuk a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se sentir mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise face \u00e0 M. Sinclair en mars 2005, juste apr\u00e8s que ce dernier eut commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler au CGG. L\u2019avocate de la PNC a ensuite demand\u00e9 si, durant cette p\u00e9riode, Mme Nastiuk avait fait plusieurs d\u00e9placements en automobile avec M. Sinclair, si ce dernier avait \u00e9t\u00e9 chez elle pour souper et d\u00eener, si elle lui avait remis les cl\u00e9s de son automobile et avait discut\u00e9 avec lui de la vente d\u2019une automobile, si elle avait gard\u00e9 les cadeaux qu\u2019il lui avait faits (\u00e0 elle, comme \u00e0 tous les autres membres du personnel, en m\u00eame temps) et si elle l\u2019avait laiss\u00e9 r\u00e9parer son automobile, sa chaudi\u00e8re au mazout et son climatiseur :\n[TRADUCTION] Me Bryson : \u00c9tait-ce parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait votre patron ou parce que vous vouliez qu\u2019il fasse ces choses pour vous?\nMme Nastiuk : Je ne voulais pas qu\u2019il le fasse. Il avait propos\u00e9 de le faire pour moi \u2013 et c\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 je ne me trouvais pas au CGG depuis une partie du mois d\u2019avril \u2013 ou une partie du mois d\u2019avril, une partie du mois de mai, et les choses n\u2019\u00e9taient pas tout \u00e0 fait \u2013 pas vraiment mauvaises \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0.\nTranscription : page 660, lignes 2 \u00e0 11.\nB. Le contre-interrogatoire, par M. Sinclair, de Mme Nastiuk [164] M. Sinclair a pos\u00e9 un certain nombre de questions \u00e0 Mme Nastiuk, lui pr\u00e9sentant une version de leurs interactions qui diff\u00e9rait de celle qu\u2019elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans son t\u00e9moignage direct. M. Sinclair a conclu son contre-interrogatoire de Mme Nastiuk en posant une longue s\u00e9rie de questions pr\u00e9cises, dont fait partie l\u2019\u00e9change suivant :\n[TRADUCTION] M. Sinclair : Et bien, dans ce cas particulier, je suis accus\u00e9 ici de harc\u00e8lement sexuel, et pour moi il est tr\u00e8s important que ces questions soient \u00e9claircies. Le contexte dans lequel les commentaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits, le simple fait de dire que ceci c\u2019est ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit au sujet de commentaires sexuels ou d\u2019une conversation sexuelle, sans donner d\u2019autres informations pour l\u2019\u00e9claircir, ne croyez-vous pas que ce serait pr\u00e9judiciable \u2013 que cela pourrait \u00eatre pr\u00e9judiciable, Mme Nastiuk?\nMme Nastiuk : Je suppose que je reviendrais \u00e0 la fois o\u00f9 j\u2019\u00e9tais assise seule dans votre bureau et que vous avez commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 parler et \u2013 \u00e0 parler de vous-m\u00eame et \u00e0 faire ces commentaires, et que vous n\u2019avez absolument pas tenu compte de la g\u00eane que je ressentais et du fait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait inappropri\u00e9 pour vous de me faire ces commentaires, et toute cette affaire d\u2019ignorer tout simplement ma r\u00e9action ou mon manque de r\u00e9action.\nM. Sinclair : Avez-vous jamais dit, Tom, ne dites pas \u00e7a? Ne parlez pas de \u00e7a? Est-ce que vous me l\u2019avez jamais dit, Mme Nastiuk?\nMme Nastiuk : Pas avant \u2013 je vous l\u2019ai bien dit, mais pas avant la fin de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019automne.\nM. Sinclair : De quelle ann\u00e9e s\u2019agirait-il Mme Nastiuk?\nMme Nastiuk : 2005.\nM. Sinclair : Et combien de fois est-ce que je l\u2019ai dit \u2013 est-il arriv\u00e9 que je dise quelque chose et que vous ne m\u2019ayez jamais rien dit? [\u2026] Est-ce que cela arrivait souvent?\nMme Nastiuk : Je pense que c\u2019\u00e9tait fr\u00e9quent, que les employ\u00e9s \u2013 qu\u2019ils connaissaient cet air que vous aviez et ils savaient qu\u2019il ne fallait pas r\u00e9agir, r\u00e9pondre, s\u2019exprimer. C\u2019\u00e9tait fr\u00e9quent.\nTranscription : page 1290, lignes 20 \u00e0 25; page 1291, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 1292, lignes 2 \u00e0 7.\nVII. La plaignante doit \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie A. Conclusion: La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de Mme Nastiuk [165] Une fois que l\u2019instruction du Tribunal a d\u00e9but\u00e9, la plaignante a eu la responsabilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter un t\u00e9moignage digne de foi qui \u00e9tablirait l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de harc\u00e8lement sexuel contre M. Sinclair, ainsi que de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de la PNC. Elle \u00e9tait tenue de prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, et au moyen de preuves claires et convaincantes, que l\u2019intim\u00e9, M. Sinclair, l\u2019avait harcel\u00e9e sexuellement et que la PNC l\u2019avait priv\u00e9 de ses possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi en exer\u00e7ant des repr\u00e9sailles apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ses plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne aupr\u00e8s de la Commission.\n[166] Le fardeau de preuve initial exigeait que la plaignante pr\u00e9sente une preuve digne de foi sur chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment constitutif de l\u2019acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qui, si on y ajoutait foi, serait suffisante pour justifier un verdict en sa faveur; \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019une r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[167] Lorsqu\u2019une preuve prima facie est \u00e9tablie, le fardeau de preuve se d\u00e9place vers l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui doit produire une preuve constituant une explication raisonnable.\n[168] Cependant, avant de conclure si la plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie, il est absolument essentiel que l\u2019arbitre commence par tirer une conclusion de fait sur la principale question qu\u2019est la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la plaignante. Cette conclusion de fait joue un r\u00f4le fondamental pour ce qui est de toutes les autres conclusions de fait qui se rapportent \u00e0 la preuve produite.\n[169] L\u2019affirmation de Mme Nastiuk selon laquelle la conduite de M. Sinclair \u00e9tait constante et d\u2019une intensit\u00e9 croissante est contredite par ce qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au sujet des nombreuses interactions que les deux ont eues et qui \u00e9taient des activit\u00e9s ordinaires auxquelles elle avait pris part de son plein gr\u00e9, comme le fait que M. Sinclair r\u00e9pare son automobile, son climatiseur et sa chaudi\u00e8re.\n[170] L\u2019affirmation de Mme Nastiuk selon laquelle c\u2019\u00e9tait M. Sinclair qui avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 un milieu de travail hostile dans lequel elle travaillait s\u2019est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e fausse, comme elle l\u2019a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 dans son propre t\u00e9moignage direct ainsi que dans les r\u00e9ponses qu\u2019elle a donn\u00e9es en contre-interrogatoire, et comme l\u2019ont montr\u00e9 aussi les informations que l\u2019administrateur de bande, Dale Morrisseau, avait re\u00e7ues des coll\u00e8gues de travail de Mme Nastiuk. C\u2019est l\u2019irascibilit\u00e9 de cette derni\u00e8re, ainsi que sa condescendance envers ses coll\u00e8gues de travail, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 la source de l\u2019hostilit\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9gard.\n[171] Mme Nastiuk a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir fait des recherches dans des sites Web ax\u00e9s sur les droits de la personne pour d\u00e9terminer si ce qu\u2019elle d\u00e9crivait comme un comportement importun et d\u00e9plac\u00e9 de M. Sinclair envers elle \u00e9tait du harc\u00e8lement sexuel. M\u00eame si elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ce comportement ne correspondait \u00e0 aucune des descriptions de harc\u00e8lement sexuel qu\u2019elle avait trouv\u00e9es en faisant ses recherches, Mme Nastiuk continue d\u2019all\u00e9guer que le type de comportement d\u00e9plac\u00e9 de M. Sinclair est assimilable \u00e0 du harc\u00e8lement sexuel.\n[172] Apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 et examin\u00e9 avec soin le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Nastiuk, je conclus qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin digne de foi. Premi\u00e8rement, elle n\u2019a pas inform\u00e9 M. Sinclair en temps opportun que les contacts de nature non professionnelle qu\u2019il avait avec elle et les questions de nature personnelle qu\u2019il lui posait \u00e9taient importuns et, deuxi\u00e8mement, elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que cette attitude \u00e9tait de nature sexuelle et constituait donc du harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Nastiuk a \u00e9t\u00e9 incoh\u00e9rent et souvent conjectural, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019objectif. Et par-dessus tout, son t\u00e9moignage direct n\u2019a pas r\u00e9sist\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve du contre-interrogatoire.\n[173] Quand il a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Nastiuk en contre-interrogatoire par l\u2019avocate de la PNC et par M. Sinclair, ainsi que dans les questions de la pr\u00e9sidente, de fournir des d\u00e9tails et de donner des exemples au sujet du harc\u00e8lement sexuel qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par M. Sinclair, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable d\u2019en d\u00e9crire un seul.\n[174] Je souscris \u00e0 l\u2019observation que l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la PNC, a faite sur la plainte de repr\u00e9sailles de Mme Nastiuk, car il s\u2019agit d\u2019une description exacte de son t\u00e9moignage :\n[TRADUCTION] Malgr\u00e9 de multiples tentatives en contre-interrogatoire, la PNC n\u2019a pu avoir de Mme Nastiuk un seul exemple de la mani\u00e8re dont la PNC n\u2019a pu la prot\u00e9ger au travail contre les effets all\u00e9gu\u00e9s du harc\u00e8lement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 de M. Sinclair. Les probl\u00e8mes que Mme Nastiuk avait avec la PNC \u00e9taient ax\u00e9s sur les probl\u00e8mes qu\u2019elle disait avoir avec l\u2019administration du CGG, lesquels doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans le contexte de ses \u00e9tudes r\u00e9centes et de son exp\u00e9rience limit\u00e9e dans le domaine, de m\u00eame que de la r\u00e9surrection r\u00e9cente du programme du CGG. Dans les plaintes que Mme Nastiuk a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par la suite en mati\u00e8re de repr\u00e9sailles ainsi qu\u2019aupr\u00e8s de RHDSC \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la PNC celle ci all\u00e8gue de mani\u00e8re inexacte que la PNC ne s\u2019est nullement occup\u00e9e de ses pr\u00e9occupations et ne l\u2019a pas du tout prot\u00e9g\u00e9e contre les effets du harc\u00e8lement de M. Sinclair. Elle ne donne au TCDP aucun exemple de cette omission all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, et sa d\u00e9claration ne correspond pas aux mesures que la PNC a prises pour la faire revenir au travail apr\u00e8s une absence autoris\u00e9e. Le CGG n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre des mesures disciplinaires \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de M. Sinclair ou \u00e0 d\u00e9dommager Mme Nastiuk sans une preuve de probabilit\u00e9s d\u00e9finitive. M. Morrisseau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9concert\u00e9 et incertain quant \u00e0 la nature de la relation qu\u2019entretenaient la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9, M. Sinclair, et quant \u00e0 la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations, de sorte qu\u2019il a pris des mesures d\u2019accommodement et a surveill\u00e9 la situation.\n[175] Je conclus que Mme Nastiuk n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin digne de foi et que ce qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement sexuel et de repr\u00e9sailles n\u2019est pas cr\u00e9dible.\nB. Conclusion: La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Sinclair [176] Les affirmations que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a faites dans son t\u00e9moignage direct ont \u00e9t\u00e9 v\u00e9rifi\u00e9es en contre interrogatoire et demeurent en grande partie intactes. J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage par rapport aux circonstances uniques de l\u2019affaire et \u00e0 l\u2019atmosph\u00e8re stressante qui r\u00e9gnait au CGG de la PNC, et je conclus qu\u2019il est un t\u00e9moin digne de foi qui a fait un t\u00e9moignage cr\u00e9dible. M. Sinclair a ni\u00e9 la totalit\u00e9 des accusations et des all\u00e9gations de comportement d\u00e9plac\u00e9 de Mme Nastiuk, ou les a toutes expliqu\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re raisonnable, et il a ni\u00e9 cat\u00e9goriquement avoir harcel\u00e9 la plaignante sur le plan sexuel.\nC. Conclusion : La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de Dale Morrisseau [177] M. Morrisseau est ind\u00e9pendant de tous les autres t\u00e9moins dans cette affaire. Neutre, objectif et impartial, il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re convaincante et pertinente. Il a estim\u00e9 que ni Mme Nastiuk ni M. Sinclair ne lui avaient r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 tous les d\u00e9tails de leur relation professionnelle\/personnelle, ce qui l\u2019avait laiss\u00e9 aux prises avec le probl\u00e8me d\u2019une double version des faits qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas r\u00e9gler.\nVIII. La d\u00e9cision [178] Au vu des conclusions qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je rejette la totalit\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations d\u2019actes discriminatoires et de repr\u00e9sailles que la plaignante, Mme Nastiuk, a formul\u00e9es contre l\u2019intim\u00e9, M.

Le contexte [1] Le 20 juin 2008, M. Greg Morrison Blain (le plaignant) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission), all\u00e9guant que la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (l\u2019intim\u00e9e) avait fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, contrairement aux articles 7, 10 et 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP). Il soutient avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9 du droit de choisir pour quelle affectation pr\u00e9senter sa candidature \u00e0 cause de l\u2019attitude discriminatoire et st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9e de son surintendant vis-\u00e0-vis de son statut d\u2019Autochtone, ce qui, \u00e0 son avis, constitue aussi du harc\u00e8lement. Il ajoute que les nombreuses enqu\u00eates li\u00e9es au Code de d\u00e9ontologie qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9es sur son r\u00f4le au sein de la Bande indienne d\u2019Ashcroft constituent de la discrimination et du harc\u00e8lement du fait de ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents autochtones.\n[2] Le 30 mars 2012, la Commission a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) instruise la plainte en vertu du paragraphe 44(3) de la LCDP. La Commission prend part \u00e0 l\u2019audience pour repr\u00e9senter l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019affaire.\n[3] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire aupr\u00e8s de la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada en vue, d\u2019une part, de contester la validit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision prise par la Commission de d\u00e9f\u00e9rer la plainte au Tribunal et, d\u2019autre part, de solliciter une ordonnance interdisant \u00e0 ce dernier d\u2019instruire la plainte. La demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 27 avril 2012, et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e au plaignant et \u00e0 la Commission. Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 7 mai 2012, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal suspende l\u2019instruction de la plainte jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada se soit prononc\u00e9e sur sa demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, car la question g\u00e9n\u00e9rale dont la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est saisie consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si la Commission a d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre au Tribunal la plainte relative aux droits de la personne.\n[4] Le 16 mai, M. Susheel Gupta, pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim, a confi\u00e9 \u00e0 la soussign\u00e9e la t\u00e2che de trancher la pr\u00e9sente demande. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 d\u2019avis de requ\u00eate, pas plus qu\u2019une requ\u00eate officielle, comme l\u2019exige l\u2019article 3 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Apr\u00e8s que toutes les parties ont eu la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter leurs observations, j\u2019ai tranch\u00e9 la demande en me fondant sur les documents fournis.\nII. La position des parties [5] L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019autres observations ni invoqu\u00e9 d\u2019autres questions \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa demande de suspension de l\u2019instruction du Tribunal jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale se soit prononc\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de d\u00e9f\u00e9rer la plainte au Tribunal.\n[6] Pour faire suite \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en vue d\u2019obtenir la suspension de l\u2019affaire susmentionn\u00e9e en attendant l\u2019audition de sa demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il y a lieu de la rejeter. Il fait valoir que la LCDP prescrit, au paragraphe 48.9(1), que \u00ab [l\u2019]instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique \u00bb. Suspendre l\u2019instruction pour la simple raison que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire ne serait pas conforme au paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi, car cette mesure emp\u00eacherait de r\u00e9gler le pr\u00e9sent litige de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive. La plainte date de juin 2008 et il s\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9coul\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de quatre ans avant qu\u2019elle atteigne cette \u00e9tape-ci du processus. Un d\u00e9lai additionnel, en attendant l\u2019instruction de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, lui porterait pr\u00e9judice.\n[7] Le plaignant soutient par ailleurs que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a sollicit\u00e9 une suspension mais sans r\u00e9ellement motiver sa demande, hormis le simple fait d\u2019avoir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Il s\u2019agit donc l\u00e0, selon lui, d\u2019un motif insuffisant pour \u00e9tayer une suspension selon la jurisprudence du Tribunal.\n[8] Le plaignant fonde ses observations sur une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente du Tribunal : Marshall c. Cerescorp Co., 2011 TCDP 5, et il fait valoir que, dans cette affaire-l\u00e0, l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait elle aussi demand\u00e9 que l\u2019on soumette \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le judiciaire la d\u00e9cision prise par la Commission de d\u00e9f\u00e9rer la plainte au Tribunal et qu\u2019elle ne souhaitait pas que le processus du Tribunal se poursuive pendant que la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e9tait en instance.\n[9] Le plaignant soutient que lorsque la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire Marshall, cette derni\u00e8re se situait \u00e0 un stade plus avanc\u00e9 devant le Tribunal que ne l\u2019\u00e9tait la pr\u00e9sente affaire au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 un ajournement. Cependant, dans Marshall, m\u00eame si des dates avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9es en vue de l\u2019audition de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande d\u2019ajournement de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, car celle-ci n\u2019avait pas montr\u00e9 que la poursuite de l\u2019instance engag\u00e9e devant le Tribunal causerait un d\u00e9ni de justice naturelle.\n[10] Par ailleurs, le plaignant soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle serait priv\u00e9e de justice naturelle et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale si la demande d\u2019ajournement n\u2019\u00e9tait pas accord\u00e9e. Il ajoute qu\u2019une telle all\u00e9gation ne pourrait pas \u00eatre \u00e9tablie en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et que l\u2019intim\u00e9e aura tout le loisir de pr\u00e9senter au Tribunal des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations. Il soutient donc que le moment o\u00f9 sera entendue la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et son issue \u00e9ventuelle sont actuellement inconnus et qu\u2019il ne faudrait pas qu\u2019il soit oblig\u00e9 d\u2019attendre les r\u00e9sultats de cette demande avant que le Tribunal entreprenne l\u2019instruction de sa plainte.\n[11] La Commission soutient que le fait d\u2019accorder une suspension en attendant l\u2019issue d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire est une question d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public et qu\u2019il y a donc lieu de rejeter la demande. Elle ajoute que la demande de suspension d\u2019instance de l\u2019intim\u00e9e repose sur le fait qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 de soumettre \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le judiciaire la d\u00e9cision prise par la Commission de d\u00e9f\u00e9rer la plainte au Tribunal et que ce simple fait ne suffit pas en droit pour justifier un ajournement, notamment au vu de l\u2019article 48.9 de la LCDP, ainsi que de la jurisprudence. Par ailleurs, elle soutient qu\u2019aucune question de justice naturelle n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9e pour justifier cette demande.\nIII. Analyse [12] Pour \u00e9tudier la demande de suspension, il est n\u00e9cessaire de prendre en compte le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la LCDP, lequel prescrit : \u00ab [l\u2019]instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique \u00bb.\n[13] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure et que le fait de se prononcer sur l\u2019ajournement d\u2019une affaire rel\u00e8ve bel et bien de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire. Je conclus que les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Baltruweit, 2004 TCDP 14 (CanLII), s\u2019appliquent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce :\n[15] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que les tribunaux administratifs sont ma\u00eetres de leur proc\u00e9dure. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils disposent d\u2019importants pouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de se prononcer sur des demandes d\u2019ajournement. Ce principe est analys\u00e9 plus en d\u00e9tail par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Prassad c. Ministre de l\u2019Emploi et de l\u2019Immigration, [1989] 1. R.C.S. 560. Dans cette affaire, l\u2019appelant avait demand\u00e9 l\u2019ajournement de son enqu\u00eate d\u2019immigration en attendant que le Ministre rende sa d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa demande visant \u00e0 lui permettre de demeurer au Canada. L\u2019arbitre a rejet\u00e9 la demande d\u2019ajournement.\n[16] Dans son jugement, la Cour supr\u00eame a affirm\u00e9 que les tribunaux administratifs, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9cises \u00e9tablies par loi ou r\u00e8glement, sont ma\u00eetres chez eux et fixent leur propre proc\u00e9dure. Cependant, dans l\u2019exercice de fonctions judiciaires ou quasi judiciaires, ces tribunaux sont tenus de respecter les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle. [Voir aussi Re Cedarvale Tree Services Ltd. and Labourers\u2019 International Union of North America, (1971), 22 D.L.R. (3d) 40, 50 (C.A. Ont.), Pierre c. Ministre de la Main-d\u2019\u0153uvre et de l\u2019Immigration, [1978] 2 C.F. 849, 851 (C.F., 1re inst.)].\n[14] Cela dit, l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal est assujetti aux r\u00e8gles de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et de la justice naturelle, de m\u00eame qu\u2019au r\u00e9gime de la Loi. Cette derni\u00e8re exige que le Tribunal instruise la plainte quand la Commission lui en fait la demande et, aussi, qu\u2019il accorde aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leurs arguments et leurs observations. L\u2019article 2 de la Loi fait \u00e9tat d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat public pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019\u00e9limination des pratiques discriminatoires. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cet article, les all\u00e9gations de discrimination doivent \u00eatre instruites de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive et en temps opportun.\n[15] Dans une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente qui, \u00e0 mon avis, est applicable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et que le plaignant a d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9e : Marshall c. Cerescorp Co, le membre du Tribunal Edward P. Lustig a conclu, aux paragraphes 11 et 12 :\n[Traduction] Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, l\u2019instruction des plaintes par le Tribunal doit se faire sans formalisme et, \u00e9l\u00e9ment particuli\u00e8rement pertinent quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. Cependant, comme le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre chez lui, il peut n\u00e9anmoins ajourner une instance lorsqu\u2019il le juge appropri\u00e9, vu son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire (voir L\u00e9ger c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1999) D.C.D.P. no 6 (TCDP), au paragraphe 4; Baltruweit c. Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, 2004 TCDP 14, au paragraphe 15). Le Tribunal doit exercer ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en respectant les principes de justice naturelle (Baltruweit, au paragraphe 17). La non-disponibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, le besoin d\u2019ajourner l\u2019instance en vue d\u2019obtenir l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat ou une communication tardive de la part de la partie adverse sont quelques exemples de pr\u00e9occupations li\u00e9es \u00e0 la justice naturelle auxquelles le Tribunal pourrait r\u00e9pondre.\n[\u2026] Pour pouvoir obtenir un ajournement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e se doit d\u2019\u00e9tablir que le fait de laisser l\u2019instance engag\u00e9e devant le Tribunal suivre son cours normal la privera de justice naturelle. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ne m\u2019a pas convaincu que le fait de ne pas accorder un ajournement causerait n\u00e9cessairement un tel pr\u00e9judice.\n[16] Je conclus que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que si sa demande n\u2019est pas accueillie on la privera de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale ou de la justice naturelle, ou d\u2019une possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations. De ce fait, sa demande est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nJuge administrative\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 12 juin 2012\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1808\/3812\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Greg Morrison Blain c.

Analyse. 16\nC........................... Conclusion. 21\n[1] En date du 17 janvier 2005, Madame Yanick Lindor (Plaignante), d\u00e9pose une plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (Commission), en vertu des articles 7 et 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP) contre Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada (Intim\u00e9). En date du 17 mars 2010, la Commission en vertu de l\u2019article 44(3)a) de la LCDP, r\u00e9f\u00e8re la plainte au Tribunal sur la portion de la plainte qui touche \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience et la Commission rejette la portion de la plainte en ce qui a trait aux motifs de distinction illicite quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge, la couleur et la situation de famille. La Commission ne participera pas \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[2] Le 11 octobre 2011, la Plaignante pr\u00e9sente une requ\u00eate pour divulgation en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance du Tribunal enjoignant l\u2019Intim\u00e9 \u00e0 divulguer des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires que la Plaignante estime pertinents, notamment pour les fins de pr\u00e9paration en vue de l\u2019audience.\n[3] Apr\u00e8s analyse des arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les parties au soutien et en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate pour divulgation de documents, j\u2019estime que la question \u00e0 trancher au pr\u00e9alable et qui permettra de d\u00e9terminer la pertinence de la divulgation suppl\u00e9mentaire demand\u00e9e par la Plaignante, est celle de d\u00e9terminer quelle est la port\u00e9e de la plainte. L\u2019Intim\u00e9 conteste indirectement dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate pour divulgation, l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de certains all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la Plaignante; ces all\u00e9gu\u00e9s en question touchent \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate pour divulgation et l\u2019Intim\u00e9 s\u2019appuie sur la port\u00e9e de la plainte pour formuler ses objections. L\u2019Intim\u00e9 affirme que la port\u00e9e de la plainte ne s\u2019\u00e9tend pas au-del\u00e0 du 22 avril 2004.\n[4] Puisque la pertinence est appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e en regard non seulement de la plainte mais aussi, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e9manant des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 6(1)d) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du TCDP, il est important de trancher d\u2019abord la question de la port\u00e9e de la plainte car la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 en d\u00e9pend.\n[5] Un appel conf\u00e9rence a eu lieu le 1er mars 2012 afin de clarifier certaines questions sur la requ\u00eate en divulgation et dans le but d\u2019\u00e9tablir un \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier afin que les parties puissent soumettre leurs arguments sur la port\u00e9e de la plainte.\n[6] Le Tribunal a donn\u00e9 l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 aux parties de pr\u00e9senter des arguments \u00e9crits suppl\u00e9mentaires et, au besoin, de pr\u00e9senter de la jurisprudence \u00e0 l\u2019appui sur leur position sur la port\u00e9e de la plainte. Les parties ont donc soumis au Tribunal leurs arguments sur la port\u00e9e de la plainte et ont r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 leurs arguments d\u00e9j\u00e0 soumis au Tribunal sur la requ\u00eate en divulgation.\n[7] Les deux questions \u00e0 trancher sont les suivantes:\n1. Quelle est la port\u00e9e de la plainte? Couvre-t-elle ou non les \u00e9v\u00e9nements auxquels fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence la Plaignante dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et sa port\u00e9e s\u2019\u00e9tend-elle au-del\u00e0 du 22 avril 2004?\n2. La demande de divulgation suppl\u00e9mentaire de la Plaignante est-elle justifi\u00e9e dans les circonstances?\n[8] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question : Quelle est la port\u00e9e de la plainte? Couvre-t-elle ou non les \u00e9v\u00e9nements auxquels fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence la Plaignante dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et sa port\u00e9e s\u2019\u00e9tend-elle au-del\u00e0 du 22 avril 2004?\nI. Les faits et les positions des parties [9] La Plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e par l\u2019employeur en 1998 \u00e0 titre de graphiste. Elle a poursuivi des \u00e9tudes pour devenir traductrice multilingue et en novembre 2002, elle a commenc\u00e9 le programme d\u2019apprentissage dans le bureau de la traduction. Durant sa participation au programme, la Plaignante avance qu\u2019elle a fait une d\u00e9pression grave et souffrait de migraines tr\u00e8s s\u00e9v\u00e8res et de crises de panique. Elle affirme avoir subi de la discrimination et du harc\u00e8lement, et ses all\u00e9gations sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, la Plaignante mentionne que ce traitement discriminatoire a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9.\n[10] La Plaignante soumet que le 6 avril 2004, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e du programme d\u2019apprentissage alors qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie. Elle ajoute que puisqu\u2019elle \u00e9tait fonctionnaire avant sa rentr\u00e9e dans le programme d\u2019apprentissage (contrairement \u00e0 la plupart des participants du programme), l\u2019employeur avait une obligation de lui offrir un autre poste \u00e9quivalent au niveau TR-01, selon la Loi, les r\u00e8glements, et la convention collective apr\u00e8s son renvoi.\n[11] La Plaignante affirme ne pas \u00eatre retourn\u00e9e au travail et ce, jusqu\u2019au 18 janvier 2006, soit jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle soit mut\u00e9e dans un poste d\u2019agente d\u2019appui professionnel au niveau SI-01 au Bureau de la traduction au Service de la d\u00e9fense nationale.\n[12] La Plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission le 17 janvier 2005. Dans sa plainte elle fait mention que les actes discriminatoires se sont perp\u00e9tu\u00e9s apr\u00e8s son renvoi du programme TR survenu le 6 avril 2004 et \u00e0 cet effet elle pr\u00e9cise:\n\u00ab (...) Je porte plainte contre mon employeur, le Bureau de la traduction (BT) des Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada, qui ne m\u2019a pas assur\u00e9 un milieu de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement. Je soutiens avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination: traitements in\u00e9quitables, harc\u00e8lement r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9, intimidation et menaces de repr\u00e9sailles, rabaissement public, d\u00e9nigrement de ma condition invalidante et cong\u00e9diement d\u00e9guis\u00e9 de la part de Mme M.B., Gestionnaire du Service criminologie et de Mme C.M., Encadreuse, \u00e0 cause de ma couleur, de mon \u00e2ge, de ma situation de famille, de ma d\u00e9ficience et de mon \u00e9tat de d\u00e9tresse mentale. \u00bb\n[13] La Plaignante mentionne qu\u2019au moment de la signature de sa plainte, en 2005, elle \u00e9tait toujours \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de l\u2019Intim\u00e9, et \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie.\n[14] La Plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle indique dans sa plainte qu\u2019elle s\u2019est retrouv\u00e9e dans une situation pr\u00e9caire \u00e0 partir d\u2019avril 2004 en raison de son renvoi et que ces circonstances persisteraient jusqu'\u00e0 sa mutation \u00e9ventuelle et que la plainte fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au traitement discriminatoire qui lui serait inflig\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle soit mut\u00e9e suite \u00e0 son retour de cong\u00e9. De\nplus, selon la Plaignante, peu de jours apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u une lettre de cong\u00e9diement d\u00e9guis\u00e9, la gestionnaire rend publics les renseignements personnels de la Plaignante et \u00e0 cet effet elle mentionne dans sa plainte :\n\u00ab Lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union, M.B., confirme, \u00e0 ma demande, que le programme TR prendrait fin le 1er janvier 2005. Quelques jours plus tard, le 16 avril, ma condition m\u00e9dicale me force \u00e0 garder le lit. Inform\u00e9e par le m\u00e9decin traitant de mon invalidit\u00e9, la gestionnaire se d\u00e9p\u00eache pour me faire parvenir, le 3 mai 2004, \u00e0 domicile, durant mon invalidit\u00e9, la d\u00e9cision prise par la direction de mettre fin \u00e0 ma participation au programme TR. Ainsi, l\u2019employeur aggrave ma d\u00e9tresse mentale en me faisant parvenir l\u2019\u00e9valuation du mois de mars, une note dat\u00e9e du 22 avril, \u201fpour t\u2019annoncer une nouvelle d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able\u201d et une lettre de cong\u00e9diement d\u00e9guis\u00e9 dat\u00e9e du 6 avril, mettant fin \u00e0 mon emploi \u00e0 la fin de la m\u00eame journ\u00e9e. Cette d\u00e9cision d\u00e9coulant de caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles, a pour but de me mettre tout a fait a l\u2019\u00e9cart. \u201fLa directrice a demand\u00e9 qu\u2019on mute l\u2019employ\u00e9e \u00e0 la DSP d\u00e8s son retour afin d\u2019\u00e9viter une situation d\u00e9licate\u201d.\nCette d\u00e9cision a pour but \u00e9galement de me forcer \u00e0 me trouver un emploi ailleurs \u201f\u00e0 son retour de cong\u00e9, elle continuera de toucher son salaire pendant qu\u2019elle se cherche un autre emploi\u201d; elle me laisse sans travail et sans contact, dans la honte et le d\u00e9sespoir \u00e0 cause de ma d\u00e9ficience et mon \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 psychologique. Peu de jours apr\u00e8s, M.B. rend publics ces renseignements que j\u2019estime personnels et confidentiels. Elle a manqu\u00e9 de compassion et de respect \u00e0 mon endroit dans un message humiliant, rabaissant et ridiculisant transmis par courriel \u00e0 tous les coll\u00e8gues. Le message fait allusion \u00e0 mon incapacit\u00e9 \u201felle n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi\u2026 cet \u00e9chec n\u2019enl\u00e8ve rien \u00e0 ses qualit\u00e9s\u2026 afin de ne pas imposer un fardeau financier \u00e0 notre service\u201d, \u00e0 ma d\u00e9ficience, \u00e0 mon renvoi du programme TR et \u00e0 ma mutation. \u201fNotre directrice a demand\u00e9 qu\u2019on mute l\u2019employ\u00e9e \u00e0 la DSP d\u00e8s son retour\u201d.\nM.B. a ni\u00e9 mes droits, elle devait savoir que ce message de nature discriminatoire et haineuse (...) allait m\u2019avilir et nuire \u00e0 ma r\u00e9putation. L\u2019employeur fait preuve d\u2019un m\u00e9pris flagrant de mon \u00e9tat et ne m\u2019a pas assur\u00e9 un traitement \u00e9quitable de gestion de sorte que ce manquement provoque un bouleversement de ma vie tant personnel, qu\u2019\u00e9conomique et m\u2019inflige une souffrance morale injustifi\u00e9e. Mes droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 au travail et \u00e0 la protection de l\u2019emploi devant la loi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 bafou\u00e9s. \u00bb\n[15] Dans ses repr\u00e9sentations, la Plaignante avance qu\u2019il est clair qu\u2019elle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans sa plainte au traitement discriminatoire qui lui serait inflig\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle soit mut\u00e9e suite \u00e0 son retour de cong\u00e9. Selon elle, l\u2019Intim\u00e9 avait certaines obligations comme employeur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette mutation et dans la mesure que des actes discriminatoires se sont perp\u00e9tu\u00e9s jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle soit mut\u00e9e, ces actes s\u2019ins\u00e8rent dans la port\u00e9e de la plainte. La Plaignante affirme que les actes discriminatoires qui sont survenus apr\u00e8s le 6 avril 2004, soit apr\u00e8s son renvoi du programme TR, constituent un prolongement de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e entre 2002 et 2004 et sont assujettis \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal.\n[16] La Plaignante affirme que les \u00e9changes de courriels survenus apr\u00e8s avril 2004 dont fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence la Plaignante dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions au paragraphe 36, d\u00e9montrent clairement de quelle fa\u00e7on l\u2019Intim\u00e9 percevait ses obligations envers la Plaignante durant cette p\u00e9riode et ainsi que son appr\u00e9ciation du rendement de la Plaignante et de ses capacit\u00e9s et habilet\u00e9s en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9e :\n\u00ab On n\u2019a jamais r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 s\u2019en d\u00e9barrasser??? Pauvre toi! Tous ces efforts pour rester finalement pogn\u00e9s avec\u2026 \u00c0 moins qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 conserv\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9ceptionniste ou commis? \u00bb\n[17] La Plaignante fait valoir que la port\u00e9e d\u2019une plainte ne se d\u00e9finit pas seulement par une p\u00e9riode temporelle mais plut\u00f4t par la nature des actes reproch\u00e9s ainsi que ce qui d\u00e9coule des actes reproch\u00e9s.\n[18] L\u2019Intim\u00e9, au sujet de la question de la port\u00e9e de la plainte, soutient qu\u2019il ne fait aucun doute que la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte se situe entre le mois de d\u00e9cembre 2002 et le mois d\u2019avril 2004. L\u2019Intim\u00e9 se r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 la page frontispice de la plainte qui indique sous l\u2019item \u201fDate de l\u2019acte discriminatoire pr\u00e9sum\u00e9\u201d, que la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par l\u2019acte discriminatoire est du 24 d\u00e9cembre 2002 au 22 avril 2004. L\u2019Intim\u00e9 ajoute que cette p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9e par la Plaignante elle-m\u00eame sur la page frontispice de la plainte. L\u2019Intim\u00e9 soutient que la lecture de la plainte confirme la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e et identifi\u00e9e par la Plaignante. Il mentionne que la Plaignante indique d\u2019abord qu\u2019elle est entr\u00e9e en fonction (stage) le 2 d\u00e9cembre 2002 (page 1, 3i\u00e8me paragraphe) et que deux semaines apr\u00e8s elle d\u00e9note une discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard \u201fen raison de ma couleur et de mon \u00e2ge\u201d (page 1, 4i\u00e8me paragraphe). L\u2019Intim\u00e9 affirme que la Plaignante termine sa plainte en soulignant un dernier fait qui lui aurait caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice quelques jours apr\u00e8s la note du 22 avril 2004 : \u00abPeu de jours apr\u00e8s, M.B. rend publics ces renseignements que j\u2019estime personnels et confidentiels.\u00bb (Page 3, dernier paragraphe).\n[19] Pour ces raisons, l\u2019Intim\u00e9 soumet qu\u2019il ne fait aucun doute que la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte se situe dans la p\u00e9riode mentionn\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment.\n[20] Selon l\u2019Intim\u00e9, le Tribunal est donc saisi d\u2019une plainte qui couvre cette p\u00e9riode et son pouvoir d\u00e9cisionnel pour statuer sur cette plainte se limite n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 cette p\u00e9riode puisque la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d\u00e9coule de la plainte. Au soutien de sa position, l\u2019Intim\u00e9 fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Bell Canada c. Association canadienne des employ\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, 2003 CSC 36. L\u2019Intim\u00e9 affirme que cette d\u00e9cision reconna\u00eet que la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d\u00e9coule de la plainte qui lui est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Commission.\nII. Analyse [21] Apr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les arguments des parties et apr\u00e8s \u00e9tude des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions de la Plaignante et de l\u2019Intim\u00e9 et \u00e9tude de la plainte, je consid\u00e8re que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements entourant les circonstances du renvoi de la Plaignante du programme TR ainsi que ceux entourant sa mutation sont directement li\u00e9es aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements dont fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence la Plaignante dans sa plainte; le fait de les inclure dans la port\u00e9e de la plainte devant le Tribunal n\u2019a pas pour effet de constituer une nouvelle plainte ou de d\u00e9naturer la plainte r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Commission. La LCDP pr\u00e9voit \u00e0 l\u2019article 48.9(1) que : \u00ab L\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. \u00bb Le Tribunal tire sa comp\u00e9tence de la LCDP et entend les plaintes r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9es par la Commission. Il est \u00e9galement ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure et a le pouvoir d\u2019amender une plainte s\u2019il consid\u00e8re que les faits survenus apr\u00e8s la plainte, d\u00e9coulent de ceux mentionn\u00e9s dans la plainte et, ne constituent pas une nouvelle plainte qui aurait pour effet de la soustraire \u00e0 l\u2019application du processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission, processus pr\u00e9vu dans la LCDP. Aucune demande formelle n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e devant le Tribunal pour amender la plainte. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, je me prononcerai donc sur la port\u00e9e de la plainte plut\u00f4t que sur le fait de l\u2019amender ou non.\n[22] Lorsque le Tribunal examine la plainte, il le fait en accord avec les principes susmentionn\u00e9s et de mani\u00e8re non formaliste et non rigide:\n\u00ab Les formules de plainte ne doivent pas \u00eatre scrut\u00e9es de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu'un acte d'accusation en mati\u00e8re criminelle. \u00bb\nCanada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Robinson, [1994] 3 CF 228 (CA)\n[23] Je consid\u00e8re applicable aux circonstances en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du mus\u00e9e canadien des civilisations c. Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada (section local 70396), 2006 CF 704, au para. 53 :\n\u00ab Ce qui importe en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, c\u2019est de savoir si les faits dont dispose le Tribunal r\u00e9v\u00e8lent qu\u2019une certaine politique est discriminatoire. Aussi, une analyse trop stricte ou trop technique de la plainte ne devrait pas \u00eatre adopt\u00e9e. \u00bb\n[24] Il ne fait nul doute que le Tribunal a le pouvoir d\u2019amender une plainte \u00e0 cet effet dans\nCanada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Parent, 2006 CF 1313 au para. 30 :\n\u00ab Le Tribunal jouit d\u2019une discr\u00e9tion consid\u00e9rable relativement \u00e0 l\u2019instruction des plaintes en vertu des paragraphes 48.9(1) et (2) et des articles 49 et 50 de la Loi. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de cette discr\u00e9tion pour traiter d\u2019une demande d\u2019amendement, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canderel Lt\u00e9e c. Canada (C.A.), 1993 CanLII 2990 (CAF), [1994] 1 C.F. 3, 1993 IIJCan 2990 (C.A.F.), le juge Robert D\u00e9cary a rappel\u00e9 que : \u00ab [\u2026] la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est qu'une modification devrait \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 tout stade de l'action aux fins de d\u00e9terminer les v\u00e9ritables questions litigieuses entre les parties, pourvu, notamment, que cette autorisation ne cause pas d'injustice \u00e0 l'autre partie que des d\u00e9pens ne pourraient r\u00e9parer, et qu'elle serve les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice. \u00bb (Notre emphase).\n[25] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la page frontispice de la plainte, cette derni\u00e8re est un document non-sign\u00e9 qui donne un aper\u00e7u de ce que contient la plainte et que je ne consid\u00e8re pas comme un acte de proc\u00e9dure au m\u00eame titre que la plainte. La plainte est sign\u00e9e \u00e0 chacune des pages ainsi que la page intitul\u00e9e formulaire de plainte. La page frontispice de la plainte indique, sous le titre \u201fMotif(s) de distinction illicite\u201d, couleur, \u00e2ge, situation de famille et d\u00e9ficience or, la Commission a par la suite d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer la plainte sur un moins large \u00e9ventail de motifs de distinction illicite que ceux indiqu\u00e9s sur la page frontispice. En effet, lorsque la Commission r\u00e9f\u00e8re la plainte, elle l\u2019envoie accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019une lettre qui mentionne sa d\u00e9cision et qui en pr\u00e9cise la port\u00e9e et, dans le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, elle a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 la plainte sur le motif illicite de distinction de la d\u00e9ficience et non sur les autres motifs inscrits sur la page frontispice. On peut donc conclure que la page frontispice n\u2019a pas la m\u00eame importance sur le plan proc\u00e9dural que ne le pr\u00e9tend l\u2019Intim\u00e9.\n[26] Dans les circonstances, cela d\u00e9naturerait l\u2019administration de la justice de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019instruction devant le Tribunal pour la partie de la plainte qui r\u00e9f\u00e8re aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements couvrant la p\u00e9riode jusqu\u2019au 22 avril 2004 et ensuite, de demander \u00e0 la Plaignante de soumettre les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus apr\u00e8s le 22 avril 2004 d\u00e9coulant des circonstances d\u00e9crites dans la plainte mais qui vont au-del\u00e0 de ceux-ci, \u00e0 la Commission pour enqu\u00eate et, ainsi de recommencer le processus complet pour s\u2019assurer qu\u2019aucun pr\u00e9judice n\u2019est subi par l\u2019Intim\u00e9. Dans la d\u00e9cision Kavanagh c. Service correctionnel du Canada (31 Mai 1999), T505\/2298 (T.C.D.P.), la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal a repris le raisonnement appliqu\u00e9 par la Commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate de l\u2019Ontario dans Entrop c. Compagnie p\u00e9troli\u00e8re imp\u00e9riale Lt\u00e9e (1994) 23 C.H.R.R. D\/186. Il est \u00e9crit au paragraphe 9 de cette d\u00e9cision qu\u2019il : \u00ab serait difficile au plan pratique, inefficace et injuste d\u2019exiger que les personnes pr\u00e9sentent des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles seulement dans le cadre d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure distincte \u00bb. La m\u00eame d\u00e9marche a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie dans Fowler c. Flicka Gymnastics Club, 31 C.H.R.R. D\/397 (B.C.H.R.C.). Dans cette affaire, la partie plaignante a soutenu que l\u2019amendement d\u00e9coulait [traduction] \u00ab des faits constituant le fondement de la plainte initiale \u00bb.\n[27] Je consid\u00e8re ces deux d\u00e9cisions applicables en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce puisqu\u2019elles mentionnent la pertinence de ne pas entreprendre de proc\u00e9dure distincte pour des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles qui d\u00e9coulent des faits constituant le fondement de la plainte initiale. Bien que le cas pr\u00e9sent ne traite pas d\u2019all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles suite \u00e0 la plainte, la m\u00eame d\u00e9marche intellectuelle peut s\u2019appliquer puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019exclure ou non, des \u00e9v\u00e9nements post\u00e9rieurs au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte et, qui constituent le prolongement de la plainte initiale.\n[28] Dans un m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, le membre Groarke \u00e9crit dans l\u2019affaire Cook c. Premi\u00e8re nation d\u2019Onion Lake, 2002 CanLII 45929 (TCDP) au para. 17: \u00ab [l]a r\u00e8gle de pratique est par cons\u00e9quent que les questions qui d\u00e9coulent d\u2019un m\u00eame ensemble de circonstances factuelles devraient normalement \u00eatre entendues ensemble. \u00bb\n[29] J\u2019abonde en ce sens, et je consid\u00e8re que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements d\u00e9coulant de la plainte initiale devraient \u00eatre entendus ensemble, ce qui est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[30] Ainsi, dans Parent supra, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale examine s\u2019il existe un commun d\u00e9nominateur entre les all\u00e9gations de discrimination dans la plainte initiale et l\u2019amendement \u00e0 la plainte :\n\u00ab [43] Je ne retiens pas cette pr\u00e9tention du demandeur. Dans les circonstances, il existe un facteur commun qui fonde les all\u00e9gations de discrimination dans la plainte initiale et dans l\u2019amendement accord\u00e9, \u00e0 savoir la sant\u00e9 du d\u00e9fendeur Alain Parent. Cela constitue le lien qui permet au Tribunal de conclure comme il l\u2019a fait. La discrimination dont se plaint ledit d\u00e9fendeur est all\u00e9gu\u00e9e \u00eatre \u00e9galement un facteur dans sa lib\u00e9ration. \u00bb\n[31] Dans un respect des r\u00e8gles d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, il est important d\u2019analyser le pr\u00e9judice que pourrait subir l\u2019Intim\u00e9 et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, de tenter d\u2019y rem\u00e9dier. \u00c0 cet effet la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9labor\u00e9 sur la question du pr\u00e9judice toujours dans Parent supra au paragraphe 40:\n\u00ab La question du pr\u00e9judice est le facteur pr\u00e9dominent \u00e0 \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 dans de telles circonstances. L\u2019amendement ne doit pas \u00eatre accord\u00e9 s\u2019il cause un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019Intim\u00e9. Ici, bien que la plainte ait pu \u00eatre amend\u00e9e \u00e0 un stade moins avanc\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures, rien dans la preuve n\u2019indique que les Forces canadiennes n\u2019\u00e9taient en mesure de se pr\u00e9parer et de faire valoir sa position sur les questions soulev\u00e9es. L\u2019amendement n\u2019a caus\u00e9 aucun pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e et dans les circonstances, la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients penche en faveur du d\u00e9fendeur Alain Parent. \u00bb\n[32] Bien qu\u2019ici il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un amendement \u00e0 la plainte mais plut\u00f4t d\u2019une pr\u00e9cision sur sa port\u00e9e, les crit\u00e8res applicables lors d\u2019un amendement sont utiles pour les fins de cette analyse.\n[33] Les parties sont au stade de la divulgation et ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions devant le Tribunal. Bien que l\u2019Intim\u00e9 ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie pas des moyens de d\u00e9fense \u00e0 soulever au stade de l\u2019enqu\u00eate devant la Commission en ce qui concerne les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus apr\u00e8s 2005, il convient de noter que les all\u00e9gations faites dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions des parties doivent n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre prouv\u00e9es au stade de l\u2019audience devant le Tribunal. L\u2019Intim\u00e9 aura donc l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter toute sa preuve et de contre-interroger les t\u00e9moins de la Plaignante et de faire sa plaidoirie en cons\u00e9quence. J\u2019en conclu donc que l\u2019Intim\u00e9 ne subira pas de pr\u00e9judice.\n[34] Je conclu que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements entourant le renvoi de la Plaignante du programme TR ainsi que toutes les circonstances pertinentes entourant la mutation de la Plaignante incluant la mutation compl\u00e9t\u00e9e et, les actions ayant eu lieu par la suite qui r\u00e9f\u00e8rent \u00e0 ces circonstances, font partie de la port\u00e9e de la plainte.\n[35] Le principal objectif consiste \u00e0 s\u2019assurer que toutes les parties ont la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re d\u2019\u00eatre entendues par le Tribunal comme le pr\u00e9voit l\u2019article 50(1) de la LCDP. L\u2019Intim\u00e9 aura donc l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 d\u2019amender son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\nIII. Conclusion [36] Ayant d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus apr\u00e8s le 22 avril 2004 et mentionn\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment font partie de la port\u00e9e de la plainte et feront partie de l\u2019instruction devant le Tribunal, il reste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la pertinence des documents demand\u00e9s par la Plaignante dans sa requ\u00eate en divulgation.\n[37] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me question : La demande de divulgation suppl\u00e9mentaire de la Plaignante est-elle justifi\u00e9e dans les circonstances?\nA. Les faits et les positions des parties [38] Les principaux arguments au soutien de la requ\u00eate de la Plaignante relativement \u00e0 la question de la divulgation sont les suivants :\n(a) En octobre 2010, les parties ont \u00e9chang\u00e9 leurs expos\u00e9s de pr\u00e9cisions respectifs et ont fait la divulgation des documents pertinents selon les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal.\n(b) La divulgation de l\u2019Intim\u00e9 ne contient aucun document qui date au-del\u00e0 du 17 juin 2004, sauf pour une lettre dat\u00e9e du 17 octobre 2005. L\u2019Intim\u00e9 refuse de produire des documents qui datent au-del\u00e0 du 17 juin 2004 pour le motif que ces documents ne sont pas pertinents puisqu\u2019ils remontent \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode post\u00e9rieure au sujet faisant l\u2019objet de la plainte de la Plaignante notamment, son renvoi survenu le 6 avril 2004.\n(c) En 2002, la Plaignante soutient avoir d\u00e9but\u00e9 le programme d\u2019apprentissage dispens\u00e9 par le Bureau de traduction. Durant sa participation au programme, la plaignante a fait une d\u00e9pression grave, et souffrait de migraines tr\u00e8s s\u00e9v\u00e8res et de crises de panique. Elle soutient avoir subi de la discrimination et du harc\u00e8lement, traitement ayant contribu\u00e9 aux probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 de la plaignante et ces all\u00e9gations sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la Plaignante.\n(d) Le 6 avril 2004, la Plaignante affirme avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e du programme d\u2019apprentissage alors qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie. Comme elle \u00e9tait fonctionnaire avant sa rentr\u00e9e dans le programme d\u2019apprentissage, l\u2019employeur avait une obligation d\u2019offrir \u00e0 la Plaignante, apr\u00e8s son renvoi, un autre poste \u00e9quivalent au niveau TR-01, selon la convention collective, les lois et les r\u00e8glements.\n(e) Le 17 juin 2004, la Plaignante a effectu\u00e9 une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et suite \u00e0 cette demande, elle a obtenu de nombreux documents pertinents aux faits mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus et qui datent au-del\u00e0 du 17 juin 2004 et qui font partie de sa divulgation dans cette instance. Compte tenu de la nature des documents obtenus suite \u00e0 cette demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, la Plaignante maintient qu\u2019il est fort probable que d\u2019autres documents pertinents aux questions en litige et qui datent au-del\u00e0 du 17 juin 2004, demeurent toujours en possession de l\u2019employeur et doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s.\n(f) La Plaignante soumet que dans sa r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019Intim\u00e9 sugg\u00e8re que le crit\u00e8re pour d\u00e9terminer si un document doit \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9 est celui de la pertinence, et que la pertinence s\u2019appr\u00e9cie par rapport aux all\u00e9gations contenues dans les actes de proc\u00e9dures.\n(g) La Plaignante affirme que tout document qui est \u201fpotentiellement pertinent\u201d doit \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9 et, que ce crit\u00e8re n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s exigeant et qu\u2019il s\u2019appr\u00e9cie par rapport aux questions en litige.\n(h) Selon la Plaignante, certains documents pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019instance datant au-del\u00e0 du 17 juin 2004 et qui sont en possession de la mise en cause doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s.\n[39] La Plaignante demande au Tribunal de contraindre l\u2019Intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la divulgation des documents suivants :\n(a) Tout document, notes personnelles, notes de service. Notes prises lors de rencontres ou d\u2019appels, correspondance, courriels, pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par\/\u00e9chang\u00e9s entre C\u00e9line Marchand, Manon Boucher, Nicole Dugr\u00e9, Jocelyne Doyle-Rodrigue, Richard Berriault, Genevi\u00e8ve Durocher et tout autre employ\u00e9, se rapportant au renvoi de la Plaignante du programme d\u2019apprentissage, \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 de son travail dans son programme, \u00e0 son rendement, aux probl\u00e8mes au niveau du personnel impliquant la Plaignante, \u00e0 son placement dans un autre poste apr\u00e8s son renvoi, aux discussions sur son cong\u00e9diement, \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019un nouveau poste pour elle, et enfin, \u00e0 son retour au travail.\n(b) Toutes les notes, courriels et autres documents pr\u00e9par\u00e9s pour l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne men\u00e9e par l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice embauch\u00e9e par la mise en cause, suite \u00e0 la plainte de la plaignante d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 17 janvier 2005.\n(c) Toutes les notes, courriels et autres documents pr\u00e9par\u00e9s pour la proc\u00e9dure du grief du 6 juin 2004, la plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, ou tout autre processus qui portent sur ces m\u00eames faits.\n(d) Une liste des journ\u00e9es de cong\u00e9 prises par la Plaignante entre janvier 2006 jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent.\n(e) Tout autre document pertinent aux faits en litige, tels que d\u00e9crits dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la Plaignante.\n[40] La Plaignante avance que la r\u00e8gle 6(1)(d) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du TCDP indique clairement que les parties doivent divulguer les documents qui ont une pertinence par rapport aux faits, aux questions et aux mesures de redressement mentionn\u00e9es dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions ; il n\u2019y a rien dans cette r\u00e8gle qui indique que la pertinence s\u2019appr\u00e9cie seulement selon le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte.\n[41] La Plaignante affirme que l\u2019Intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte est \u00ab l\u2019acte de proc\u00e9dure \u00bb dans les causes dont est saisi ce Tribunal.\n[42] La Plaignante avance que le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte est un document tr\u00e8s bref, pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par la Commission, qui contient tr\u00e8s peu d\u2019information, autre que le nom de la Plaignante, la date de l\u2019acte discriminatoire, l\u2019adresse o\u00f9 a eu lieu l\u2019incident, les motifs de distinction illicite, les articles pertinents de la loi, et un sommaire de quelques mots des actes de discrimination. Il est comme son nom l\u2019indique, un sommaire, et ne constitue pas une plaidoirie qui contient tous les faits mat\u00e9riaux.\n[43] Selon la Plaignante, la demande de divulgation n\u2019est pas une \u00ab une exp\u00e9dition de p\u00eache \u00bb. Elle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 les documents qui seront possiblement pertinents, a \u00e9tabli la pertinence de tous les documents demand\u00e9s et, dans la mesure du possible, a identifi\u00e9 les personnes qui poss\u00e9daient ces documents.\n[44] Pour sa part, l\u2019Intim\u00e9 au soutien de sa r\u00e9ponse avance ce qui suit :\n\u00ab L\u2019article 6(1)d) et e) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne traite sp\u00e9cifiquement des documents qui doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s dans le cadre de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de chacune des parties. Il se lit comme suit :\n6(1) Chaque partie doit signifier et d\u00e9poser dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le membre instructeur un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions indiquant :\n(\u2026)\nd) les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u2013 pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 \u2013 et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle ;\ne) les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u2013 pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation est invoqu\u00e9 \u2013 et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de\nredressement demand\u00e9s en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle; \u00bb (Nous soulignons)\n[45] L\u2019Intim\u00e9 soutient que le crit\u00e8re pour d\u00e9terminer si un document doit \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9 est donc clairement identifi\u00e9 par l\u2019article 6 soit celui de la pertinence.\n[46] L\u2019Intim\u00e9 affirme qu\u2019il est bien \u00e9tabli par la plus haute instance d\u00e9cisionnelle du pays que \u00ab la pertinence \u00bb s\u2019\u00e9value au regard des all\u00e9gations contenues aux actes de proc\u00e9dure :\n\u00ab La pertinence s\u2019appr\u00e9cie alors principalement par rapport aux all\u00e9gations contenues dans les actes de proc\u00e9dure. \u00bb\nGlegg c. Smith & Nephew Inc., 2005 CSC 31, au para. 22\n[47] L\u2019Intim\u00e9 soutient que le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte de la Plaignante dat\u00e9 du 14 janvier 2005, constitue l\u2019acte de proc\u00e9dure par lequel le Tribunal peut identifier la pertinence de la demande de divulgation et, cons\u00e9quemment, la p\u00e9riode qui devrait \u00eatre couverte pour l\u2019exercice de la divulgation.\n[48] L\u2019Intim\u00e9 soumet qu\u2019en identifiant la p\u00e9riode qui devrait \u00eatre couverte pour l\u2019exercice de la divulgation, on \u00e9vite qu\u2019une partie abuse du processus de divulgation en effectuant \u00ab une exp\u00e9dition de p\u00eache \u00bb et en imposant un fardeau inutile \u00e0 la partie adverse qui fait face \u00e0 une telle demande.\n[49] L\u2019Intim\u00e9 affirme que la Plaignante a elle-m\u00eame identifi\u00e9 dans le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte, sous l\u2019item \u201fDate\u201d de l\u2019acte discriminatoire pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 (page frontispice), que la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par l\u2019acte discriminatoire est du 24 d\u00e9cembre 2002 au 22 avril 2004.\n[50] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019Intim\u00e9 soumet que la p\u00e9riode pertinente concernant la plainte se situe entre le 24 d\u00e9cembre 2002 et le 22 avril 2004. Le Tribunal devra ultimement d\u00e9cider si durant cette p\u00e9riode, la Plaignante a prouv\u00e9 l\u2019acte discriminatoire pr\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n[51] Pour l\u2019Intim\u00e9, il devient donc \u00e9vident que celui-ci a rempli largement son obligation de divulgation puisque la p\u00e9riode couverte par l\u2019exercice de divulgation se situe entre le mois de janvier 2002 et le 17 juin 2004. (Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9 du 25 octobre 2010, annexe A).\n[52] Dans le cadre de son exercice de divulgation pour la p\u00e9riode couverte, l\u2019Intim\u00e9 a trouv\u00e9 deux documents dat\u00e9s respectivement du 22 ao\u00fbt 2005 et du 5 octobre 2005 (document divulgu\u00e9 \u00e9galement par la Plaignante dans son volume 6, document #386). Le premier document repr\u00e9sentant le registre des congr\u00e8s de la Plaignante du 1 avril 2004 au 26 mars 2004 et, le second \u00e9tant un document \u00e9manant de Sant\u00e9 Canada au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019aptitude de travail de la Plaignante.\n[53] L\u2019Intim\u00e9 soumet qu\u2019il a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une divulgation compl\u00e8te, dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du 25 octobre 2011 (annexe A), concernant l\u2019objet de la plainte et que les repr\u00e9sentations de la plaignante soumises le 11 octobre 2011 ne justifient pas les conclusions recherch\u00e9es.\nB. Analyse [54] La pertinence est une notion distincte de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 en preuve pour fins de l\u2019audition et ce principe est mentionn\u00e9 notamment dans la d\u00e9cision Association des employ\u00e9(e)s de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication du Manitoba Inc. c. Manitoba Telecom Services 2007 TCDP 28 au par 4 :\n\u00ab La production de documents est assujettie au crit\u00e8re de la pertinence potentielle, qui n\u2019est pas un crit\u00e8re tr\u00e8s exigeant. Il doit y avoir une certaine pertinence entre le document ou les renseignements demand\u00e9s et la question en litige. Il ne fait aucun doute qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de veiller \u00e0 ce que tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents soient disponibles dans le cadre d\u2019une affaire comme celle en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Une partie a le droit d\u2019obtenir les renseignements ou les documents qui sont pertinents quant \u00e0 l\u2019affaire ou qui pourraient l\u2019\u00eatre. Cela ne veut pas dire que ces documents ou renseignements seront admis en preuve ou qu\u2019on leur accordera une importance significative. \u00bb\n[55] En proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 l\u2019analyse de la pertinence, on doit \u00eatre en mesure de constater qu'un lien rationnel existe entre les documents demand\u00e9s et les questions contenues dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate; c'est-\u00e0-dire que l'on puisse pr\u00e9tendre la pertinence probable de l'information recherch\u00e9e voir Guay c. Gendarmerie Royale du Canada, 2004 TCDP 34, au para. 42.\n[56] La pertinence s\u2019appr\u00e9cie en lien avec la plainte et l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte n\u2019est pas en lui seul l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer pour analyser la pertinence et ne constitue pas l\u2019acte de proc\u00e9dure qui permet de d\u00e9terminer la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par l\u2019acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9.\n[57] La r\u00e8gle 6(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal dicte ce qui suit:\n\u00ab Chaque partie doit signifier et d\u00e9poser dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le membre instructeur un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions indiquant :\na) les faits pertinents que la partie cherche \u00e0 \u00e9tablir. \u00bb (Nos soulign\u00e9s).\n[58] Par ailleurs, ce sont les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions qui servent aux fins d\u2019une plaidoirie dans le cadre des proc\u00e9dures devant le Tribunal et \u201fqui \u00e9noncent les conditions plus pr\u00e9cises de l\u2019audience\u201d voir Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 1 au para. 10.\n[59] La pertinence sera donc analys\u00e9e avec l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la Plaignante ainsi que la plainte telle que d\u00e9finie pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment dans la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question de cette d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\n[60] Je vais proc\u00e9der maintenant \u00e0 l\u2019analyse de chacune des demandes de la Plaignante individuellement afin de d\u00e9terminer la pertinence des documents demand\u00e9s dans la requ\u00eate en divulgation:\n(a) Tout document, notes personnelles, notes de service. Notes prises lors de rencontres ou d\u2019appels, correspondance, courriels, pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par\/\u00e9chang\u00e9s entre C\u00e9line Marchand, Manon Boucher, Nicole Dugr\u00e9, Jocelyne Doyle-Rodrigue, Richard Berriault, Genevi\u00e8ve Durocher et tout autre employ\u00e9, se rapportant au renvoi de la plaignante du programme d\u2019apprentissage, \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 de son travail dans son programme, \u00e0 son rendement, aux probl\u00e8mes au niveau du personnel impliquant la plaignante, \u00e0 son placement dans un autre poste apr\u00e8s son renvoi, aux discussions sur son cong\u00e9diement, \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019un nouveau poste pour elle, et enfin, \u00e0 son retour au travail.\nTout document qui porte sur le renvoi de la Plaignante du programme d\u2019apprentissage, et qui se rapporte aux circonstances ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 son renvoi sont potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019instance en cause et reli\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019objet de la plainte. L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la Plaignante en fait mention notamment \u00e0 son paragraphe 1 qui mentionne ce qui suit : \u00ab (\u2026) qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accommod\u00e9e, qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e diff\u00e9remment, harcel\u00e9e aux mains de son employeur et injustement renvoy\u00e9e du programme d\u2019apprentissage menant \u00e0 son accr\u00e9ditation \u00e0 titre de traductrice (TR) au sein de la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. \u00bb\nLes documents qui portent sur la qualit\u00e9 de travail de la Plaignante, sur son rendement et les circonstances de son emploi sont potentiellement pertinents aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination, de harc\u00e8lement et de mauvaise foi de l\u2019employeur notamment les questionnements de l\u2019employeur sur la comp\u00e9tence de la Plaignante sont \u00e9galement potentiellement pertinents. L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la Plaignante en fait mention notamment aux paragraphes suivants sans les reproduire ici pour fins de concision : Par. 6, 7, 8, 9, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28, 35, 36. (Voir l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la Plaignante en annexe).\nLes documents sur la recherche d\u2019un nouveau poste pour la Plaignante ainsi que ceux de son retour au travail sont potentiellement pertinents notamment pour la question des mesures de redressement demand\u00e9s. L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la Plaignante en fait mention notamment aux paragraphes suivants sans les reproduire ici pour fins de concision: Par. 29, 30, 31, 32, 33. (Voir l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la Plaignante en annexe).\n(b) Toutes les notes, courriels et autres documents pr\u00e9par\u00e9s pour l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne men\u00e9e par l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice embauch\u00e9e par la mise en cause, suite \u00e0 la plainte de la plaignante, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 17 janvier 2005.\nJe ne trouve pas de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la Plaignante. Il m\u2019est donc difficile d\u2019en d\u00e9terminer la pertinence en lien avec l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Je demande donc \u00e0 la Plaignante de me soumettre des pr\u00e9cisions par le biais d\u2019arguments suppl\u00e9mentaires sur cette question avant que je puisse la trancher. Je donnerai l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre \u00e9galement. Un \u00e9ventuel privil\u00e8ge peut aussi s\u2019y rattacher; j\u2019en traiterai plus loin.\n(c) Toutes les notes, courriels et autres documents pr\u00e9par\u00e9s pour la proc\u00e9dure du grief du 6 juin 2004, la plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, ou tout autre processus qui portent sur ces m\u00eames faits.\nLes documents demand\u00e9s sont potentiellement pertinents parce que bien qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9s \u00e0 la m\u00eame \u00e9poque que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements de la plainte, ils touchent aux m\u00eames faits que la plainte et ces documents se rapportent aux m\u00eames circonstances factuelles. Il va s\u2019en dire qu\u2019un \u00e9ventuel privil\u00e8ge peut s\u2019y rattacher. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment que j\u2019en traiterai plus loin.\n(d) Une liste des journ\u00e9es de cong\u00e9 prises par la Plaignante entre janvier 2006 jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent.\nCette demande est pertinente pour permettre \u00e0 la Plaignante de calculer les dommages qu\u2019elle estime avoir subis notamment en ayant pris des cong\u00e9s pay\u00e9s et non pay\u00e9s en lien avec ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 et qu\u2019elle consid\u00e8re reli\u00e9s au traitement discriminatoire et harcelant dont elle fait mention dans sa plainte. La Plaignante en fait mention dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions aux paragraphes 31, 51(e) et (f).\nL\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions au paragraphe 31 se lit comme suit :\n\u00ab Depuis son retour au travail en 2006, la Plaignante continue de souffrir des \u00e9pisodes de d\u00e9pression et des s\u00e9quelles reli\u00e9es au traitement qu\u2019elle subit pendant son apprentissage. Elle a d\u00fb retarder son retour progressif au travail en 2006. \u00bb\nL\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions au paragraphe 51 (e) et (f) se lisent comme suit dans la section \u201fmesures de redressements recherch\u00e9s\u201d:\n\u00ab L\u2019indemnisation \u00e0 la Plaignante de la totalit\u00e9 des pertes salariales pass\u00e9es et futures, des pertes aux r\u00e9gimes d\u2019avantages sociaux (pass\u00e9es et futures) et des d\u00e9penses encourues par la Plaignante qui d\u00e9coulent des actes de l\u2019employeur (y compris les pertes salariales engendr\u00e9es par les p\u00e9riodes de cong\u00e9 de maladie et celles qui d\u00e9coulent de sa mutation en 2006); l\u2019indemnisation de la totalit\u00e9 des pertes encourues par la Plaignante \u00e0 son r\u00e9gime de cong\u00e9 de maladie. \u00bb\n(e) Tout autre document pertinent aux faits en litige, tels que d\u00e9crits dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la Plaignante.\nCette demande est large et est d\u00e9j\u00e0 trait\u00e9e dans les demandes de la Plaignante \u201fa \u00e0 d\u201d. L\u2019obligation continue de divulgation des documents pertinents qui est pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 6 (5) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du TCDP demeure, je ne vois donc pas la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de l\u2019ordonner.\nC. Conclusion [61] L\u2019Intim\u00e9 fournira une liste compl\u00e8te de divulgation des documents pertinents demand\u00e9s par la Plaignante soit les items de \u201fa \u00e0 d\u201d ci-haut mentionn\u00e9s et, cette derni\u00e8re sera en mesure d\u2019identifier les documents dont elle requiert une copie. Je tiens \u00e0 souligner que les directives \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans cette d\u00e9cision sont \u00e9mises sous r\u00e9serve du droit de l\u2019Intim\u00e9 d\u2019invoquer, au besoin, et avec motifs \u00e0 l\u2019appui, tout privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation applicable, tel que pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du TCDP.\n[62] J\u2019autorise l\u2019Intim\u00e9 \u00e0 amender son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions pour r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de la Plaignante contenus dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions sur les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus apr\u00e8s le 22 avril 2004. La Plaignante aura l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de soumettre une r\u00e9plique et ce, \u00e0 compter de la r\u00e9ception de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions amend\u00e9 de l\u2019Intim\u00e9.\n[63] Un appel conf\u00e9rence avec les parties et le Tribunal suivra cette d\u00e9cision afin de convenir de l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier pour la r\u00e9daction de la liste de divulgation ainsi que pour discuter des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions \u00e0 amender. La question de \u201cproduction\u201d proprement dite au sens de la r\u00e8gle 6(4), sera trait\u00e9e ult\u00e9rieurement, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la forte possibilit\u00e9 que la Plaignante soit d\u00e9j\u00e0 en possession de certains documents vis\u00e9s par sa demande de divulgation.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nJuge administrative\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 15 juin 2012\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1465\/1110\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Yanick Lindor v.

L\u2019ordonnance. 14\n[1] Le 23 septembre 2011, le Tribunal a rendu sa d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire Bronwyn Cruden c. Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement international et Sant\u00e9 Canada, 2011 TCDP 13 [Cruden].\n[2] Le 24 novembre 2011, l\u2019avocate de Mme Bronwyn Cruden (la plaignante) a demand\u00e9 des \u00e9claircissements au sujet de la mise en \u0153uvre de la mesure de redressement ordonn\u00e9e par le Tribunal au paragraphe 176 de la d\u00e9cision Cruden, \u00e0 savoir :\n[\u2026] [C]onform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la LCDP, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI de d\u00e9ployer la plaignante \u00e0 la DGPG au niveau PM\u201106 et de prendre avec elle les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour l\u2019affecter dans un pays ami, faisant partie de ses trois premiers choix o\u00f9 il y a des installations m\u00e9dicales appropri\u00e9es et o\u00f9 elle ne sera soumise \u00e0 aucune restriction m\u00e9dicale.\n(Cruden, paragraphe 176)\n[3] Dans le cas d\u2019une ordonnance rendue en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H-6 [la Loi], la personne reconnue coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire \u2013 en l\u2019occurrence l\u2019Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement international (l\u2019ACDI ou l\u2019intim\u00e9e) \u2013 est tenue d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la victime, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les chances dont l\u2019acte l\u2019a priv\u00e9e. La question qui requiert pr\u00e9sentement des \u00e9claircissements est le moment o\u00f9 l\u2019on doit appliquer l\u2019obligation de d\u00e9ployer la plaignante \u00e0 un pays ami, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire celui o\u00f9 il y a lieu d\u2019accorder \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les chances dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e.\n[4] Le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2011, le Tribunal a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas functus officio et qu\u2019il demeurait saisi de l\u2019affaire pour ce qui \u00e9tait de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019ordonnance en litige (Bronwyn Cruden c. Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement international et Sant\u00e9 Canada, 2011 TCDP 21). Il a toutefois demand\u00e9 aux parties de lui fournir des observations additionnelles afin de pouvoir trancher l\u2019affaire.\n[5] Apr\u00e8s avoir pris en consid\u00e9ration les observations additionnelles des parties, le Tribunal a eu besoin de plus amples explications sur les informations qu\u2019elles contenaient. Vu la nature technique et factuelle du litige opposant les parties, le Tribunal a convoqu\u00e9 une audience en vue d\u2019entendre les parties. Cette audience a eu lieu le 16 janvier 2012.\n[6] Le 1er mars 2012, dans une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate - 2012 TCDP 5 \u2013 le Tribunal a conclu que les chances d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la plaignante une affectation d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettaient \u00e9taient en 2013 et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de clarifier son ordonnance en vue d\u2019en faciliter l\u2019ex\u00e9cution et de veiller \u00e0 ce que la plaignante puisse b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la mesure de redressement ordonn\u00e9e. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 :\n1. que, dans les sept jours suivant le prononc\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, l'ACDI affecte Mme Cruden \u00e0 un poste de niveau PM\u201106 \u00e0 la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes g\u00e9ographiques;\n2. que l\u2019ACDI, dans les 15 jours suivant le prononc\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 Mme Cruden des affectations disponibles en 2013 dans des pays \u00e9trangers qui sont ou seront disponibles, \u00e0 des endroits o\u00f9 il y a des installations m\u00e9dicales appropri\u00e9es et o\u00f9 elle ne sera soumise \u00e0 aucune restriction m\u00e9dicale;\n3. que l\u2019ACDI, dans les 21 jours suivant la date o\u00f9 Mme Cruden lui fait part, par \u00e9crit, de ces trois principaux choix d\u2019affectation parmi ceux que l\u2019ACDI lui aura pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s (qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de trois choix relatifs \u00e0 une affectation dans des pays diff\u00e9rents ou dans un m\u00eame pays, ou de deux choix dans un m\u00eame pays et d\u2019un choix dans un autre), \u00e9tablisse en consultation avec Mme Cruden un plan d\u2019apprentissage personnalis\u00e9 qui indiquera la formation que cette derni\u00e8re devra suivre ou l\u2019exp\u00e9rience qu\u2019elle devra acqu\u00e9rir en vue d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter avec succ\u00e8s l\u2019une des affectations sur le terrain qui sera retenue pour 2013;\n4. le plan d\u2019apprentissage personnalis\u00e9 devra pr\u00e9ciser de quelle fa\u00e7on l\u2019ACDI permettra \u00e0 Mme Cruden de suivre la formation ou d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir l\u2019exp\u00e9rience qui sera n\u00e9cessaire, et ce plan devra \u00e9galement inclure un calendrier, assorti de dates pr\u00e9cises, quant au moment o\u00f9 Mme Cruden pourra suivre cette formation ou acqu\u00e9rir cette exp\u00e9rience avant la date d\u2019affectation;\n5. une fois que Mme Cruden aura suivi la formation ou acquis l\u2019exp\u00e9rience qui sera indiqu\u00e9e dans le plan d\u2019apprentissage, que l\u2019ACDI accorde \u00e0 Mme Cruden l\u2019affectation sur le terrain pour laquelle le plan d\u2019apprentissage aura \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli.\n[7] Le Tribunal a continu\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre saisi de l\u2019affaire afin d\u2019\u00eatre disponible au cas o\u00f9 d\u2019autres \u00e9claircissements seraient n\u00e9cessaires, et ce, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que les parties confirment que les modalit\u00e9s de son ordonnance avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en \u0153uvre.\n[8] Le Tribunal a re\u00e7u de l\u2019intim\u00e9e une lettre dat\u00e9e du 25 avril 2012 en vue de faire modifier le passage suivant de l\u2019ordonnance :\n[Q]ue l\u2019ACDI, dans les 15 jours suivant le prononc\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 Mme Cruden des affectations disponibles en 2013 dans des pays \u00e9trangers qui sont ou seront disponibles, \u00e0 des endroits o\u00f9 il y a des installations m\u00e9dicales appropri\u00e9es et o\u00f9 elle ne sera soumise \u00e0 aucune restriction m\u00e9dicale.\n[9] Le Tribunal a re\u00e7u de toutes les parties des observations sur leurs positions concernant la modification propos\u00e9e. La r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 1er juin 2012.\n[10] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de la modification qu\u2019elle propose, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir :\n[traduction]\nNous proposons que le libell\u00e9 de la partie 2 soit modifi\u00e9 afin de tenir compte du fait que l\u2019ACDI ne sera pas en mesure d\u2019offrir \u00e0 Mme Cruden avant octobre 2012 une affectation disponible en 2013. Cela est d\u00fb au fait que le processus relatif \u00e0 2012 est en cours et qu\u2019il faudra attendre qu\u2019il soit termin\u00e9 avant de pouvoir d\u00e9terminer les postes disponibles en 2013. L\u2019ACDI pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019elle saura en octobre 2012 quels postes seront disponibles pour le cycle d\u2019affectation de 2013, et elle est dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 s\u2019engager \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Mme Cruden les postes possibles d\u00e8s que les informations \u00e0 ce sujet seront disponibles.\nIl va sans dire que si ces informations deviennent disponibles avant octobre 2012, l\u2019ACDI pr\u00e9sentera plus t\u00f4t les affectations en question \u00e0 Mme Cruden.\n[11] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la partie 1 de l\u2019ordonnance du 1er mars, Mme Cruden occupe pr\u00e9sentement un poste de niveau PM\u201106 au sein de la DGPG \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la partie 4 de cette m\u00eame ordonnance, Mme Cruden et l\u2019ACDI ont \u00e9tabli ensemble un plan d\u2019apprentissage personnalis\u00e9. Quant \u00e0 la partie 5, l\u2019ACDI l\u2019honorera une fois que la formation que Mme Cruden aura suivie sera termin\u00e9e.\n[12] Pour ce qui est des affectations sur le terrain, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que ces derni\u00e8res sont habituellement d\u2019une dur\u00e9e de deux ans, assortie d\u2019une option de prolongation d\u2019un an. Le suivi que l\u2019on fait aupr\u00e8s des employ\u00e9s pr\u00e9sents sur place, en vue de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019ils souhaitent se pr\u00e9valoir de l\u2019option de prolongation (ou non) et d\u2019obtenir l\u2019accord de la direction \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, a lieu au cours de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9. S\u2019il est convenu qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 prolongera son affectation, il va donc de soi que le poste n\u2019est pas inclus dans l\u2019offre des affectations sur le terrain. Si un employ\u00e9 d\u00e9cide de ne pas prolonger la dur\u00e9e de son affectation ou si la direction ne souscrit pas \u00e0 cette mesure, son poste est alors ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00ab exercice d\u2019affectations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger \u00bb (EAE) qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 cette ann\u00e9e additionnelle l\u00e0. Habituellement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e le sait au cours des mois de septembre ou d\u2019octobre, avant le lancement de l\u2019EAE proprement dit en octobre.\n[13] L\u2019intim\u00e9e offre des garanties telles que les suivantes :\n[traduction]\n1) les options disponibles seront offertes \u00e0 Mme Cruden d\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re occasion et, en tout \u00e9tat de cause, avant le lancement des processus officiels d\u2019affectation;\n2) le fait de modifier ainsi le calendrier n\u2019aura pas d\u2019incidence sur le plan d\u2019apprentissage de Mme Cruden, lequel est con\u00e7u pour procurer \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re les comp\u00e9tences dont elle aura besoin, peu importe les choix de pays qui deviendront disponibles;\n3) Mme Cruden aura le temps d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir des comp\u00e9tences propres aux pays en question au cours de la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9tendant entre les mois de septembre\u2011octobre 2012 et l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2013, car le plan de formation que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9tabli avec la plaignante vise \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir les comp\u00e9tences ainsi que l\u2019exp\u00e9rience et les connaissances que requi\u00e8rent l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019activit\u00e9s de d\u00e9veloppement sur le terrain en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et non dans un pays en particulier\nI. La position de la Commission [14] La Commission reconna\u00eet que le Tribunal est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 modifier le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. \u00c0 son avis, cette mesure pourrait \u00eatre prise dans le cadre de la comp\u00e9tence qu\u2019elle a conserv\u00e9e dans le but de superviser la mise en \u0153uvre des mesures de redressement, ou pour faire preuve d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale envers l\u2019ACDI qui, \u00e0 ma connaissance, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant que l\u2019obligation de faire part des affectations disponibles \u00e9tait assortie d\u2019un d\u00e9lai de 15 jours.\n[15] En ce qui concerne le fond de la demande de l\u2019ACDI, la Commission convient avec cette derni\u00e8re que Mme Cruden doit \u00eatre inform\u00e9e des possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019affectation en 2013 d\u00e8s que les informations y aff\u00e9rentes sont disponibles. La Commission fait \u00e9galement remarquer que, selon l\u2019ACDI, il est impossible de se conformer au d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, ni de faire part des affectations disponibles avant les mois de septembre ou d\u2019octobre 2012.\n[16] La Commission fait \u00e9galement remarquer que, selon l\u2019ACDI, il est impossible de se conformer au d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, ni de faire part des affectations disponibles avant les mois de septembre ou d\u2019octobre 2012.\n[17] Dans les circonstances, et en se fondant sur les garanties de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, lesquelles sont d\u00e9crites ci-dessus, la Commission accepte la demande de l\u2019ACDI concernant la modification de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\nII. La position (reproduite dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9) de la plaignante [18] Mme Cruden s\u2019inqui\u00e8te du fait que, si le Tribunal acc\u00e8de \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019ACDI sans mettre en place un certain nombre de garanties, cela aura sur elle un effet n\u00e9gatif.\nA. Le plan d\u2019apprentissage [19] Le plan d\u2019apprentissage de Mme Cruden est un aspect crucial de la pr\u00e9paration \u00e0 une affectation et, pour illustrer ce qui inqui\u00e8te Mme Cruden, il est important de comprendre de quelle fa\u00e7on ce plan a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli, de m\u00eame que sa mise en \u0153uvre et l\u2019effet du nouveau d\u00e9lai que propose l\u2019ACDI sur le choix d\u2019une affectation. Une copie du plan d\u2019apprentissage est jointe ci\u2011apr\u00e8s.\nB. L\u2019\u00e9tablissement du plan d\u2019apprentissage [20] Quand Mme Cruden est revenue au travail en f\u00e9vrier 2012, elle a eu pour t\u00e2che de mettre au point son plan d\u2019apprentissage.\n[21] Mme Cruden ne savait pas exactement par o\u00f9 commencer. Elle a rempli la premi\u00e8re colonne du plan \u2013 les objectifs d\u2019apprentissage \u2013 en indiquant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019exp\u00e9rience qui lui faisaient d\u00e9faut par rapport \u00e0 ce que l\u2019ACDI avait mentionn\u00e9 dans l\u2019exercice d\u2019affectations en Asie de 2012.\n[22] Ce plan d\u2019apprentissage a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli principalement en fonction des exigences op\u00e9rationnelles d\u2019une affectation en Asie. Le plan de Mme Cruden devrait englober les exigences op\u00e9rationnelles d\u2019autres affectations, mais elles ne refl\u00e8tent pas n\u00e9cessairement celles qui concernent les affectations faites ailleurs qu\u2019en Asie. Par exemple, dans les pays de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Sud la langue de travail est l\u2019espagnol, une langue que Mme Cruden ne parle pas, et cela ne figure pas \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle dans son plan d\u2019apprentissage.\n[23] De plus, les activit\u00e9s choisies sous la rubrique [traduction] \u00ab Exp\u00e9rience de la formulation et de la prestation de conseils et de recommandations strat\u00e9giques aux gestionnaires sup\u00e9rieurs \u00bb, \u00e0 la rang\u00e9e 5, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9es \u00e0 la suite de discussions avec la directrice de Mme Cruden. Cette directrice a pens\u00e9 que Mme Cruden devait profiter de l\u2019occasion d\u2019apprentissage pour suivre le Programme international de formation en \u00e9valuation du d\u00e9veloppement (PIFED) et elle lui a demand\u00e9 d\u2019inclure cette activit\u00e9 dans son plan d\u2019apprentissage.\n[24] La directrice de Mme Cruden a reconnu que cet objectif d\u2019apprentissage prendrait appui sur la vaste exp\u00e9rience de cette derni\u00e8re en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9laboration de m\u00e9moires au Cabinet et de cadres de gestion et de responsabilisation ax\u00e9s sur les risques et les r\u00e9sultats approuv\u00e9s par le Secr\u00e9tariat du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, notamment, et elle a laiss\u00e9 entendre que cet objectif d\u2019apprentissage lui donnerait l\u2019occasion d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir formation et exp\u00e9rience dans le domaine de l\u2019\u00e9valuation. Cet objectif d\u2019apprentissage est con\u00e7u pour permettre de comprendre en d\u00e9tail le travail d\u2019\u00e9valuation, ce qui renforcera la capacit\u00e9 de Mme Cruden \u00e0 g\u00e9rer des programmes.\n[25] Enfin, il est important de signaler que, \u00e0 la colonne 4 du plan d\u2019apprentissage, la mention \u00ab op \u00bb indique les objectifs qui d\u00e9coulent des affectations en Asie, tandis que la mention \u00ab perf \u00bb indique les objectifs qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9s par la directrice de Mme Cruden afin d\u2019aider cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 se perfectionner. Par exemple, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 recommand\u00e9 par l\u2019adjoint du directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral r\u00e9gional de l\u2019Asie que Mme Cruden suive le cours de [traduction] \u00ab Pr\u00e9paration de pr\u00e9sentations au Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor \u00bb (rang\u00e9e 6), car cela pourrait se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler utile plus tard pour aider la Direction de l\u2019Asie \u00e0 atteindre ses objectifs.\nC. La mise en \u0153uvre du plan d\u2019apprentissage [26] Il ressort d\u2019un examen du plan d\u2019apprentissage de Mme Cruden qu\u2019il reste encore \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer un grand nombre des comp\u00e9tences cl\u00e9s. Voici une explication plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de l\u2019effet qu\u2019aurait la non-d\u00e9termination de ces comp\u00e9tences cl\u00e9s sur la capacit\u00e9 de r\u00e9ussite de Mme Cruden :\nRang\u00e9es 1 et 2 \u2013 Exp\u00e9rience de la communication avec les intervenants locaux, nationaux ou internationaux\/collaboration avec les repr\u00e9sentants gouvernementaux ou les OI (deux objectifs d\u2019apprentissage distincts).\nRang\u00e9e 3 \u2013 Ces objectifs ne seront atteints que si Mme Cruden est affect\u00e9e \u00e0 un projet actif. Les trois premiers o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e sont deux projets en voie de cl\u00f4ture, ne comportant pas de communication avec les intervenants, de m\u00eame que le [traduction] M\u00e9canisme d\u2019appui au programme, qui est un projet que Mme Cruden a g\u00e9r\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement.\n[27] Selon ce que l\u2019ACDI a \u00e9valu\u00e9, l\u2019exp\u00e9rience que Mme Cruden a acquise sur le terrain ant\u00e9rieurement (les sept semaines pass\u00e9es \u00e0 Kaboul et \u00e0 Kandahar en 2007 et en 2008) n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisante pour une affectation en 2012. On pr\u00e9voyait lui donner l\u2019occasion d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir les connaissances et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience sur le terrain qui \u00e9taient requises pendant le temps o\u00f9 elle travaillerait \u00e0 l\u2019Administration centrale avant d\u2019obtenir une affectation en 2013. \u00c0 ce stade-ci, aucun d\u00e9lai n\u2019est pr\u00e9vu pour l\u2019obtention des deux autres semaines d\u2019exp\u00e9rience sur le terrain qui sont jug\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires pour acqu\u00e9rir l\u2019exp\u00e9rience sur le terrain requise.\nRang\u00e9e 4 \u2013 Cette rang\u00e9e contient toute l\u2019exp\u00e9rience qui est requise pour la gestion de projets. Les deux premiers projets affect\u00e9s \u00e0 Mme Cruden \u00e9taient tous deux en voie de cl\u00f4ture et le troisi\u00e8me est celui qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 g\u00e9r\u00e9 dans le cadre du programme de l\u2019Afghanistan. Cela \u00e9tant, il reste encore \u00e0 planifier ou \u00e0 mettre en \u0153uvre l\u2019exp\u00e9rience que l\u2019ACDI juge essentielle \u00e0 la r\u00e9ussite d\u2019une affectation.\n[28] Par ailleurs, l\u2019ACDI n\u2019a pas encore assign\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Cruden un mentor comp\u00e9tent qui la guidera dans son perfectionnement. On lui a plut\u00f4t dit de soumettre ses questions \u00e0 la chef des op\u00e9rations pour l\u2019Indon\u00e9sie qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la plaignante, n\u2019a que quelques ann\u00e9es d\u2019exp\u00e9rience sur le plan op\u00e9rationnel. Mme Cruden n\u2019a rien contre le fait que ce soit la chef des op\u00e9rations qui l\u2019assiste, mais celle-ci lui a dit que, jusqu\u2019ici, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9e d\u2019obtenir d\u2019autres personnes les r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 la totalit\u00e9 des questions qu\u2019elle lui a pos\u00e9es, ce qui signifie que les questions de Mme Cruden restent parfois sans r\u00e9ponse.\n[29] De ce fait, Mme Cruden passe un temps consid\u00e9rable \u00e0 essayer de deviner ce qu\u2019elle doit savoir et il lui faut suivre ensuite un parcours assez d\u00e9tourn\u00e9 pour obtenir des r\u00e9ponses. L\u2019assignation d\u2019un mentor comp\u00e9tent, ayant une vaste exp\u00e9rience de la gestion des programmes et capable de la guider activement dans le cadre du processus de gestion de programmes, est une exigence qui est cruciale si l\u2019on veut que Mme Cruden atteigne les objectifs figurant dans son plan d\u2019apprentissage. Par exemple, Lawrence Peck, du programme de l\u2019Afghanistan, serait le candidat id\u00e9al vu sa vaste exp\u00e9rience de la gestion de programmes au sein de l\u2019ACDI.\nRang\u00e9e 5 \u2013 Le fait d\u2019observer comment se fait l\u2019\u00e9valuation des programmes n\u2019est pas une exp\u00e9rience qui rel\u00e8ve de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes g\u00e9ographiques, mais de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des politiques. Il ne faut pas seulement du temps pour mener des n\u00e9gociations entre les directions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales; il faut aussi que la participation de Mme Cruden soit incluse dans le cadre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence d\u2019un \u00e9ventuel march\u00e9 conclu avec l\u2019\u00e9valuateur. L\u2019\u00e9valuation est pr\u00e9vue pour le mois de septembre mais, \u00e0 ce jour, il n\u2019y a eu aucune discussion entre les directions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sur cet objectif.\nD. L\u2019effet du calendrier sur le choix d\u2019affectations [30] La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate initiale veillait \u00e0 ce que Mme Cruden ne soit pas oblig\u00e9e de concourir avec d\u2019autres personnes en vue d\u2019obtenir une \u00e9ventuelle affectation. Si vous r\u00e9visez la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate comme l\u2019ACDI le voudrait, Mme Cruden pr\u00e9sentera \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI sa liste d\u2019affectations pendant que d\u2019autres participent \u00e0 un concours pour les affectations de leur choix. Cela \u00e9tant, l\u2019ACDI sera en mesure de choisir quelle affectation offrir \u00e0 Mme Cruden apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9valu\u00e9 quelles sont les personnes qui participent \u00e0 un concours pour les m\u00eames affectations. Par ailleurs, il sera injuste pour tous les membres du personnel de pr\u00e9senter leur candidature \u00e0 une affectation pour laquelle il n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas possible d\u2019organiser un concours.\n[31] De plus, le plan d\u2019apprentissage existant est cens\u00e9 \u00eatre termin\u00e9 d\u2019ici avril 2013. Si la prolongation est accord\u00e9e, Mme Cruden se verra pr\u00e9senter une liste d\u2019affectations \u00e0 un moment o\u00f9 seuls six mois de son plan d\u2019apprentissage auront \u00e9t\u00e9 faits, et certaines des exp\u00e9riences cl\u00e9s mentionn\u00e9es dans le plan n\u2019auront pas \u00e9t\u00e9 acquises.\n[32] De plus, si l\u2019affectation de Mme Cruden a lieu dans un pays autre que ceux vis\u00e9s par le programme de l\u2019Asie, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les options sont limit\u00e9es \u00e0 cause des restrictions budg\u00e9taires, cela ne lui laissera qu\u2019une p\u00e9riode de six \u00e0 neuf mois pour suivre une formation linguistique.\n[33] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, Mme Cruden propose que la demande de prolongation de l\u2019ACDI soit r\u00e9vis\u00e9e ainsi :\n1. l\u2019ACDI pr\u00e9sentera \u00e0 Mme Cruden la liste des affectations disponibles en 2013, deux semaines avant que celles-ci soient annonc\u00e9es aux employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ACDI;\n2. Mme Cruden fera part \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI des trois affectations qu\u2019elle aura choisies dans la semaine suivant la r\u00e9ception de la liste indiqu\u00e9e au point no 1. L\u2019ACDI choisira l\u2019affectation finale. Apr\u00e8s avoir communiqu\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision \u00e0 Mme Cruden, l\u2019ACDI fera ensuite conna\u00eetre la liste des pays \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s, comme cela se fait normalement.\n3. L\u2019ach\u00e8vement du plan d\u2019apprentissage ne devrait pas \u00eatre un facteur \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration au moment de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019affectation en 2013.\n4. Si Mme Cruden n\u2019est pas en mesure de faire part \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI des trois postes prescrits dans l\u2019ordonnance, elle en indiquera un ou deux, \u00e9tant entendu que cela permettra \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI, si elle d\u00e9cide de ne pas accorder \u00e0 Mme Cruden l\u2019un des pays indiqu\u00e9s, de reporter l\u2019affectation \u00e0 2014. Cette mesure tiendra compte du fait qu\u2019en 2013 il y aura vraisemblablement moins de postes qu\u2019au cours des ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes \u00e0 cause des r\u00e9ductions budg\u00e9taires et, partant, vraisemblablement moins de postes appropri\u00e9s que Mme Cruden pourra demander d\u2019obtenir dans un pays o\u00f9 elle pourrait amener sa famille.\nVoici quelques exemples des r\u00e9percussions que le budget a eues sur le nombre des affectations :\n\u2022 cette ann\u00e9e, les affectations au Mozambique, au Rwanda et en Afrique du Sud ont \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9es (un fait que confirme le proc\u00e8s-verbal d\u2019une r\u00e9union du personnel ci\u2011joint);\n\u2022 l\u2019ACDI a mis fin \u00e0 des programmes dans huit pays (trois en Asie et cinq en Afrique, voir l\u2019article de presse ci-joint).\n[34] Les postes en Asie pour lesquels Mme Cruden pourra pr\u00e9senter sa candidature seront nettement r\u00e9duits en 2013. Trois pays de moins sont disponibles et, de plus, elle n\u2019est pas en mesure d\u2019accepter un poste au Bangladesh, car c\u2019est sa s\u0153ur qui est la chef de mission. Cela voudrait dire que Mme Cruden ne pourrait pas remplacer sa superviseure, la chef d\u2019aide, en cas d\u2019absence, car dans un tel cas elle rel\u00e8verait directement de sa s\u0153ur.\n[35] De plus, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que deux postes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pourvus au Vietnam en 2012, le seul pour lequel elle pourrait pr\u00e9senter sa candidature dans ce pays en 2013 serait vraisemblablement un poste de niveau EX-1. Le seul moyen possible, car un poste de niveau EX-1 n\u2019est pas envisag\u00e9 dans l\u2019ordonnance, serait que Mme Cruden satisfasse concr\u00e8tement aux comp\u00e9tences exig\u00e9es, ou bien que la personne de niveau PM-06 qui sera affect\u00e9e en 2012 au Vietnam, et qui exerce \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire les fonctions de niveau EX-1 depuis un certain nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es, envisage d\u2019exercer les fonctions de EX-1, ce qui permettrait \u00e0 Mme Cruden d\u2019assumer les fonctions de niveau PM\u201106.\n[36] Le Vietnam \u00e9tait le deuxi\u00e8me choix d\u2019affectation de Mme Cruden apr\u00e8s l\u2019Afghanistan. De ce fait, s\u2019il lui est impossible de trouver un poste appropri\u00e9 dans une autre r\u00e9gion, Mme Cruden pr\u00e9f\u00e9rerait que l\u2019ACDI reporte son affectation \u00e0 2014 plut\u00f4t que d\u2019offrir un pays figurant dans la liste des trois o\u00f9 elle ne se sentirait pas \u00e0 l\u2019aise de vivre durant trois ans. La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate actuellement en vigueur ne pr\u00e9voit pas d\u2019autres options si Mme Cruden n\u2019est pas en mesure de faire part de trois postes.\nIII. La r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e aux observations de la plaignante [37] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9 que la plaignante serait inform\u00e9e des postes disponibles avant le lancement du processus d\u2019affectation officiel. Elle s\u2019attend \u00e0 faire part de ces informations en octobre 2012, soit, en th\u00e9orie, plus de deux semaines avant le lancement du processus officiel.\n[38] Les pr\u00e9occupations de la plaignante ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qui demeure disponible pour en discuter et les r\u00e9gler.\n[39] L\u2019intim\u00e9e r\u00e9it\u00e8re que la modification demand\u00e9e ne touchera pas le plan d\u2019apprentissage de la plaignante.\n[40] Enfin, l\u2019intim\u00e9e r\u00e9pond \u00e0 la demande que fait la plaignante d\u2019\u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 reporter son affectation jusqu\u2019en 2014 si elle est insatisfaite du choix d\u2019affectations disponibles. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que cette demande contredit l\u2019intention de l\u2019ordonnance qui est reconnue dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate dat\u00e9e du 1er mars 2012, laquelle intention \u00e9tait d\u2019offrir \u00e0 la plaignante, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettaient, les chances dont elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient de plus que l\u2019ordonnance initiale pr\u00e9voyait express\u00e9ment qu\u2019elle conserverait une certaine latitude quant au pays auquel la plaignante serait affect\u00e9e. Selon elle, cette derni\u00e8re demande de la plaignante est inappropri\u00e9e, car elle implique une modification importante et pr\u00e9judiciable de l\u2019ordonnance et elle prolonge l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses dispositions. Elle demande au Tribunal de ne pas prendre en consid\u00e9ration cette derni\u00e8re demande ou, \u00e0 tout le moins, pas dans le contexte de sa demande de modification.\n[41] L\u2019intim\u00e9e laisse entendre que la plaignante, si elle est insatisfaite des chances qui lui seront offertes, pourrait toujours pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, et le Tribunal ne rendrait pas sa d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate en l\u2019absence d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\nIV. Analyse [42] Dans Cruden, et dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate qu\u2019il a rendue le 1er mars 2012 dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le Tribunal a dit qu\u2019il conserverait sa comp\u00e9tence en vue de superviser la mise en \u0153uvre des mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cette comp\u00e9tence, l\u2019intim\u00e9e demande que le Tribunal modifie le calendrier d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019ordonnance d\u00e9crite dans sa d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate du 1er mars 2012. La Commission consent \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et la plaignante, au cas o\u00f9 le calendrier d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019ordonnance serait prolong\u00e9, demande que l\u2019on fixe des garanties appropri\u00e9es afin de s\u2019assurer que l\u2019ordonnance soit ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e. Je souscris \u00e0 l\u2019argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon lequel les affectations de 2013 ne peuvent pas \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9es avant la fin du processus relatif \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2012 et qu\u2019elle ne disposera de ces informations qu\u2019en octobre 2012 ou aux alentours de cette date. Par cons\u00e9quent, la d\u00e9cision du 1er mars 2012 du Tribunal sera modifi\u00e9e en cons\u00e9quence, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions qui suivent.\n[43] Cela dit, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la plaignante a fait \u00e9tat de ses pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 propos de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement et de la mise en \u0153uvre du plan d\u2019apprentissage. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il est instructif de comprendre, d\u2019une part, pourquoi il a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de clarifier l\u2019ordonnance Cruden et, d\u2019autre part, les motifs qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate dat\u00e9e du 1er mars 2012 au sujet de la question d\u2019accorder une affectation \u00e0 la plaignante d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettaient. Une partie de ces motifs est reproduite ci-dessous :\n[14] Cependant, hormis cette d\u00e9claration, rien n\u2019indique qu\u2019un plan d\u2019apprentissage d\u00e9fini a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli. Rien n\u2019indique que l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est efforc\u00e9e avec la plaignante de trouver des affectations satisfaisantes, quelle formation ou quelle exp\u00e9rience additionnelles sont n\u00e9cessaires pour que cette derni\u00e8re ait du succ\u00e8s dans une affectation, comment l\u2019intim\u00e9e propose que la plaignante acqui\u00e8re la formation ou l\u2019exp\u00e9rience requise pour avoir du succ\u00e8s dans une affectation et \u00e0 quel moment se pr\u00e9sentera, en cons\u00e9quence, la chance de l\u2019affecter \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettront.\n[15] M\u00eame si la plaignante a fait part \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI des choix d\u2019affectation qu\u2019elle privil\u00e9giait au d\u00e9but du processus d\u2019affectation, un plan d\u2019apprentissage d\u00e9fini n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli \u00e0 ce stade-l\u00e0. Au moment o\u00f9 le Tribunal a tenu son audience dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, soit le 16 janvier 2012, un tel plan n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 non plus \u00e9tabli. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le t\u00e9moin de l\u2019ACDI a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de mentionner des mesures concr\u00e8tes que l\u2019ACDI avait prises pour voir comment cette derni\u00e8re ex\u00e9cuterait l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal parce qu\u2019elle ne participait pas \u00e0 ce processus. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 son avocate pour l\u2019inviter \u00e0 communiquer avec elle \u00e0 propos de la fa\u00e7on d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter l\u2019ordonnance et que la plaignante n\u2019y avait pas r\u00e9pondu. Elle soutient que les communications ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rompues entre les parties quand la plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande d\u2019\u00e9claircissements au Tribunal en novembre 2011. Je conclus que cette explication n\u2019est pas cr\u00e9dible. Au d\u00e9but du mois de novembre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante que l\u2019ACDI n\u2019allait pas l\u2019affecter en 2012, mais qu\u2019elle pouvait quand m\u00eame pr\u00e9senter sa candidature pour le processus d\u2019affectation. La plaignante a ensuite pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour deux affectations au Vietnam, et sa candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e dans les deux cas. Une fois que la plaignante avait fait part de ses choix d\u2019affectation, l\u2019ACDI aurait pu, \u00e0 n\u2019importe quel moment, planifier une r\u00e9union avec elle pour commencer \u00e0 discuter de la fa\u00e7on d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal. La plaignante \u00e9tait disponible pour ces discussions.\n[16] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la Loi, il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la plaignante les chances dont l\u2019acte discriminatoire l\u2019a priv\u00e9e. Pour d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 quel moment il convient d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la plaignante cette chance, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit tout d\u2019abord examiner de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9rieuse de quelle fa\u00e7on elle ex\u00e9cutera l\u2019ordonnance. L\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal \u00e9tait con\u00e7ue comme une directive visant \u00e0 permettre aux parties de r\u00e9gler entre elles les d\u00e9tails relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019ordonnance, mais il est possible qu\u2019\u00e0 cause de cela la plaignante ait perdu la chance d\u2019\u00eatre affect\u00e9e aux postes disponibles au Vietnam. Le Tribunal conclut donc qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de clarifier son ordonnance afin d\u2019en faciliter l\u2019ex\u00e9cution et de veiller \u00e0 ce que la plaignante puisse b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la mesure de redressement qu\u2019il a ordonn\u00e9e.\n(Cruden, aux paragraphes 14 \u00e0 16)\n[44] Au vu de ces motifs, j\u2019ai ajout\u00e9 quelques exigences \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance afin d\u2019aider les parties \u00e0 prendre des mesures pour contribuer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement et \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre d\u2019un plan d\u2019apprentissage efficace et pour veiller \u00e0 ce que la plaignante soit form\u00e9e \u00e0 temps pour une affectation en 2013. Apr\u00e8s avoir pris en consid\u00e9ration les observations les plus r\u00e9centes des parties, il me semble y avoir encore des probl\u00e8mes entre ces derni\u00e8res sur le plan de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement et de la mise en \u0153uvre du plan d\u2019apprentissage. L\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9clare qu\u2019elle a travaill\u00e9 avec la plaignante en vue de mettre au point un plan d\u2019apprentissage et qu\u2019elle continuera de le faire pour r\u00e9gler ses pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ce plan, mais la plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame pour ce qui est de la conception de ce plan d\u2019apprentissage. L\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9clare que le fait de modifier le calendrier en vue d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter l\u2019ordonnance n\u2019aura pas d\u2019incidence sur le plan d\u2019apprentissage de Mme Cruden et que cette derni\u00e8re aura du temps pour acqu\u00e9rir des comp\u00e9tences propres \u00e0 un pays en particulier au cours de la p\u00e9riode qui s\u2019\u00e9tendra entre les mois de septembre ou d\u2019octobre 2012 et l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 de 2013. L\u2019ordonnance qui suit r\u00e9pond \u00e0 ces probl\u00e8mes, mais je crois qu\u2019il serait avantageux que l\u2019on tienne une autre conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique \u00e0 la suite du prononc\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate afin que les parties comprennent quelles sont leurs obligations aux termes de l\u2019ordonnance et qu\u2019elles fournissent les autres \u00e9claircissements qui peuvent \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaires. Cette autre conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique permettra \u00e9galement de discuter des probl\u00e8mes que les parties ont soulev\u00e9s \u00e0 propos de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019ordonnance au-del\u00e0 du cycle d\u2019affectations de 2013.\nV. L\u2019ordonnance [45] Conform\u00e9ment aux motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, le Tribunal ordonne :\n1. que, au moins deux semaines avant d\u2019annoncer les affectations disponibles en 2013 aux autres employ\u00e9s, l\u2019ACDI fournisse \u00e0 Mme Cruden une liste des affectations dans un pays \u00e9tranger en 2013 qui sont ou seront disponibles et o\u00f9 il y a des installations m\u00e9dicales appropri\u00e9es et o\u00f9 elle ne sera soumise \u00e0 aucune restriction m\u00e9dicale;\n2. que, dans la semaine suivant la r\u00e9ception de la liste mentionn\u00e9e au point no 1 ci\u2011dessus, Mme Cruden fasse part \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI de ses trois principaux choix parmi les affectations que l\u2019ACDI aura indiqu\u00e9es;\n3. que, parmi les trois choix que Mme Cruden aura indiqu\u00e9s, l\u2019ACDI choisisse l\u2019affectation finale et en fasse part \u00e0 Mme Cruden avant d\u2019annoncer les affectations disponibles aux autres employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ACDI;\n4. que, apr\u00e8s avoir choisi le lieu o\u00f9 Mme Cruden sera affect\u00e9e en 2013, l\u2019ACDI mette au point, en consultation avec Mme Cruden, un plan d\u2019apprentissage personnalis\u00e9 d\u00e9crivant toutes les activit\u00e9s de formation que celle-ci devra suivre et toute l\u2019exp\u00e9rience qu\u2019elle devra acqu\u00e9rir afin pouvoir ex\u00e9cuter avec succ\u00e8s l\u2019affectation disponible en 2013;\n5. que le plan d\u2019apprentissage personnalis\u00e9 pr\u00e9cise de quelle mani\u00e8re l\u2019ACDI offrira \u00e0 Mme Cruden la formation qu\u2019elle devra suivre ou l\u2019exp\u00e9rience qu\u2019elle devra acqu\u00e9rir et qu\u2019il comprenne \u00e9galement un calendrier, assorti de dates pr\u00e9cises, quant au moment o\u00f9 cette formation ou cette exp\u00e9rience lui seront offertes avant la date d\u2019affectation en 2013;\n6. que, lorsque Mme Cruden aura suivi la formation ou acquis l\u2019exp\u00e9rience qui est requise et indiqu\u00e9e par le plan d\u2019apprentissage, l\u2019ACDI accorde \u00e0 Mme Cruden l\u2019affectation sur le terrain disponible en 2013 pour laquelle le plan d\u2019apprentissage a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli.\n[46] Le Tribunal continuera d\u2019\u00eatre saisi de l\u2019affaire afin d\u2019\u00eatre disponible au cas o\u00f9 d\u2019autres \u00e9claircissements s\u2019av\u00e9reraient n\u00e9cessaires, et ce, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que les parties confirment que les modalit\u00e9s de son ordonnance ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en \u0153uvre.\n[47] Le Tribunal demande aux parties d\u2019indiquer au greffe d\u2019ici le 7 ao\u00fbt 2012 les moments o\u00f9 elles seront disponibles pour prendre part \u00e0 une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, qui aura lieu durant les semaines du 13 ou du 20 ao\u00fbt 2012.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nJuge administrative\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 6 juillet 2012\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal: T1466\/1210\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause: Bronwyn Cruden c.

Le contexte [2] La pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans le contexte d\u2019une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H-6 (la Loi), par l\u2019APN et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada (SSEFPN). Les plaignantes all\u00e8guent que le minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien (l\u2019intim\u00e9), aujourd\u2019hui appel\u00e9 le minist\u00e8re des Affaires autochtones et du D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada, verse, au titre des services d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019enfance, des niveaux in\u00e9quitables de fonds pour les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui vivent dans les r\u00e9serves. Selon les plaignantes, cela \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique.\n[3] Le 14 mars 2011, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9, le Tribunal avait rejet\u00e9 la plainte (voir Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada et al. c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, 2011 TCDP 4 [SSEFPN et al.]).\n[4] Par la suite, trois demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire concernant la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate que le Tribunal avait rendue en mars 2011 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.

Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 445, dat\u00e9e du 18 avril 2012, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait droit aux demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire et annul\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate du Tribunal. L\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 un membre instructeur diff\u00e9rent pour nouvelle d\u00e9cision.\n[5] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision 2012 CF 445 et au paragraphe 49(2) de la Loi, le 7 mai 2012 le soussign\u00e9, agissant \u00e0 titre de pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim, a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 la membre instructrice Sophie Marchildon pour instruire la plainte.\n[6] Le 23 mai 2012, l\u2019avocat de la SSEFPN a envoy\u00e9 au Tribunal une lettre indiquant, notamment, qu\u2019il avait sollicit\u00e9 l\u2019opinion de l\u2019APN et de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) au sujet de la d\u00e9signation d\u2019un nouveau membre pour instruire l\u2019affaire et que ces deux entit\u00e9s \u00e9taient collectivement d\u2019avis que le Tribunal devait d\u00e9signer une formation de trois membres en vue d\u2019instruire l\u2019affaire.\n[7] Le 31 mai 2012, j\u2019ai inform\u00e9 les parties que Mme Marchildon avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e pour instruire la plainte le 7 mai 2012.\n[8] Le 5 juin 2012, l\u2019APN a \u00e9crit au Tribunal en me demandant instamment de r\u00e9examiner la d\u00e9cision d\u2019attribuer l\u2019affaire \u00e0 un membre seul et de d\u00e9signer plut\u00f4t une formation de trois membres. L\u2019APN a demand\u00e9 de pouvoir discuter de l\u2019affaire dans le cadre d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique ou de faire des observations au Tribunal sur la question.\n[9] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la lettre de l\u2019APN, j\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 le 8 juin 2012 que j\u2019\u00e9tudierais une requ\u00eate que pr\u00e9senterait l\u2019APN \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa demande de r\u00e9examen concernant ma d\u00e9cision de d\u00e9signation du 7 mai 2012.\n[10] Le 15 juin 2012, l\u2019APN a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, demandant que je d\u00e9signe une formation de trois membres pour instruire sa plainte.\nIII. Les positions des parties [11] Selon l\u2019APN, le paragraphe 49(2) de la Loi conf\u00e8re au pr\u00e9sident un vaste pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour ce qui est de r\u00e9gir la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, et le pr\u00e9sident conserve le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de r\u00e9viser les d\u00e9cisions de d\u00e9signation tant qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de manquement aux principes de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, ni de pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 une partie comparaissant devant lui.\n[12] En se fondant sur des discussions de gestion d\u2019instance ant\u00e9rieures, tenues le 14 d\u00e9cembre 2009, l\u2019APN soutient qu\u2019elle s\u2019attendait raisonnablement \u00e0 ce que l\u2019on mette tout en \u0153uvre pour d\u00e9signer une formation de trois membres. L\u2019APN soutient \u00e9galement qu\u2019elle s\u2019attendait l\u00e9gitimement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il y ait une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019exposer plus en d\u00e9tail ses pr\u00e9occupations dans le cadre d\u2019un processus ouvert et transparent, semblable \u00e0 celui d\u2019une r\u00e9union de gestion d\u2019instance. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019APN soutient que le fait de ne pas donner une occasion de participer et d\u2019\u00e9noncer les motifs justifiant le changement d\u2019engagement, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire d\u2019une formation compos\u00e9e de trois membres \u00e0 une formation compos\u00e9e d\u2019un membre seul, peut constituer une erreur susceptible de contr\u00f4le.\n[13] L\u2019APN soutient \u00e9galement qu\u2019il est avantageux, par souci de justice et de c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9, que je r\u00e9vise la d\u00e9cision de d\u00e9signation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Selon elle, pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il convient de d\u00e9signer une formation compos\u00e9e de trois membres, il est n\u00e9cessaire de prendre en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019effet que cette d\u00e9cision peut avoir sur la conduite de l\u2019audience ainsi que sur le processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration. Elle ajoute que la plainte soul\u00e8ve des questions complexes qui auront des cons\u00e9quences d\u2019une grande port\u00e9e, tant pour ce qui est de l\u2019impact que cela aura sur les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations que sur la jurisprudence des droits de la personne en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. La preuve sera volumineuse et d\u00e9taill\u00e9e, et le Tribunal sera vraisemblablement appel\u00e9 \u00e0 rendre de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions au sujet d\u2019objections d\u2019ordre proc\u00e9dural. De plus, aussi comp\u00e9tent que puisse \u00eatre un membre seul, dans les affaires complexes il y a un avantage \u00e0 disposer des connaissances et de la contribution au processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration de deux membres de plus. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019APN ajoute que le degr\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 d\u2019examen auquel sera soumise la pr\u00e9sente affaire m\u00e9rite que l\u2019on prenne en consid\u00e9ration le degr\u00e9 de confiance accru que peut procurer le fait que les parties et le public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral savent que l\u2019on a obtenu un r\u00e9sultat plus nuanc\u00e9 gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la contribution et \u00e0 la r\u00e9flexion d\u2019une formation compos\u00e9e de trois membres.\n[14] La SSEFPN soutient que, depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, le Tribunal a pour usage de r\u00e9examiner les d\u00e9cisions de d\u00e9signation si cela est fait dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9, de la c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9 et de la justice. Selon elle, une d\u00e9cision de d\u00e9signation prise en vertu du paragraphe 49(2) de la Loi a une incidence sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats des parties et, de ce fait, il faudrait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement solliciter l\u2019avis de ces derni\u00e8res si elles ont une opinion sur l\u2019affaire. La SSEFPN soutient qu\u2019en raison des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, ainsi que de la complexit\u00e9 des questions juridiques et de fait qui sont soulev\u00e9es, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 bon que le Tribunal, avant de prendre sa d\u00e9cision au sujet de la d\u00e9signation, sollicite le point de vue des parties sur la question de savoir s\u2019il convenait de d\u00e9signer une formation ou non.\n[15] La Commission a fait siennes les observations que la SSEFPN a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es.\n[16] Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral n\u2019a adopt\u00e9 aucune position \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate.\nIV. L\u2019analyse [17] Le paragraphe 48.4(3) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le vice-pr\u00e9sident, en cas d\u2019absence ou d\u2019emp\u00eachement du pr\u00e9sident ou de vacance de son poste, assume la pr\u00e9sidence.\n[18] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les paragraphes 49(1) et (2) de la Loi disposent :\n49. (1) La Commission peut, \u00e0 toute \u00e9tape post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte, si elle est convaincue, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 celle\u2011ci, que l\u2019instruction est justifi\u00e9e.\n49. (1) At any stage after the filing of a complaint, the Commission may request the Chairperson of the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint if the Commission is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry is warranted.\n(2) Sur r\u00e9ception de la demande, le pr\u00e9sident d\u00e9signe un membre pour instruire la plainte. Il peut, s\u2019il estime que la difficult\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire le justifie, d\u00e9signer trois membres, auxquels d\u00e8s lors les articles 50 \u00e0 58 s\u2019appliquent.\n(2) On receipt of a request, the Chairperson shall institute an inquiry by assigning a member of the Tribunal to inquire into the complaint, but the Chairperson may assign a panel of three members if he or she considers that the complexity of the complaint requires the inquiry to be conducted by three members.\n[19] Le pouvoir de d\u00e9signer un membre ou une formation compos\u00e9e de trois membres est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 exclusivement au pr\u00e9sident (voir Brink\u2019s Canada Ltd. c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1996] 2 CF 113 (QL), au paragraphe 28 [Brink\u2019s]). Le paragraphe 49(2) pr\u00e9voit que, pour prendre cette d\u00e9cision, le pr\u00e9sident tient compte de la difficult\u00e9 de la plainte.\n[20] La difficult\u00e9 de la plainte doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e au cas par cas et certains des facteurs dont il faut tenir compte peuvent inclure la nature et la port\u00e9e de la plainte, les faits pr\u00e9cis qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re, les questions de droit soulev\u00e9es ainsi que la nature et le volume potentiels de la preuve documentaire et des t\u00e9moignages des t\u00e9moins.\n[21] Le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi prescrit que l\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait de la mani\u00e8re la plus exp\u00e9ditive possible. La Loi dispose aussi que le pr\u00e9sident est le premier dirigeant du Tribunal et que, \u00e0 ce titre, il en assure la direction et en contr\u00f4le les activit\u00e9s, notamment en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition des t\u00e2ches entre les membres et \u00e0 la gestion de ses affaires internes (voir le paragraphe 48.4(2)). En tant que gardien et protecteur de fonds publics, il incombe au pr\u00e9sident de g\u00e9rer les ressources du Tribunal de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 s\u2019acquitter de mani\u00e8re efficace et efficiente de son mandat envers le public. Cette responsabilit\u00e9 consiste, notamment, \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration les ressources des institutions au moment de d\u00e9cider de l\u2019affectation des affaires de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 permettre au Tribunal de traiter de la totalit\u00e9 des plaintes qui lui sont soumises.\n[22] Par cons\u00e9quent, compte tenu de l\u2019\u00e9conomie et du libell\u00e9 de la Loi, la d\u00e9cision d\u2019affecter un membre seul ou une formation compos\u00e9e de trois membres \u00e0 l\u2019instruction d\u2019une plainte est une d\u00e9cision qui repose sur l\u2019examen que fait le pr\u00e9sident de la complexit\u00e9 de la plainte, mais aussi de la gestion du Tribunal. Sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019analyse qui suit, les parties n\u2019ont pas montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement obligatoire de pr\u00e9senter des observations avant que l\u2019on prenne une d\u00e9cision au sujet de l\u2019affectation d\u2019une affaire en vertu du paragraphe 49(2) de la Loi.\n[23] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 un membre seul pour instruire la pr\u00e9sente plainte le 7 mai 2012. Cela dit, le pouvoir qu\u2019a le pr\u00e9sident de d\u00e9signer des membres en vue d\u2019instruire une plainte n\u2019est pas assujetti au principe du functus officio, o\u00f9 les circonstances exigent que le pouvoir soit exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 plus d\u2019une reprise pour r\u00e9pondre aux fins de la Loi (voir la d\u00e9cision Brink, au paragraphe 28). Cependant, le pouvoir de modifier une d\u00e9cision d\u2019affectation ne permet pas d\u2019effectuer de tels changements si une telle mesure occasionne un manquement aux principes de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 ou porte pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 une partie quelconque qui compara\u00eet devant le Tribunal (voir Brink, au paragraphe 29). Dans le cas de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, aucune des parties n\u2019a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 un probl\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 quelconque ou soutenu que ce serait pr\u00e9judiciable si la d\u00e9signation, le 7 mai 2012, d\u2019un membre unique \u00e9tait remplac\u00e9e par la d\u00e9signation d\u2019une formation compos\u00e9e de trois membres. \u00c0 part le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui n\u2019a adopt\u00e9 aucune position au sujet de la requ\u00eate, les autres parties recommandent plut\u00f4t au Tribunal de d\u00e9signer une formation constitu\u00e9e de trois membres pour la pr\u00e9sente instruction. J\u2019ai donc toute latitude pour r\u00e9examiner la d\u00e9cision de d\u00e9signation que j\u2019ai prise le 7 mai 2012.\n[24] L\u2019APN soutient qu\u2019elle s\u2019attendait raisonnablement \u00e0 ce que l\u2019on mette tout en \u0153uvre pour d\u00e9signer une formation compos\u00e9e de trois membres. Sa position repose sur une r\u00e9union de gestion d\u2019instance, tenue le 14 d\u00e9cembre 2009 entre le Tribunal et les parties, r\u00e9union qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sum\u00e9e dans une lettre que le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9e aux parties le 23 d\u00e9cembre 2009. Dans ce document, sous la rubrique [traduction] \u00ab Formation \u00bb, il est indiqu\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab [L]a pr\u00e9sidente a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle est dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 faire de son mieux pour constituer une formation. \u00bb\n[25] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Baker c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), [1999] 2 RCS 817 [Baker], la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a statu\u00e9 que la doctrine de l\u2019attente l\u00e9gitime :\n[\u2026] est fond\u00e9e sur le principe que les \u00abcirconstances\u00bb touchant l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale comprennent les promesses ou pratiques habituelles des d\u00e9cideurs administratifs, et qu\u2019il serait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement injuste de leur part d\u2019agir en contravention d\u2019assurances donn\u00e9es en mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dures, ou de revenir sur des promesses mat\u00e9rielles sans accorder de droits proc\u00e9duraux importants.\n(Baker, au paragraphe 26)\n[26] Bien que la doctrine de l\u2019attente l\u00e9gitime puisse donner naissance \u00e0 un droit de pr\u00e9senter des observations, un droit d\u2019\u00eatre consult\u00e9 ou des droits de nature proc\u00e9durale plus \u00e9tendus, elle ne cr\u00e9e pas de droits fondamentaux et n\u2019entrave pas le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du d\u00e9cideur l\u00e9gal (voir Moreau-B\u00e9rub\u00e9 c. Nouveau-Brunswick (Conseil de la magistrature), 2002 CSC 11, au paragraphe 78).\n[27] Comme la doctrine de l\u2019attente l\u00e9gitime ne cr\u00e9e pas de droits fondamentaux et n\u2019entrave pas le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du d\u00e9cideur l\u00e9gal, je conclus qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas y avoir d\u2019attente l\u00e9gitime qu\u2019une formation constitu\u00e9e de trois membres serait absolument d\u00e9sign\u00e9e pour instruire la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Cependant, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la pr\u00e9sidente consultait activement les parties dans le cadre de la gestion d\u2019instance, et qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019on ferait de son mieux pour constituer une formation, cela a pu avoir cr\u00e9\u00e9 une attente que les parties seraient consult\u00e9es avant que l\u2019on prenne une d\u00e9cision d\u2019affectation. Les parties n\u2019ont pas eu cette occasion avant le 7 mai 2012, date \u00e0 laquelle j\u2019ai pris ma d\u00e9cision d\u2019affectation, mais la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate a permis aux parties d\u2019exprimer leurs vues sur le sujet. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon moi, s\u2019il existait une attente quant au fait d\u2019\u00eatre consult\u00e9 avant la d\u00e9signation d\u2019un membre pour instruire l\u2019affaire, le fait que les parties aient pu faire des observations sur la question vis\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate r\u00e9pond \u00e0 cette attente.\n[28] L\u2019APN soutient \u00e9galement qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice et de la c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9 de r\u00e9viser la d\u00e9cision d\u2019affectation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle laisse entendre que, dans les affaires complexes, il y a un avantage \u00e0 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des connaissances et de la contribution au processus de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration de deux membres de plus, ce qui rehausse \u00e9galement le degr\u00e9 de confiance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la d\u00e9cision rendue. Le Tribunal et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ont tous deux reconnu la complexit\u00e9 et l\u2019importance des questions qui sont soulev\u00e9es dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Comme le fait remarquer l\u2019APN, la complexit\u00e9 de la plainte obligera \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve nombreux et d\u00e9taill\u00e9s, ce qui m\u00e8nera \u00e0 de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions concernant des objections de nature proc\u00e9durale, ainsi que plusieurs semaines d\u2019audition. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, que ce soit un membre seul ou une formation constitu\u00e9e de trois membres que l\u2019on d\u00e9signe pour instruire la pr\u00e9sente affaire, les parties et le Tribunal ont d\u00e9pens\u00e9 et continueront de d\u00e9penser un temps et des ressources consid\u00e9rables en vue du r\u00e8glement de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. En tant que pr\u00e9sident et premier dirigeant par int\u00e9rim, et conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 48.4(2) de la Loi, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t je me dois de g\u00e9rer d\u2019une mani\u00e8re efficace les ressources restreintes du Tribunal, ce qui inclut la r\u00e9partition du travail entre les membres. En \u00e9valuant les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente affaire et la gestion du Tribunal, je me dois de favoriser un processus \u00e9quitable et exp\u00e9ditif, non seulement pour le r\u00e8glement de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, mais aussi pour celui de toutes les plaintes qui sont soumises au Tribunal. Comme l\u2019ont indiqu\u00e9 les plaignantes, et ce, tout r\u00e9cemment dans la lettre du 23 mai 2012 que la SSEFPN a adress\u00e9e au Tribunal, le r\u00e8glement exp\u00e9ditif de la pr\u00e9sente plainte a pour elles de s\u00e9rieuses cons\u00e9quences :\n[traduction] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9 dans des lettres ant\u00e9rieures au Tribunal, il est de la plus haute importance pour nos clients que l\u2019affaire soit r\u00e9gl\u00e9e rapidement. [\u2026] Tout retard dans cette affaire am\u00e8ne des milliers d\u2019enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00e0 \u00eatre isol\u00e9s davantage de leurs familles et de leurs collectivit\u00e9s et les prive de soins ad\u00e9quats et culturellement pertinents. Tout autre retard aurait pour effet de discr\u00e9diter l\u2019administration de la justice et de causer un pr\u00e9judice consid\u00e9rable aux victimes de discrimination.\n[29] Vu la charge de travail actuelle du Tribunal et la disponibilit\u00e9 de ses membres, la d\u00e9signation d\u2019une formation compos\u00e9e de trois membres pour instruire l\u2019affaire particuli\u00e8re dont il est ici question pourrait avoir une incidence sur la planification des conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de gestion d\u2019instance, l\u2019audition des requ\u00eates et les dates ultimes de l\u2019audition, comparativement au fait de proc\u00e9der avec un membre seul. Cela dit, si les parties demeurent conscientes et souples \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des difficult\u00e9s que pr\u00e9sente le fait de coordonner la disponibilit\u00e9 des membres, et si elles travaillent de concert pour h\u00e2ter le d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019affaire avec la gestion et l\u2019aide du Tribunal, je conclus que la d\u00e9signation d\u2019une formation constitu\u00e9e de trois membres en vue d\u2019instruire la pr\u00e9sente plainte pourrait ne pas avoir d\u2019incidences importantes sur la gestion de la charge de travail du Tribunal, sur ses affaires internes ou sur l\u2019instruction exp\u00e9ditive de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. En gardant cela \u00e0 l\u2019esprit, je note l\u2019ouverture des parties et leur accord \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du fait que Mme Marchildon, membre instructrice, assure la gestion de la pr\u00e9sente affaire pendant l\u2019examen de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. Sur ce fondement, une formation constitu\u00e9e de trois membres sera d\u00e9sign\u00e9e pour instruire la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\nV. La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate [30] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision a pour objet d\u2019informer les parties qu\u2019une formation constitu\u00e9e de trois membres est d\u00e9sign\u00e9e en vue de l\u2019instruction de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Outre Mme Marchildon, les deux autres membres d\u00e9sign\u00e9s pour instruire la pr\u00e9sente plainte et constituer la formation sont M. B\u00e9langer et M. Lustig. Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 49(3) de la Loi, je d\u00e9l\u00e8gue \u00e0 Mme Marchildon la pr\u00e9sidence de l\u2019instruction.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSusheel Gupta\nVice-pr\u00e9sident, pr\u00e9sident et premier dirigeant par int\u00e9rim\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 10 juillet 2012\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1340\/7008\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada et al. c.

Lustig\nDate : Le 23 ao\u00fbt 2012\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2012 TCDP 17\nI. Le contexte [1] Les plaignantes ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne, all\u00e9guant que le financement in\u00e9quitable des services de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance fournis dans les r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00e9tait assimilable \u00e0 de la discrimination du fait de la race et de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, LRC 1985, c H-6 (la Loi). Dans une d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 14 mars 2011 et publi\u00e9e sous la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence 2011 TCDP 4, le Tribunal a fait droit \u00e0 une requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en vue de faire rejeter la plainte au motif que les questions qui y \u00e9taient soulev\u00e9es exc\u00e9daient sa comp\u00e9tence : la \u00ab requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence \u00bb. Le Tribunal a statu\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne poss\u00e9dait pas la comp\u00e9tence requise aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi pour instruire la plainte car, en l\u2019absence d\u2019un groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9, on ne pouvait pas conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un motif de distinction illicite de la part du gouvernement du Canada. Cette d\u00e9cision a par la suite fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[2] Le 18 avril 2012, dans une d\u00e9cision publi\u00e9e sous la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence 2012 CF 445, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a infirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal et renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire \u00e0 une formation diff\u00e9remment constitu\u00e9e afin que l\u2019affaire soit r\u00e9examin\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re conforme \u00e0 ses motifs.\n[3] Lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance qui a eu lieu le 25 janvier 2012, et que le Tribunal a plus tard r\u00e9sum\u00e9e dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 29 juin 2012, les parties ont demand\u00e9 que la membre instructrice Marchildon \u00e9tablisse une directive sur la mani\u00e8re d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019ordonnance de renvoi que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendue dans sa d\u00e9cision 2012 CF 445. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elles ont demand\u00e9 conseil sur la question de savoir si cette ordonnance, qui renvoyait l\u2019affaire au Tribunal pour r\u00e9examen conform\u00e9ment aux motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, exigeait que ce dernier instruise de nouveau la requ\u00eate en rejet qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet du contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. La membre instructrice Marchildon a demand\u00e9 que les parties pr\u00e9sentent des observations sur la question, en exigeant que les observations initiales et les r\u00e9ponses connexes soient d\u00e9pos\u00e9es au cours des deux semaines suivantes.\n[4] Le 10 juillet 2012, le vice-pr\u00e9sident et pr\u00e9sident int\u00e9rimaire, M. Gupta, a r\u00e9vis\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision initiale de d\u00e9signer un membre instructeur seul pour entendre l\u2019affaire et il a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 une formation coll\u00e9giale constitu\u00e9e des trois membres instructeurs Marchildon, Lustig et B\u00e9langer (2012 TCDP 16). La d\u00e9cision qui suit a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par tous les membres de cette formation.\nII. L\u2019analyse [5] Il convient de signaler que, dans chacune de leurs observations concernant la pr\u00e9sente question, les parties ont demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une audition sur le fond de la plainte sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019audition des requ\u00eates pr\u00e9liminaires pendantes.\n[6] Dans cette optique et apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 avec soin les observations des parties sur la pr\u00e9sente question, ainsi que les motifs que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendus dans sa d\u00e9cision 2012 CF 445, la formation coll\u00e9giale est d\u2019avis que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, en infirmant la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal selon laquelle il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas comp\u00e9tent pour instruire la plainte, a tranch\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9finitive la question relative \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence. En fait, lorsqu\u2019elle a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire au Tribunal, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas laiss\u00e9 entendre qu\u2019il fallait que le r\u00e9examen rev\u00eate la forme d\u2019une autre audition et, plus important encore, elle a rendu des motifs pr\u00e9cis qui obligent le Tribunal \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019il y a lieu de rejeter la requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence : voir la d\u00e9cision Turanskaya c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), [1997] A.C.F. no 254, au paragraphe 6, ainsi que la d\u00e9cision Marsh c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada), 2006 CF 1466, au paragraphe 45. Soumettre la requ\u00eate \u00e0 une autre audition irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019objet m\u00eame du processus de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[7] En cons\u00e9quence, \u00e9tant li\u00e9 par la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et les motifs qui y figurent, le Tribunal se doit maintenant, sous r\u00e9serve d\u2019autres requ\u00eates pr\u00e9liminaires pendantes, de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de la plainte sur le fond.\nIII. La d\u00e9cision [8] Le Tribunal rejette la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en vue de faire rejeter la plainte du fait de la question relative \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nPr\u00e9sidente de la formation coll\u00e9giale\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nMembre instructeur\nEdward P.

Vu le caract\u00e8re singulier et l\u2019importance de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, ainsi que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la collectivit\u00e9 autochtone \u00e0 pouvoir observer les d\u00e9bats, l\u2019Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) (le R\u00e9seau de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision des peuples autochtones) a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal, dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 22 octobre 2009, l\u2019autorisation de filmer l\u2019audition de la plainte, ce qui inclut les d\u00e9clarations pr\u00e9liminaires et finales, les d\u00e9positions des t\u00e9moins, les questions pos\u00e9es, les objections formul\u00e9es et les arguments invoqu\u00e9s. Dans une d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 28 mai 2010 (2010 TCDP 16), le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 cette demande au motif que le fait d\u2019autoriser la pr\u00e9sence de cam\u00e9ras serait pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019audition et que cela pouvait miner l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats. APTN a par la suite d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire concernant cette d\u00e9cision.\n[2] Le 14 mars 2011, dans la d\u00e9cision 2011 TCDP 4, le Tribunal a fait droit \u00e0 une requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en vue de faire rejeter la plainte au motif que les questions qui y \u00e9taient soulev\u00e9es exc\u00e9daient la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal (la requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence).

Elle a conclu que le Tribunal avait rendu la d\u00e9cision 2012 TCDP 16 sans tenir compte des documents qu\u2019il avait en main et que cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable lorsqu\u2019on l\u2019\u00e9valuait par rapport au dossier disponible. Consid\u00e9rant que la d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait loin de satisfaire au crit\u00e8re de la justification, de la transparence et de l\u2019intelligibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019exige l\u2019arr\u00eat Dunsmuir c. Nouveau-Brunswick [2008] 1 R.C.S. 190, 2008 CSC 9, elle a fait droit \u00e0 la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire d\u2019APTN. Cependant, compte tenu de la d\u00e9cision 2011 TCDP 4 dans laquelle le Tribunal avait conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas comp\u00e9tent pour examiner la plainte sous-jacente, la question du r\u00e9examen de la d\u00e9cision de ne pas autoriser la pr\u00e9sence de cam\u00e9ras a \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la prise d\u2019une d\u00e9cision judiciaire sur la requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence.\nLe 18 avril 2012, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans une d\u00e9cision publi\u00e9e sous la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence 2012 CF 445, a infirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision 2011 TCDP 4 du Tribunal et renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire \u00e0 une formation diff\u00e9remment constitu\u00e9e du Tribunal pour que la d\u00e9cision soit r\u00e9examin\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re conforme \u00e0 ses motifs.

L\u2019analyse [5] La formation a examin\u00e9 les observations que les parties avaient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en 2009 \u00e0 la suite de la premi\u00e8re demande d\u2019APTN concernant la pr\u00e9sence de cam\u00e9ras, de m\u00eame que la r\u00e9cente demande que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a faite dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 21 ao\u00fbt 2012 afin de pouvoir pr\u00e9senter des observations suppl\u00e9mentaires sur la question de la pr\u00e9sence de cam\u00e9ras. Cependant, compte tenu des motifs que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendus dans sa d\u00e9cision 2011 CF 810, la formation coll\u00e9giale est d\u2019avis que, m\u00eame s\u2019il reste \u00e0 trancher la question des directives d\u2019ex\u00e9cution concernant la pr\u00e9sence de cam\u00e9ras, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale rejette d\u2019une mani\u00e8re d\u00e9finitive les motifs que le Tribunal a invoqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appui d\u2019une interdiction compl\u00e8te de t\u00e9l\u00e9diffusion. En fait, ces motifs obligent la formation coll\u00e9giale \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019autoriser la pr\u00e9sence de cam\u00e9ras lors des d\u00e9bats et que, de ce fait, des observations suppl\u00e9mentaires sur la question ne feraient que retarder inutilement la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[6] Il faudra toutefois autoriser la pr\u00e9sence de cam\u00e9ras conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 des directives d\u2019ex\u00e9cution qu\u2019il reste encore \u00e0 d\u00e9finir. Ces directives viseront \u00e0 trouver un juste \u00e9quilibre entre les effets d\u00e9favorables possibles de la prise d\u2019images et l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019ont les personnes vivant dans les r\u00e9serves \u00e0 observer les d\u00e9bats. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la formation coll\u00e9giale s\u2019engage \u00e0 entreprendre avec les parties des discussions visant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des directives d\u2019ex\u00e9cution qui conviendront \u00e0 tous. La formation fixera une date pour ces discussions dans un avenir rapproch\u00e9 et s\u2019informera sous peu des disponibilit\u00e9s des parties \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nIII. La d\u00e9cision [7] Le Tribunal fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate d\u2019APTN concernant la pr\u00e9sence de cam\u00e9ras, sous r\u00e9serve des directives d\u2019ex\u00e9cution qu\u2019il \u00e9tablira sans d\u00e9lai.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nPr\u00e9sidente de la formation coll\u00e9giale\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nMembre instructeur\nEdward P.

Lustig\nDate : Le 6 septembre 2012\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2012 TCDP 19\nI. La requ\u00eate [1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 le 30 juillet 2012 en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance en annulation de l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de l\u2019avis de question constitutionnelle (l\u2019AQC) que les plaignants ont signifi\u00e9 le 19 janvier 2012.\n[2] Les plaignants ont signifi\u00e9 un AQC en vue de contester la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens, L.R.C. (1985), ch. I-5, en vertu de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, Partie I de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, constituant l\u2019annexe B de la Loi de 1982 sur le Canada (R.\u2011U.) (1982), ch. 11 (la Charte). La contestation de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de cet article en vertu de la Charte est fond\u00e9e sur le fait que l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] contrevient a) aux articles 2 et 3 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne; et b) \u00e0 l\u2019article premier et au paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, et devrait \u00eatre annul\u00e9 et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 inop\u00e9rant \u00bb. L\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens porte sur l\u2019inscription au registre des Indiens en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens.\nII. Le contexte [3] Les plaignants sont des fr\u00e8res et s\u0153ur, petits\u2011enfants d\u2019une Indienne qui a \u00e9pous\u00e9 un non\u2011Indien avant 1985. Les plaignants ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes pratiquement identiques en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985), ch. H-6 (la LCDP), affirmant que les dispositions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019inscription de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e9taient discriminatoires \u00e0 leur endroit pour des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur le sexe ou la situation de famille en ce sens qu\u2019elles ne donnaient pas le droit \u00e0 leurs enfants d\u2019\u00eatre inscrits \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien, ce qui ne serait pas le cas dans la situation hypoth\u00e9tique d\u2019enfants n\u00e9s d\u2019un grand\u2011p\u00e8re Indien qui aurait \u00e9pous\u00e9 une non\u2011Indienne.\n[4] Dans son avis de requ\u00eate, qui comprend ses observations \u00e9crites, l\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence requise pour conna\u00eetre d\u2019une contestation de la Loi sur les Indiens fond\u00e9e sur la Charte et que l\u2019AQC devrait \u00eatre annul\u00e9.\n[5] Dans ses observations \u00e9crites dat\u00e9es du 9 ao\u00fbt 2012, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) affirme qu\u2019elle convient avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 du fait qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal devrait refuser d\u2019examiner les questions fond\u00e9es sur la Charte qui sont soulev\u00e9es dans l\u2019AQC.\n[6] Dans leurs observations \u00e9crites dat\u00e9es du 9 ao\u00fbt 2012, les plaignants soutiennent que le Tribunal est comp\u00e9tent pour entendre et juger leur AQC.\n[7] Dans ses observations faites le 23 ao\u00fbt 2012 en r\u00e9ponse aux observations des plaignants, l\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme que les observations des plaignants n\u2019ont aucun fondement.\nIII. Les dispositions l\u00e9gales pertinentes [8] Dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, les dispositions l\u00e9gales pertinentes sont les suivantes :\nDans la Charte :\n1 La Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s garantit les droits et libert\u00e9s qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. Ils ne peuvent \u00eatre restreints que par une r\u00e8gle de droit, dans des limites qui soient raisonnables et dont la justification puisse se d\u00e9montrer dans le cadre d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique.\n15(1) La loi ne fait acception de personne et s\u2019applique \u00e9galement \u00e0 tous, et tous ont droit \u00e0 la m\u00eame protection et au m\u00eame b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la loi, ind\u00e9pendamment de toute discrimination, notamment des discriminations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, le sexe, l\u2019\u00e2ge ou les d\u00e9ficiences mentales ou physiques.\nDans la LCDP :\n2 La pr\u00e9sente loi a pour objet de compl\u00e9ter la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet, dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada, au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\n39 Pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente partie, \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb s\u2019entend d\u2019un acte vis\u00e9 aux articles 5 \u00e0 14.1.\n40(1) Sous r\u00e9serve des paragraphes (5) et (7), un individu ou un groupe d\u2019individus ayant des motifs raisonnables de croire qu\u2019une personne a commis un acte discriminatoire peut d\u00e9poser une plainte devant la Commission en la forme acceptable pour cette derni\u00e8re.\n49(1) La Commission peut, \u00e0 toute \u00e9tape post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte, si elle est convaincue, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 celle-ci, que l\u2019instruction est justifi\u00e9e.\n50(2) [Le membre instructeur] tranche les questions de droit et les questions de fait dans les affaires dont il est saisi en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie.\n53(2) \u00c0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 54, ordonner, selon les circonstances, \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire [\u2026]\n67 La pr\u00e9sente loi est sans effet sur la Loi sur les Indiens et sur les dispositions prises en vertu de cette loi. [Abrog\u00e9, 2008, ch. 30, art. 1]\nDans les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03-05-04)\n9 (7) Si une partie entend invoquer des motifs constitutionnels devant le membre instructeur pour contester la validit\u00e9, l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 ou l\u2019op\u00e9ration d\u2019une loi ou d\u2019un r\u00e8glement, elle doit donner un avis \u00e0 cet effet conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 57 de la Loi sur la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et \u00e0 la Formule 69 des R\u00e8gles de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (1998).\nDans la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, L.R.C. (1985), ch. F-7\n57(1) Les lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales [\u2026] ou leurs textes d\u2019application, dont la validit\u00e9, l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 ou l\u2019effet, sur le plan constitutionnel, est en cause devant [\u2026] un office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral [\u2026], ne peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9s invalides, inapplicables ou sans effet, \u00e0 moins que le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada et ceux des provinces n\u2019aient \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe (2).\nIV. Les observations des parties [9] Les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9 peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9sum\u00e9es de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\ni) En vertu du paragraphe 50(2) de la LCDP, le Tribunal est comp\u00e9tent pour trancher les questions de droit, constitutionnelles ou autres, dans les affaires dont il est saisi en vue de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu\u2019un acte donn\u00e9 est un \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb au sens des articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 de la LCDP. Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas comp\u00e9tent pour conna\u00eetre des questions de droit qui ne lui servent pas \u00e0 se prononcer sur les affaires dont il est saisi, comme la question de savoir si l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens contrevient \u00e0 l\u2019article 15 de la Charte, et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, si cet article est justifi\u00e9 par l\u2019article premier de la Charte;\nii) Le pouvoir de trancher les questions de droit s\u2019applique \u00e0 toute question constitutionnelle soulev\u00e9e dans l\u2019exercice du mandat du Tribunal. Comme la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) c. Martin, 2003 CSC 54, au paragraphe 34, \u00ab la question qui se pose alors est de savoir si la mission du tribunal administratif inclut le pouvoir de se prononcer sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la disposition contest\u00e9e \u00bb. La comp\u00e9tence conf\u00e9r\u00e9e au Tribunal par le paragraphe 50(2) de la LCDP ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 la contestation de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 15 de la Charte telle qu\u2019elle est \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019AQC;\niii) Le fait que l\u2019article 15 de la Charte offre \u00e9galement une protection contre la discrimination ne conf\u00e8re pas au Tribunal la comp\u00e9tence requise pour trancher de fa\u00e7on autonome les questions constitutionnelles relatives \u00e0 la contestation de dispositions l\u00e9gislatives pour des raisons de discrimination; le Tribunal n\u2019a pas davantage la comp\u00e9tence requise pour d\u00e9cider si une loi donn\u00e9e contrevient aux articles 2 ou 7 \u00e0 12 de la Charte. Le Tribunal peut s\u2019acquitter du mandat qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 par la loi et \u00e9tablir si les dispositions contest\u00e9es constituent un \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb au sens de la LCDP, ind\u00e9pendamment de la Charte. Par cons\u00e9quent, la question fond\u00e9e sur la Charte ne rel\u00e8ve pas du mandat confi\u00e9 au Tribunal par la LCDP. En cons\u00e9quence de quoi, l\u2019AQC devrait \u00eatre annul\u00e9, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas dans les d\u00e9cisions Neubauer c. British Columbia (Ministry of Human Resources), 2004 BCHRT 34, et Hendershott c. Ontario (Community and Social Services), 2011 HRTO 482;\niv) L\u2019abrogation de l\u2019article 67 de la LCDP n\u2019a pas de rapport avec la question qui fait l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. L\u2019article 67 n\u2019a aucune incidence sur les droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vus par la Charte qui sont invoqu\u00e9s devant les tribunaux. Les plaintes de violation des droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vus par la Charte pouvaient \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9es avant l\u2019abrogation de l\u2019article 67 et peuvent toujours \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9es apr\u00e8s son abrogation. Toutefois, ladite abrogation de l\u2019article 67 n\u2019a pas eu pour effet d\u2019autoriser le Tribunal \u00e0 conna\u00eetre de ces plaintes.\n[10] Les observations de la Commission peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9sum\u00e9es de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\ni) Le paragraphe 50(2) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que, dans les affaires dont il est saisi, le Tribunal a le pouvoir de trancher les questions de droit, y compris les questions constitutionnelles qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner afin de trancher les affaires dont il est saisi. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal peut se pencher sur les all\u00e9gations de violation de la LCDP sans avoir \u00e0 trancher les questions relatives \u00e0 la Charte que les plaignants ont soulev\u00e9es dans leur AQC. Autrement dit, pour reprendre la formulation du paragraphe 50(2) de la LCDP, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas \u00e0 trancher les questions relatives \u00e0 la Charte qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises dans l\u2019affaire dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal devrait renoncer \u00e0 examiner les questions relatives \u00e0 la Charte qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es;\nii) Lorsque le Tribunal est saisi d\u2019une affaire, la question essentielle doit toujours \u00eatre de savoir si un intim\u00e9 s\u2019est rendu coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire, au sens de la LCDP. Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas comp\u00e9tent pour mener des enqu\u00eates autonomes visant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir si une disposition l\u00e9gislative contrevient ou non \u00e0 la Charte;\niii) M\u00eame lorsqu\u2019un tribunal conclut qu\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gislative contrevient \u00e0 la Charte, il n\u2019a pas le pouvoir de prononcer une d\u00e9claration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. Il s\u2019ensuit que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence requise pour accorder aux plaignants les r\u00e9parations fond\u00e9es sur la Charte qu\u2019ils demandent, soit une d\u00e9claration selon laquelle l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens est annul\u00e9 et inop\u00e9rant.\n[11] Les observations des plaignants peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9sum\u00e9es de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\ni) Le Tribunal est comp\u00e9tent pour conna\u00eetre de l\u2019ACQ relatif \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens et il n\u2019y a rien dans la LCDP qui limite cette comp\u00e9tence;\nii) Le paragraphe 50(2) de la LCDP accorde au Tribunal le pouvoir de trancher toutes les questions de droit, sans restriction, y compris les questions constitutionnelles, \u00e0 condition qu\u2019un ACQ appropri\u00e9 ait \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9;\niii) L\u2019abrogation de l\u2019article 67 de la LCDP visait \u00e0 soumettre les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e0 un examen en vertu de la LCDP, sans restriction, y compris en ce qui concerne la question de savoir si les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens contreviennent \u00e0 la Constitution et \u00e0 la Charte aussi bien qu\u2019\u00e0 la LCDP.\nV. Analyse [12] Un tribunal administratif poss\u00e9dant le pouvoir de trancher des questions de droit et dont la comp\u00e9tence constitutionnelle n\u2019est pas clairement \u00e9cart\u00e9e peut r\u00e9soudre une question constitutionnelle se rapportant \u00e0 une affaire dont il est r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement saisi (R. c. Conway, 2010 CSC 22, au paragraphe 78 (Conway)). Si le tribunal administratif a le pouvoir expr\u00e8s ou tacite de trancher une question de droit, la question qui se pose toujours est celle de savoir si la r\u00e9paration demand\u00e9e est de celles que le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu que le tribunal administratif en cause puisse accorder eu \u00e9gard au cadre l\u00e9gislatif \u00e9tabli (voir Conway, aux paragraphes 81 et 82).\n[13] Le paragraphe 50(2) de la LCDP accorde au Tribunal le pouvoir de trancher toutes les questions de droit \u00ab dans les affaires dont il est saisi \u00bb. Comme le pr\u00e9cisent les articles 2 et 39 ainsi que les paragraphes 40(1) et 49(1) de la LCDP, la question que le Tribunal doit trancher dans toutes les affaires dont il est saisi est de savoir si un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis au sens des articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 de la LCDP. L\u2019AQC que les plaignants ont signifi\u00e9 vise \u00e0 juger des m\u00eames faits qui contreviennent pr\u00e9tendument \u00e0 la LCDP \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la Charte. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la question constitutionnelle que les plaignants ont soulev\u00e9e ne se rapporte pas \u00e0 la question de savoir si un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis au sens de la LCDP. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une question de droit totalement distincte, qui ne rel\u00e8ve pas du mandat confi\u00e9 par la loi au Tribunal en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[14] Le fait que les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne exigent des parties qu\u2019elles signifient un AQC conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 57 de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales ne change rien \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence constitutionnelle accord\u00e9e au Tribunal par la LCDP. L\u2019abrogation de l\u2019article 67 de la LCDP n\u2019a pas non plus eu pour effet d\u2019accorder au Tribunal le pouvoir d\u2019entendre et juger de mani\u00e8re autonome, et en vertu de la Charte, des contestations relatives \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens qui ne se rapportent pas \u00e0 la question de savoir si un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis au sens de la LCDP.\n[15] Dans leur AQC, les plaignants demandent \u00e9galement au Tribunal d\u2019annuler l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens et de le d\u00e9clarer inop\u00e9rant. Comme l\u2019indique le paragraphe 53(2) de la LCDP, le Tribunal n\u2019est comp\u00e9tent pour accorder des r\u00e9parations que s\u2019il juge qu\u2019un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis au sens de la LCDP et tout ordre en vue de r\u00e9parer l\u2019acte discriminatoire est donn\u00e9 \u00ab [\u2026] \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire \u00bb (voir les alin\u00e9as 53(2)a) \u00e0 e), le paragraphe 53(3) et les articles 54 et 54.1 de la LCDP). Rien n\u2019indique dans la LCDP, ou ailleurs, que le Tribunal a le pouvoir d\u2019annuler des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives ou de prononcer des d\u00e9clarations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 constitutionnelle.\n[16] Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 avec attention les observations des parties ainsi que la jurisprudence applicable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je conviens avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 et la Commission que la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en annulation de l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de l\u2019AQC devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas le pouvoir requis en mati\u00e8re constitutionnelle pour conna\u00eetre de l\u2019AQC des plaignants.\nVI. D\u00e9cision [17] Pour l\u2019ensemble de ces motifs, la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 est accord\u00e9e et j\u2019ordonne que l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de l\u2019AQC des plaignants soit annul\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

Le respect par le MAINC de l\u2019ordonnance quant aux mesures de redressement deux, trois et quatre. 13\nIV......... La d\u00e9cision. 16\nI. Le contexte [1] Au cours de la p\u00e9riode du 19 au 22 juillet 2010, le Tribunal a men\u00e9 l\u2019instruction des all\u00e9gations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les plaignants, James Louie et Joyce Beattie, selon lesquelles des agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada, anciennement Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada (le MAINC), avaient agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire dans leur traitement des demandes de bail des plaignants pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en application du paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi sur les Indiens (la Loi).\n[2] L\u2019article 58(3) de la Loi est ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9 :\nLe ministre peut louer au profit de tout Indien, \u00e0 la demande de celui-ci, la terre dont ce dernier est en possession l\u00e9gitime sans que celle-ci soit d\u00e9sign\u00e9e.\n[3] Le paragraphe 3(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP) pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\nPour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n[4] L\u2019article 5 de la LCDP est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ainsi :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\na) d\u2019en priver un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture.\n[5] Les plaignants avaient form\u00e9 une coentreprise afin de pr\u00e9parer et de pr\u00e9senter une demande d\u2019utilisation de terres dans une r\u00e9serve indienne et une demande de titulaire d\u2019un billet de location au ministre du MAINC conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi. Ils voulaient obtenir un bail d\u2019habitation \u00e0 long terme pr\u00e9pay\u00e9 visant des terres appartenant au titulaire d\u2019un billet de location (le plaignant M. Louie) pour le d\u00e9veloppeur (la plaignante Mme Beattie), dans l\u2019intention d\u2019\u00e9ventuellement mettre le bail en march\u00e9 et de l\u2019attribuer \u00e0 un tiers. L\u2019intim\u00e9, qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas satisfait de l\u2019auto\u2011d\u00e9claration faite par le plaignant M. Louie selon laquelle la transaction \u00e9tait \u00e0 son avantage, a refus\u00e9 de traiter les demandes des plaignants \u00e0 moins qu\u2019ils ne prouvent que le titulaire d\u2019un billet de location recevrait une contrepartie refl\u00e9tant la juste valeur marchande du bien. Les plaignants all\u00e8guent que cette politique et cette interpr\u00e9tation de la Loi constituent de la discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des propri\u00e9taires fonciers individuels indiens.\nA. La d\u00e9cision du Tribunal [6] Le 26 janvier 2011, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a rendu une d\u00e9cision (la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal) selon laquelle, en refusant de laisser le plaignant M. Louie \u00e9valuer lui\u2011m\u00eame les avantages qui d\u00e9couleraient de la location de ses terres et en refusant de traiter la demande de bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les plaignants, l\u2019intim\u00e9 les a priv\u00e9s de services destin\u00e9s au public et a donc commis un acte discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP.\n[7] Plusieurs des conclusions formul\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal sont pertinentes pour ce qui est de clarifier les mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es :\n52. Dans le traitement de la demande des plaignants pour un bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location, le MAINC s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur des crit\u00e8res et des proc\u00e9dures \u00e9tablies dans son Guide de la gestion des terres afin de tenter de d\u00e9terminer si la transaction propos\u00e9e par M. Louie \u00e9tait viable et \u00e0 son avantage. Dans le cadre de ce processus, le MAINC a demand\u00e9 une \u00e9valuation ind\u00e9pendante afin de d\u00e9terminer la juste valeur marchande, sans tenir compte de l\u2019accord de coentreprise des plaignants et, en novembre 2008, le MAINC a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Louie d\u2019\u00e9tablir, \u00e0 la satisfaction du minist\u00e8re, une preuve de [traduction] \u00ab sa capacit\u00e9 et sa comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 conclure la transaction propos\u00e9e \u00bb.\n53. Le MAINC a tent\u00e9 d\u2019imposer un pouvoir unilat\u00e9ral sur tous les aspects de la proposition de bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location des plaignants. Pendant le traitement de la demande de M. Louie, les agents du MAINC \u00e9taient d\u2019avis qu\u2019il \u00e9tait de leur \u00ab devoir \u00bb d\u2019intervenir afin de prot\u00e9ger les int\u00e9r\u00eats de M. Louie \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien inscrit et de dicter la nature et les modalit\u00e9s du bail demand\u00e9. Ce faisant, ils ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on dont la Loi est devenue un anachronisme qui est contraire \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 et aux droits de la personne individuels garantis auxquels tous les Canadiens ont droit.\n54. L\u2019attitude paternaliste du MAINC envers M. Louie a \u00e9t\u00e9 avalis\u00e9e et soutenue sans \u00e9quivoque par le ministre Chuck Strahl dans sa lettre \u00e0 M. Louie le 15 mai 2008. Le ministre a carr\u00e9ment d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Louie ne pouvait pas dicter les modalit\u00e9s du bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location qu\u2019il demandait, et il a soutenu qu\u2019[traduction] \u00ab un rapport fiduciaire est cr\u00e9\u00e9 [\u2026] lorsque le Canada contracte des baux de certificats de possession. [\u2026] En vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens, le pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9tablir le loyer revient au Canada et ne peut pas \u00eatre annul\u00e9 de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit, sauf par modification de la loi. Ce pouvoir s\u2019\u00e9tend au-del\u00e0 de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du loyer et une d\u00e9charge ne modifiera pas le pouvoir unilat\u00e9ral du Canada d\u2019\u00e9tablir les modalit\u00e9s du bail, qui comprennent aussi, sans s\u2019y limiter, des dispositions quant \u00e0 l\u2019environnement. \u00bb [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n55. Le ministre avait tort. Il n\u2019existe aucune obligation fiduciaire dans l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du ministre pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 58(3). De plus, l\u2019exercice unilat\u00e9ral du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire ne serait pas judicieux et annulerait l\u2019objet du paragraphe 58(3), qui vise \u00e0 faciliter la location de terres par des propri\u00e9taires fonciers individuels indiens qui y voient un avantage (voir Boyer, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9).\n56. La demande de bail minist\u00e9riel des plaignants \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur un accord de coentreprise en vertu duquel Mme Beattie construirait une maison unifamiliale sur la terre lou\u00e9e et la vendrait ensuite \u00e0 un prix et selon des modalit\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient acceptables pour M. Louie, et le produit net de la vente serait divis\u00e9 entre M. Louie et Mme Beattie. Le loyer de 1 $ n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 sur la valeur r\u00e9elle de la terre et il ne s\u2019agissait pas de l\u2019avantage que M. Louie cherchait \u00e0 obtenir dans le cadre de la coentreprise. Les avantages que M. Louie et Mme Beattie souhaitaient obtenir \u00e9taient la construction d\u2019une maison unifamiliale sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lou\u00e9e et sa vente \u00e9ventuelle. Plut\u00f4t que de se concentrer sur la demande de bail dans le contexte plus large de l\u2019accord de coentreprise, et des avantages qui en d\u00e9coulaient pour M. Louie, les agents du MAINC ont insist\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9parer un bail conform\u00e9ment aux exigences applicables du Guide de la gestion des terres, y compris des recettes de location avantageuses sur une p\u00e9riode de 49 ans \u00e9tablies en fonction d\u2019une \u00e9valuation de la terre dans son \u00e9tat am\u00e9lior\u00e9 prospectif.\n57. Le refus du MAINC d\u2019accepter le fait que M. Louie avait le droit de d\u00e9terminer les avantages dont il pourrait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de son association d\u2019affaires avec Mme Beattie a immobilis\u00e9 le processus de demande. En pratique, la demande des plaignants pour un bail minist\u00e9riel selon les modalit\u00e9s sur lesquelles ils s\u2019\u00e9taient entendus a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par le ministre dans sa lettre du 15 mai 2008 \u00e0 M. Louie. La lettre du ministre a exacerb\u00e9 le traitement discriminatoire dont le MAINC a fait preuve envers les plaignants.\nB. Les mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es [8] Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(2) de la LCDP, le Tribunal a rendu une d\u00e9cision dans laquelle il a exig\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 corrige la situation en se conformant aux cinq mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es suivantes :\n1. L\u2019intim\u00e9 examinera de nouveau les demandes de bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location des plaignants conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision et \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal;\n2. L\u2019intim\u00e9 modifiera son Guide de la gestion des terres et prendra des mesures, en collaboration avec la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, afin de rajuster ses pratiques ou d\u2019\u00e9viter que des pratiques semblables soient utilis\u00e9es;\n3. L\u2019intim\u00e9 devra modifier son Guide de la gestion des terres et toute autre politique afin de pr\u00e9voir que, lorsque des occupants individuels (sauf ceux qui sont frapp\u00e9s d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 mentale ou qui sont mineurs) ont d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par eux-m\u00eames qu\u2019une transaction sera \u00e0 leur avantage, le MAINC acceptera ce choix et proc\u00e9dera au traitement du bail demand\u00e9 en fonction de ce choix;\n4. L\u2019intim\u00e9 se conformera aux ordonnances ci-jointes dans les six mois suivant la date de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce;\n5. Le Tribunal conservera sa comp\u00e9tence et restera saisi de l\u2019affaire pendant neuf mois apr\u00e8s la date de la d\u00e9cision en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, afin de recevoir des preuves suppl\u00e9mentaires, d\u2019entendre d\u2019autres arguments ou de rendre des ordonnances suppl\u00e9mentaires si les parties ne s\u2019entendent pas au sujet de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation ou de l\u2019application des mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es.\n[9] Le paragraphe 59 de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal fait partie int\u00e9grante des mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es :\n59. Comme la Loi est maintenant assujettie \u00e0 la LCDP, je conclus que le processus de demande pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 58(3) doit devenir une fonction administrative habilitante qui reconna\u00eet et qui accepte que les Indiens inscrits (sauf ceux qui sont mineurs ou frapp\u00e9s d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 mentale) sont des Canadiens responsables qui sont capables d\u2019\u00e9valuer eux-m\u00eames les avantages qui d\u00e9couleraient de la location de leur terre et que le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire minist\u00e9riel ne doit pas \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on unilat\u00e9rale.\nII. Les faits survenus depuis la d\u00e9cision du tribunal [10] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, les agents du MAINC et les plaignants ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9examiner la demande de bail pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les plaignants en application du paragraphe 58(3).\n[11] Le 8 mars 2011, les plaignants ont fourni \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 un bail propos\u00e9, dans lequel Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine du chef du Canada \u00e9tait d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme le bailleur, mais qui ne pr\u00e9voyait ni r\u00f4les ni responsabilit\u00e9s continus pour le bailleur. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a cependant pas jug\u00e9 le bail propos\u00e9 acceptable et, le 18 mars 2011, il a fourni aux plaignants une \u00e9bauche de bail et a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle int\u00e9grait les modalit\u00e9s du bail propos\u00e9 par les plaignants dans son bail d\u2019habitation standard lorsque ces modalit\u00e9s refl\u00e9taient les renseignements figurant dans l\u2019accord de coentreprise. Le bail propos\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas acceptable aux yeux des plaignants.\n[12] Le 20 juin 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a envoy\u00e9 un courriel informant le repr\u00e9sentant des plaignants que [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] le minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada a r\u00e9examin\u00e9 la demande pour un bail d\u2019un titulaire de billet de location pour le lot 170-1, bloc quatre, plan officiel no 93082, r\u00e9serve indienne no 1 Okanagan. \u00bb Un document intitul\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab Bail \u00bb (le bail du 20 juin 2011) \u00e9tait joint au courriel et on demandait aux plaignants de le signer et de le renvoyer pour que le repr\u00e9sentant du ministre puisse le signer. Le bail du 20 juin 2011 pr\u00e9voyait un r\u00f4le continu pour Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine du chef du Canada en tant que \u00ab propri\u00e9taire \u00bb, \u00e9non\u00e7ant, entre autres choses, que le locataire devait obtenir l\u2019autorisation du propri\u00e9taire pour toute cession ou sous-location \u00e0 bail et pour tous plans d\u2019am\u00e9nagement en vue de travaux propos\u00e9s. Ce bail propos\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas acceptable pour les plaignants.\n[13] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 8 juillet 2011, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a inform\u00e9 le repr\u00e9sentant des plaignants que le bail du 20 juin 2011 constituait le r\u00e9sultat du r\u00e9examen de la demande de bail pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les plaignants qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de mesure de redressement. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a ajout\u00e9 que, bien que MAINC soit pr\u00eat \u00e0 n\u00e9gocier le bail,\n[traduction]\n[\u2026] de telles discussions n\u2019ont aucun lien avec la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, qui ne portait que sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation par l\u2019intim\u00e9 de l\u2019avantage pour le titulaire d\u2019un billet de location au cours du processus de demande de bail. Je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 discuter du bail avec vous la semaine prochaine. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, il ne fait aucun doute que l\u2019intim\u00e9 se conforme pleinement au paragraphe susmentionn\u00e9. (Un renvoi \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re mesure de redressement.)\n[14] Au cours d\u2019autres communications qui ont eu lieu le 12 juillet 2011, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a de nouveau mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait disponible pour discuter du bail du 20 juin 2011, mais que :\n[traduction]\nsi les discussions portaient sur l\u2019int\u00e9gration dans le bail d\u2019id\u00e9es figurant dans votre bail, mon client envisagera de les int\u00e9grer si elles sont fond\u00e9es. Toutefois, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, mon client s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal et ces discussions ne font pas partie de la d\u00e9cision.\n[15] Le 26 juillet 2011, les plaignants ont fourni \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 un bail semblable au bail du 8 mars 2011. Le jour suivant, les plaignants ont essay\u00e9 d\u2019enregistrer le bail dans le Registre des terres indiennes. \u00c0 l\u2019heure actuelle, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas encore approuv\u00e9 le bail vis\u00e9 au paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi ni enregistr\u00e9 le bail dans le Registre.\n[16] Quand aux autres mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es, qui enjoignent \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de mettre fin aux actes discriminatoires et de modifier son Guide de la gestion des terres, le 26 mai 2011, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) et l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont conclu un accord de mise en \u0153uvre afin de respecter les mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es.\n[17] L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation contradictoire des mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es a paralys\u00e9 le processus de conformit\u00e9. Le 20 septembre 2011, les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations \u00e9crites et des plaidoyers dans lesquels ils demandaient des \u00e9claircissements au sujet de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal et des mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es.\nIII. Analyse et pr\u00e9cisions A. Le ministre ne doit pas exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire unilat\u00e9ralement [18] Selon la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, les agents du MAINC doivent r\u00e9pondre aux besoins particuliers en mati\u00e8re de location de chaque Indien qui pr\u00e9sente une demande de bail, m\u00eame si le bail demand\u00e9 est exceptionnel ou irr\u00e9gulier.\n[19] Pour administrer les demandes de bail de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e et de fa\u00e7on judicieuse, il faut tenir compte des droits publics accord\u00e9s aux Indiens, comme il en a \u00e9t\u00e9 question dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Boyer c. R. [1986] 2 C.F. 393. (C.A.) :\n17. [...] Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, je ne crois tout simplement pas que la Couronne soit soumise \u00e0 des obligations de fiduciaire lorsqu\u2019elle exerce le pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par le paragraphe 58(3). Dans l\u2019affaire Guerin, il \u00e9tait question de terrains non attribu\u00e9s faisant partie d\u2019une r\u00e9serve, terrains qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 c\u00e9d\u00e9s \u00e0 la Couronne afin qu\u2019elle consente \u00e0 leur sujet un bail \u00e0 long terme ou vende ces terrains \u00e0 des conditions favorables \u00e0 la bande. Selon mon interpr\u00e9tation du jugement, c\u2019est \u00e0 cause de toutes ces circonstances qu\u2019il a pu \u00eatre dit qu\u2019une obligation de caract\u00e8re fiduciaire \u00e9tait n\u00e9e : en effet, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat m\u00eame de la bande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 au Ministre lors de la cession des terrains et \u00e9tait en jeu au moment de leur ali\u00e9nation. Lorsqu\u2019un bail est consenti en vertu du paragraphe 58(3), les circonstances sont enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rentes : aucune ali\u00e9nation n\u2019est envisag\u00e9e et le droit qui sera transf\u00e9r\u00e9 temporairement est le droit \u00e0 l\u2019usage d\u2019un terrain, droit qui appartient individuellement \u00e0 l\u2019Indien qui en a possession, et aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat de la bande ne peut \u00eatre touch\u00e9 (je r\u00e9p\u00e8te qu\u2019il va de soi que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat dont je parle ici a un sens technique et juridique; il est \u00e9vident que, sur le plan moral, la bande peut toujours \u00eatre concern\u00e9e par le comportement et l\u2019attitude de ses membres). Selon moi, l\u2019obligation du Ministre, lorsqu\u2019il exerce les pouvoirs qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le paragraphe 58(3), se limite, pour ainsi dire, \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9voit la loi : il ne peut exc\u00e9der le pouvoir qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9, ce qu\u2019il ferait si, sous le couvert d\u2019un bail, il proc\u00e9dait \u00e0 ce qui constituerait, \u00e0 toutes fins pratiques, une ali\u00e9nation du terrain (ce n\u2019est certainement pas le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce puisque la dur\u00e9e pr\u00e9vue pour le bail est de 21 ans et que celui-ci ne comporte aucune clause de renouvellement particuli\u00e8re); il ne peut [page 406] non plus tenir compte de consid\u00e9rations non pertinentes dans l\u2019exercice de sa discr\u00e9tion, ce qui serait le cas s\u2019il accordait de l\u2019importance \u00e0 quoi que ce soit d\u2019autre que le profit de l\u2019Indien en possession l\u00e9gitime \u00e0 la demande duquel il agit. L\u2019obligation du Ministre ne concerne tout simplement pas la bande.\n18. La conclusion me semble \u00e9vidente. Consid\u00e9rant la structure de la Loi sur les Indiens et la clart\u00e9 du libell\u00e9 de son paragraphe 58(3), il n\u2019existe aucun motif de croire que le Ministre est oblig\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir le consentement de la bande ou de son conseil avant de consentir un bail comme celui dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Il semble que cette Loi, dont l\u2019esprit paternaliste a fait l\u2019objet de tant de critiques, ait n\u00e9anmoins jug\u00e9 bon d\u2019accorder \u00e0 chaque membre de la bande une certaine autonomie, et une ind\u00e9pendance relative \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des dicta de son conseil de bande dans l\u2019exercice de son esprit d\u2019entreprise et la mise en valeur de son terrain.\n[20] De plus, le jugement dont le ministre et les agents du MAINC doivent faire preuve dans l\u2019exercice de leur pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que leur conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi se traduit par la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objet de la LCDP exprim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 2 de cette loi :\nLa pr\u00e9sente loi a pour objet de compl\u00e9ter la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet, dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada, au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\n[21] Pour ce qui est de l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que d\u00e9tient le ministre concernant l\u2019octroi d\u2019un bail vis\u00e9 au paragraphe 58(3), il importe de tenir compte du fait que le bail n\u2019entra\u00eene pas une cession de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par le bailleur (le d\u00e9tenteur d\u2019un certificat de possession) au preneur. Le bailleur demeure propri\u00e9taire de la terre pendant la dur\u00e9e du bail, sous r\u00e9serve seulement du droit du preneur de poss\u00e9der et d\u2019utiliser la terre jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date d\u2019expiration du bail. L\u2019expiration du bail entra\u00eene l\u2019application du droit r\u00e9versif du bailleur de reprendre possession de la terre.\n[22] Le MAINC affirme qu\u2019il a examin\u00e9 de nouveau la demande des plaignants. Pour d\u00e9cider si le traitement de la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une fonction administrative habilitante ou s\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 en \u00ab suiv[ant] les r\u00e8gles \u00bb, sans tenir compte des droits d\u00e9crits dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Boyer et garantis par la LCDP, il convient d\u2019examiner minutieusement le traitement de la demande faite par les plaignants pour obtenir un bail relatif \u00e0 un certificat de possession.\n[23] La d\u00e9marche adopt\u00e9e par les agents du MAINC, soit celle de \u00ab suivre les r\u00e8gles \u00bb et le fait qu\u2019ils ont insist\u00e9 sur une location \u00e0 bail, sont incompatibles avec les exigences des plaignants et constituent un exercice vexatoire du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 58(3). L\u2019expression \u00ab suivre les r\u00e8gles \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e lors d\u2019un \u00e9change entre Ken McDonald, directeur par int\u00e9rim, Services fonciers et fiduciaires de la r\u00e9gion de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, et Sheila Craig, directrice int\u00e9rimaire, Terres et d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique, MAINC, et a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit dans la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal :\nParagraphe 29\n[traduction]\nLe 8 f\u00e9vrier 2008, M. McDonald a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 M. Beattie et a envoy\u00e9 des copies \u00e0 Mme Craig, \u00e0 M. Adam et \u00e0 plusieurs autres dirigeants du MAINC dans lequel il expliquait son souvenir d\u2019un appel \u00e0 M. Adam : Nous avons bri\u00e8vement discut\u00e9 de la nature de la transaction et de ce qui \u00e9tait une question \u00e9mergente. Les occupants cherchent de plus en plus \u00e0 trouver des fa\u00e7ons d\u2019utiliser leurs terres attribu\u00e9es par certificat de possession afin d\u2019obtenir du financement pour des projets de logement. Nous avons aussi discut\u00e9 du fait que cela est \u00ab tout nouveau \u00bb et que, par cons\u00e9quent, nous nous efforcerons de travailler avec vous afin de trouver un mod\u00e8le de bail qui r\u00e9pond aux besoins de M. Louie et qui satisfait aussi aux exigences du MAINC.\nParagraphe 36\n[traduction]\nLe 7 novembre 2008, lorsque les discussions entre M. Beattie, pour le compte des plaignants, et les agents du MAINC se sont sold\u00e9es par une impasse, Mme Craig a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 M. McDonald dans lequel elle lui a demand\u00e9 de \u00ab tout lui renvoyer et de proposer une date de rencontre, puis de fermer le dossier si l\u2019impasse persistait [\u2026] \u00bb.\nParagraphe 37\n[traduction]\nLe 11 novembre 2008, M. McDonald a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 Mme Craig : \u00c7a me semble bon Sheila. En passant, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 je communiquais avec lui, je lui ai dit de rester discret et que je ferais ce que je pourrais. Vous vous souviendrez des deux d\u00e9charges, etc. Lorsqu\u2019il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9crire toutes ces lettres, nous lui avons dit que nous n\u2019avions aucune autre option que de suivre les r\u00e8gles.\nB. Les all\u00e9gations du MAINC selon lesquelles il s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance quant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re mesure de redressement [24] Le MAINC affirme qu\u2019en \u00e9tablissant le bail du 20 juin 2011, il avait [traduction] \u00ab bel et bien mis en \u0153uvre \u00bb la mesure de redressement faisant \u00e9tat du fait que la demande de bail vis\u00e9 au paragraphe 58(3) pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les plaignants devait \u00eatre examin\u00e9e \u00e0 nouveau.\n[25] Le Guide de la gestion des terres du MAINC comprend des lignes directrices g\u00e9n\u00e9rales en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9daction de baux. Une de ces lignes directrices concerne l\u2019importance des attendus et informe les agents du MAINC que les attendus doivent constituer un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des faits pertinents concernant l\u2019entente entre les parties, et qu\u2019ils figurent apr\u00e8s l\u2019identification des parties et avant les dispositions du bail. Cette directive n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9e pour ce qui est du bail du 20 juin 2011. Le bail contient plut\u00f4t un [traduction] \u00ab Contexte \u00bb de quatre phrases dans lequel il n\u2019est nullement fait mention de la coentreprise des plaignants.\n[traduction]\nLe titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la terre est d\u00e9tenu par le propri\u00e9taire pour l\u2019usage et au profit de la Premi\u00e8re Nation.\nLe propri\u00e9taire foncier, un membre de la Premi\u00e8re Nation, a la possession l\u00e9gitime de la terre, comme le montre le certificat de possession no 159390.\nAucune am\u00e9lioration n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 la terre au d\u00e9but.\nLe bail est \u00e9tabli en application du paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[26] MAINC n\u2019a pas mentionn\u00e9 dans le [traduction] \u00ab Contexte \u00bb que James Louie \u00e9tait le possesseur l\u00e9gitime de la terre qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9e, rel\u00e9guant cette pr\u00e9cision dans une liste de d\u00e9finitions figurant en annexe : [traduction] \u00ab Propri\u00e9taire foncier \u00bb : S\u2019entend de James (Jimmie) Louie et ses h\u00e9ritiers, ex\u00e9cuteurs, administrateurs, successeurs, ayants droit et autres repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux. \u00bb\n[27] Le bail du 20 juin 2011 est une location \u00e0 bail type de base renfermant des clauses qui sont incompatibles avec l\u2019accord de coentreprise des plaignants. Le MAINC ne s\u2019est pas v\u00e9ritablement efforc\u00e9 de se conformer aux mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, et cela refl\u00e8te l\u2019\u00e9troitesse d\u2019esprit et l\u2019intransigeance dont le MAINC a fait preuve dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal.\n[28] Nonobstant les observations \u00e9crites et verbales pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les MAINC le 20 septembre 2011 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle il s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, je conclus que le MAINC a continu\u00e9, en d\u00e9pit de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, de r\u00e9examiner de mani\u00e8re vexatoire et arbitraire la demande de bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les plaignants.\n[29] Cette conclusion est fond\u00e9e, en partie, sur la lettre accompagnant l\u2019\u00e9bauche de bail du 18 mars 2001 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a envoy\u00e9e au repr\u00e9sentant des plaignants, dans laquelle il est mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nNous avons examin\u00e9 votre bail et avons int\u00e9gr\u00e9 vos modalit\u00e9s dans notre bail\u2011type d\u2019habitation lorsque celles\u2011ci refl\u00e8tent les renseignements \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019accord de coentreprise et \u00e0 l\u2019audience du Tribunal. Nous avons joint une \u00e9bauche pour que vous puissiez l\u2019examiner et pour qu\u2019elle puisse constituer le point de d\u00e9part de nos discussions.\nVous comprendrez que nous avons besoin de pr\u00e9cisions concernant l\u2019usage du bien afin de pouvoir \u00e9valuer les exigences statutaires et r\u00e9glementaires obligatoires pour l\u2019octroi du bail et en discuter avec vous. [...] [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[30] La r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux [traduction] \u00ab exigences statutaires et r\u00e9glementaires obligatoires \u00bb est analys\u00e9e dans la prochaine section de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision apportant des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[31] M\u00eame si la coentreprise des plaignants a en quelque sorte \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e dans l\u2019\u00e9bauche de bail du 18 mars 2001, l\u2019affirmation selon laquelle les modalit\u00e9s de la coentreprise des plaignants sont int\u00e9gr\u00e9es dans le document est inexacte et trompeuse.\n[32] Je conclus \u00e9galement que l\u2019\u00e9bauche de bail du 18 mars 2001 a servi de mod\u00e8le pour le bail du 20 juin 2011. Les deux versions sont peut\u2011\u00eatre appropri\u00e9es lorsqu\u2019il est question d\u2019un bail \u00e0 long terme entre un propri\u00e9taire et un locataire o\u00f9 l\u2019avantage recherch\u00e9 pour l\u2019Indien qui est propri\u00e9taire de la terre est la garantie d\u2019obtenir un revenu de location \u00e0 intervalles r\u00e9guliers. Aucune des deux versions n\u2019est cependant compatible avec la coentreprise des plaignants.\n[33] Le bail du 20 juin 2011 n\u2019est pas conforme \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal et au r\u00e9examen de la demande de bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les plaignants qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 dans les mesures de redressement. Cela refl\u00e8te plut\u00f4t une attitude intransigeante et une poursuite des actes discriminatoires que les agents du MAINC ont commis lorsqu\u2019ils ont initialement trait\u00e9 la demande de bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les plaignants. Les lignes de conduite contradictoires adopt\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9 sont pr\u00e9occupantes : d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9 confirme son intention de mettre en \u0153uvre la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal afin d\u2019emp\u00eacher la perp\u00e9tration des actes discriminatoires dont les plaignants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019accord de mise en \u0153uvre conclu avec la Commission, alors que, de l\u2019autre, il permet \u00e0 ses agents des Terres en Colombie\u2011Britannique de continuer de perp\u00e9trer les actes discriminatoires initiaux.\nC. Le respect par le MAINC de l\u2019ordonnance quant aux mesures de redressement deux, trois et quatre [34] Cette incongruit\u00e9 compromet l\u2019accord de mise en \u0153uvre du 26 mai 2011 conclu entre l\u2019intim\u00e9 et la Commission. Plusieurs paragraphes sont particuli\u00e8rement pertinents quant aux \u00e9claircissements demand\u00e9s et quant \u00e0 la reprise du processus de r\u00e9examen de la demande de bail vis\u00e9 au paragraphe 58(3) pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les plaignants :\n[traduction]\n2.1 Les Services fonciers et la Commission reconnaissent que, pour emp\u00eacher la perp\u00e9tration des actes discriminatoires, il faut adopter une strat\u00e9gie proactive et syst\u00e9matique, et qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de toutes les parties de travailler ensemble pour apporter une solution quant aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination le plus rapidement possible.\n2.2 Il est admis que le pr\u00e9sent accord a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du membre du Tribunal Wallace G. Craig selon laquelle un tel accord permet de se conformer \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision.\n3. Responsabilit\u00e9s\nA. Respect de l\u2019ordonnance\n3.1 Dans les trente (30) jours suivant la date du pr\u00e9sent accord, les Services fonciers doivent donner une directive provisoire \u00e0 leur personnel selon laquelle les demandes de bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location vis\u00e9 au paragraphe 58(3) doivent \u00eatre trait\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment au point 3 du paragraphe 64 de la d\u00e9cision rendue le 26 janvier 2010 par le membre du Tribunal Wallace G. Craig, qui pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit : \u00ab [l]\u2019intim\u00e9 devra modifier son Guide de la gestion des terres et toute autre politique afin de pr\u00e9voir que, lorsque des occupants individuels (sauf ceux qui sont frapp\u00e9s d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 mentale ou qui sont mineurs) ont d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par eux-m\u00eames qu\u2019une transaction sera \u00e0 leur avantage, le MAINC acceptera ce choix et proc\u00e9dera au traitement du bail demand\u00e9 en fonction de ce choix. \u00bb Les parties conviennent que le terme \u00ab avantage \u00bb s\u2019entend d\u2019une contrepartie financi\u00e8re, s\u2019il y a lieu, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la transaction. Les parties conviennent et reconnaissent \u00e9galement que cela ne saurait retarder ou emp\u00eacher la participation obligatoire des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00e0 la modification du Guide de la gestion des terres.\n3.5 La Commission et les Services fonciers conviennent qu\u2019aucune des dispositions du pr\u00e9sent accord n\u2019a pour effet de modifier l\u2019obligation des Services fonciers d\u2019examiner de nouveau les demandes de bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location des plaignants conform\u00e9ment au point 2 du paragraphe 64 de la d\u00e9cision.\n[35] Pour se conformer \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re mesure de redressement, les agents du MAINC doivent \u00e9laborer un bail minist\u00e9riel qui concorde avec l\u2019accord de coentreprise des plaignants et qui constitue un tout harmonieux uniquement assujetti aux r\u00e8glements administratifs de la bande, et dans lequel le plaignant M. Louie est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme le bailleur, ce qui lui permet de prot\u00e9ger son int\u00e9r\u00eat dans la coentreprise dans l\u2019avenir, de m\u00eame que son droit r\u00e9versif de reprendre possession de sa terre \u00e0 l\u2019expiration du bail.\n[36] Cela remet en question la section 2.7 de la directive 7\u20111 du Guide de la gestion des terres de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et la d\u00e9signation de la Couronne comme bailleur dans le bail du 20 juin 2011 :\n2.7 Cause Obligatoire. Parce qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des deux parties d\u2019\u00eatre bien au fait de leurs obligations respectives, la plupart des baux renferment un grand nombre de dispositions traitant des rapports entre le propri\u00e9taire et le locataire. Cependant, toute entente relative \u00e0 la location d\u2019une terre doit, \u00e0 tout le moins, comprendre les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\na) le nom du bailleur (propri\u00e9taire) et du preneur (locataire). La Couronne f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9tant d\u00e9tentrice du titre juridique sur toutes les terres de r\u00e9serve, tous les baux concernant ces derni\u00e8res doivent \u00eatre conclus avec Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine du chef du Canada \u00e0 titre de bailleur, sauf dans le cas d\u2019une sous-location \u00e0 bail. Cette disposition s\u2019applique, m\u00eame lorsque le contr\u00f4le et l\u2019administration des terres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e0 une bande particuli\u00e8re conform\u00e9ment aux articles 53 ou 60 de la Loi sur les Indiens, l\u2019autorit\u00e9 d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9e doit signer le bail au nom du ministre, qui repr\u00e9sente la Couronne. Un sous-bail est, par sa nature m\u00eame, conclu entre le preneur du bail principal et le tiers sous-preneur et par cons\u00e9quent, la Couronne n\u2019y est pas partie au sous-bail; [\u2026] [Soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[37] Les auteurs du guide ont mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 quel \u00e9tait l\u2019objet vis\u00e9 lorsque le titre sur les terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour les Indiens \u00e9tait simplement transmis \u00e0 la Couronne, soit le fait que seul le titre \u00e9tait transmis \u00e0 la Couronne, pas la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. La Couronne et le gouvernement du Canada ne d\u00e9tiennent ni titre juridique, ni droit r\u00e9versif \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour les Indiens.\n[38] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mitchell c. Bande indienne Peguis, [1990] 2 R.C.S. 85 (C.S.C.), M. le juge La Forest a d\u00e9crit le droit des Indiens aux \u00ab terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es aux Indiens \u00bb comme \u00ab un droit absolu \u00bb et juste :\nDonc, si une bande indienne conclut une op\u00e9ration commerciale ordinaire, que ce soit avec une Couronne provinciale ou une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e, et acquiert des biens personnels, que ce soit sous forme de chatels ou de titres de cr\u00e9ances, comment doit\u2011on qualifier les biens en question? \u00c0 mon avis, il est illogique de les comparer aux biens qui \u00e9choient aux Indiens conform\u00e9ment aux trait\u00e9s et \u00e0 leurs accords accessoires. Les Indiens ont un droit absolu \u00e0 ces biens; ils leur sont dus en tant qu\u2019Indiens. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[39] Ce droit absolu prot\u00e8ge les terres attribu\u00e9es par les bandes \u00e0 ses membres au moyen de certificats de possession, ainsi que tous les droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui en d\u00e9coulent, dont le droit de louer la possession des terres qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9es. Un bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location ne porte pas atteinte \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 collective perp\u00e9tuelle et ultime par les Indiens de ces terres attribu\u00e9es, ou du titre de ces terres qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la Couronne pour qu\u2019elle le d\u00e9tienne en fiducie pour les Indiens.\n[40] M\u00eame si le gouvernement du Canada a l\u2019autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative exclusive sur les \u00ab Indiens et terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour les Indiens \u00bb, il doit exercer ce pouvoir en respectant les restrictions impos\u00e9es par la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s et la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[41] Lorsque les parties ont comparu devant le Tribunal le 22 septembre 2011, le processus de mise en \u0153uvre des changements au Guide de la gestion des terres n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9 dans la p\u00e9riode de six mois pr\u00e9vue pour la mise en \u0153uvre. \u00c0 la suite d\u2019une demande des parties, la p\u00e9riode a \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9e jusqu\u2019au 26 mai 2012, le Tribunal conservant sa comp\u00e9tence jusqu\u2019au 25 ao\u00fbt 2012.\nIV. La d\u00e9cision [42] Un Indien inscrit qui d\u00e9tient un certificat de possession a le droit de construire une maison sur sa terre, ou bien de la lotir et de l\u2019am\u00e9nager, sans aucune intervention du MAINC, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019une demande de bail vis\u00e9 au paragraphe 58(3) soit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au ministre. Pour accorder un tel bail, les agents du MAINC responsables de la gestion de terres doivent porter attention \u00e0 l\u2019objet de la LCDP pour s\u2019assurer que la d\u00e9cision discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019accorder ou de refuser d\u2019accorder un bail d\u00e9coule d\u2019une fonction administrative habilitante. Les Indiens ne doivent pas \u00eatre trait\u00e9s comme des suppliants. Il s\u2019agit de demandeurs qui ont parfaitement le droit de louer leurs terres et, ce faisant, de conserver le contr\u00f4le de leur int\u00e9r\u00eat dans une transaction de tenure \u00e0 bail en \u00e9tant d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme le bailleur.\n[43] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019insistance du MAINC pour que la Couronne, en fait le gouvernement du Canada, soit le bailleur, abroge le droit du plaignant M. Louie, en tant que propri\u00e9taire l\u00e9gitime de la terre qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9e par certificat de possession, de g\u00e9rer son int\u00e9r\u00eat continu dans l\u2019accord de coentreprise visant l\u2019am\u00e9nagement de sa terre.\n[44] Je consid\u00e8re comme d\u00e9nu\u00e9e de fondement l\u2019all\u00e9gation du MAINC selon laquelle il a v\u00e9ritablement r\u00e9examin\u00e9 la demande de bail d\u2019un billet de location des plaignants et il s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal et aux mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es.\n[45] Je consid\u00e8re \u00e9galement comme sans fondement l\u2019all\u00e9gation du MAINC selon laquelle, dans les mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es, il n\u2019est pas question que le Tribunal examine les diverses clauses des baux que les parties se sont \u00e9chang\u00e9s lors des discussions continues qu\u2019elles ont eu pour \u00e9tablir les modalit\u00e9s d\u2019un bail acceptable.\n[46] La d\u00e9cision du Tribunal pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal conserve sa comp\u00e9tence et reste saisi de l\u2019affaire afin de pouvoir prendre les mesures n\u00e9cessaires si les parties ne s\u2019entendent pas au sujet de l\u2019application des mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es. Dans la d\u00e9cision Grover c. Canada (Conseil national de recherches) (1994), 80 F.T.R. 256 (C.F.) (paragraphe 33), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a express\u00e9ment reconnu que ce pouvoir faisait partie des vastes pouvoirs de redressement \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la LCDP que poss\u00e8de le Tribunal\n[47] Il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de se conformer \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal et de recommencer le traitement de la demande de bail vis\u00e9 au paragraphe 58(3) pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les plaignants, et ce, conform\u00e9ment aux directives et aux instructions donn\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision que le Tribunal a rendue en 2011 et dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nSign\u00e9e par\nWallace G.

Le contexte [1] Dans la d\u00e9cision Heather Lynn Grant c. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2012 TCDP 10 [Grant], le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) a conclu que la plainte que Mme Grant, la plaignante, avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre Manitoba Telecom Services Inc. (l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou MTS) en vertu de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H\u20116 (la Loi), \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e. Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de verser \u00e0 la plaignante une indemnit\u00e9 d\u2019un montant de 10 000 $ au titre du pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019elle avait subi par suite de l\u2019acte discriminatoire commis, ainsi qu\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 d\u2019un montant de 10 000 $ pour avoir commis cet acte de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e (voir la d\u00e9cision Grant, aux paragraphes 132 et 133). Il lui a \u00e9galement ordonn\u00e9 de s\u2019efforcer, avec le concours de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission), de renseigner les membres de la haute direction sur l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement et d\u2019\u00e9tablir des politiques appropri\u00e9es \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard (voir la d\u00e9cision Grant, aux paragraphes 130 et 134).\n[2] La plaignante a \u00e9galement sollicit\u00e9 des mesures de redressement concernant sa r\u00e9int\u00e9gration dans ses fonctions aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la perte de salaire, la perte de cotisations de retraite, la perte d\u2019autres prestations, les d\u00e9penses et les co\u00fbts qu\u2019elle avait support\u00e9s, de m\u00eame que les int\u00e9r\u00eats y aff\u00e9rents. Dans la d\u00e9cision Grant, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 aux parties de lui pr\u00e9senter d\u2019autres observations et \u00e9claircissements sur ces mesures de redressement et a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il demeurerait saisi de l\u2019affaire jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que les parties aient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ces observations et ces \u00e9claircissements (voir la d\u00e9cision Grant, aux paragraphes 135 et 136).\n[3] Le 10 juillet 2012, une audience a eu lieu sous forme de conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique en vue d\u2019obtenir des parties des \u00e9claircissements additionnels sur leurs observations concernant les mesures de redressement en suspens.\n[4] Voici la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal concernant les mesures de redressement en suspens qui d\u00e9coulaient de la d\u00e9cision Grant.\nII. Les mesures de redressement en suspens A. La r\u00e9int\u00e9gration dans les fonctions [5] La plaignante souhaite \u00eatre r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9e dans ses fonctions au m\u00eame endroit, ou \u00e0 un poste cot\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e9quivalente au m\u00eame endroit.\n[6] Conform\u00e9ment au raisonnement expos\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision McAvinn c. Strait Crossing Bridge Ltd. D.T. 13\/01 (TCDP), la plaignante mentionne que s\u2019il existe une \u00ab s\u00e9rieuse possibilit\u00e9 \u00bb qu\u2019elle ait conserv\u00e9 son emploi, le Tribunal doit dans ce cas ordonner sa r\u00e9int\u00e9gration. Cependant, m\u00eame si cette possibilit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre un \u00e9l\u00e9ment \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration pour d\u00e9terminer la mesure de redressement qui convient en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il ne s\u2019agit pas du seul. Une d\u00e9marche aussi restrictive priverait le Tribunal du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de redressement dont il dispose pour concevoir une mesure de redressement appropri\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi. Une fois qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que la plainte est fond\u00e9e, l\u2019objectif que l\u2019on vise en rendant une ordonnance en vertu du paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi est, dans toute la mesure du possible, d\u2019indemniser pleinement la partie plaignante. Il faut pour cela que le Tribunal exerce son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de redressement en ob\u00e9issant \u00e0 des principes, en tenant compte du lien qui existe entre l\u2019acte discriminatoire commis et la perte all\u00e9gu\u00e9e (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 268, au paragraphe 37 [Chopra]). Autrement dit, le Tribunal doit exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en mati\u00e8re de redressement de mani\u00e8re raisonnable, eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019affaire ainsi qu\u2019aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s (Hughes c. \u00c9lections Canada, 2010 TCDP 4, au paragraphe 50).\n[7] Dans la d\u00e9cision Grant, le Tribunal a conclu qu\u2019on avait \u00e9valu\u00e9 le rendement au travail de la plaignante sans prendre s\u00e9rieusement en compte les effets de sa d\u00e9ficience sur son rendement. L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019\u00e9tait servie des appr\u00e9ciations du rendement de la plaignante pour comparer cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 une autre employ\u00e9e, Sharon Horner, dans le but de d\u00e9cider laquelle des deux serait licenci\u00e9e. Sur ce fondement, le Tribunal a conclu que la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante avait jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision prise par l\u2019intim\u00e9e de ne plus la garder \u00e0 son service. Cependant, m\u00eame si le Tribunal a conclu qu\u2019il y avait un lien entre le rendement et l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation n\u00e9gative du rendement de la plaignante, la d\u00e9ficience de cette derni\u00e8re et son licenciement, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9taient pas suffisants pour que le Tribunal puisse maintenant revenir en arri\u00e8re et appr\u00e9cier quel aurait r\u00e9ellement \u00e9t\u00e9 le rendement de la plaignante si l\u2019on avait tenu compte de sa d\u00e9ficience. Le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas non plus en main suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant le rendement de Sharon Horner. Pour comparer les deux employ\u00e9es avant le licenciement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas seulement utilis\u00e9 les appr\u00e9ciations du rendement; elle a aussi interrog\u00e9 leurs gestionnaires. La gestionnaire de Sharon Horner n\u2019a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal, pas plus que Sharon Horner. Sans ces informations, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas en mesure aussi d\u2019appr\u00e9cier \u00e0 nouveau les deux candidates au licenciement et de d\u00e9cider laquelle il aurait fallu licencier; il ne conviendrait pas non plus de le faire eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 54(2)a) de la Loi et de la conclusion du Tribunal selon laquelle il n\u2019existait aucune preuve prima facie d\u2019animosit\u00e9 discriminatoire dans la d\u00e9cision prise par l\u2019intim\u00e9e de licencier des employ\u00e9s (voir la d\u00e9cision Grant, aux paragraphes 44 \u00e0 47). Ce que le Tribunal tente de redresser dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est plut\u00f4t, selon moi, la chance qu\u2019a perdue la plaignante de faire appr\u00e9cier son rendement de mani\u00e8re non discriminatoire et, par cons\u00e9quent, la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait, tout comme une autre candidate, de conserver l\u2019emploi qu\u2019elle exer\u00e7ait aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. La difficult\u00e9 que pose la conception d\u2019une mesure de redressement appropri\u00e9e dans le cas pr\u00e9sent r\u00e9side dans le fait que, ind\u00e9pendamment de l\u2019acte discriminatoire commis, il y avait au moins une possibilit\u00e9 de 50 % qu\u2019on aurait licenci\u00e9 la plaignante de toute fa\u00e7on. C\u2019est l\u00e0 un point important dont il faut tenir compte pour d\u00e9cider si, dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration est une mesure appropri\u00e9e et ce point, de pair avec les autres motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 croire qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas raisonnable d\u2019ordonner que la plaignante soit r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9e dans ses fonctions.\nB. La perte de salaire [8] La plaignante sollicite une indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire. Au moment de son licenciement, elle a re\u00e7u une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part : deux semaines de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour chaque ann\u00e9e de service aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, soit un montant total de 62 000 $. Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 licenci\u00e9e en f\u00e9vrier 2007, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 sans travail pendant quelques mois. Elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 exercer un nouvel emploi en octobre 2007, et elle travaille r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement depuis ce temps. Les d\u00e9clarations de revenus de la plaignante pour 2006 \u00e0 2009 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal et ces d\u00e9clarations indiquent que le revenu de la plaignante a augment\u00e9 au cours des ann\u00e9es suivant la date o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019a licenci\u00e9e.\n[9] La plaignante soutient qu\u2019il lui a fallu accomplir un plus grand nombre d\u2019heures de travail pour gagner le m\u00eame revenu qu\u2019elle aurait touch\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de MTS. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, elle n\u2019a pas conserv\u00e9 ses bordereaux de paie, mais elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal un tableau qu\u2019elle a \u00e9tabli avec son syndicat et qui pr\u00e9sente la diff\u00e9rence, sur une base horaire, entre le montant qu\u2019elle a gagn\u00e9 dans ses nouveaux postes et le montant qu\u2019elle aurait touch\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de MTS entre les ann\u00e9es 2007 et 2010. Ce tableau n\u2019inclut pas de dates, pas plus qu\u2019il n\u2019indique ses heures de travail, mais il g\u00e9n\u00e9ralise ses gains sur une base annuelle. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante a tent\u00e9 d\u2019expliquer le raisonnement qui sous-tendait les calculs contenus dans le tableau, mais elle n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019autres preuves \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ces chiffres. En se fondant sur le tableau, et en disant qu\u2019elle a accompli un plus grand nombre d\u2019heures de travail, la plaignante demande au Tribunal de conclure qu\u2019elle a subi une perte de salaire. \u00c0 l\u2019audience du 10 juillet 2012, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019\u00e9claircir sa pr\u00e9tention de perte de salaire fond\u00e9e sur le fait qu\u2019elle avait accompli un plus grand nombre d\u2019heures de travail pour toucher la m\u00eame r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, ainsi que d\u2019\u00e9tayer cette pr\u00e9tention \u00e0 l\u2019aide de d\u00e9cisions jurisprudentielles et des dispositions de la Loi. Elle a r\u00e9pondu que m\u00eame si l\u2019on d\u00e9termine habituellement la perte de salaire \u00e0 partir du revenu annuel brut, plut\u00f4t que sur une base horaire, le Tribunal se devait de souscrire aux calculs qu\u2019elle avait faits au sujet de sa perte de salaire en se fondant sur une approche g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et lib\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la Loi, voire dans les limites d\u2019une approche litt\u00e9rale relativement \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des dispositions de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c). J\u2019admets que cet alin\u00e9a ne pr\u00e9cise pas comment calculer la perte de salaire, mais cela ne change rien au fait que le Tribunal doit tirer la conclusion qui s\u2019impose au mieux de ses comp\u00e9tences, en se fondant sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s. Les calculs de la perte de salaire que la plaignante a faits sur une base horaire, de m\u00eame que les explications connexes, \u00e9taient vagues et non \u00e9tay\u00e9s\npar des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suffisants pour permettre au Tribunal de conclure qu\u2019elle avait subi une perte de salaire ou n\u2019avait pu att\u00e9nuer les dommages subis \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. J\u2019ajouterais que le principe de l\u2019att\u00e9nuation des dommages repose sur la pr\u00e9misse suivante :\n[\u2026] La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 encourager l\u2019efficience \u00e9conomique en exigeant que les personnes qui ont subi des pertes prennent des mesures pour minimiser leur perte, puisqu\u2019il n\u2019est pas dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de permettre que des membres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 maximisent leur perte au d\u00e9triment d\u2019autres personnes, m\u00eame ci celles-ci sont responsables de la perte [\u2026].\n(Voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Chopra, au paragraphe 40).\n[10] Il est difficile de souscrire \u00e0 l\u2019argument de la plaignante selon lequel elle a subi une perte de salaire compte tenu de ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus officielles et du principe de l\u2019att\u00e9nuation des dommages. De ce fait, je conclus que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part que la plaignante a re\u00e7ue de l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait plus que compenser la perte qu\u2019elle a subie au cours de sa p\u00e9riode d\u2019absence de travail et que les d\u00e9clarations de revenus applicables aux ann\u00e9es post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 son licenciement de MTS indiquent qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas subi de perte de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, comparativement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle aurait gagn\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de MTS. Pour ces motifs, je ne crois pas qu\u2019il soit raisonnable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u2019ordonner l\u2019octroi d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire.\n[11] La plaignante pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement avoir subi une perte li\u00e9e au r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration variable et au r\u00e9gime des primes vers\u00e9es relativement aux ventes de groupe de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Cependant, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les renseignements que les parties ont fournis sur ces deux r\u00e9gimes, je conviens avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e que le r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration variable et celui des primes vers\u00e9es relativement aux ventes de groupe font partie de la perte de salaire de la plaignante. Il s\u2019agit de primes qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 incluses dans son revenu. Ayant conclu que la plaignante a att\u00e9nu\u00e9 sa perte de salaire, je n\u2019accorde pas d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 au titre du r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration variable ou du r\u00e9gime des primes vers\u00e9es relativement aux ventes de groupe.\nC. La pension [12] La plaignante sollicite une indemnit\u00e9 pour les cotisations de retraite perdues. Elle soutient que, compte tenu de l\u2019\u00e2ge et des ann\u00e9es de service qu\u2019elle avait au moment de son licenciement, la perte de sa pension a eu pour elle de graves cons\u00e9quences. Les parties ont reconnu que la plaignante ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie plus d\u2019un r\u00e9gime de retraite aupr\u00e8s de son nouvel employeur. Selon la plaignante, il lui faudra maintenant effectuer beaucoup plus d\u2019ann\u00e9es de travail qu\u2019il ne lui en aurait fallu aupr\u00e8s de MTS pour subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins dans l\u2019avenir et au moment de la retraite.\n[13] L\u2019intim\u00e9e est d\u2019avis que toute perte qu\u2019all\u00e8gue la plaignante par rapport \u00e0 sa pension doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e de pair avec sa perte de salaire. Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir d\u2019indemniser les victimes d\u2019acte discriminatoire de toute perte de salaire. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 la victime d\u2019un acte discriminatoire les \u00ab avantages \u00bb dont cet acte l\u2019a priv\u00e9e. Une pension est un avantage de retraite qui, m\u00eame s\u2019il est souvent calcul\u00e9 ou si l\u2019on y cotise en fonction du salaire d\u2019un employ\u00e9, ne fait pas partie de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de cet employ\u00e9. Ce ne sont pas tous les employeurs qui offrent un programme de retraite, et ce dernier peut \u00eatre une importante mesure d\u2019encouragement \u00e0 l\u2019emploi. En ce sens, je crois qu\u2019un tel programme peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 plus justement comme un \u00ab avantage \u00bb, plut\u00f4t que comme un \u00e9l\u00e9ment inclus dans la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration d\u2019un employ\u00e9. Le Tribunal a adopt\u00e9 une approche semblable pour d\u00e9terminer des mesures de redressement en mati\u00e8re de pension dans la d\u00e9cision Levac c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, D.T.2\/95 (TCDP), une affaire dans laquelle une indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e.\n[14] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, \u00e0 cause de l\u2019acte discriminatoire commis par l\u2019intim\u00e9e la plaignante a perdu une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019au moins 50 % de conserver son emploi aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ainsi que des prestations de retraite y aff\u00e9rentes. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la Loi, la plaignante s\u2019est vue priv\u00e9e de la possibilit\u00e9 de conserver l\u2019avantage de ces prestations en raison de l\u2019acte discriminatoire commis. Pour cette raison, il faudrait maintenant mettre \u00e0 sa disposition une partie des prestations de retraite perdues. \u00c0 l\u2019instar du raisonnement expos\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Shiv Chopra c. Sant\u00e9 Canada, 2004 TCDP 27, o\u00f9 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 divis\u00e9e par trois en vue de tenir compte du nombre de candidats int\u00e9ress\u00e9s par le poste dont, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le Tribunal, la victime de discrimination avait \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e, je crois qu\u2019il convient pareillement en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de r\u00e9duire de 50 % les cotisations de retraite perdues au cours de la p\u00e9riode qui a suivi le licenciement de la plaignante afin de tenir compte du fait que celle-ci n\u2019a pas perdu son emploi par suite d\u2019un acte discriminatoire, mais a plut\u00f4t perdu la possibilit\u00e9 de conserver son emploi par rapport \u00e0 une autre candidate.\n[15] Compte tenu des motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, et par souci non pas de sanctionner l\u2019intim\u00e9e, mais, dans toute la mesure du possible, d\u2019indemniser pleinement la plaignante en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la Loi, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de replacer les prestations de retraite de la plaignante dans la situation o\u00f9 elles se trouvaient au moment du licenciement. Pour la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9tendant entre la date du licenciement et la date d\u2019application des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, l\u2019intim\u00e9e contribuera au r\u00e9gime de retraite de la plaignante la moiti\u00e9 des cotisations qu\u2019elle aurait effectu\u00e9es au cours de cette p\u00e9riode si la plaignante \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e \u00e0 son service. S\u2019il est impossible de r\u00e9tablir le r\u00e9gime de retraite ant\u00e9rieur, il faudra prendre les dispositions n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9tablir les prestations de retraite perdues, de la mani\u00e8re d\u00e9crite ci-dessus, dans un r\u00e9gime ou un programme comparable en veillant \u00e0 ce que la plaignante puisse recevoir des prestations de retraite comparables \u00e0 celles qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7ues par l\u2019entremise de MTS. Compte tenu des difficult\u00e9s et des consid\u00e9rations qui peuvent entrer en jeu dans la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019application de cette ordonnance, compte tenu du manque de preuves permettant de d\u00e9terminer le mieux possible l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, compte tenu de l\u2019admission des parties selon laquelle il faudra peut-\u00eatre recourir aux services d\u2019un actuaire pour effectuer ces calculs de retraite, et compte tenu du fait que les preuves qui m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es pour faire ces calculs sont insuffisantes, je laisserai donc d\u2019abord aux parties le soin de r\u00e9gler les d\u00e9tails des prestations de retraite perdues de la plaignante dans le cadre des param\u00e8tres susmentionn\u00e9s. Je demeurerai saisie de l\u2019affaire au cas o\u00f9 les parties ne parviendraient pas \u00e0 s\u2019entendre \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nD. Le r\u00e9gime d\u2019actionnariat des employ\u00e9s [16] La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir pris part au r\u00e9gime d\u2019actionnariat des employ\u00e9s. MTS est une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 publique qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un r\u00e9gime dans le cadre duquel les employ\u00e9s peuvent contribuer de 4 % \u00e0 6 % de leur revenu en investissant dans des actions de l\u2019entreprise. La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle contribuait 4 % de son revenu \u00e0 ce r\u00e9gime et que MTS effectuait une quote-part parall\u00e8le \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 1 % de ce revenu. La plaignante estime que si elle \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e au service de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la quote-part de cette derni\u00e8re aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019environ 2 441,06 $. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ne conteste pas ce calcul, mais elle soutient une fois de plus que ce montant doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 plus justement comme un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et que la plaignante a att\u00e9nu\u00e9 sa perte de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Je crois que le r\u00e9gime d\u2019actionnariat des employ\u00e9s, \u00e0 l\u2019instar d\u2019une pension, peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 plus justement comme un \u00ab avantage \u00bb au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la Loi, plut\u00f4t que comme un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de l\u2019employ\u00e9. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un fonds de placement, offert par l\u2019employeur, auquel les employ\u00e9s contribuent durant leur p\u00e9riode d\u2019emploi et dont ils b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure. En appliquant le m\u00eame raisonnement que celui que j\u2019ai suivi pour calculer la perte de pension de la plaignante, \u00e0 savoir que cette derni\u00e8re avait une chance de 50 % de conserver son poste, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de replacer le r\u00e9gime d\u2019actionnariat des employ\u00e9s de la plaignante dans la situation o\u00f9 il se trouvait au moment du licenciement. Pour la p\u00e9riode qui s\u2019\u00e9tend entre la date du licenciement et celle de l\u2019application des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, l\u2019intim\u00e9e contribuera au r\u00e9gime d\u2019actionnariat de la plaignante la moiti\u00e9 des cotisations qu\u2019elle aurait faites au cours de cette p\u00e9riode si la plaignante \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e \u00e0 son service. S\u2019il est impossible de r\u00e9tablir le r\u00e9gime d\u2019actionnariat ant\u00e9rieur, il faudra prendre les dispositions n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9tablir les prestations perdues, de la mani\u00e8re d\u00e9crite plus t\u00f4t, dans un r\u00e9gime ou un programme comparable en veillant \u00e0 ce que la plaignante puisse recevoir les prestations du r\u00e9gime d\u2019une mani\u00e8re comparable \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7u par l\u2019entremise de MTS. Compte tenu, d\u2019une part, des difficult\u00e9s et des consid\u00e9rations qui peuvent entrer en jeu dans la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019application de cette ordonnance et, d\u2019autre part, du manque de preuves qui permettraient au Tribunal de d\u00e9terminer de la meilleure fa\u00e7on possible l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, je laisserai donc tout d\u2019abord aux parties le soin de r\u00e9gler les d\u00e9tails de la perte des prestations du r\u00e9gime d\u2019actionnariat de la plaignante, conform\u00e9ment aux param\u00e8tres expos\u00e9s plus t\u00f4t. Je demeurerai saisie de l\u2019affaire au cas o\u00f9 les parties ne parviendraient pas \u00e0 s\u2019entendre \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nE. Les autres d\u00e9penses [17] Conform\u00e9ment au r\u00e9gime de prestations de MTS, la plaignante demande qu\u2019on lui rembourse diverses d\u00e9penses qu\u2019il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de recouvrer \u00e0 la suite de son licenciement ainsi qu\u2019au cours de la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9sente plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e. La plaignante a support\u00e9 des frais de m\u00e9dicaments d\u2019un montant de 282,61 $, des frais de services dentaires d\u2019un montant de 147,40 $ ainsi que des frais de services d\u2019orthodontie d\u2019un montant de 4 500 $. Selon le r\u00e9gime d\u2019assurance dentaire de MTS, les soins dentaires ordinaires sont assur\u00e9s \u00e0 100 % jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence d\u2019un montant de 1 250 $ par ann\u00e9e, et les services d\u2019orthodontie sont assur\u00e9s \u00e0 50 %, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence d\u2019un montant de 1 000 $ par ann\u00e9e. La plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle aurait demand\u00e9 le remboursement des d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es aux services d\u2019orthodontie sur deux ans, soit un montant total de 1 000 $ chaque ann\u00e9e. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 ce montant. Si j\u2019applique le m\u00eame raisonnement que celui que j\u2019ai suivi pour calculer les prestations de retraite de la plaignante, \u00e0 savoir que cette derni\u00e8re avait une chance de 50 % de conserver son emploi, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de payer la somme de 1 000 $ pour rembourser la moiti\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es aux services d\u2019orthodontie et la somme de 73,70 $ pour rembourser la moiti\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es aux services dentaires. On ne m\u2019a pas fourni assez de preuves pour d\u00e9terminer quel aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le montant de l\u2019assurance couvrant le co\u00fbt des m\u00e9dicaments, mais l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas non plus contest\u00e9 le montant d\u00e9clar\u00e9. J\u2019ordonne donc \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re de payer la somme de 141,31 $, qui repr\u00e9sente la moiti\u00e9 du co\u00fbt des m\u00e9dicaments.\n[18] La plaignante sollicite \u00e9galement une indemnit\u00e9 compensant les frais qu\u2019elle a support\u00e9s pour suivre un cours de conduite de camion de classe 1. Ce cours co\u00fbte 4 800 $, mais elle ne r\u00e9clame que la somme de 1 200 $, car le solde a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 par un programme gouvernemental. Je suis convaincue que cette d\u00e9pense a \u00e9t\u00e9 support\u00e9e par suite de l\u2019acte discriminatoire commis. \u00c0 la suite de son licenciement, la plaignante a suivi ce cours afin d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir les comp\u00e9tences n\u00e9cessaires pour trouver du travail dans un autre domaine. En appliquant le m\u00eame raisonnement que celui que j\u2019ai suivi pour calculer les pertes de pension de la plaignante, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019elle avait une chance de 50 % de conserver son emploi, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de payer la somme de 600 $ en vue de rembourser la moiti\u00e9 du co\u00fbt du cours de formation.\n[19] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c), j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de verser \u00e0 la plaignante une indemnit\u00e9 totale de 1 815,01 $ au titre des d\u00e9penses qu\u2019elle a support\u00e9es par suite de l\u2019acte discriminatoire commis.\nF. Les d\u00e9pens [20] La plaignante sollicite une indemnit\u00e9 pour les d\u00e9penses qu\u2019elle a support\u00e9es dans le cadre de l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, et elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un tableau de d\u00e9penses \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019audience du 10 juillet 2012. Elle sollicite la somme de 2 000 $ au titre de l\u2019h\u00e9bergement, des repas, du stationnement et des d\u00e9placements. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CSC 53 [Mowat], la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a conclu qu\u2019il ressort clairement du texte, du contexte et de l\u2019objet de la Loi que le Tribunal n\u2019est pas habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 adjuger des d\u00e9pens. Selon le raisonnement expos\u00e9 dans cet arr\u00eat, et compte tenu du fait qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun lien entre les types particuliers d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019article 53 et les d\u00e9pens que r\u00e9clame la plaignante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je ne puis voir dans la Loi une source quelconque qui autoriserait le Tribunal \u00e0 accorder une indemnit\u00e9 pour les d\u00e9penses support\u00e9es par la plaignante relativement \u00e0 l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. De ce fait, aucune indemnit\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e pour ces d\u00e9pens.\nG. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats [21] Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi, la plaignante sollicite des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur toute indemnit\u00e9 qu\u2019accorderait le Tribunal. J\u2019accorderai de ce fait des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es, au taux en vigueur de la Banque du Canada, comme suit :\n\u2022 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral et pour dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats sp\u00e9ciaux inclura des int\u00e9r\u00eats calcul\u00e9s \u00e0 compter de la date du licenciement de la plaignante jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision;\n\u2022 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 relative aux services d\u2019orthodontie inclura des int\u00e9r\u00eats calcul\u00e9s \u00e0 compter du mois d\u2019octobre 2010, date \u00e0 laquelle la plaignante a fait le dernier paiement relatif \u00e0 cette d\u00e9pense, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision;\n\u2022 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 relative aux services dentaires inclura des int\u00e9r\u00eats calcul\u00e9s \u00e0 compter du mois de f\u00e9vrier 2008, date \u00e0 laquelle la plaignante a fait le dernier paiement relatif \u00e0 cette d\u00e9pense, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision;\n\u2022 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 relative aux d\u00e9penses de m\u00e9dicaments inclura des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 compter du mois d\u2019avril 2008, date \u00e0 laquelle la plaignante a fait le dernier paiement relatif \u00e0 cette d\u00e9pense, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision;\n\u2022 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 relative au cours de formation inclura des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 compter du mois de juillet 2007, date \u00e0 laquelle la plaignante a fait la d\u00e9pense, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nJe signale que les mesures de redressement li\u00e9es \u00e0 la pension de retraite et au r\u00e9gime d\u2019actionnariat de la plaignante ne sont pas des paiements d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 car elles ont pour but de r\u00e9tablir un avantage suivant l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la Loi.\nIII. L\u2019ordonnance [22] Apr\u00e8s avoir conclu que la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Grant est fond\u00e9e, et compte tenu des motifs du Tribunal au sujet des mesures de redressement en suspens dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question plus t\u00f4t, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019intim\u00e9e englobe tout ce qui suit :\n\u2022 L\u2019intim\u00e9e replacera les prestations de retraite de la plaignante dans la situation o\u00f9 elles se trouvaient au moment du licenciement. Pour la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9tendant entre la date du licenciement et celle de l\u2019application des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, l\u2019intim\u00e9e contribuera au r\u00e9gime de pension la moiti\u00e9 des cotisations de retraite qu\u2019elle aurait faites au cours de cette p\u00e9riode si la plaignante \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e \u00e0 son service. S\u2019il est impossible de r\u00e9tablir le r\u00e9gime de retraite ant\u00e9rieur, il faudra prendre les dispositions n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9tablir les prestations de retraite perdues, de la mani\u00e8re d\u00e9crite plus t\u00f4t, dans un r\u00e9gime ou un programme comparable en veillant \u00e0 ce que la plaignante puisse toucher des prestations de retraite qui se comparent \u00e0 celles qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7ues par l\u2019entremise de MTS. Je laisserai d\u2019abord aux parties le soin de r\u00e9gler les d\u00e9tails des prestations de retraite que la plaignante a perdues, conform\u00e9ment aux param\u00e8tres indiqu\u00e9s dans mes motifs.\n\u2022 L\u2019intim\u00e9e replacera le r\u00e9gime d\u2019actionnariat des employ\u00e9s de la plaignante dans la situation o\u00f9 il se trouvait au moment o\u00f9 celle-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e. Pour la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9tendant entre la date du cong\u00e9diement et celle de l\u2019application des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, l\u2019intim\u00e9e contribuera au r\u00e9gime d\u2019actionnariat des employ\u00e9s de la plaignante la moiti\u00e9 des cotisations qu\u2019elle aurait faites durant cette p\u00e9riode si la plaignante \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e \u00e0 son service. S\u2019il est impossible de r\u00e9tablir le r\u00e9gime d\u2019actionnariat des employ\u00e9s ant\u00e9rieurs, il faudra prendre les dispositions n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9tablir les prestations perdues, de la mani\u00e8re d\u00e9crite plus t\u00f4t, dans un r\u00e9gime ou un programme comparable, en veillant \u00e0 ce que la plaignante puisse toucher les prestations du r\u00e9gime d\u2019une mani\u00e8re comparable \u00e0 celles qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7ues par l\u2019entremise de MTS. Je laisserai d\u2019abord aux parties le soin de r\u00e9gler les d\u00e9tails des prestations du r\u00e9gime d\u2019actionnariat des employ\u00e9s que la plaignante a perdues conform\u00e9ment aux param\u00e8tres indiqu\u00e9s dans mes motifs.\n\u2022 L\u2019intim\u00e9e paiera \u00e0 la plaignante une indemnit\u00e9 totale de 1 815,01 $ au titre des d\u00e9penses qu\u2019elle a support\u00e9es par suite de l\u2019acte discriminatoire commis. Elle paiera des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur cette somme, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions d\u00e9crites plus t\u00f4t dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs.\n\u2022 L\u2019intim\u00e9e paiera \u00e0 la plaignante une indemnit\u00e9 d\u2019un montant de 10 000 $ pour le pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019elle a subi par suite de l\u2019acte discriminatoire commis. L\u2019intim\u00e9e paiera des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur cette somme \u00e0 compter de la date du licenciement de la plaignante jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n\u2022 L\u2019intim\u00e9e paiera \u00e0 la plaignante une indemnit\u00e9 d\u2019un montant de 10 000 $ pour avoir commis l\u2019acte discriminatoire en question de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e. Elle paiera des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur cette somme \u00e0 compter de la date du licenciement de la plaignante jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n\u2022 L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019efforcera, de pair avec la Commission, de renseigner les membres de sa haute direction, comme les directeurs et les chefs du service des relations de travail, sur l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement ainsi que sur la LCDP. L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019efforcera, de pair avec la Commission, de veiller \u00e0 disposer d\u2019une politique appropri\u00e9e sur l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement et, sinon, elle en \u00e9tablira une ou modifiera sa politique actuelle. Elle consultera les syndicats dans le cadre de ce processus afin de tenir compte du point de vue des employ\u00e9s. Cette mesure de redressement sera ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[23] Je demeurerai saisie de l\u2019affaire au cas o\u00f9 les parties ne parviendraient pas \u00e0 s\u2019entendre sur le r\u00e9tablissement du r\u00e9gime de retraite et du r\u00e9gime d\u2019actionnariat des employ\u00e9s de la plaignante, et au cas o\u00f9 les parties auraient besoin de plus d\u2019\u00e9claircissements sur la mesure de redressement relative aux activit\u00e9s de formation et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019une politique.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nJuge administrative\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 20 septembre 2012\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal: T1452\/7809\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause: Heather Lynn Grant c.

Les plaintes [1] En janvier 2008 et en juin 2009, Chris Hughes a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP) contre Ressources humaines et D\u00e9veloppement des comp\u00e9tences Canada (Ressources humaines et D\u00e9veloppement social canada \u2013 RHDSC \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 les faits se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s). La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a enqu\u00eat\u00e9 sur ces plaintes et les a renvoy\u00e9es devant le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) pour instruction le 24 juin 2011.\n[2] Wallace Craig, membre instructeur, a instruit ces plaintes \u00e0 Victoria (Colombie\u2011Britannique) du 23 au 25 mai, du 28 mai au 1er juin et les 13 et 14 juin 2012.\n[3] Dans sa premi\u00e8re plainte, pi\u00e8ce C-1, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission le 27 janvier 2008, M. Hughes a pr\u00e9tendu qu\u2019entre mars 2006 et janvier 2008, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un acte discriminatoire en contravention de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP. M. Hughes a soutenu que RHDSC refusait de l\u2019employer parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience : la d\u00e9pression.\n[4] Dans sa seconde plainte, pi\u00e8ce C-2, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission le 11 juin 2009, M. Hughes a pr\u00e9tendu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre lui depuis le d\u00e9but de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2008, en contravention de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP, et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait toujours victime de discrimination au sens de l\u2019article 7.\nB. Les articles pertinents de la LCDP [5] L\u2019article 3 est ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9 :\n3. (1) Pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n[6] L\u2019article 7 est ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9 :\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\n[\u2026]\n[7] L\u2019article 14.1 est ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9 :\n14.1 Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\nC. La norme de preuve et l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 [8] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat F.H. c. McDougall, 2008 CSC 53, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a clarifi\u00e9 le droit en ce qui concerne la norme de preuve applicable dans les instances civiles : la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, ni plus ni moins.\n[9] La preuve doit \u00eatre claire et convaincante pour satisfaire au crit\u00e8re de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s.\n[10] La Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le juge du proc\u00e8s ne devait pas consid\u00e9rer le t\u00e9moignage du demandeur en vase clos, mais qu\u2019il devait plut\u00f4t examiner l\u2019ensemble de la preuve et d\u00e9terminer l\u2019incidence des contradictions sur les questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 touchant au c\u0153ur du litige.\n[11] \u00c0 la page 56 de l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c.

De plus, pour expliquer en d\u00e9tail pourquoi un t\u00e9moignage a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9, il se peut que le juge doive tenir des propos peu flatteurs sur le t\u00e9moin. [\u2026] Bref, l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 est un exercice difficile et d\u00e9licat qui ne se pr\u00eate pas toujours \u00e0 une \u00e9nonciation compl\u00e8te et pr\u00e9cise.\nEn fin de compte, ajouter foi \u00e0 un t\u00e9moignage et non \u00e0 un autre est affaire de jugement (paragraphe 76 \u2013 arr\u00eat McDougall).\n[12] Les \u00e9claircissements que la Cour supr\u00eame a apport\u00e9s au sujet de la norme de preuve et de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 sont conformes \u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019ouvrage de William Pentney, Discrimination and the Law (Thomson Carswell, 2006), et \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Van Berkel c.

J\u2019ai \u00e9galement examin\u00e9 la preuve sous l\u2019angle de la plausibilit\u00e9 dans les circonstances et \u00e9valu\u00e9 les motifs des t\u00e9moins. En outre, j\u2019ai port\u00e9 attention \u00e0 leur sens de l\u2019observation et \u00e0 leur m\u00e9moire, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 leur attitude et \u00e0 leur comportement sous serment, de m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont ils ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9.

M. Hughes doit d\u2019abord apporter une preuve prima facie du fait que RHDSC a contrevenu aux articles 7 et 14.1 de la LCDP. Si le plaignant arrive \u00e0 apporter une telle preuve, c\u2019est alors \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de prouver qu\u2019il n\u2019a jamais adopt\u00e9 la conduite qui fait l\u2019objet de la plainte ou que cette conduite ne constituait pas un acte discriminatoire : arr\u00eat Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 RCS 536.\nD. Le contexte [14] De 1995 \u00e0 2005, M. Hughes a \u00e9t\u00e9 un employ\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019Agence des douanes et du revenu du Canada (l\u2019ADRC), qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9e par l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (l\u2019ARC) et l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (l\u2019ASFC); il y a occup\u00e9 trois postes, lesquels sont d\u00e9crits \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce C-4 de l\u2019onglet 16 : agent de guichet d\u2019affaires, inspecteur des douanes et agent de perception.\n[15] M. Hughes est dipl\u00f4m\u00e9 de la Middlesex District High School en Ontario. Pendant qu\u2019il travaillait pour l\u2019ARC, il a poursuivi ses \u00e9tudes en suivant des cours de base de comptabilit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale au Camosun College et plusieurs cours de formation donn\u00e9s par l\u2019ARC sur le droit fiscal et les recours judiciaires. M. Hughes a ensuite \u00e9galement suivi un certain nombre de cours de formation en mati\u00e8re d\u2019application de la loi pendant qu\u2019il travaillait pour l\u2019ASFC (pi\u00e8ce C-4, onglet 16).\n[16] M. Hughes a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir, pendant ses premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es en poste, divulgu\u00e9 un incident impliquant d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ARC qui avaient suivi des proc\u00e9dures d\u2019envoi de documents incorrectes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un contribuable. M. Hughes a affirm\u00e9 s\u2019\u00eatre alors vu accoler l\u2019\u00e9tiquette de d\u00e9lateur. Il a alors d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des poursuites contre l\u2019ARC, ce qui s\u2019est sold\u00e9 par la conclusion d\u2019une entente confidentielle et le versement par l\u2019ARC d\u2019une somme d\u2019argent qui ne peut \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9e. M. Hughes a avou\u00e9 avoir souffert d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et de stress et avoir d\u00fb s\u2019absenter du travail pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales pendant cette p\u00e9riode mouvement\u00e9e.\n[17] Pendant sa premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode d\u2019emploi \u00e0 l\u2019ARC, M. Hughes est rest\u00e9 un employ\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, incapable d\u2019obtenir l\u2019emploi permanent qu\u2019il convoitait.\nII. Les arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par M. Hughes A. Les circonstances entourant les plaintes de discrimination et de repr\u00e9sailles de M. Hughes [18] Au d\u00e9but de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Hughes a identifi\u00e9 la pi\u00e8ce C-1 comme \u00e9tant la plainte de discrimination qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 27 janvier 2008, et il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sous serment que toutes les all\u00e9gations qu\u2019elle contenait \u00e9taient vraies. La plainte \u00e9tablit qu\u2019au printemps 2006, M. Hughes a postul\u00e9 un emploi \u00e0 titre de candidat externe et a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans un bassin de candidats (num\u00e9ro de processus de s\u00e9lection 2006-REH-EA-BC-SC-587) qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 en vue de pourvoir 11 postes d\u2019agent de prestation des services au niveau CR-05 \u00e0 RHDSC, \u00e0 Victoria. M. Hughes a affirm\u00e9 avoir pass\u00e9 une entrevue le 23 ao\u00fbt 2006, avec succ\u00e8s.\n[19] Les extraits suivants de la pi\u00e8ce C-1 sont pertinents relativement \u00e0 la question de la d\u00e9ficience :\n[traduction]\nLe 17 octobre 2006, j\u2019ai re\u00e7u un courriel m\u2019avisant que j\u2019avais \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans un bassin de candidats \u00e9valu\u00e9s en partie. J\u2019ai t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 RHDSC et on m\u2019a r\u00e9pondu que le courriel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mal formul\u00e9, que je poss\u00e9dais toutes les qualifications essentielles du poste et que j\u2019avais \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans un bassin de candidats pleinement qualifi\u00e9s (ce qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas depuis le 23 ao\u00fbt 2006).\nLe 19 d\u00e9cembre 2006, j\u2019ai re\u00e7u un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique d\u2019une certaine K. Porter qui m\u2019a demand\u00e9 des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences afin de terminer le processus. Cela n\u2019avait pas de sens; cela entrait en contradiction avec ce qu\u2019on m\u2019avait dit auparavant. Elle m\u2019a dit que j\u2019avais d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que je poss\u00e9dais toutes les qualifications essentielles et que la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence demand\u00e9e servirait uniquement \u00e0 confirmer les r\u00e9sultats.\nJ\u2019ai dit \u00e0 Mme Porter que le fait de fournir des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences poserait probl\u00e8me vu que j\u2019avais \u00e9t\u00e9 un fonctionnaire divulgateur. J\u2019avais remis un compte rendu des affaires internes au comit\u00e9 lors de l\u2019entrevue du mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt. J\u2019ai r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 que j\u2019avais eu de tr\u00e8s bonnes \u00e9valuations de rendement dans le pass\u00e9 et que j\u2019avais donn\u00e9 copie de ces \u00e9valuations au comit\u00e9 au mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt. J\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 mes probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9, le stress et la d\u00e9pression dont je souffrais ainsi que la question des repr\u00e9sailles exerc\u00e9es \u00e0 mon endroit par l\u2019ASFC en ce qui concernait les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences. J\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de mesures d\u2019adaptation en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[20] Apr\u00e8s que le plaignant eut \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans le bassin de candidats CR-05, une reclassification nationale des professions a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e et le niveau minimum d\u2019\u00e9tudes requis a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 \u00e0 deux ann\u00e9es d\u2019\u00e9tudes postsecondaires. M. Hughes a reconnu que cette reclassification faisait en sorte qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait techniquement plus qualifi\u00e9 pour obtenir un poste de niveau CR-05. M. Hughes n\u2019a jamais obtenu d\u2019emploi \u00e0 partir du bassin de candidats CR-05.\n[21] M. Hughes a affirm\u00e9 que malgr\u00e9 le changement apport\u00e9 au niveau d\u2019\u00e9tudes exig\u00e9, le bassin CR-05 dans lequel il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 aurait pu servir \u00e0 pourvoir des postes \u00e9quivalents, comme ceux d\u2019agent des prestations de Service Canada (PM-02), d\u2019agent des services aux citoyens (PM-01), d\u2019agent des services de paiement (PM-01) et d\u2019agent de prestation des services (CR-04). Dans sa plainte de discrimination, M. Hughes a fourni le nom de six personnes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9es \u00e0 des postes \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e d\u2019un an : deux le 14 septembre 2006, deux le 6 novembre 2006, une le 11 novembre 2006 et une le 2 janvier 2007 (neuf mois); il a affirm\u00e9 que sa candidature aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre prise en consid\u00e9ration pour ces postes.\n[22] M. Hughes a \u00e9galement dress\u00e9 une liste de quatre personnes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9es le 22 mai 2007 pour occuper des postes de niveau PM\u201101 dans le cadre d\u2019un processus non annonc\u00e9 et il a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019offre d\u2019emploi et les qualifications requises \u00e9taient presque identiques \u00e0 celles du bassin CR\u201105 dans lequel il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9. [traduction] \u00ab RHDSC aurait d\u00fb se servir du bassin CR-05 dans lequel je me trouvais, mais ils ne l\u2019ont pas fait pour des raisons de discrimination. \u00bb\n[23] Pour finir, M. Hughes a donn\u00e9 le nom d\u2019une personne qui se trouvait dans un bassin CR-04 et qui, le 22 mai 2007, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e par int\u00e9rim \u00e0 un poste de niveau PM\u201102 pour une p\u00e9riode d\u2019un an. [traduction] \u00ab Encore une fois, on aurait d\u00fb prendre ma candidature en consid\u00e9ration \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que j\u2019avais d\u00e9montr\u00e9 peu de temps auparavant que j\u2019\u00e9tais qualifi\u00e9 pour ce poste et que j\u2019avais 10 ans d\u2019exp\u00e9rience comme PM-01 et PM-02. \u00bb\n[24] M. Hughes a produit la pi\u00e8ce C-5, onglet 23; elle comprend un \u00ab guide d\u2019\u00e9valuation \u00bb au nom de Chris Hughes, d\u00fbment remplie, qui se termine par la mention manuscrite [traduction] \u00ab Le candidat satisfait \u00e0 toutes les exigences \u00bb, en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au processus de recrutement CR-05 par voie de concours num\u00e9ro 2006-REH-CSD-EA-BC-SC-587. \u00c9galement sous la pi\u00e8ce C\u20115, onglet 23, se trouve un formulaire de v\u00e9rification des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences qui contient les questions et r\u00e9ponses pertinentes suivantes : [traduction] (Q16) \u00ab R\u00e9engageriez-vous [...]?

Hughes).\n[25] Au cours de la pr\u00e9sente instruction relative aux plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par M. Hughes, il s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9 que l\u2019essentiel de la preuve du plaignant \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se incorrecte suivante : le fait d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans un bassin de candidats, en l\u2019occurrence le bassin CR-05, s\u2019accompagnait d\u2019une garantie d\u2019emploi.\n[26] N\u00e9anmoins, a) le refus ou la n\u00e9gligence de la part de RHDSC de reconna\u00eetre les qualifications de M. Hughes, et b) le fait de ne pas le r\u00e9embaucher \u00e0 partir du bassin CR-05 tout en sachant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience constitue un acte discriminatoire. Cette conclusion est renforc\u00e9e par les conditions dans lesquelles RHDSC a ensuite engag\u00e9 M. Hughes, comme CR-04 nomm\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, emploi qui n\u2019a [traduction] \u00ab pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9 \u00bb, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire qu\u2019il y a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin, alors m\u00eame que M.

M. Hughes a pr\u00e9tendu que le fait de ne pas avoir divulgu\u00e9 ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments avait fait en sorte qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9, ce qui d\u00e9montrait qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 stigmatis\u00e9 et que son exp\u00e9rience professionnelle et ses qualifications s\u2019en trouvaient discr\u00e9dit\u00e9es.\n[28] M. Hughes a produit la copie d\u2019une lettre (pi\u00e8ce C-4, onglet 12) dat\u00e9e du 31 ao\u00fbt 2007 que RHDSC lui a envoy\u00e9e pour lui offrir un emploi d\u2019une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e pour la p\u00e9riode allant du 13 septembre 2007 au 7 mars 2008. Le 5 septembre 2007, M. Hughes a accept\u00e9 cette offre. Des lettres similaires de RHDSC dat\u00e9es du 22 novembre 2007 et du 28 f\u00e9vrier 2008 (pi\u00e8ces R-3 et R-4) ont prolong\u00e9 la p\u00e9riode d\u2019emploi de M. Hughes au 28 mars 2008, et finalement au 27 juin 2008.\n[29] Sur son site web, Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada (AADNC), (anciennement Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada), offre une mise \u00e0 jour des renseignements concernant le Paiement d\u2019exp\u00e9rience commune (PEC), l\u2019expliquant en partie de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\nLe Paiement d\u2019exp\u00e9rience commune (PEC) est un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la Convention de r\u00e8glement relative aux pensionnats indiens. Cette convention de r\u00e8glement, approuv\u00e9e par les tribunaux, est entr\u00e9e en vigueur le 19 septembre 2007. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9goci\u00e9e par des repr\u00e9sentants de diverses organisations autochtones, des repr\u00e9sentants des \u00c9glises, les avocats des anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves et le gouvernement du Canada. Le PEC est vers\u00e9 aux anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves admissibles qui ont r\u00e9sid\u00e9 dans un pensionnat indien nomm\u00e9 dans la Convention de r\u00e8glement. Les anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves admissibles re\u00e7oivent 10 000 $ pour leur premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e (ou une partie d\u2019ann\u00e9e) de fr\u00e9quentation d\u2019un pensionnat indien nomm\u00e9, puis 3 000 $ pour chaque ann\u00e9e subs\u00e9quente (ou partie d\u2019ann\u00e9e).\n[30] Il revenait \u00e0 M. Hughes (tout comme aux autres agents de prestation des services nouvellement embauch\u00e9s dans l\u2019Unit\u00e9 de traitement des PEC de RHDSC \u00e0 Victoria) de traiter les demandes, d\u2019\u00e9tablir si les demandeurs avaient droit au paiement et d\u2019exp\u00e9dier en une seule fois le PEC aux anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves des pensionnats indiens. Une partie importante du travail de M. Hughes consistait \u00e0 recevoir des appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de demandeurs qui lui parlaient souvent des traumatismes qu\u2019ils avaient subis, ce qui avait pour effet d\u2019augmenter son niveau de stress.\nC. La performance de M. Hughes en tant que pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux PEC [31] M. Hughes a expliqu\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on dont les demandes de PEC \u00e9taient trait\u00e9es dans les bureaux de RHDSC situ\u00e9s au 595, rue Pandora, \u00e0 Victoria. M. Hughes a affirm\u00e9 avoir d\u00e9tenu le record de traitement des demandes de PEC et s\u2019\u00eatre ainsi vu attribuer le surnom de \u00ab Rock Star \u00bb et la r\u00e9putation d\u2019homme de la situation dans son \u00e9quipe.\n[32] M. Hughes a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir volontairement fait beaucoup d\u2019heures suppl\u00e9mentaires pendant les premiers mois de la mise en place du programme de traitement des PEC, ce qui est en partie illustr\u00e9 par la pi\u00e8ce C-4, onglet 24, constitu\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9changes de courriels entre le plaignant et sa chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe, Jacky Smith, sous les objets [traduction] : \u00ab Heures suppl\u00e9mentaires, production \u00bb et \u00ab Heures suppl\u00e9mentaires pendant le week\u2011end, production \u00bb :\n[33] Le 22 octobre 2007 :\n[traduction]\nM. Hughes : J\u2019ai travaill\u00e9 cinq heures samedi et trois heures dimanche. J\u2019ai saisi 35 demandes et proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019examen des donn\u00e9es de 30 demandes.\nMme Smith : C\u2019est excellent, Chris. Merci beaucoup pour tes efforts productifs.\n[34] Les 28 et 30 octobre 2007 :\n[traduction]\nM. Hughes : J\u2019ai saisi 39 demandes et proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019examen des donn\u00e9es de 132 demandes\nMme Smith : Ton niveau de productivit\u00e9 est constamment excellent, Chris. Merci pour ton excellent travail.\n[35] La pi\u00e8ce C-4, onglet 25, consiste en deux courriels qui montrent que M. Hughes \u00e9tait un travailleur consciencieux.\n[36] Le premier courriel a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 le 7 novembre 2007 par Lorraine Lewis, agente de projet par int\u00e9rim, \u00e0 M. Hughes et \u00e0 Mme Shelley Spears, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 Jacky Smith en copie conforme : [traduction] \u00ab Merci \u00e0 vous deux d\u2019avoir trouv\u00e9 un exemple de client pay\u00e9 dans l\u2019optique de la formation. \u00bb\n[37] Dans le second courriel, dat\u00e9 du 22 novembre 2007, une gestionnaire de RHDSC, Liz Klempner, a attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention des employ\u00e9s charg\u00e9s des PEC sur deux sites web : le site de la banque de donn\u00e9es d\u2019AINC et le site d\u2019AADNC, \u00e0 partir desquels les employ\u00e9s pouvaient obtenir les coordonn\u00e9es des bandes et \u00e9tablir la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 d\u2019autres faits essentiels. Comme Mme Klempner l\u2019a \u00e9crit : \u00ab Merci \u00e0 Chris Hughes et aux autres employ\u00e9s qui ont fourni ces informations utiles. \u00bb\n[38] Conscient du fait que son emploi d\u2019agent affect\u00e9 aux PEC \u00e9tait d\u2019une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, M. Hughes a engag\u00e9 un \u00e9change de courriels avec sa chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe, Jacky Smith, le 8 janvier 2008, afin de se renseigner sur la mani\u00e8re d\u2019obtenir un poste par int\u00e9rim de PM-02 (ou de PM-01) dans la section du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse (RPC\/SV). Il a \u00e9crit : [traduction] \u00ab J\u2019esp\u00e8re avoir d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que je suis un employ\u00e9 fiable et productif depuis que je travaille pour le programme des PEC. \u00bb La r\u00e9ponse de Mme Smith est r\u00e9v\u00e9latrice :\n[traduction]\nJe ne sais pas si tu as pos\u00e9 ta candidature au r\u00e9cent concours qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 organis\u00e9 pour pourvoir le poste d\u2019agent des services aux clients de niveau PM\u201101. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un poste de premi\u00e8re ligne, en contact avec les clients, en bas. Je ne pense pas que la section RPC\/SV ait encore des postes de niveau PM\u201101 \u00e0 pourvoir, mais je n\u2019en suis pas absolument certaine. Si tu ne te trouves pas dans un bassin actif, je te sugg\u00e9rerais de pr\u00e9senter une demande de mutation aux gestionnaires en poste ici.\nTu trouveras ci\u2011joint le formulaire officiel; la demande peut \u00eatre envoy\u00e9e au gestionnaire recruteur par courriel, note de service ou lettre. Il appartient \u00e0 cette unit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cider si la demande est recevable ou non. Je ne connais pas tous les gestionnaires, mais le directeur est Kim Bergh et les noms des gestionnaires doivent se trouver dans l\u2019annuaire \u00e9lectronique.\nJe pense vraiment que tu es un membre de l\u2019\u00e9quipe fiable, productif et proactif et je ne verrais aucune objection \u00e0 ce que tu donnes mon nom en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[39] Le 30 janvier 2008, M. Hughes a envoy\u00e9 une demande de mutation par courriel \u00e0 Kim Bergh (envoy\u00e9e en copie conforme \u00e0 M. Quinn), appuyant cette demande d\u2019un curriculum vit\u00e6 d\u00e9taillant les divers postes qu\u2019il avait occup\u00e9s avant d\u2019entrer \u00e0 RHDSC.\n[40] Au d\u00e9but du mois de f\u00e9vrier 2008, une coll\u00e8gue de M. Hughes a mis ce dernier mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise devant d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s en l\u2019accusant avec force d\u2019avoir trait\u00e9 incorrectement certaines demandes de PEC, ce qui \u00e9tait faux. Perturb\u00e9 par cette attaque verbale, M. Hughes s\u2019est rendu directement dans le bureau de sa chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe, Mme Smith. Ne l\u2019y trouvant pas, il est all\u00e9 voir le pr\u00e9sident du syndicat local, qui a contact\u00e9 Mme Smith et lui a demand\u00e9 de rencontrer M. Hughes. Mme Smith a discut\u00e9 de l\u2019incident avec M. Hughes, mais elle lui a fait clairement savoir que, selon elle, il n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb aller aussi pr\u00e9cipitamment demander de l\u2019aide au syndicat. \u00c0 la suite de cela, Mme Smith a rencontr\u00e9 la coll\u00e8gue en question, mais elle ne l\u2019a pas sanctionn\u00e9e pour ce que M. Hughes avait per\u00e7u comme du harc\u00e8lement. Cet incident a empoisonn\u00e9 la relation de M. Hughes et de Mme Smith, et cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019est ensuite montr\u00e9e r\u00e9ticente \u00e0 se porter pleinement garante de M. Hughes dans sa recherche d\u2019emploi.\n[41] Dans une v\u00e9rification des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences dat\u00e9e du 6 ao\u00fbt 2008, pi\u00e8ce C-5, onglet 32, Mme Smith a revu \u00e0 la baisse la capacit\u00e9 de M. Hughes \u00e0 traiter les demandes de PEC, contredisant ainsi les remarques \u00e9logieuses qu\u2019elle lui avait faites le 8 janvier 2008 au sujet de son \u00e9thique de travail ainsi que son offre de lui servir de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\n[42] Dans une v\u00e9rification des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences dat\u00e9e du 11 octobre 2008, Mme Smith a mentionn\u00e9 l\u2019incident et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Il aurait mieux convenu de contacter le chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe en personne plut\u00f4t que de demander au syndicat d\u2019intervenir. \u00bb\nD. La d\u00e9ficience permanente de M. Hughes [43] \u00c0 la fin d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de travail intense dans le traitement des demandes de PEC, M. Hughes a recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9. La pi\u00e8ce C-4, onglet 28, est constitu\u00e9e de courriels \u00e9chang\u00e9s le 14 d\u00e9cembre 2007 par M. Hughes, Cherie Nash (agente de projet par int\u00e9rim) et Jacky Smith (chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe). M. Hughes y expliquait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait malade depuis deux jours, souffrant de maux de dos et d\u2019un \u00e9pisode d\u2019empoisonnement alimentaire ou de grippe, et qu\u2019il ne pourrait pas travailler le samedi suivant. Le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2007, M. Hughes a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 Mme Smith pour lui expliquer qu\u2019il souffrait toujours de douleurs graves \u00e0 la hanche, affirmant : [traduction] \u00ab Je souffre du syndrome du piriforme et\/ou de spondylolisth\u00e9sis depuis 12 ans et je peux g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement g\u00e9rer mes douleurs et mon \u00e9tat sans avoir \u00e0 trop m\u2019absenter du travail. Je n\u2019ai de vraies crises qu\u2019une ou deux fois par an. \u00bb\n[44] Le 18 f\u00e9vrier 2008, M. Hughes a re\u00e7u la note manuscrite suivante, pi\u00e8ce C-4, onglet 19, du docteur John Miller, M.D., omnipraticien \u00e0 Victoria :\nNom \u2013 Chris Hughes\nDate \u2013 Le 18 f\u00e9vrier 2008\nM. Hughes a souffert de d\u00e9pression par le pass\u00e9 et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 quelque peu stress\u00e9 et d\u00e9prim\u00e9 au cours du dernier mois. Le fait de r\u00e9duire ses contacts t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques avec les clients serait b\u00e9n\u00e9fique. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n(Sign\u00e9) Dr John Miller, M.D.\n[45] Le Oxford Dictionary d\u00e9finit la d\u00e9pression comme [traduction] \u00ab M\u00e9d. \u00c9tat pathologique de d\u00e9couragement extr\u00eame, caract\u00e9ris\u00e9 par des sentiments d\u2019incomp\u00e9tence et d\u2019impuissance et qui s\u2019accompagne souvent de sympt\u00f4mes physiques. \u00bb\n[46] M. Hughes a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la note du docteur Miller \u00e0 Mme Smith, et celle\u2011ci l\u2019a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 faire face \u00e0 cet \u00e9pisode de d\u00e9pression en modifiant ses t\u00e2ches.\n[47] Le 14 avril 2008, M. Hughes a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une autre demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 Mme Smith :\n[Traduction]\nJe souhaiterais formuler une nouvelle demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation du fait de ma d\u00e9ficience. Merci d\u2019avoir modifi\u00e9 mes t\u00e2ches quand j\u2019ai port\u00e9 ma situation \u00e0 votre attention.\nJ\u2019ai \u00e9prouv\u00e9 beaucoup de difficult\u00e9s la semaine derni\u00e8re. Je demande \u00e0 \u00eatre mut\u00e9 au poste de niveau CR-04 d\u2019agent de prestation des services charg\u00e9 de traiter les demandes de SRG [suppl\u00e9ment de revenu garanti] pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales.\n\u00c0 l\u2019heure actuelle, le poste que j\u2019occupe et le programme auquel je suis affect\u00e9 font empirer mon \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Je pense que le fait de travailler au traitement des demandes de SRG am\u00e9liorera ma sant\u00e9. Je crois que le traitement des demandes de SRG exige beaucoup de calculs (exercice auquel j\u2019excelle et que j\u2019aime) et demandent moins de contacts avec les clients que mon poste actuel. Aussi, la nature du programme n\u2019est pas d\u00e9primante.\nLe programme de traitement des demandes de PEC est bien souvent li\u00e9 \u00e0 des cas d\u2019abus et de discrimination, ce qui est stressant et d\u00e9primant. Ce n\u2019est pas un poste qui me convient vu mes ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents m\u00e9dicaux.\nLe fait de m\u2019occuper de demandes de SRG serait moins stressant et devrait att\u00e9nuer ma d\u00e9pression.\nJe suis s\u00fbr que certaines personnes affect\u00e9es au programme de SRG ne se plaisent pas dans leur poste ou souhaitent revenir au programme des PEC. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, ma demande est fond\u00e9e sur des raisons m\u00e9dicales et elle doit recevoir une r\u00e9ponse favorable en application de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et de l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor.\nMon poste actuel tout comme le poste consistant \u00e0 traiter des demandes de SRG sont des postes CR-04. RHDSC ne devrait avoir aucune raison de refuser ma requ\u00eate \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans un bassin de candidats parfaitement qualifi\u00e9s pour occuper un poste CR-04 et que l\u2019avis d\u2019emploi pr\u00e9cisait que le bassin en question pourrait servir \u00e0 pourvoir des postes similaires au niveau CR-04. Pi\u00e8ce R-5.\n[48] M. Hughes a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Smith sa nouvelle demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation compte tenu de son \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif tenant lieu de d\u00e9ficience le 14 avril 2008, \u00e0 9 h 34. Cette demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie d\u2019un court \u00e9change de courriels avec Mme Smith, \u00e0 10 h 2 et \u00e0 10 h 8. \u00c0 10 h 9, Mme Smith a fait suivre la demande de M. Hughes \u00e0 M. Quinn. \u00c0 10 h 21, Mme Smith a retranscrit mot pour mot la note du docteur Miller dat\u00e9e du 18 f\u00e9vrier 2008 et l\u2019a envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Quinn, pr\u00e9cisant qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u cette note, elle avait relev\u00e9 M. Hughes de ses fonctions consistant \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux appels des clients. \u00c0 11 h 10, M. Quinn a fait suivre la demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation de M. Hughes \u00e0 Caleigh Miller, consultante en ressources humaines, qui lui a imm\u00e9diatement r\u00e9pondu :\n[Traduction]\nJe conviens que des mesures d\u2019adaptation sont n\u00e9cessaires pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales. Le fait de refuser une mutation (pour d\u2019autres raisons, telles que le fait d\u2019\u00eatre la bonne personne ou non pour le poste, etc.) ne revient pas \u00e0 se soustraire \u00e0 une obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation. Nous devons faire tous les efforts n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses besoins dans le poste qu\u2019il occupe actuellement avant d\u2019envisager de le muter \u00e0 un autre poste de m\u00eame niveau. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les t\u00e2ches des CR-04 sont relativement similaires (c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire de nature administrative), il nous faudrait conna\u00eetre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment les t\u00e2ches qu\u2019il ne peut pas accomplir. Est\u2011il incapable d\u2019\u00eatre en contact avec le public? De se servir d\u2019un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone? Etc., etc. Il affirme que cela devrait att\u00e9nuer sa d\u00e9pression. Ce n\u2019est pas garanti. La d\u00e9pression est un trouble m\u00e9dical qui exige l\u2019intervention d\u2019un professionnel de la sant\u00e9. Dire que le fait d\u2019occuper un emploi diff\u00e9rent aura un impact sur sa sant\u00e9, consid\u00e9rant qu\u2019il ne conna\u00eet pas la nature de cet emploi particulier, est une pr\u00e9somption.\nNous pouvons \u00e9galement r\u00e9diger une lettre \u00e0 envoyer au m\u00e9decin de Chris pour lui poser plus de questions au sujet des capacit\u00e9s et des limites de ce dernier, en joignant une copie de sa description de travail, etc., m\u00eame s\u2019il apporte une note m\u00e9dicale.\n[49] Les commentaires de Mme Miller ont port\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019attention de la direction de RHDSC le caract\u00e8re s\u00e9rieux de la maladie de M. Hughes, la d\u00e9pression. Malgr\u00e9 les recommandations de Mme Miller, Mme Smith et M. Quinn n\u2019ont pas mis en \u0153uvre les recommandations sugg\u00e9r\u00e9es et n\u2019ont pas davantage cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de M. Hughes compte tenu de sa d\u00e9ficience. Mme Miller a formul\u00e9 des recommandations pr\u00e9cises auxquelles il aurait fallu donner suite. Les gestionnaires qui ont manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 leur obligation de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation de M. Hughes compte tenu de sa maladie mentale ont montr\u00e9 qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient incapables de se mettre \u00e0 la place du plaignant et de comprendre les difficult\u00e9s inh\u00e9rentes aux maladies mentales ainsi que leur devoir de gestionnaires de RHDSC, tel que le pr\u00e9voit le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor du Canada.\nE. La cessation de l\u2019emploi de M. Hughes [50] Cinq semaines apr\u00e8s que M. Hughes eut demand\u00e9 des accommodements compte tenu de son \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif, Anne Milne, directrice principale, Services de traitement et de paiement, C.\u2011B.\/Alb. et Territoires, RHDSC, a avis\u00e9 M. Hughes, par lettre dat\u00e9e du 20 mai 2008 (pi\u00e8ce C-4, onglet 42), que son emploi \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux PEC prendrait fin le 27 juin 2008.\nF. Les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles de M. Hughes [51] En juin 2009, M. Hughes a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte de repr\u00e9sailles contre RHDSC. Cette plainte \u00e9tait visiblement la suite directe de la plainte de discrimination qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en janvier 2008 pour le motif de distinction illicite qu\u2019est la d\u00e9ficience. Dans sa plainte de repr\u00e9sailles, M. Hughes a affirm\u00e9 avoir, en janvier 2008, inform\u00e9 sa chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe du fait qu\u2019il souffrait de d\u00e9pression ainsi que du fait qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Il a ajout\u00e9 que les gestionnaires recruteurs \u00e9taient au fait de sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[52] M. Hughes a affirm\u00e9 que quand la direction de RHDSC a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise au courant de sa plainte fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience, elle a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 son endroit en refusant de le muter dans d\u2019autres services, ce qui a finalement men\u00e9 au non\u2011renouvellement de son contrat de travail de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux PEC, et, apr\u00e8s la cessation de cet emploi, fait en sorte qu\u2019il ne soit pas s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 pour occuper un nouvel emploi \u00e0 partir de deux bassins de candidats dans lesquels il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9.\n[53] Il est pertinent que M. Hughes ait pr\u00e9tendu avoir fait l\u2019objet tant de discrimination que de repr\u00e9sailles pendant la p\u00e9riode allant de janvier \u00e0 juin 2008. En examinant la plainte de repr\u00e9sailles continues de M. Hughes sur le fond, je note que tout au long de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Hughes s\u2019est montr\u00e9 extr\u00eamement p\u00e9remptoire et dogmatique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ce qu\u2019il percevait comme son droit \u00e0 une carri\u00e8re au sein de RHDSC. \u00c0 ce sujet, il s\u2019est refus\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter le fait que les d\u00e9cisions prises par la direction de RHDSC soient ax\u00e9es sur le crit\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif de la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb, et il a per\u00e7u les d\u00e9cisions de la direction de ne pas prendre en sa candidature en consid\u00e9ration comme des repr\u00e9sailles continues.\nG. La preuve prima facie du plaignant [54] La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Hughes consistait en son t\u00e9moignage de vive voix et en des preuves documentaires pertinentes, parmi lesquelles j\u2019ai s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 les plus convaincantes et probantes. Je conclus, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que M. Hughes a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve prima facie de discrimination en contravention de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP, acte discriminatoire auquel RHDSC s\u2019est livr\u00e9 en refusant de prolonger l\u2019emploi du plaignant de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019accommoder compte tenu de sa d\u00e9ficience et en mettant fin \u00e0 son emploi alors qu\u2019il souffrait de d\u00e9ficience.\n[55] Au vu de ces m\u00eames \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, je conclus que le plaignant n\u2019est pas parvenu \u00e0 \u00e9tablir prima facie l\u2019existence de repr\u00e9sailles en contravention de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP, en relation avec sa plainte de discrimination.\nIII. Les arguments presents par RHDSC [56] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve prima facie, il revient maintenant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de fournir une explication raisonnable en vue de d\u00e9montrer soit que l\u2019acte discriminatoire pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 n\u2019a pas eu lieu, soit que la conduite en cause n\u2019\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire. Autrement, dit, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi du plaignant parce que celui\u2011ci avait une d\u00e9ficience ou encore que le fait d\u2019accommoder le plaignant aurait constitu\u00e9 une contrainte excessive.\nA. Kenneth Campbell, t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [57] Pendant les ann\u00e9es 2006, 2007 et 2008, M. Campbell occupait un poste de gestionnaire de niveau inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 RHDSC, \u00e0 Victoria. M. Quinn \u00e9tait son sup\u00e9rieur hi\u00e9rarchique et Mme Milne \u00e9tait leur sup\u00e9rieure hi\u00e9rarchique \u00e0 tous deux, occupant un poste de gestionnaire relativement \u00e9lev\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de RHDSC, division de l\u2019Ouest canadien.\n[58] M. Campbell s\u2019est souvenu d\u2019une entrevue qu\u2019il avait eue avec M. Hughes en 2006, relativement au bassin de candidats CR-05 2006-REH-EA-BC-SC-587, dans lequel M. Hughes avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9. Pendant l\u2019entrevue, M. Hughes avait fourni un ensemble de renseignements de nature professionnelle et avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que sa candidature fasse l\u2019objet d\u2019un traitement particulier vu qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure d\u2019obtenir des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences du fait du refus injustifi\u00e9 des gestionnaires qui l\u2019avaient supervis\u00e9 dans les emplois qu\u2019il avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment occup\u00e9s dans la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Pendant leur conversation, M. Hughes lui a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il se trouvait sur une liste noire du fait de son pass\u00e9 de fonctionnaire divulgateur et de ses conflits avec ses gestionnaires.\n[59] Je conclus que pendant toute la p\u00e9riode pertinente, qui a commenc\u00e9 en 2006, M. Campbell savait que M. Hughes avait la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019occuper un poste de niveau CR\u201105, qu\u2019en 2007, M. Hughes avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 dans des bassins de dotation pour des postes de plus bas niveau : un bassin CR\u201103 et un bassin CR-04 pour un poste de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux PEC, et qu\u2019il savait qu\u2019en 2007, RHDSC avait s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 M. Hughes dans le bassin CR-04 pour effectuer le traitement des demandes de PEC.\n[60] Pendant la formation des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s au traitement des PEC, un formateur venu d\u2019Ottawa, M. Paul Thomas, a souhait\u00e9 s\u2019entretenir avec M. Campbell au sujet de M. Hughes. \u00c0 la suite de cette conversation, M. Campbell, un chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe de la division des PEC, a envoy\u00e9 un courriel, dat\u00e9 du 18 septembre 2007 et comportant la mention [traduction] \u00ab Importance : Haute, Objet : Probl\u00e8mes \u00bb, \u00e0 M. Quinn, gestionnaire du service de traitement des PEC, pour informer ce dernier des commentaires n\u00e9gatifs que Paul Thomas avait formul\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Hughes. Dans son courriel, M. Campbell a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : \u00ab J\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Paul de mettre ces informations et tout autre commentaire qu\u2019il voudrait formuler par \u00e9crit \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019on pourrait vouloir en garder une trace. Je ne suis pas s\u00fbr que Liz ait des probl\u00e8mes avec Chris, mais on pourrait le lui demander. \u00bb\n[61] La lettre d\u2019emploi utilis\u00e9e par RHDSC stipule que tout nouvel emploi commence par une p\u00e9riode de probation, sans donner de d\u00e9finition pr\u00e9cise du terme \u00ab probation \u00bb. Selon la d\u00e9finition courante du terme, il s\u2019agit du fait de soumettre un individu \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode de mise \u00e0 l\u2019essai en vue de s\u2019assurer qu\u2019il convient, ou ne convient pas, \u00e0 un poste particulier. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, M. Campbell et M. Quinn auraient d\u00fb faire part \u00e0 M. Hughes des all\u00e9gations de M. Thomas et prendre son explication en consid\u00e9ration. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un comportement inacceptable, et le fait qu\u2019ils aient choisi de mettre ces informations de c\u00f4t\u00e9 en vue de les utiliser contre M. Hughes plus tard joue en leur d\u00e9faveur.\n[62] Un important t\u00e9moin potentiel, Jacky Smith, chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe de M. Hughes, est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Hughes. Sans avertissement pr\u00e9alable de la part des avocats, M. Campbell a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Smith avait tenu certains propos incendiaires relativement \u00e0 sa peur pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e des comportements que M. Hughes pourrait possiblement adopter du fait de son \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif. Je n\u2019ai pas tenu compte de cette d\u00e9position, mais je la consid\u00e8re comme pertinente pour \u00e9tablir la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Campbell.\n[63] Plus tard, quand j\u2019ai interrog\u00e9 le t\u00e9moin au sujet d\u2019un commentaire n\u00e9gatif que Mme Smith avait formul\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Hughes dans un rapport dat\u00e9 du 11 f\u00e9vrier 2008 et intitul\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab V\u00e9rification des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u2013 Pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s au traitement des PEC \u00bb, lequel visait \u00e0 identifier les employ\u00e9s ayant le meilleur rendement (pi\u00e8ce C-4, onglet 17), M. Campbell a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait dans l\u2019ensemble de [traduction] \u00ab quelque chose au sujet d\u2019une coll\u00e8gue \u00bb et que cela [traduction] \u00ab nous a mis la puce \u00e0 l\u2019oreille \u00bb. En v\u00e9rit\u00e9, une coll\u00e8gue avait harcel\u00e9 M. Hughes et soit M. Campbell savait que tel \u00e9tait le cas, soit il a fait preuve de manque de jugement en formulant son commentaire relatif \u00e0 une puce \u00e0 l\u2019oreille. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une observation non fond\u00e9e.\n[64] Apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9diement (ou comme RHDSC le dit, apr\u00e8s le non-renouvellement de son contrat), M. Hughes a continu\u00e9 de bombarder RHDSC de demandes d\u2019emploi pendant l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2008, l\u2019une de ses demandes faisant la preuve d\u2019une attitude tr\u00e8s acrimonieuse \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de M. Campbell.\n[65] Quand M. Hughes a postul\u00e9 un emploi d\u2019agent de prestation de programmes et de services de niveau CR-04, M. Campbell occupait alors le poste de gestionnaire de la prestation des services, S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse, C.\u2011B., Alb. et Territoires.\n[66] Dans un courriel envoy\u00e9 le 30 octobre 2008, M. Campbell a inform\u00e9 M. Hughes que [traduction] \u00ab Toutes les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences que vous nous avez donn\u00e9es n\u2019ont soit pas confirm\u00e9 votre rendement ant\u00e9rieur, soit pas voulu en discuter. Le 22 octobre, bien apr\u00e8s la date d\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du 10 septembre qui vous avait \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e, nous avons re\u00e7u des informations de la part d\u2019une de vos r\u00e9f\u00e9rences, M. Tim O\u2019Neill. En plus de ne pas \u00eatre arriv\u00e9e dans les d\u00e9lais impartis, cette r\u00e9ponse faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un qui \u00e9tait essentiellement un coll\u00e8gue ayant occup\u00e9 des fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe par int\u00e9rim pendant de courtes p\u00e9riodes. La d\u00e9cision du comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation selon laquelle vos qualifications ne satisfont pas aux exigences du poste est confirm\u00e9e. \u00bb\n[67] M. Hughes a r\u00e9pondu le jour m\u00eame, par un courriel d\u2019une page de longueur, d\u00e9luge d\u2019accusations commen\u00e7ant de la mani\u00e8re suivante : [traduction] \u00ab Vous pouvez vous attendre \u00e0 trois enqu\u00eates de la Commission de la fonction publique (relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente offre et aux deux bassins de candidats dans lesquels je me trouve, ce dont RHDSC fait fi), \u00e0 une nouvelle plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et possiblement \u00e0 des poursuites civiles. \u00bb, et se terminant ainsi : [traduction] \u00ab Je vais porter toute cette affaire \u00e0 l\u2019attention de mon d\u00e9put\u00e9 et des m\u00e9dias. \u00c0 la suite de cela, je vais me fabriquer une pancarte et manifester devant votre bureau. \u00bb\n[68] M. Campbell a imm\u00e9diatement fait suivre son courriel ainsi que la r\u00e9ponse de M. Hughes \u00e0 six cadres de direction en mentionnant : [traduction] \u00ab R\u00e9ponse de Chris. Veuillez noter la pr\u00e9sence de menaces d\u2019en appeler aux m\u00e9dias. \u00bb Pi\u00e8ce C-5, onglet 30. M. Campbell a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 s\u2019\u00eatre senti menac\u00e9, ajoutant que c\u2019\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019il se trouvait confront\u00e9 \u00e0 un tel comportement.\n[69] Je conclus que M. Campbell a \u00e9t\u00e9 profond\u00e9ment troubl\u00e9 par l\u2019hostilit\u00e9 manifest\u00e9e par M. Hughes \u00e0 son endroit, que cela a affect\u00e9 n\u00e9gativement son t\u00e9moignage, au point qu\u2019il est devenu manifestement r\u00e9ticent \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux questions qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire. En outre, pendant que j\u2019\u00e9coutais sa d\u00e9position, j\u2019ai per\u00e7u une antipathie sous\u2011jacente \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Hughes. \u00c0 tous les \u00e9gards, je conclus que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Campbell ne constituait pas un r\u00e9cit d\u00e9nu\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9motion et objectif de ses \u00e9changes avec M. Hughes.\nB. James Quinn, t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [70] En 2006, M. Quinn, gestionnaire de la prestation des services, Services de traitement et de paiement \u00e0 Service Canada, a accept\u00e9 d\u2019organiser et de g\u00e9rer le processus de traitement des demandes de PEC de RHDSC. Sous la menace d\u2019un volume de demandes inattendu, M. Quinn s\u2019est d\u00e9p\u00each\u00e9 de trouver des bureaux ad\u00e9quats pour une \u00e9quipe qui, selon les pr\u00e9visions, devait compter au moins 100 agents de traitement des demandes et agents de soutien auxiliaires. Des basins de candidats de niveau CR-04 et CR-03 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9s, environ 400 demandes d\u2019emploi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ues, les candidats ont pass\u00e9 des examens et environ 200 d\u2019entre eux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s avec des contrats \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. M. Quinn n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 au processus d\u2019embauche, mais il \u00e9tait conscient du fait que M. Hughes avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 \u00e0 partir du bassin CR-04.\n[71] M. Quinn a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le concours de niveau CR-04 pour les postes relatifs aux PEC comprenait un processus d\u2019examen aboutissant \u00e0 un classement des candidats. M. Hughes a obtenu la pi\u00e8ce C-5, onglet 40, au moyen d\u2019une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information. La pi\u00e8ce C-5, onglet 40, consiste en deux courriels indiquant clairement qu\u2019il \u00e9tait urgent de trouver des employ\u00e9s nomm\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e pour effectuer le traitement des demandes de PEC et desquels il ressort qu\u2019on avait l\u2019intention de se fonder sur les r\u00e9sultats de plusieurs examens pour \u00e9tablir un classement des candidats. Les deux courriels ont le m\u00eame objet : [traduction] \u00ab Rapport confidentiel du comit\u00e9 d\u2019examen du processus de recrutement CR\u201104 2007-CSD-EA-BC-SC-425 (Victoria) \u00bb, chacun \u00e9tant accompagn\u00e9 des mentions [traduction] \u00ab Importance : Haute \u00bb et [traduction] \u00ab Crit\u00e8re de diffusion : confidentiel \u00bb. Le premier courriel a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 par Linda Granger \u00e0 Bob McFarland dans la matin\u00e9e du 3 ao\u00fbt 2008 et adress\u00e9 en copie conforme \u00e0 six membres du personnel de direction, dont M. Quinn. Le premier courriel se termine par un message sp\u00e9cial \u00e0 l\u2019attention de M. Quinn : [traduction] \u00ab Jim : Tu trouveras ci\u2011joint une liste de candidats potentiellement qualifi\u00e9s. Ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 class\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 nos conversations \u2013 R\u00e9sultats des examens : premi\u00e8rement \u2013 v\u00e9rification et exactitude; deuxi\u00e8mement \u2013 notes; troisi\u00e8mement \u2013 grammaire \u00bb. Le nom de M. Hughes appara\u00eet au cinqui\u00e8me rang de la liste des 88 candidats potentiellement qualifi\u00e9s.\n[72] RHDSC s\u2019attendait \u00e0 devoir traiter un grand volume de demandes de PEC pendant toute une ann\u00e9e. Dans les faits, il y a eu une tr\u00e8s forte hausse des demandes en octobre, en novembre et en d\u00e9cembre 2007, demande qui a diminu\u00e9 fortement en janvier 2008. Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2008, M. Quinn a re\u00e7u la consigne d\u2019envoyer les dossiers restants \u00e0 Calgary d\u2019ici le mois de septembre suivant.\n[73] Le 14 d\u00e9cembre 2007, M. Quinn a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 CB-TY-DIST-CEP-PEC en adressant une copie conforme du message \u00e0 quatre cadres de direction de RHDSC, y compris Anne Milne et Kim Bergh, l\u2019objet \u00e9tant [traduction] \u00ab Info \u2013 Activit\u00e9 de dotation en personnel CR\u201104 \u00e0 venir, Centre de traitement RPC\/SV \u00bb :\n[Traduction]\nVous savez peut-\u00eatre qu\u2019au cours des prochaines semaines et des prochains mois, le service de traitement des demandes RPC\/SV cherchera \u00e0 embaucher des employ\u00e9s parmi les CR\u201104 actuellement pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s au traitement des demandes de PEC et parmi les candidats qui se trouvent dans les bassins CR\u201104 en vue de pourvoir les postes vacants au centre de traitement des demandes.\nLes gestionnaires du centre de traitement RPC\/SV ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences additionnelles leur soient envoy\u00e9es relativement aux employ\u00e9s CR\u201104 pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux PEC, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que ceux-ci ont eu l\u2019occasion de faire la preuve de leurs capacit\u00e9s et comp\u00e9tences ainsi que de leurs qualit\u00e9s personnelles pour des postes o\u00f9 il est question de traitement de demandes.\nVoici un peu de contexte au sujet du fonctionnement du processus. Le gestionnaire recruteur qui demande l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de mesures de dotation d\u00e9finira les \u00ab crit\u00e8res de s\u00e9lection \u00bb en fonction de l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 des crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite de ce poste d\u2019agent de prestation des services 1 (CR\u201104), lequel fait \u00e9tat des comp\u00e9tences requises pour occuper le poste \u00e0 pourvoir. Ces comp\u00e9tences incluront une combinaison aussi bien de capacit\u00e9s et de comp\u00e9tences que de qualit\u00e9s personnelles. Les Ressources humaines (renouvellement du personnel) identifieront les candidats des bassins existants qui ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019ils poss\u00e9daient le degr\u00e9 de comp\u00e9tences le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 pendant le processus d\u2019embauche initial; en m\u00eame temps que des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 jour fournies par votre chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe, cette information servira au gestionnaire recruteur \u00e0 d\u00e9finir le profil de la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb pour les occasions de mutation.\nLe processus vise \u00e0 s\u2019assurer que les s\u00e9lections sont effectu\u00e9es \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de toutes les informations disponibles, afin de s\u2019assurer qu\u2019on choisit la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb pour le poste et l\u2019organisation. Les personnes identifi\u00e9es et s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9es pour les occasions de mutation au sein de RPC\/SV seront contact\u00e9es directement au sujet de leur int\u00e9r\u00eat pour une occasion de mutation. Les personnes qui ne seront pas contact\u00e9es restent dans le bassin de candidats et peuvent \u00eatre s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9es \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure, au fur et \u00e0 mesure que des postes se lib\u00e8rent.\n[74] Je conclus que la lettre de M. Quinn dat\u00e9e du 14 d\u00e9cembre 2007 montre clairement que l\u2019intention de RHDSC \u00e9tait d\u2019offrir un emploi permanent aux employ\u00e9s pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux PEC : [traduction] \u00ab [qui] ont eu l\u2019occasion de faire la preuve de leurs capacit\u00e9s et comp\u00e9tences ainsi que de leurs qualit\u00e9s personnelles pour des postes o\u00f9 il est question de traitement de demandes \u00bb. Envoy\u00e9e peu de temps avant que M. Hughes pr\u00e9sente sa demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation, cette lettre montre que RHDSC aurait pu muter M. Hughes \u00e0 un poste qui aurait permis de tenir compte de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[75] Il est tr\u00e8s probable que tous les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux PEC, y compris M. Hughes, \u00e9taient nerveux, du fait de l\u2019incertitude entourant leur futur \u00e0 RHDSC; et ils savaient que M. Quinn jouait un r\u00f4le cl\u00e9 dans toute d\u00e9cision de gestion concernant la prolongation de leur emploi.\n[76] Le 22 mai 2008, M. Quinn a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 Kim Bergh, directeur de Service Canada, intitul\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab Objet : FW- Chris Hughes \u2013 \u00e9ch\u00e9ance \u2013 Message envoy\u00e9 hier \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019AC \u2013 Relations de travail. La lettre avisant Chris Hughes de la non-prolongation de son contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 Anne Milne hier. \u00bb, courriel que M. Bergh a fait suivre \u00e0 Mme Milne. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ce courriel, Mme Milne a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 M. Quinn et \u00e0 Kim Bergh et a copi\u00e9 deux autres membres de la direction. Ce courriel \u00e9tait intitul\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab Objet : RE Chris Hughes \u2013 \u00e9ch\u00e9ance \u2013 Jim\/Kim [\u2026] si vous recevez d\u2019autres appels ou courriels relatifs \u00e0 cet employ\u00e9, veuillez me les envoyer ou les envoyer \u00e0 Debra Pynten. Merci. \u00bb\n[77] Je conclus que M. Quinn aurait pu persuader d\u2019autres gestionnaires de RHDSC d\u2019accepter la mutation de M. Hughes \u00e0 un poste o\u00f9 il aurait re\u00e7u les accommodements requis en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Au lieu de cela, tout comme dans le cas des opinions n\u00e9gatives formul\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de M. Hughes par Paul Thomas, formateur, je conclus que M. Quinn \u00e9tait le pivot d\u2019une intrigue tram\u00e9e par la direction, faisant preuve d\u2019insensibilit\u00e9 pour la gravit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9pression dont M. Hughes souffrait et ne tenant pas compte de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP. Je conclus que M. Quinn n\u2019a pas fourni un r\u00e9cit objectif relativement au r\u00f4le qu\u2019il a jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de [traduction] \u00ab ne pas prolonger \u00bb le contrat \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e de M. Hughes, et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pleinement conscient du fait qu\u2019une prolongation de l\u2019emploi en question \u00e9tait essentielle en vue d\u2019offrir \u00e0 M. Hughes les accommodements dont il avait besoin compte tenu de sa d\u00e9ficience, question qui aurait pu n\u00e9cessiter de nombreux mois pour \u00eatre r\u00e9solue de mani\u00e8re ad\u00e9quate.\nC. Anne Milne [78] Anne Milne, directrice ex\u00e9cutive principale, RHDSC, Ouest canadien, a entendu parler de M. Hughes pour la premi\u00e8re fois quand il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande de mutation. Elle a affirm\u00e9 ne pas avoir pris la d\u00e9cision de ne pas muter M. Hughes : [traduction] \u00ab Je crois que c\u2019\u00e9tait M. Quinn. \u00bb \u00c0 plusieurs reprises, Mme Milne a fait preuve d\u2019incertitude dans ses r\u00e9ponses : elle ne se souvenait pas de la raison pour laquelle elle avait sign\u00e9 la lettre de [traduction] \u00ab non-prolongation \u00bb dat\u00e9e du 20 mai 2008; elle ne se souvenait pas du moment o\u00f9 elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise pour la premi\u00e8re fois au courant de l\u2019existence de la plainte de M. Hughes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne; elle croyait qu\u2019on lui avait dit que M. Hughes avait besoin d\u2019accommodements en raison de probl\u00e8mes de stress, sans qu\u2019il soit fait mention de d\u00e9pression. Lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire, Mme Milne a affirm\u00e9 ne pas avoir pris la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Hughes, et quand on lui a demand\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab Qui a pris cette d\u00e9cision? \u00bb, elle a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Je ne sais pas. \u00bb Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi elle avait sign\u00e9 la lettre envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Hughes, mais pas les deux autres lettres de cessation d\u2019emploi, elle n\u2019a pas fourni d\u2019explication satisfaisante.\n[79] Comme le d\u00e9montre l\u2019\u00e9change de courriels qui a eu lieu le 22 mai, la direction de RHDSC a engag\u00e9 d\u2019importantes discussions au sujet de la lettre de Mme Milne dat\u00e9e du 20 mai par laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Hughes. Je conclus que la lettre de Mme Milne \u00e9tait le fruit de la d\u00e9cision prise au niveau de la haute direction de rejeter M. Hughes et ses nombreuses demandes d\u2019emploi \u00e0 RHDSC. Consid\u00e9rant que la lettre en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e juste cinq semaines apr\u00e8s que M. Hughes a pour la seconde fois demand\u00e9 de l\u2019aide relativement \u00e0 sa d\u00e9pression, le paragraphe final de ladite lettre est assez incroyable : [traduction] \u00ab Je voudrais profiter de l\u2019occasion pour vous remercier des services que vous avez fournis pendant la dur\u00e9e de votre emploi \u00e0 Ressources humaines et D\u00e9veloppement social et vous souhaiter du succ\u00e8s dans vos projets. Si vous avez des questions au sujet de votre emploi ou de vos avantages sociaux, veuillez contacter votre chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe actuel. \u00bb Des copies de la lettre de cessation d\u2019emploi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9es \u00e0 Jim Quinn, gestionnaire de la prestation des services du projet PEC, \u00e0 Victoria, et \u00e0 Elizabeth Li, conseill\u00e8re en ressources humaines, \u00e0 Edmonton.\n[80] Le fait que Mme Milne ait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019application de cette mesure d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par la direction est particuli\u00e8rement contestable parce qu\u2019un tel geste \u00e9tait contraire \u00e0 l\u2019opinion formul\u00e9e par Caleigh Miller, consultante en ressources humaines, qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 en partie : [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] La d\u00e9pression est un trouble m\u00e9dical qui exige l\u2019intervention d\u2019un professionnel de la sant\u00e9. \u00bb Mme Milne a commis une erreur en ignorant l\u2019ampleur du conseil de Mme Miller, et le caract\u00e8re s\u00e9rieux de la d\u00e9ficience dont M. Hughes \u00e9tait atteint, erreur aggrav\u00e9e par le z\u00e8le fervent dont la direction a fait preuve pour se d\u00e9barrasser de celui\u2011ci.\nIV. Conclusions [81] Les t\u00e9moins de RHDSC ont justifi\u00e9 par des motifs rationnels la raison pour laquelle M. Hughes s\u2019\u00e9tait vu accorder une troisi\u00e8me prolongation de son contrat de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux PEC, ou une mutation dans un autre service, affirmant qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de gestion raisonnable qui d\u00e9pendait enti\u00e8rement de l\u2019obtention du sceau [traduction] \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb. Je conclus qu\u2019aux yeux de la direction de RHDSC, le fait d\u2019\u00e9tablir si un candidat qualifi\u00e9 est une [traduction] \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb ou non est un processus intangible, plus subjectif qu\u2019objectif, susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre teint\u00e9 de sentiments ou d\u2019opinions.\n[82] La LCDP exige qu\u2019un employeur continue d\u2019employer un travailleur frapp\u00e9 de d\u00e9ficience. Une fois qu\u2019une d\u00e9ficience est \u00e9tablie, un employeur doit constamment s\u2019efforcer d\u2019offrir des mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 concern\u00e9 en pr\u00e9voyant pour lui le travail qu\u2019il est capable d\u2019accomplir dans son \u00e9tat, aussi longtemps que cela ne se traduit pas par des contraintes excessives pour l\u2019employeur. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment qu\u2019on peut mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi.\n[83] Tout en sachant fort bien que M. Hughes \u00e9tait atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience du fait de sa d\u00e9pression et qu\u2019il avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 occuper un emploi qui se pr\u00eaterait \u00e0 ses \u00e9pisodes d\u00e9pressifs, et au m\u00e9pris du devoir qui lui incombait en application de la LCDP de continuer \u00e0 l\u2019employer, du moins aussi longtemps que l\u2019ampleur de sa d\u00e9ficience n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9finie, la direction de RHDSC a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment ignor\u00e9 le devoir que lui imposait la LCDP et a sommairement mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Hughes.\n[84] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par RHDSC, je conclus que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas r\u00e9fut\u00e9 la preuve prima facie du plaignant.\nV. D\u00e9cision [85] Je conclus que M. Hughes a \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9 \u00e0 un comportement qui constituait un acte discriminatoire, \u00e0 savoir que RHDSC, tout en sachant que M. Hughes souffrait d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience, a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment refus\u00e9 de continuer \u00e0 l\u2019employer, en contravention de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP.\n[86] Je conclus que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas soumis M. Hughes \u00e0 des repr\u00e9sailles ou \u00e0 des menaces de repr\u00e9sailles pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte en cause.\nVI. La r\u00e9paration A. Le pr\u00e9judice moral [87] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019un plaignant peut \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ pour le pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019il a subi en \u00e9tant victime d\u2019un acte discriminatoire.\n[88] En tant qu\u2019organisme du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et en sa qualit\u00e9 d\u2019employeur, RHDSC a le devoir primordial de s\u2019occuper rapidement et efficacement d\u2019un employ\u00e9 handicap\u00e9. En manquant \u00e0 ce devoir et en mettant fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Hughes, RHDSC a exacerb\u00e9 le stress et la d\u00e9pression dont celui\u2011ci souffrait.\n[89] Dans les circonstances, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 RHDSC de payer \u00e0 M. Hughes la somme maximale de 20 000 $ pour le pr\u00e9judice moral que ce dernier a subi.\nB. L\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale [90] Le paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 un intim\u00e9 de payer une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $ \u00e0 une victime d\u2019acte discriminatoire s\u2019il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[91] Je conclus que RHDSC a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment refus\u00e9 de continuer d\u2019employer M. Hughes et de g\u00e9rer sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[92] Dans les circonstances, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 RHDSC de payer la somme de 10 000 $ \u00e0 M. Hughes \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale.\nC. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats [93] En application du paragraphe 53(4) de la LCDP, des int\u00e9r\u00eats simples, payables \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e au titre du pr\u00e9judice moral et de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, seront calcul\u00e9s sur une base annuelle \u00e0 compter de la date de la plainte, en se fondant sur le taux d\u2019escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle).\nSign\u00e9e par\nWallace G.

Lustig\nDate : Le\n12 octobre 2012\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2012 TCDP\n23\nI. Le contexte\n[1] Les plaignantes ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne, all\u00e9guant que le financement in\u00e9quitable des services de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance fournis dans les r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00e9tait assimilable \u00e0 de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, LRC 1985, c H\u20116 (la Loi). Vu le caract\u00e8re singulier et l\u2019importance de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, ainsi que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la collectivit\u00e9 autochtone \u00e0 pouvoir observer les d\u00e9bats, l\u2019Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) (le R\u00e9seau de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision des peuples autochtones) a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal, dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 22 octobre 2009, l\u2019autorisation de filmer l\u2019audition de la plainte, ce qui inclut les d\u00e9clarations pr\u00e9liminaires et finales, les d\u00e9positions des t\u00e9moins, les questions pos\u00e9es, les objections formul\u00e9es et les arguments invoqu\u00e9s. Dans une d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 28 mai 2010 (2010 TCDP 16), le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 cette demande au motif que le fait d\u2019autoriser la pr\u00e9sence de cam\u00e9ras serait pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019audition et que cela pouvait miner l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats. L\u2019APTN a par la suite d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire concernant cette d\u00e9cision. Le 14 mars 2011, le Tribunal a rendu une d\u00e9cision (2011 TCDP 4) faisant droit \u00e0 une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 en vue de faire rejeter la plainte au motif que les questions qui y \u00e9taient soulev\u00e9es exc\u00e9daient sa comp\u00e9tence (la requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence). Cette d\u00e9cision a elle aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 plus tard l\u2019objet d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[2] Le 3 juin 2011, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendu sa d\u00e9cision au sujet de la demande de l\u2019APTN concernant la pr\u00e9sence de cam\u00e9ras aux audiences du Tribunal (2011 CF 810). La Cour a conclu que le Tribunal avait rendu la d\u00e9cision 2010 TCDP 16 sans tenir compte des documents qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis et que le r\u00e9sultat auquel il \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable si on l\u2019\u00e9valuait par rapport au dossier disponible. Elle a conclu que la d\u00e9cision ne satisfaisait pas au crit\u00e8re de la justification, de la transparence et de l\u2019intelligibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019exige l\u2019arr\u00eat Dunsmuir c. Nouveau\u2011Brunswick, [2008] 1 R.C.S. 190,2008 CSC 9, et elle a fait droit \u00e0 la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de l\u2019APTN. Cependant, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la d\u00e9cision 2011 TCDP 4 du Tribunal, o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que ce dernier n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour examiner la plainte sous-jacente, la question du r\u00e9examen de la d\u00e9cision de ne pas faire droit \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence de cam\u00e9ras a \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence soit judiciairement r\u00e9gl\u00e9e.\n[3] Le 18 avril 2012, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendu sa d\u00e9cision, sous la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence 2012 CF 445; elle a annul\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision 2011 TCDP 4 du Tribunal et renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire \u00e0 un membre instructeur diff\u00e9rent du Tribunal pour nouvelle d\u00e9cision, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses motifs. Le 10 juillet 2012, M. Gupta, vice-pr\u00e9sident et pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim, a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 une formation de trois membres instructeurs pour instruire la plainte.\n[4] Le 24 ao\u00fbt 2012, suite \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision 2012 CF 445 par laquelle la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a tranch\u00e9 la question de la requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence, le Tribunal a entrepris de r\u00e9examiner la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 autoriser la pr\u00e9sence de cam\u00e9ras, conform\u00e9ment aux motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision 2011 CF 810. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, qui est publi\u00e9e sous la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence 2012 TCDP 18, le Tribunal a statu\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait lieu d\u2019autoriser la pr\u00e9sence de cam\u00e9ras lors des audiences, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 des directives d\u2019ex\u00e9cution qu\u2019il restait encore \u00e0 d\u00e9finir.\n[5] Les directives d\u2019ex\u00e9cution propos\u00e9es que l\u2019APTN avait soumises dans sa demande initiale de 2009 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9es lors d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance tenue avec les parties et l\u2019APTN le 26 septembre 2012. Lors de cette conf\u00e9rence, la proposition de l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019ajouter le paragraphe \u00ab q) \u00bb aux directives d\u2019ex\u00e9cution a suscit\u00e9 un diff\u00e9rend. La modification propos\u00e9e \u00e9tait la suivante :\n[traduction] q) Aucun t\u00e9moignage ne sera enregistr\u00e9 ou diffus\u00e9, et cela s\u2019applique aux questions pos\u00e9es et aux r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es lors d\u2019un interrogatoire principal, lors d\u2019un contre-interrogatoire ou lors de n\u2019importe quelle autre participation du t\u00e9moin au sein de la salle d\u2019audience;\n[6] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la modification propos\u00e9e, les membres instructeurs ont demand\u00e9 que les parties fassent part au Tribunal de leur point de vue sur l\u2019ajout de la directive \u00ab q) \u00bb dans l\u2019espoir d\u2019en arriver \u00e0 un consensus. Malheureusement, les parties et l\u2019APTN n\u2019ont pas pu s\u2019entendre sur les modalit\u00e9s de cette directive et, \u00e0 la suite de br\u00e8ves d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations, le Tribunal a fait part de vive voix aux parties de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\n[7] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, publi\u00e9e sous la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence 2011 CF 810, le juge Lutfy s\u2019est prononc\u00e9 sur la question soulev\u00e9e par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 propos de la preuve selon laquelle certains des t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9 avaient fait part de leurs pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019enregistrement et de la diffusion de leur t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 cause du risque d\u2019un montage s\u00e9lectif, ainsi que de l\u2019effet sur d\u2019\u00e9ventuelles ordonnances d\u2019exclusion et de l\u2019effet sur des t\u00e9moins. Le juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 que le Tribunal avait omis d\u2019examiner si ces pr\u00e9occupations au sujet de la pr\u00e9sence de cam\u00e9ras avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9es dans la jurisprudence, soit R. c. Pilarinos, 2001 BCSC 1332, R. c. Fleet, (1994), 137 NSR (2d) 156 (CS), et Andreen c. Dairy Producers Co-operative Ltd. (No 2), (1994), 22 CHRR D\/80, et si ces d\u00e9cisions s\u2019appliquaient aux faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le juge a indiqu\u00e9, \u00e0 titre d\u2019exemple de cela, qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune preuve que des ordonnances d\u2019exclusion avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues ou \u00e9taient envisag\u00e9es, ou qu\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible de r\u00e9gler ce probl\u00e8me si jamais il se pr\u00e9sentait.\n[8] En examinant si ces d\u00e9cisions s\u2019appliquaient bel et bien \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\nII. L\u2019Analyse\n[\u2026] [A]ucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise au tribunal pour indiquer que les droits \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e qui \u00e9taient en jeu en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e9taient semblables \u00e0 ceux qui l\u2019\u00e9taient dans les affaires Pilarinos, Fleet et Andreen. Dans cette derni\u00e8re affaire, la pr\u00e9occupation relative \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e comme suit : [traduction] \u00ab [I]l y a une diff\u00e9rence entre, d\u2019une part, le fait de d\u00e9voiler des d\u00e9tails potentiellement intimes sur la vie d\u2019une personne dans une salle d\u2019audience o\u00f9 le public est pr\u00e9sent et, d\u2019autre part, celui de diffuser ces d\u00e9tails dans l\u2019ensemble de la province, et peut-\u00eatre dans l\u2019ensemble du pays, par l\u2019entremise d\u2019un r\u00e9seau de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision [\u2026] \u00bb (Paragraphe 14.) [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve soumise au tribunal, la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne n\u2019obligerait pas \u00e0 d\u00e9voiler des renseignements personnels sur un plaignant ou un intim\u00e9. Aucun des t\u00e9moins propos\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9tait une ancienne victime du syst\u00e8me de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Aucune personne n\u2019\u00e9tait nomm\u00e9e \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9e dans la plainte. Les t\u00e9moins du gouvernement traiteraient des politiques \u00e9tablies et des d\u00e9cisions prises au sujet de la prestation des services de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance. Les renseignements sur ces politiques et ces d\u00e9cisions sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 publiquement disponibles dans le cadre de plusieurs rapports, dont une National Policy Review (2000) (Revue des politiques nationales), \u00e9tablie par l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res nations et des repr\u00e9sentants d\u2019organismes de services aux familles et aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res nations, en partenariat avec le minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien, un rapport de la v\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada dat\u00e9 de 2008, un rapport du Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics dat\u00e9 de 2009, ainsi que l\u2019\u00c9tude canadienne sur l\u2019incidence des signalements de cas de violence et de n\u00e9gligence envers les enfants, qui est dat\u00e9e de 2008. Selon la preuve soumise au tribunal, les t\u00e9moignages et les observations porteraient principalement sur des politiques publiques bien connues.\n[9] Apr\u00e8s avoir pris en consid\u00e9ration les motifs du juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, les observations des parties sur la question, ainsi que les directives que l\u2019APTN a propos\u00e9es, le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que la proposition d\u2019exclure de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale l\u2019enregistrement et la diffusion de tous les t\u00e9moignages des t\u00e9moins est inutile et contraire \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendue en 2011. De l\u2019avis du Tribunal, les directives, dans leur libell\u00e9 actuel, r\u00e9pondent aux pr\u00e9occupations de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au sujet des t\u00e9moignages des t\u00e9moins. Le paragraphe l) des directives r\u00e9pond \u00e0 la question de la diffusion et de l\u2019exclusion des t\u00e9moins :\n[traduction] En cas d\u2019exclusion d\u2019un t\u00e9moin, le t\u00e9moignage du t\u00e9moin exclu et des personnes pr\u00e9sentes dans la salle d\u2019audience peut \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9 mais il ne pourra pas \u00eatre diffus\u00e9 avant que l\u2019on ait entendu le t\u00e9moignage du dernier de ces t\u00e9moins.\n[10] Par ailleurs, tenant compte des pr\u00e9occupations des t\u00e9moins quant au fait qu\u2019ils pouvaient \u00eatre tenus de divulguer des informations de nature personnelle qui seraient par la suite diffus\u00e9es \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision nationale, le Tribunal a remplac\u00e9 le paragraphe \u00ab q) \u00bb propos\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 par la directive suivante :\n[traduction] Il sera interdit de diffuser le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un t\u00e9moin qui s\u2019est object\u00e9 \u00e0 la diffusion de son t\u00e9moignage parce qu\u2019il contient des informations de nature personnelle une fois que le Tribunal aura examin\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage en question et confirm\u00e9 cette objection.\n[11] En appliquant cette directive, le Tribunal autorisera l\u2019enregistrement du t\u00e9moignage du t\u00e9moin et, par la suite, d\u00e9cidera si ce t\u00e9moignage contenait des informations de nature personnelle qui justifient que l\u2019on confirme l\u2019objection formul\u00e9e et l\u2019interdiction de diffusion. Pour \u00e9tablir s\u2019il convient de confirmer l\u2019objection, le Tribunal d\u00e9terminera si les informations divulgu\u00e9es sont des \u00ab renseignements personnels \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 3 de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels et il mettra en balance le droit \u00e0 la protection des renseignements personnels et le droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s du public, de m\u00eame que l\u2019objet sous-jacent de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, soit la promotion des droits de la personne. La question des objections relatives \u00e0 la diffusion de t\u00e9moignages sera, de cette fa\u00e7on, r\u00e9gl\u00e9e si jamais elle se pr\u00e9sente au cours des d\u00e9bats.\n[12] Le Tribunal n\u2019ajoutera pas le paragraphe \u00ab q) \u00bb que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a propos\u00e9 aux directives concernant la pr\u00e9sence de cam\u00e9ras. Le paragraphe \u00ab q) \u00bb des directives sera plut\u00f4t formul\u00e9 comme suit :\nIII.

L\u2019endroit d\u00e9sign\u00e9 assurera un acc\u00e8s raisonnable pour la couverture de l\u2019audience.\nd) La cam\u00e9ra et le mat\u00e9riel d\u2019enregistrement sonore seront discrets et ne causeront pas de distraction. Le son sera au minimum, les lumi\u00e8res seront discr\u00e8tes et le mat\u00e9riel sera utilis\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que les gens ne puissent pas savoir si un enregistrement est en cours. Avec l\u2019assentiment du Tribunal ou de ses repr\u00e9sentants d\u00e9sign\u00e9s, des modifications ou des ajouts pourront \u00eatre apport\u00e9s aux sources d\u2019\u00e9clairage de la salle, pourvu que les modifications ou les ajouts n\u2019entra\u00eenent pas de d\u00e9penses publiques importantes en mati\u00e8re d\u2019installation ou d\u2019entretien.\ne) Tout mat\u00e9riel autre que la cam\u00e9ra restera \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la salle d\u2019audience et n\u2019entravera pas l\u2019acc\u00e8s ou la circulation du public.\nf) Le personnel pr\u00e9sent dans la salle d\u2019audience sera v\u00eatu et se comportera d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui respecte le d\u00e9corum.\ng) Il sera interdit de filmer le public pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 l\u2019audience. La cam\u00e9ra sera positionn\u00e9e \u00e0 la droite du banc du commissaire et la tribune du public n\u2019appara\u00eetra dans aucun des plans film\u00e9s durant l\u2019audience. La cam\u00e9ra sera \u00e9teinte \u00e0 l\u2019heure du d\u00eener et pendant les pauses.\nh) Il sera interdit de filmer les gens pr\u00e9sents dans l\u2019immeuble du Tribunal ou les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui s\u2019y d\u00e9roulent lors d\u2019une suspension ou d\u2019un ajournement.\ni) La cam\u00e9ra ne focalisera ni sur les documents qui se trouvent sur la table des avocats ou celle des membres instructeurs ou qui se trouvent en la possession des avocats ou des membres instructeurs, ni sur tout autre document utilis\u00e9 lors de l\u2019interrogatoire d\u2019un t\u00e9moin qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 admis en preuve.

Cette transmission sera gratuite. Il s\u2019agira d\u2019une transmission en direct; aucune bande d\u2019archives ne sera fournie.\np) Aucun film, aucune bande vid\u00e9o, aucune photo ou aucune reproduction audio obtenu dans le cadre de la couverture d\u2019une audience du Tribunal ne sera admissible en preuve dans la proc\u00e9dure vis\u00e9e, dans une proc\u00e9dure future ou une proc\u00e9dure connexe, ou lors d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s ou d\u2019un appel li\u00e9 \u00e0 ces proc\u00e9dures. La pr\u00e9sente directive ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure introduite afin d\u2019examiner la conduite de l\u2019APTN durant l\u2019enregistrement et la diffusion de la proc\u00e9dure vis\u00e9e ou afin de v\u00e9rifier si l\u2019APTN respecte les directives du Tribunal.\nq) Il sera interdit de diffuser le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un t\u00e9moin qui s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la diffusion de son t\u00e9moignage parce qu\u2019il contient des renseignements de nature personnelle une fois que le Tribunal aura examin\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage en question et confirm\u00e9 cette objection.\nr) Compte tenu du fait que le Tribunal se trouve en terrain inconnu en adoptant les pr\u00e9sentes directives et qu\u2019il souhaite les mettre en \u0153uvre ad\u00e9quatement, le Tribunal se r\u00e9serve le droit, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les parties, de modifier les pr\u00e9sentes directives, au besoin, pour s\u2019assurer du bon d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019instance. Sans restreindre la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, en cas de non-respect des pr\u00e9sentes directives, le Tribunal se r\u00e9serve le droit de restreindre ou d\u2019interdire l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux cam\u00e9ras pendant une audience.\ns) En tout temps, le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour traiter les questions qui pourraient \u00eatre soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019enregistrement et de la diffusion des audiences, et pour \u00e9mettre des directives s\u2019il y a lieu.",

LE CONTEXTE [1] Les plaignantes ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne, all\u00e9guant que le financement in\u00e9quitable des services de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance fournis dans les r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00e9tait assimilable \u00e0 de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, LRC 1985, c H\u20116 (la Loi). Le 22 d\u00e9cembre 2009, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada (la SSEFPN) a signifi\u00e9 un avis de requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que celle-ci inclue des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi (la requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte). Le 7 f\u00e9vrier 2011, Mme Cindy Blackstock, directrice administrative de la Caring Society et de la SSEFPN, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une seconde plainte relative aux droits de la personne, all\u00e9guant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles. Cette plainte se situe actuellement au stade de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) et n\u2019a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal.\n[2] Compte tenu de la requ\u00eate dat\u00e9e du 21 d\u00e9cembre 2009 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vue de faire rejeter la plainte au motif que les questions soulev\u00e9es exc\u00e8dent la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal (la requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence) ainsi que de la d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 14 mars 2011, publi\u00e9e sous la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence 2011 TCDP 4, par laquelle le Tribunal a fait droit \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate, le Tribunal ne s\u2019est jamais prononc\u00e9 sur la requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte.

Lustig et B\u00e9langer, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e pour entendre la pr\u00e9sente affaire (2012 TCDP 16). Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 16 juillet 2012, l\u2019avocat de la SSEFPN a port\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019attention du Tribunal la requ\u00eate, dat\u00e9e du 22 d\u00e9cembre 2009, qui visait \u00e0 faire modifier la plainte , laquelle requ\u00eate est l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nII. Les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles [4] Les plaignantes soutiennent que, depuis qu\u2019elles ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte initiale, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre Mme Blackstock. Le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2009, all\u00e8guent-elles, Mme Blackstock a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e par les Chiefs of Ontario \u00e0 assister \u00e0 une r\u00e9union avec M. David McArthur, dans les bureaux du MAINC, au sujet du financement des services de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance en Ontario. Elle \u00e9tait l\u2019une des cinq personnes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9es par les Chiefs of Ontario \u00e0 assister \u00e0 cette r\u00e9union \u00e0 titre d\u2019aide technique. \u00c0 l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de Mme Blackstock, M. David McArthur lui a dit qu\u2019il savait qu\u2019elle avait un certain nombre de [traduction] \u00ab dol\u00e9ances \u00bb au sujet des services de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance, dont une plainte relative aux droits de la personne, et qu\u2019il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rerait la rencontrer \u00e0 un autre moment. M. McArthur a clairement dit qu\u2019il refuserait de rencontrer les Chiefs of Ontario si Mme Blackstock \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re d\u2019attendre \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la salle de r\u00e9union, dans l\u2019aire d\u2019accueil, pendant que se d\u00e9roulait la r\u00e9union. Aucune autre personne invit\u00e9e \u00e0 fournir un soutien technique aux Chiefs of Ontario n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 exclue de la r\u00e9union. Mme Blackstock a \u00e9crit le 15 d\u00e9cembre 2009 au ministre Chuck Strahl pour lui faire part de l\u2019incident en d\u00e9tail et demander qu\u2019on lui explique pourquoi elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 exclue.\n[5] Selon les plaignantes, ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la premi\u00e8re fois que l\u2019on emp\u00eachait Mme Blackstock de fournir un soutien \u00e0 des organismes qui avaient besoin de son expertise. Un incident semblable \u00e9tait survenu en 2008, quand la British Columbia Children and Family Services Association (la BCCFSA) avait invit\u00e9 Mme Blackstock \u00e0 lui fournir un soutien lors des n\u00e9gociations entourant l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019un mod\u00e8le de financement am\u00e9lior\u00e9 avec des hauts fonctionnaires du MAINC. Ces derniers avaient refus\u00e9 de se r\u00e9unir avec la BCCFSA si Mme Blackstock \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente parce que celle-ci avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre le MAINC.\n[6] De plus, Mme Blackstock soutient qu\u2019en d\u00e9cembre 2009 elle a appris que des hauts fonctionnaires du MAINC et du minist\u00e8re de la Justice surveillaient sa page Facebook personnelle et priv\u00e9e. Des courriels internes du MAINC obtenus \u00e0 la suite de diverses demandes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels \u00e9tablissent un lien entre la surveillance de sa page Facebook et de son compte Twitter personnels et une tentative visant \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir [traduction] \u00ab d\u2019autres mobiles \u00bb pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte relative aux droits de la personne des plaignantes. Mme Blackstock explique que ces transgressions de sa vie personnelle constituent une forme d\u2019intimidation qui pourrait avoir une incidence sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du processus suivi devant le Tribunal. Les plaignantes soutiennent qu\u2019avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte relative aux droits de la personne, Mme Blackstock \u00e9tait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement consult\u00e9e par des hauts fonctionnaires du MAINC et travaillait en collaboration avec le Minist\u00e8re \u00e0 divers projets et \u00e9tudes destin\u00e9s \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer le sort des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui \u00e9taient pris en charge.\nIII. Les positions des parties La position des plaignantes [7] Les plaignantes font valoir que le paragraphe 3(2) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e8dure) conf\u00e8re au Tribunal un vaste pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re de trancher les requ\u00eates et pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019il est possible de modifier en tout temps une plainte avant le d\u00e9but d\u2019une audience par souci de c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9 ainsi qu\u2019en vue de promouvoir les droits proc\u00e9duraux des parties : Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Association canadienne des employ\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, 2002 CFPI 776, aux paragraphes 30 \u00e0 32. Le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 appliquer pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu de permettre que l\u2019on modifie la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Virk c. Bell Canada, 2004 TCDP 10, au paragraphe 7 : \u00ab [\u2026] [L]e crit\u00e8re \u00e0 appliquer consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles sont, de par leur nature, li\u00e9es, du moins par le plaignant, aux all\u00e9gations qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte initiale et peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme soutenables. \u00bb Pour arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, le Tribunal \u00ab ne devrait pas s\u2019engager dans un examen approfondi du bien-fond\u00e9 de la modification \u00bb; il devrait plut\u00f4t autoriser la modification, sauf s\u2019il est manifeste et \u00e9vident que les all\u00e9gations n\u2019ont aucune chance de succ\u00e8s : Bressette c. Conseil de bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle et Stony Point, 2004 TCDP 02, au paragraphe 6. La d\u00e9cision Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 1, aux paragraphes 10 et 12, reconna\u00eet qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la comp\u00e9tence qu\u2019exerce le Tribunal sur une plainte d\u00e9coule d\u2019un renvoi fait par la Commission, il doit y avoir certaines limites \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tendue des modifications; cette contrainte \u00ab n\u2019est toutefois qu\u2019un aspect de l\u2019affaire \u00bb car \u00ab les tribunaux qui traitent des droits de la personne ont adopt\u00e9 une d\u00e9marche lib\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des modifications \u00bb, une d\u00e9marche qui cadre avec la nature r\u00e9paratrice de la LCDP.\n[8] Les plaignantes font valoir que les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles sont manifestement li\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte de la Caring Society. En fait, M. McArthur a express\u00e9ment d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Blackstock n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9sente dans la salle de r\u00e9union \u00e0 cause de la plainte relative aux droits de la personne de la Caring Society. Ind\u00e9pendamment des raisons pour lesquelles M. McArthur s\u2019est exprim\u00e9 ainsi, un plaignant raisonnable aurait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 ce traitement pr\u00e9judiciable comme des repr\u00e9sailles : Witwicky c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2007 TCDP 25. Par ailleurs, les plaignantes soutiennent que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne subira aucun pr\u00e9judice si l\u2019on apporte la modification en vue d\u2019ajouter les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles car il sait depuis un certain temps que les pr\u00e9tentions des plaignantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet de repr\u00e9sailles et il a eu l\u2019occasion de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces all\u00e9gations peu apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident. Par ailleurs, obliger le Tribunal \u00e0 trancher s\u00e9par\u00e9ment les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles provoquerait un d\u00e9doublement des proc\u00e9dures, qui mettrait en cause les m\u00eames parties, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui se recoupent ainsi que des questions interreli\u00e9es. Les plaignantes ajoutent que le pr\u00e9judice que l\u2019intim\u00e9 pourrait subir par suite de la modification de la plainte en vue d\u2019y inclure les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles serait contrebalanc\u00e9 par le pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019elles-m\u00eames subiraient par suite de la s\u00e9paration artificielle de ces all\u00e9gations connexes en de multiples instances. Si la requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte est accueillie, les plaignantes conviennent de demander conjointement \u00e0 la Commission de mettre en suspens la plainte de repr\u00e9sailles dont elle est actuellement saisie, en attendant qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit rendue sur le fond de la plainte modifi\u00e9e.\nLa position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [9] L\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis que le fait de modifier \u00e0 ce stade-ci la plainte pour y inclure des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles serait faire abstraction du m\u00e9canisme de plainte \u00e9tabli en vertu de la Loi et priver les parties de cette proc\u00e9dure. La plainte de repr\u00e9sailles fait actuellement l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate par la Commission et, au cours de cette enqu\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9 aura sa premi\u00e8re occasion de r\u00e9pondre au fond de la plainte et d\u2019exposer sa version des faits. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019une fois que la Commission aura conclu son enqu\u00eate, apr\u00e8s avoir tenu compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve soumis, qu\u2019elle d\u00e9cidera soit de rejeter la plainte, soit de la renvoyer au Tribunal. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, si l\u2019on fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte, toutes ces \u00e9tapes seront court\u2011circuit\u00e9es, et cela aura pour r\u00e9sultat de le priver d\u2019une occasion de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la plainte et de compromettre ainsi son droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale au stade de l\u2019enqu\u00eate.\n[10] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient \u00e9galement que le fait de modifier la plainte aurait pour r\u00e9sultat d\u2019\u00e9largir la port\u00e9e de cette derni\u00e8re et de supplanter la Commission dans son r\u00f4le, ce qui lui serait donc pr\u00e9judiciable. Selon lui, la nature sous-jacente des deux plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est diff\u00e9rente : la plainte initiale a trait \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations de financement concernant les services de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance fournis aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations vivant dans les r\u00e9serves, et la plainte de repr\u00e9sailles a trait \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations d\u00e9coulant d\u2019\u00e9changes personnels entre la directrice administrative de la Caring Society et des hauts fonctionnaires du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. L\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis que le lien entre les plaintes est insuffisant pour justifier que l\u2019on modifie la plainte initiale \u00e0 ce stade de l\u2019instance et que le Tribunal devrait autoriser la Commission \u00e0 d\u00e9cider de mani\u00e8re compl\u00e8te et \u00e9clair\u00e9e si, dans les circonstances, il est justifi\u00e9 que le Tribunal instruise la plainte de repr\u00e9sailles.\nIV. La position de la Commission [11] La Commission pr\u00e9tend que le rejet de la requ\u00eate concernant la modification de la plainte permettrait \u00e0 un intim\u00e9 d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre les repr\u00e9sentants d\u2019organismes de bienfaisance qui ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes au nom de victimes. \u00c0 son avis, la Loi doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re lib\u00e9rale et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger le dirigeant ou le repr\u00e9sentant d\u2019un organisme de bienfaisance que l\u2019on identifie \u00e0 une plainte : Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9-e-s de techniques professionnelles et de bureau d\u2019Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, section locale 2000, 2008 CSC 43.\n[12] Comme l\u2019indique l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi, \u00ab [c]onstitue un acte discriminatoire le fait [\u2026] d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant \u00bb. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, en signant la plainte initiale, Mme Blackstock est le \u00ab plaignant \u00bb et il faudrait donc qu\u2019elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie de la m\u00eame protection contre des repr\u00e9sailles que les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations pour le compte desquels elle a sign\u00e9. Toute autre interpr\u00e9tation aurait pour r\u00e9sultat que tous seraient prot\u00e9g\u00e9s contre de pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es repr\u00e9sailles, \u00e0 l\u2019exception des parties qui d\u00e9poseraient des plaintes repr\u00e9sentatives pour le compte des victimes. Par ailleurs, la Commission est d\u2019avis que la preuve d\u00e9note que Mme Blackstock a \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9e comme plaignante par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nV. L\u2019analyse et la d\u00e9cision [13] Il est bien \u00e9tabli en droit que le Tribunal a la capacit\u00e9 de modifier une plainte. Dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Parent, 2006 CF 1313, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 ce principe, au paragraphe 30 :\nLe Tribunal jouit d\u2019une discr\u00e9tion consid\u00e9rable relativement \u00e0 l\u2019instruction des plaintes en vertu des paragraphes 48.9(1) et (2) et des articles 49 et 50 de la Loi. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de cette discr\u00e9tion pour traiter d\u2019une demande d\u2019amendement, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canderel Lt\u00e9e c. Canada (C.A.), [1994] 1 C.F. 3, 1993 IIJCan 2990 (C.A.F.), le juge Robert D\u00e9cary a rappel\u00e9 que : \u00ab [\u2026] la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est qu\u2019une modification devrait \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 tout stade de l\u2019action aux fins de d\u00e9terminer les v\u00e9ritables questions litigieuses entre les parties, pourvu, notamment, que cette autorisation ne cause pas d\u2019injustice \u00e0 l\u2019autre partie que des d\u00e9pens ne pourraient r\u00e9parer, et qu\u2019elle serve les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice \u00bb.\n[14] Quant \u00e0 la question de modifier une plainte de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 pouvoir examiner des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles dans le cadre de la m\u00eame instance que celle qui a trait aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination qui sont \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la plainte initiale, le Tribunal en a d\u00e9j\u00e0 trait\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Kavanagh c. S.C.C. (31 mai 1999), T505\/2298 (T.C.D.P.). Au paragraphe 9 de cette d\u00e9cision, la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal a repris le raisonnement appliqu\u00e9 par la Commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate de l\u2019Ontario dans Entrop c. Imperial Oil Limited (1994) 23 C.H.R.R. D\/186 en disant qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab serait difficile au plan pratique, inefficace et injuste d\u2019exiger que les personnes pr\u00e9sentent des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles seulement dans le cadre d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure distincte \u00bb. Pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu de faire droit \u00e0 la modification, le Tribunal se doit de d\u00e9cider si \u00ab les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles sont, de par leur nature, li\u00e9es, du moins par le plaignant, aux all\u00e9gations qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte initiale et peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme soutenables \u00bb : Virk c. Bell Canada, 2004 TCDP 10, au paragraphe 7; voir aussi Fowler c. Flicka Gymnastics Club, 31 C.H.R.R. D\/397 (B.C.H.R.C.), Cook c. Premi\u00e8re nation d\u2019Onion Lake, [2002] C.H.R.R. no 12, au paragraphe 17, ainsi que Tran, Cam-Linh (Holly) c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2010 TCDP 31, au paragraphe 18.\n[15] En plus d\u2019\u00e9tablir un lien entre la plainte et la modification, il faut aussi que le Tribunal examine le pr\u00e9judice que pourrait subir l\u2019intim\u00e9 si l\u2019on autorisait la plaignante \u00e0 modifier sa plainte. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Parent, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 40 :\nLa question du pr\u00e9judice est le facteur pr\u00e9dominant a \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 dans de telles circonstances. L\u2019amendement ne doit pas \u00eatre accord\u00e9 s\u2019il cause un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9. Ici, bien que la plainte ait pu \u00eatre amend\u00e9e \u00e0 un stade moins avanc\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures, rien dans la preuve n\u2019indique que les Forces canadiennes n\u2019\u00e9taient en mesure de se pr\u00e9parer et de faire valoir sa position sur les questions soulev\u00e9es. L\u2019amendement n\u2019a caus\u00e9 aucun pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e et dans les circonstances, la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients penche en faveur du d\u00e9fendeur Alain Parent.\n[16] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les membres instructeurs sont d\u2019avis que le fait de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une audition de la plainte initiale et de tenir par la suite une audience distincte en vue de traiter des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles ferait obstacle \u00e0 la bonne administration de la justice et les emp\u00eacherait d\u2019instruire les plaintes sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique, ainsi que le prescrit le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi. Par ailleurs, les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles des plaignantes d\u00e9coulent de la m\u00eame matrice factuelle que celle de la plainte initiale car les deux plaintes ont en commun les m\u00eames plaignantes et les repr\u00e9sailles all\u00e9gu\u00e9es sont li\u00e9es au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte initiale contre l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[17] Par ailleurs, les membres instructeurs sont d\u2019avis que la modification ne portera pas pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 car celui-ci a eu amplement le temps et aura amplement l\u2019occasion de r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles que les plaignantes ont formul\u00e9es. Instruire la plainte initiale et les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles dans le cadre de la m\u00eame instance, plut\u00f4t que de s\u00e9parer artificiellement les all\u00e9gations en de multiples instances, est une option qui est favorable \u00e0 toutes les parties et qui sert l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice.\n[18] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte est accueillie.

D\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate. 2\nI. Contexte et objections pr\u00e9liminaires [1] Le 29 juillet 2011, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a demand\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) qu\u2019il instruise la plainte de Norm Murray (le plaignant) contre la Commission de l\u2019immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s (l\u2019intim\u00e9e) en vertu du paragraphe 49(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personnes, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H\u20116 (la Loi).\n[2] Le 10 avril 2012, la Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pour qu\u2019il soit ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de produire certains documents en sa possession ou sous son contr\u00f4le. Le 24 avril 2012, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa propre requ\u00eate pour qu\u2019il soit ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de produire certains documents. Dans ses observations en r\u00e9ponse aux requ\u00eates en divulgation, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les affidavits des personnes suivantes : Antonella Gullia et Angela Henry. En r\u00e9ponse aux observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, tant la Commission que le plaignant se sont oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des affidavits de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[3] Le 4 juin 2012, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pour l\u2019obtention d\u2019une ordonnance de rejet de la plainte. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de sa requ\u00eate en rejet, l\u2019intim\u00e9e se fonde aussi sur les affidavits de mesdames Gullia et Henry. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet, le plaignant s\u2019oppose encore une fois \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des affidavits de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[4] Pour sa part, l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019oppose au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la pi\u00e8ce F de l\u2019affidavit de France Saikali. L\u2019affidavit de Mme Saikali a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par la Commission \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses observations en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en divulgation.\nII. Les positions des parties [5] Selon la Commission, les affidavits de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sont inadmissibles. La Commission soutient que l\u2019affidavit de Mme Gullia traite principalement du processus et de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission, \u00e0 partir du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte en 2004, jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal. La Commission soutient qu\u2019une telle discussion n\u2019est pas pertinente quant \u00e0 la question de la divulgation, et qu\u2019il appert que l\u2019intim\u00e9e conteste la d\u00e9cision de la Commission. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019affidavit de Mme Henry, la Commission avance qu\u2019il contient un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert d\u2019un t\u00e9moin non qualifi\u00e9, et que la Commission n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019interroger l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur sa bonne foi dans la production d\u2019un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert. La Commission ajoute que l\u2019affidavit de Mme Henry contient des pr\u00e9cisions sur la politique du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en emploi qui ne sont pas pertinentes dans la pr\u00e9sente instance du Tribunal.\n[6] Le plaignant souscrit aux observations de la Commission relativement \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des affidavits de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. En ce qui a trait en particulier \u00e0 l\u2019affidavit de Mme Henry, le plaignant avance que les affirmations faites relativement aux politiques et aux pratiques du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et d\u2019autres minist\u00e8res du gouvernement relativement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en emploi ne sont pas pertinentes quant aux requ\u00eates. En outre, Mme Henry n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue en tant qu\u2019experte, et elle n\u2019est pas en position de pr\u00e9senter un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert au Tribunal.\n[7] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9pondu aux arguments de la Commission et \u00e0 ceux du plaignant en ce qui concerne l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des affidavits dans la r\u00e9plique faisant partie de la requ\u00eate en rejet. Selon la Commission, cela \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une r\u00e9plique aux observations en r\u00e9ponse de la Commission et du plaignant relativement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en divulgation, et, par cons\u00e9quent, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une observation en r\u00e9plique non appropri\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission demande que les paragraphes 5 \u00e0 7 des observations en r\u00e9plique de l\u2019intim\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet soient radi\u00e9s. Pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e, cela inclut ses arguments relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019objection aux affidavits dans sa r\u00e9plique \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet, parce que le plaignant a une fois de plus soulev\u00e9 la question dans sa r\u00e9plique \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet.\n[8] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019affidavit de Mme Gullia, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019il ne vise pas la r\u00e9vision de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission, et ce n\u2019est pas le but de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve. Plut\u00f4t, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve est pertinent pour l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la port\u00e9e de la plainte soumise au Tribunal. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019affidavit de Mme Henry, directrice au Secr\u00e9tariat du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor est l\u2019employeur du plaignant, et il incombe au Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor d\u2019\u00e9tablir des rapports pour tous les minist\u00e8res figurant \u00e0 l\u2019annexe II de la Loi sur la gestion des finances publiques. Par cons\u00e9quent, la position du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor sur la possibilit\u00e9 de divulgation de renseignements sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en emploi est pertinente quant aux questions dont le Tribunal est saisi. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ajoute que, en ce qui concerne le fait que l\u2019affidavit contient un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert, il est admissible compte tenu du fait que les t\u00e9moins profanes peuvent donner des t\u00e9moignages d\u2019expert lorsqu\u2019ils ont la capacit\u00e9 et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience requise pour donner un avis sur la question pertinente, ou bien parce que les comp\u00e9tences de la personne qui souscrit l\u2019affidavit sont telles qu\u2019elle est qualifi\u00e9e pour donner un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert sur un point pr\u00e9cis.\n[9] En ce qui concerne l\u2019affidavit de Mme Saikali, l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019oppose au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la copie non caviard\u00e9e du rapport suppl\u00e9mentaire d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le m\u00eame rapport, mais sous une forme caviard\u00e9e. Pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e, les parties du rapport qu\u2019elle a caviard\u00e9es contiennent les renseignements qu\u2019elle ne veut pas voir divulgu\u00e9s dans la requ\u00eate en divulgation. L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande donc que le Tribunal ne permette pas le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ces parties des documents de la Commission.\nIII. D\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate [10] Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi, \u00ab [l]\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique \u00bb. De plus, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) de la Loi accorde au Tribunal de vastes pouvoirs pour ce qui est \u00ab de recevoir [\u2026] des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou des renseignements par d\u00e9claration verbale ou \u00e9crite sous serment ou par tout autre moyen qu\u2019il estime indiqu\u00e9, ind\u00e9pendamment de leur admissibilit\u00e9 devant un tribunal judiciaire \u00bb.\n[11] La Commission et le plaignant s\u2019opposent \u00e0 la preuve par affidavit de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans leurs r\u00e9pliques respectives aux requ\u00eates en divulgation. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de sa requ\u00eate en rejet, l\u2019intim\u00e9e se fonde sur la m\u00eame preuve par affidavit. En r\u00e9plique \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet, le plaignant s\u2019oppose encore une fois \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de la preuve par affidavit. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9pondu aux arguments dans ses observations en r\u00e9plique \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019opposition \u00e0 la preuve par affidavit \u00e9tait encore une fois soulev\u00e9e dans le contexte de la requ\u00eate en rejet et que le plaignant s\u2019\u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur les m\u00eames arguments qu\u2019il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans le contexte de la requ\u00eate en divulgation \u2013 \u00e0 savoir le fait qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur les observations de la Commission \u2013 il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas incorrect que l\u2019intim\u00e9e r\u00e9ponde aux arguments du plaignant et de la Commission comme elle l\u2019a fait. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 radier les paragraphes 5 \u00e0 7 de la r\u00e9plique de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet.\n[12] En ce qui concerne les affidavits de mesdames Gullia et Henry, ni la Commission ni le plaignant ne pr\u00e9tendent qu\u2019un pr\u00e9judice ou une injustice a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ces affidavits. Plut\u00f4t, ils avancent que les renseignements contenus dans les affidavits ne sont pas pertinents et qu\u2019ils contiennent des t\u00e9moignages d\u2019expert provenant de t\u00e9moins non qualifi\u00e9s. Vu le caract\u00e8re non formel de la proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal, et vu les vastes pouvoirs pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) pour l\u2019acceptation de renseignements et d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas port\u00e9 \u00e0 radier compl\u00e8tement les affidavits. Plut\u00f4t, le Tribunal examinera les objections de la Commission et du plaignant lorsqu\u2019il soup\u00e8sera la valeur des renseignements pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans les affidavits.\n[13] En ce qui concerne la pi\u00e8ce F de l\u2019affidavit de Mme Saikali, la Commission se fonde sur le rapport suppl\u00e9mentaire d\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son all\u00e9gation selon laquelle pendant l\u2019enqu\u00eate relative \u00e0 la plainte l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fourni des donn\u00e9es statistiques sur la repr\u00e9sentation pour 2003 et 2004 et elle a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer la confidentialit\u00e9 des renseignements. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le Tribunal examine les donn\u00e9es statistiques non caviard\u00e9es contenues dans le rapport suppl\u00e9mentaire d\u2019enqu\u00eate pour que la Commission \u00e9tablisse le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de cet argument. Il suffit de dire que les donn\u00e9es statistiques sur la repr\u00e9sentation pour 2003 et 2004 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es comme faisant partie du rapport suppl\u00e9mentaire d\u2019enqu\u00eate. \u00c0 la pr\u00e9sente \u00e9tape de la proc\u00e9dure, avant d\u2019avoir \u00e0 trancher les requ\u00eates en divulgation, et les all\u00e9gations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 relative aux renseignements statistiques, il n\u2019est pas appropri\u00e9 d\u2019examiner la version non caviard\u00e9e du rapport suppl\u00e9mentaire d\u2019enqu\u00eate. Par cons\u00e9quent, la pi\u00e8ce F de l\u2019affidavit de Mme Saikali est scell\u00e9e aux fins des pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates, et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit statu\u00e9 sur les requ\u00eates, le Tribunal se fondera sur la version caviard\u00e9e du rapport suppl\u00e9mentaire d\u2019enqu\u00eate fourni par l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

D\u00e9cisions. 21\nI. Mise en situation [1] Le plaignant, Chris Hughes, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 contre l\u2019intim\u00e9, Transports Canada, une plainte pour discrimination en vertu de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne all\u00e9guant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait refus\u00e9 de l\u2019embaucher \u00e0 cause d\u2019une invalidit\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9.

En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait refus\u00e9 de l\u2019engager suite au d\u00e9voilement de ses invalidit\u00e9s, contrairement aux dispositions de la LCDP.\n[10] Dans sa requ\u00eate \u00e9galement, le plaignant fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e9galement aux faits que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait refus\u00e9 d\u2019embaucher le plaignant en \u00e9tablissant que le plaignant n\u2019aurait pas r\u00e9ussi un des crit\u00e8re de qualification, soit : d\u2019\u00eatre attentif aux d\u00e9tails (souci du d\u00e9tail). Le plaignant reproche donc \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de ne pas l\u2019avoir embauch\u00e9 non seulement \u00e0 cause du manquement indiqu\u00e9 ci-avant, en ce qui attrait aux faits qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas attentif aux d\u00e9tails, qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas le \u00ab souci du d\u00e9tail \u00bb, mais \u00e9galement \u00e0 cause de son invalidit\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 suite aux plaintes que le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre l\u2019ASFC et l\u2019ARC, lesquelles furent divulgu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9. \u00c0 cette \u00e9gard, le Tribunal fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux paragraphes 35 et 36 de la requ\u00eate en divulgation de preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant et dat\u00e9e du 11 mai 2012.\n[11] En conclusion, le plaignant indique que les documents dont il a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans sa requ\u00eate, ont un lien direct avec les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par le requ\u00e9rant.\n[12] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite dat\u00e9e du 15 juin 2012, l\u2019intim\u00e9, Transports Canada, fait valoir ce qui suit \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la requ\u00eate du plaignant :\n(a) Les documents requis par le plaignant ne seraient pas requis en vertu de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne particuli\u00e8rement du sous paragraphe (a) car, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, cet article ne permettrait pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir une analyse comparative en ce qui attrait aux raisons de refuser d\u2019employer un individu lors d\u2019un concours \u00e0 cet effet.\n(b) Dans un deuxi\u00e8me temps, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux faits que les informations recherch\u00e9es par le plaignant seraient prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, (1985), chapitre P-21 en cons\u00e9quence, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne serait soumis \u00e0 cette loi.\n[13] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, les dispositions de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP ne permettraient pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir une analyse comparative tel que requis par l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans sa plainte et que tel n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u2019intention du Parlement \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[14] De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9 indique dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite que les informations recherch\u00e9es par le plaignant sont toutes prot\u00e9g\u00e9es en vertu de l\u2019article 3 de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, L.R.C., 1985, chapitre P-21, il appuie cette pr\u00e9tention en faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Warman c.

Le plaignant indique que le texte de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP n\u2019interdit pas une analyse comparative de diff\u00e9rents candidats qui ont fait partie d\u2019un concours pour l\u2019obtention d\u2019un emploi et \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, il a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CSC 53 (Mowat).\n[16] De plus, le plaignant maintient toujours que les documents recherch\u00e9s sont pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019examen des plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par le plaignant contre l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[17] Dans un deuxi\u00e8me temps, le plaignant indique que la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels n\u2019interdit pas la production de documents requis dans sa requ\u00eate et plus particuli\u00e8rement, il fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 8b) de la Loi qui indique que la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels n\u2019interdit pas la production de documents lorsqu\u2019ils sont requis en vertu d\u2019une loi du Parlement, soit dans l\u2019instance, la LCDP (Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, L.R.C. (1985), chapitre P-21, au paragraphe 8(3)).\n[18] Finalement, dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, le plaignant fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e9galement que les documents recherch\u00e9s font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es dans une plainte en vertu de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP.\n[19] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, les documents recherch\u00e9s lui permettraient d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve circonstancielle devant lui permettre d\u2019\u00e9tablir que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait commis un acte discriminatoire en usant de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du plaignant et ce suivant les dispositions de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP.\nAnalyse du droit et des faits sur la requ\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant Chris Hughes en production des documents [20] Apr\u00e8s une lecture exhaustive des diff\u00e9rents m\u00e9moires fournis par les parties, apr\u00e8s avoir pris connaissance des dispositions pertinentes de la LCDP et \u00e9galement des r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tablies par le Tribunal, plus particuli\u00e8rement les dispositions des alin\u00e9as 6(1)b) et e) desdites r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re qu\u2019il y a lieu de faire droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant afin d\u2019obtenir les documents recherch\u00e9s consid\u00e9rant que lesdits documents recherch\u00e9s par le plaignant sont pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019instruction des plaintes que le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[21] Toutefois, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re qu\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019oblit\u00e9rer toutes informations (nom, adresse, date de naissance, sexe, etc.) et ce, afin d\u2019en assurer le caract\u00e8re confidentiel et personnel des informations pouvant \u00eatre transmises par l\u2019intim\u00e9 au plaignant.\n[22] Avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite du 15 juin dernier, le Tribunal ne consid\u00e8re pas que les dispositions de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP interdisent une analyse comparative de la candidature dans le cadre d\u2019un concours d\u2019emploi comme dans le cas sous \u00e9tude.\n[23] De m\u00eame, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que les dispositions de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels L.R.C., n\u2019interdisent pas la production de documents comme ceux recherch\u00e9s par le plaignant dans sa requ\u00eate, en autant que le caract\u00e8re confidentiel des candidatures soumises soit prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n[24] Dans son analyse, le Tribunal a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente sur le sujet, soit l\u2019arr\u00eat Leslie Palm c. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, section locale 500, Richard Wilkinson et Cliff Willicome, 2012 TCDP 11 (CanLII).\n[25] Dans la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019il a rendue, le membre Susheel Gupta a fait une analyse exhaustive de la jurisprudence applicable en mati\u00e8re de production de documents et je retiens donc les m\u00eames principes dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, et je cite :\n[9] Le droit \u00e0 une audition \u00e9quitable exige que \u00ab [\u2026] l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 soit inform\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es contre lui et ait la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre \u00bb (Charkaoui c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2007 CSC 9, au paragraphe 53). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les parties doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de prendre connaissance de la preuve de la partie adverse afin de pouvoir r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 tout \u00e9l\u00e9ment pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 leur cause (voir Ruby c. Canada (Solliciteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2002 CSC 75, au paragraphe 40). Pour donner \u00e0 une partie la possibilit\u00e9 de le faire, il faut que les renseignements pertinents qui sont en la possession ou sous le contr\u00f4le de la partie adverse lui soient communiqu\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on pleine et enti\u00e8re.\n[10] Pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il convient de communiquer des documents ou non, le Tribunal a \u00e9tabli un processus en trois \u00e9tapes : 1) d\u00e9terminer si les renseignements sont d\u2019une \u00ab pertinence possible \u00bb, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que la partie qui demande la production des renseignements ou des documents doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il existe un lien entre les renseignements ou les documents demand\u00e9s et les questions en litige; 2) sans examiner les documents, d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe une raison imp\u00e9rieuse de pr\u00e9server le caract\u00e8re confidentiel de ces derniers; 3) si le Tribunal n\u2019est pas en mesure de r\u00e9gler la question sans examiner les documents, il doit dans ce cas les examiner et d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu de les produire (voir Day c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale), (6 d\u00e9cembre 2002), T627\/1501 et T628\/1601, d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate no 3, au paragraphe 7 (TCDP); et Guay c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2004 TCDP 34, au paragraphe 44 [Guay]).\n[11] Le Tribunal a reconnu qu\u2019un plaignant a droit au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e et \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 de ses dossiers m\u00e9dicaux (voir Beaudry c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), (24 juillet 2002), T694\/8201, d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate no 1, au paragraphe 7 (TCDP) [Beaudry]; McAvinn c. Strait Crossing Bridge Ltd., (3 janvier 2001), T558\/1600, d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate no 3, au paragraphe 3 (TCDP) [McAvinn]). Toutefois, ce droit peut cesser d\u2019exister quand cette personne invoque son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 (voir McAvinn, au paragraphe 4 (TCDP), Guay, au paragraphe 45, et Syndicat canadien des communications, de l\u2019\u00e9nergie et du papier et Femmes-Action c. Bell Canada, 2005 TCDP 9, aux paragraphes 9 \u00e0 11). Dans les cas o\u00f9 il a ordonn\u00e9 que l\u2019on communique des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, le Tribunal a eu recours aux proc\u00e9dures qui suivent pour prot\u00e9ger le respect de la vie priv\u00e9e et la confidentialit\u00e9 des renseignements :\n\u00c9tudier en d\u00e9tail les documents afin de d\u00e9terminer lesquels d\u2019entre eux sont bel et bien li\u00e9s aux troubles m\u00e9dicaux en question (voir Guay, McAvinn et Beaudry);\nImposer des conditions \u00e0 propos de ceux qui peuvent voir les documents et les copier (voir Shiv Chopra c. Sant\u00e9 Canada, 2007 TCDP 10, Micheline Montreuil c. Forces canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 45, et Beaudry).\n[26] De m\u00eame, dans une autre d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, Bushey c. Sharma, 2003 TCDP 5 (Bushey), dat\u00e9e du 11 f\u00e9vrier 2003, l\u2019ancien membre Athanasios D. Hadjis a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au crit\u00e8re de la pertinence en ce qui a trait au principe directeur qui s\u2019applique en mati\u00e8re de divulgation :\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 a contest\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019on ne lui ait communiqu\u00e9 aucune copie du compte rendu du r\u00e8glement conclu avec les syndicats. Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne soit pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par avocat et agisse en son propre nom, je crois comprendre qu\u2019il soutient avoir droit \u00e0 ce que ce document lui soit communiqu\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal. Ce paragraphe, s\u2019il est lu de concert avec l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d), oblige une partie \u00e0 fournir aux autres parties une copie de tous les documents en sa possession qui sont pertinents \u00e0 toute question en cause et pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9. Le crit\u00e8re qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard consiste en fait \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les documents en question sont \u201cpotentiellement pertinents\u201d \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019audience.\n(Bushey, au paragraphe 4, notes de bas de page omises.)\n[27] Le membre Edward P. Lustig a \u00e9galement cit\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision Bushey dans la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019il a rendue relativement \u00e0 une question de divulgation dans l\u2019affaire Elizabeth Cannon, Rhoda Godin et Carol Knowles c. Ressources humaines et D\u00e9veloppement social Canada, 2011 CHRT 7.\n[28] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, un lien rationnel doit exister entre les documents demand\u00e9s et les questions contenues dans une requ\u00eate, de telle sorte, que l\u2019on puisse pr\u00e9tendre \u00e0 la pertinence probable de l\u2019information recherch\u00e9e \u00e9galement, que cette divulgation soit utile, appropri\u00e9e et susceptible de faire progresser le d\u00e9bat et repose sur un objectif acceptable dans un dossier. La recherche de document doit donc se rapporter au litige. (Smith & Nephew Inc. c. Glegg, 2005CSC31, voir paragraphe 23 de la d\u00e9cision).\n[29] Dans son analyse, le Tribunal note que la requ\u00eate du plaignant recherche la production de diff\u00e9rents documents qui auraient servi \u00e0 un comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection et ce afin de v\u00e9rifier la pr\u00e9sence ou non d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments discriminatoires et ce en contravention avec l\u2019article 7 sous paragraphe (a) de m\u00eame que l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[30] Le Tribunal note \u00e9galement, et cela, sans entrer dans une analyse approfondie de la valeur probante desdits documents recherch\u00e9s, que les documents permettraient au plaignant d\u2019\u00e9toffer sa preuve et ce, pour les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de discrimination dont il fait reproche \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[31] Le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments recherch\u00e9s poss\u00e8dent le caract\u00e8re de pertinence, et pourraient \u00eatre utile dans le litige qui oppose le plaignant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 et ce en vertu de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[32] Dans une d\u00e9cision que le Tribunal a \u00e9galement consult\u00e9, soit la d\u00e9cision Ray Davidson c. Sant\u00e9 Canada, 2012 TCDP 1 (CanLII) (Ray Davidson), une question similaire \u00e0 celle sous \u00e9tude avait alors \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tudi\u00e9e par un autre membre du tribunal.\n[33] En effet, dans cette derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cision, il y avait \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une demande de production de documents en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation de candidats dans un processus de s\u00e9lection qui avait fait l\u2019objet de deux appels aupr\u00e8s du (CACFP).\n[34] Dans cet arr\u00eat, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne avait refus\u00e9 la permission pour produire de tels documents, consid\u00e9rant que le CACFP repr\u00e9sentait un autre Tribunal et en cons\u00e9quence, il n\u2019y avait pas lieu de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision des d\u00e9cisions d\u2019un autre Tribunal et donc de rejuger une deuxi\u00e8me fois ce qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par une instance juridictionnelle diff\u00e9rente.\n[35] Le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que dans le dossier du plaignant Hughes, un simple comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection ne repr\u00e9sente pas une instance juridictionnelle valable au sens de la d\u00e9cision Ray Davidson et de l\u2019arr\u00eat Colombie\u2011Britannique (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) c. Figliola, 2011 CSC 52 (voir le paragraphe 9 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Ray Davidson).\n[36] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne la production des documents apparaissant dans la requ\u00eate du plaignant Hughes avec oblit\u00e9ration de toutes informations personnelles en ce qui a trait aux diff\u00e9rents candidats qui ont postul\u00e9s pour les m\u00eame postes que le plaignant, incluant le nom, l\u2019adresse, la date de naissance et le sexe, de m\u00eame que toutes autres informations pouvant permettre d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019identit\u00e9 des autres candidats.\nB. Requ\u00eate de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne [37] Dans une deuxi\u00e8me requ\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne en date du 15 mai 2012, la Commission recherche la production de deux types de documents : le premier type \u00e9tant des documents de nature non confidentielle alors que le deuxi\u00e8me type de document requis par la Commission aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 de documents privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[38] Le Tribunal examinera donc dans l\u2019ordre chacune des deux s\u00e9ries de documents requis par la Commission.\nDocuments non privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s [39] Ainsi, la Commission requiert dans un premier temps la production des documents suivants de l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nLa pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate vise l\u2019obtention :\n1. d\u2019une ordonnance de production par l\u2019intim\u00e9, Transports Canada, de tous les documents possiblement pertinents qui sont en sa possession ou sous son contr\u00f4le, notamment :\na) Tous les documents ou renseignements de quelque nature que ce soit, sous forme num\u00e9rique ou autre, concernant l\u2019appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique qui a eu lieu en f\u00e9vrier 2006 entre M. Lavers et M. Hughes, y compris, entre autres choses, les documents relatifs aux discussions que M. Lavers et les autres membres du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection ou les employ\u00e9s des ressources humaines ont eues au sujet des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences fournies par M. Hughes, des autres plaintes que ce dernier a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre d\u2019autres minist\u00e8res ou de sa d\u00e9ficience; les notes prises par les membres du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection, les employ\u00e9s des ressources humaines ou toute autre personne pendant le processus de v\u00e9rification des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences.\nb) Tous les documents ou renseignements de quelque nature que ce soit, sous forme num\u00e9rique ou autre, concernant les courriels envoy\u00e9s par M. Hughes le 19 juin 2006 et le 29 novembre 2006.\nc) Tous les documents ou renseignements de quelque nature que ce soit, sous forme num\u00e9rique ou autre, concernant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 2 mars 2006 qui a r\u00e9uni les membres du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection et qui a port\u00e9 sur la demande d\u2019emploi de M. Hughes et la v\u00e9rification de ses r\u00e9f\u00e9rences.\nd) Tous les documents ou renseignements de quelque nature que ce soit, sous forme num\u00e9rique ou autre, concernant les plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par M. Hughes contre d\u2019autres minist\u00e8res.\ne) Tous les documents ou renseignements de quelque nature que ce soit, sous forme num\u00e9rique ou autre, concernant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 20 f\u00e9vrier 2006 \u00e0 laquelle M. Lavers et Sonya Wood ont particip\u00e9, y compris, entre autres choses, une copie non expurg\u00e9e d\u2019une note que cette derni\u00e8re avait port\u00e9e au dossier et qui concernait sa conversation de f\u00e9vrier 2006 avec M. Lavers.\n[40] Le Tribunal note que la Commission ne requiert plus le sous paragraphe (f) du paragraphe 1 de sa requ\u00eate en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission de la fonction publique de 2007 de la plainte faite par le plaignant. En cons\u00e9quence, le Tribunal ne se prononcera donc pas sur le sous paragraphe (f) du paragraphe 1 de la requ\u00eate de la Commission.\n[41] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse dat\u00e9e du 15 juin 2012, l\u2019intim\u00e9 indique que tous documents en son pouvoir, possession ou contr\u00f4le et d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant ceux apparaissant dans les paragraphes 1 (a) \u00e0 (e) de la requ\u00eate de la Commission, ne peuvent \u00eatre produit car ils n\u2019existeraient pas. L\u2019intim\u00e9 reconna\u00eet son obligation de produire tous documents pertinents pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de confidentialit\u00e9 n\u2019est requis et l\u2019intim\u00e9 indique \u00e9galement qu\u2019elle s\u2019engage \u00e0 produire tous documents si jamais elle en apprenait l\u2019existence. Toutefois, l\u2019intim\u00e9 confirme qu\u2019elle n\u2019a aucun autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui aurait pu \u00eatre port\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019attention du conseiller de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[42] De m\u00eame, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au paragraphe 1(d) de l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne en ce qui a trait \u00e0 des documents pouvant s\u2019originer d\u2019autres agences ou d\u00e9partements et l\u2019intim\u00e9 indique que si de tels documents existaient ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas en sa possession, pouvoir ou contr\u00f4le et en cons\u00e9quence, ils ne peuvent pas faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une ordonnance du Tribunal de les produire. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9galement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels laquelle interdirait un tel ordre.\n[43] Plus loin dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e9galement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 all\u00e8gue ce qui suit aux paragraphes 11, 12 et 13 de sa r\u00e9ponse :\n[Traduction]\n11. Les documents qui n\u2019ont pas trait aux questions en litige n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produits. En outre, tous les documents qui sont par ailleurs prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, ou qui ne sont pas pertinents relativement \u00e0 une plainte introduite en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a), ne peuvent pas \u00eatre produits. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP est tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cis en ce qui a trait au refus d\u2019employer un individu. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) diff\u00e8re de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) dans le sens o\u00f9 il n\u2019exige pas de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une analyse comparative. Cela signifie que l\u2019examen des qualifications des autres candidats n\u2019est pas pertinent en ce qui a trait \u00e0 un refus d\u2019employer un individu.\n12. Consid\u00e9rant la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 de la requ\u00eate de la Commission, de deux choses l\u2019une : soit le plaignant a d\u00e9j\u00e0 les documents demand\u00e9s en sa possession, soit ces documents n\u2019existent pas. Si le plaignant avait ces documents en sa possession, il aurait d\u00fb en faire \u00e9tat dans sa liste de documents.\n13. Il va sans dire qu\u2019il est impossible de produire des documents qui n\u2019existent pas. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de s\u2019appuyer sur une loi pour l\u2019affirmer.\n[44] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9, la Commission fait valoir que les arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour refuser de produire les documents apparaissant dans sa requ\u00eate correspondent ni plus ni moins qu\u2019\u00e0 une \u00abblanquet response\u00bb, et en cons\u00e9quence, la Commission requiert une r\u00e9ponse pr\u00e9cise pour chacun des items apparaissant dans sa requ\u00eate.\n[45] Sans vouloir r\u00e9it\u00e9rer de nouveau les motifs de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal en ce qui a trait aux principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de production de documents tel que le Tribunal l\u2019a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la requ\u00eate du plaignant pour la production de documents, le Tribunal comprend que la Commission recherche \u00e9galement des informations devant permettre d\u2019\u00e9tayer sa position en ce qui a trait \u00e0 une preuve de discrimination que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait commis \u00e0 l\u2019endroit du plaignant Hughes.\n[46] Le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que les informations recherch\u00e9es par la Commission dans sa requ\u00eate pour production de document au sous alin\u00e9a 1 (a) \u00e0 (e) de sa requ\u00eate peuvent avoir rapport aux plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par le plaignant \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Toutefois, il est ind\u00e9niable que l\u2019exigence de la production de tous documents ou mat\u00e9riel de quelque nature que ce soit qui appara\u00eet dans la formulation de chacun des items requis par la Commission ne peuvent pas servir \u00e0 une exp\u00e9dition de p\u00eache comme l\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 nos tribunaux \u00e0 plusieurs reprises dans plusieurs d\u00e9cisions, (voir plus particuli\u00e8rement CTEA c. Bell Canada, [2000] C.H.R.D. No. 6, T503\/2098, num\u00e9ro 2, paragraphes 12 \u00e0 14; paragraphes suivants.\n[47] Qu\u2019en est-il dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier?\n[48] Le Tribunal fait face \u00e0 une situation o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 indique qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait pas les documents en sa possession et\/ou n\u2019existeraient pas et cela dans une phras\u00e9ologie qui appara\u00eet for vague au Tribunal.\n[49] Dans un tel contexte, il appert au Tribunal qu\u2019il serait prudent et aviser de requ\u00e9rir de l\u2019intim\u00e9 une attestation claire et non \u00e9quivoque \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019elle ne peut produire aucun des documents requis par la Commission dans sa requ\u00eate en ce qui a trait aux paragraphes 1 (a) \u00e0 (e).\n[50] Afin d\u2019\u00e9claircir la pr\u00e9sente situation, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re qu\u2019il serait donc opportun que l\u2019intim\u00e9 produise un affidavit \u00e0 l\u2019effet d\u2019indiquer de fa\u00e7on claire et formelle, pour chacun des documents requis par la Commission, qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas en sa possession des documents requis par la Commission. Le Tribunal r\u00e9f\u00e8re le lecteur sur les raisons de tel affidavit au paragraphe 58 qui suit.\n[51] De plus, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par l\u2019intim\u00e9 de produire un tel affidavit, et cela dans un d\u00e9lai de quinze (15) jours \u00e0 compter de pr\u00e9sent jugement, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que de tels documents existent et en cons\u00e9quence, il est donc ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de produire de tels documents sans autre d\u00e9lai subs\u00e9quent.\nDocuments pour lequel un privil\u00e8ge de confidentialit\u00e9 est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 [52] Dans la deuxi\u00e8me partie de la requ\u00eate de la Commission, cette derni\u00e8re requiert de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qu\u2019il produise tous documents pour lequel l\u2019intim\u00e9 a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 un privil\u00e8ge de confidentialit\u00e9. Ce privil\u00e8ge de confidentialit\u00e9 appara\u00eet dans une liste de documents apparaissant dans la correspondance \u00e9chang\u00e9e entre les parties mais plus particuli\u00e8rement dans la requ\u00eate de la Commission dat\u00e9e du 24 avril 2012 et d\u00e9crits comme suit :\n[Traduction]\n1.

Les notes manuscrites, non dat\u00e9es.\n[53] Le Tribunal note que l\u2019intim\u00e9 oppose une fin de non-recevoir \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la Commission en ce qui a trait \u00e0 cette deuxi\u00e8me partie des documents de la requ\u00eate de la Commission au motif que ces documents seraient privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s (liste des documents privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s).\n[54] Dans un premier temps, le Tribunal note que la requ\u00eate de la Commission pour la production de tous les documents apparaissant dans la liste de documents privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s, \u00e0 l\u2019exception du document portant le num\u00e9ro 16 pour lequel la Commission ne requiert pas de production, apparaissent comme \u00e9tant non clairement identifi\u00e9 afin de les relier au dossier du plaignant.\n[55] En d\u2019autres termes, l\u2019exigence de la production de ces documents, tel que r\u00e9dig\u00e9, ne fait pas r\u00e9f\u00e9rence directement \u00e0 une information qui s\u2019av\u00e8rerait utile ou n\u00e9cessaire pour les fins du dossier du plaignant, mais ce point n\u2019apparait pas comme \u00e9tant fatal au stade de la requ\u00eate pour production de documents de la Commission. La pertinence de tels documents sera appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e plus profond\u00e9ment par le membre instructeur lors de l\u2019audition au fond du pr\u00e9sent dossier.\n[56] Dans un deuxi\u00e8me temps, le Tribunal note que l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un privil\u00e8ge de confidentialit\u00e9 et de fa\u00e7on corr\u00e9lative, il n\u2019indique pas d\u2019aucune fa\u00e7on, pour chacun des items requis, en quoi le privil\u00e8ge de confidentialit\u00e9 devrait s\u2019appliquer en l\u2019instance.\n[57] En d\u2019autres termes, quelle est la nature du privil\u00e8ge de confidentialit\u00e9 qui devrait s\u2019appliquer pour chacun des items apparaissant dans la liste des documents qui sont requis par la Commission?\n[58] Dans la jurisprudence applicable \u00e0 une telle question de confidentialit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l\u2019invocation du secret professionnel, le Tribunal a consult\u00e9 plusieurs d\u00e9cisions dont les plus pertinentes apparaissent ci-apr\u00e8s.\n[59] D\u2019abord dans la d\u00e9cision Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c.

Dans cette d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, les membres du Tribunal avaient alors fait mention de ce qui suit :\nToutefois, on ne peut pas vraiment dissocier la question de la description de celle de la contestation, et il n\u2019y a pas de raison d\u2019examiner les documents qui, de toute \u00e9vidence, sont privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s. Dans beaucoup de cas, par exemple, le simple fait qu\u2019un document ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli par un conseiller juridique est suffisant pour prouver qu\u2019il est assorti du privil\u00e8ge du secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat. Ce serait un abus de droit que de tenter de d\u00e9terminer dans quelles circonstances il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer si la description des documents est suffisante pour permettre \u00e0 l\u2019autre partie de d\u00e9cider si elle d\u00e9sire contester l\u2019all\u00e9gation de privil\u00e8ge de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Il semble au d\u00e9part qu\u2019au moins deux exigences minimales doivent \u00eatre respect\u00e9es. La premi\u00e8re est qu\u2019il doit y avoir une description suffisante des documents physiques; la deuxi\u00e8me est que la description d\u2019un document devrait expliquer pourquoi il est assorti d\u2019un privil\u00e8ge particulier.\n[60] De m\u00eame, le Tribunal s\u2019\u00e9tait exprim\u00e9 comme suit \u00e9galement un peu plus loin dans la d\u00e9cision :\nPar cons\u00e9quent, la seule question \u00e0 examiner \u00e0 ce moment-ci est celle de l\u2019identification. Essentiellement, il s\u2019agit de se demander si les inscriptions d\u00e9crivant chaque document, ainsi que l\u2019all\u00e9gation de privil\u00e8ge, sont suffisantes pour informer les autres parties des raisons pour lesquelles il n\u2019existe pas d\u2019obligation de divulguer le document. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il est \u00e9vident que l\u2019intim\u00e9 est oblig\u00e9 d\u2019indiquer, sans compromettre le privil\u00e8ge, le lien entre sa revendication g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de privil\u00e8ge et le document en question. Il s\u2019ensuit normalement que ce dernier ne devrait pas \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Pour certains autres documents, il faut se demander, en outre, si le fait qu\u2019une partie les ait divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019autre partie l\u2019emp\u00eache d\u2019invoquer le privil\u00e8ge \u00e0 l\u2019audience m\u00eame.\nNous avons reconnu que tous les facteurs mentionn\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9 devraient \u00eatre pris en compte pour d\u00e9terminer si un document est d\u00e9crit convenablement aux fins de la divulgation. Cependant, aucun de ces facteurs n\u2019est d\u00e9terminant en soi, et la question \u00e0 savoir si un document est suffisamment identifi\u00e9 est en fin de compte une affaire de jugement. D\u2019autre part, les r\u00e8gles ordinaires de pratique pr\u00e9cisent clairement qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas suffisant d\u2019indiquer qu\u2019un document existe et d\u2019all\u00e9guer qu\u2019il est privil\u00e9gi\u00e9. Il faut aller plus loin et informer les autres parties de l\u2019objet de ce document et expliquer les raisons pour lesquelles le privil\u00e8ge pertinent s\u2019applique.\nD\u2019autre part, ce serait une erreur que de d\u00e9finir une formule indiquant les exigences \u00e0 satisfaire dans chaque cas. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une question pragmatique qui exige de la latitude et du jugement, et il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de fournir une description d\u00e9taill\u00e9e des documents. Dans beaucoup de cas, il peut \u00eatre suffisant de fournir une description extr\u00eamement br\u00e8ve ou de pr\u00e9ciser les circonstances qui expliquent la conclusion \u00e9vidente quant au privil\u00e8ge revendiqu\u00e9. Le seul fait qu\u2019un conseiller juridique ait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un document particulier est habituellement suffisant pour all\u00e9guer le privil\u00e8ge du secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat. Dans d\u2019autres cas, l\u2019indication qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de notes manuscrites ou d\u2019autres documents priv\u00e9s est suffisante pour attester le caract\u00e8re priv\u00e9 des documents et expliquer pourquoi le privil\u00e8ge a \u00e9t\u00e9 revendiqu\u00e9. Dans le cas des n\u00e9gociations collectives, la mention \u00ab proposition de l\u2019employeur \u00bb accompagn\u00e9e de la date correspondante peut \u00eatre suffisante pour attester la nature du document.\n[61] Ces m\u00eames principes r\u00e9apparaissent dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Poitras c. Twinn, 2001 CFPI 456 (CanLII), o\u00f9 on retrouve le passage qui suit pour la m\u00eame question :\n[5] Cela nous am\u00e8ne \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me partie de la requ\u00eate, soit la revendication d\u2019un privil\u00e8ge dans l\u2019affidavit de documents de la Couronne, Sur ce point, je suis d\u2019accord avec la Bande pour dire que cette revendication de privil\u00e8ge est trop englobante et trop vague. Vingt-deux documents ou liasses de documents ne sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9s que par un num\u00e9ro de classement. Un autre dossier est identifi\u00e9 par une description seulement, soit comme le dossier d\u2019instance des avocats. Aucune indication n\u2019est fournie relativement \u00e0 ces documents ou liasses quant au nombre de documents qu\u2019elles contiennent, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant et quant \u00e0 leur date; l\u2019auteur et le destinataire de chaque document ne sont indiqu\u00e9s qu\u2019en termes tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9raux. Cela ne suffit manifestement pas. Je reconnais que la description d\u2019un document \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard duquel un privil\u00e8ge est revendiqu\u00e9 ne doit pas \u00eatre de nature \u00e0 faire \u00e9chec \u00e0 la revendication de privil\u00e8ge, mais la simple indication de la date et du nom, du titre ou des initiales de son auteur et de son destinataire ne font habituellement pas \u00e9chec \u00e0 la revendication de privil\u00e8ge, sauf lorsqu\u2019il existe des circonstances exceptionnelles, ce qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[6] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019ordonnerai que la requ\u00eate soit accueillie en partie et la Couronne devra produire d\u2019ici 30 jours un affidavit de documents additionnels relativement \u00e0 sa revendication de privil\u00e8ge.\n[62] De m\u00eame, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat 1185740 Ontario Ltd. c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re du revenu national), 1999 CanLII 9151 (CF), en faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Lumonics Research Ltd. c. Gordon Gould, Refac International Limited, and Patlex Corporation, [1983] 2C.F. 360, on retrouve ce qui suit :\n[6] Dans Lumonics Research Ltd. c. Gordon Gould, Refac International Limited, and Patlex Corporation, [1983] 2C.F. 360, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a clairement \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il incombait \u00e0 la partie qui s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la production de documents en raison du caract\u00e8re privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 de la communication d\u2019en \u00e9tablir les faits pertinents. \u00c0 mon avis, les d\u00e9fendeurs dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire ne se sont pas d\u00e9charg\u00e9s du fardeau de la preuve qui reposait sur eux. L\u2019avocat de la demanderesse a soulev\u00e9 comme argument qu\u2019il incombait aux d\u00e9fendeurs d\u2019\u00e9tablir les faits qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la protection du secret qu\u2019ils invoquaient et que les d\u00e9fendeurs n\u2019avaient fourni aucune preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Je souscris enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019avocat. L\u2019avocat a pr\u00e9tendu, \u00e0 juste titre selon moi, que Mme Castle, avocate des d\u00e9fendeurs, ne pouvait pas, aux fins de l\u2019argumentation, d\u00e9poser en preuve des faits sur lesquels les d\u00e9fendeurs se basaient pour invoquer le caract\u00e8re secret des communications entre avocat et client. De toute \u00e9vidence, cette all\u00e9gation ne peut \u00eatre contest\u00e9e. L\u2019avocat de la demanderesse m\u2019a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du juge Rothstein (maintenant juge de la Cour d\u2019appel) dans Evans (K.F.) Ltd. C. Canada (ministre des Affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res) reflex, [1996] 106F.T.R. 210. Dans Evans, le juge Rothstein devait d\u00e9cider si le secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 certains types de documents. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de sa pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle les documents ne devaient pas \u00eatre produits parce qu\u2019ils tombaient sous le coup du secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat, le ministre d\u00e9fendeur avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve l\u2019affidavit de Me Beverly Anne Chomyn, l\u2019avocate dont l\u2019opinion juridique \u00e9tait en cause.\n[7] Le juge Rothstein en est venu \u00e0 conclure que le d\u00e9fendeur avait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la protection de la communication parce qu\u2019une partie en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e. Je n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 me prononcer sur la question de la renonciation \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que j\u2019ai conclu que les d\u00e9fendeurs ne s\u2019\u00e9taient pas d\u00e9charg\u00e9s de leur fardeau. Il est clair, \u00e0 la lecture de la d\u00e9cision du juge Rothstein dans Evans et de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel dans Lumonics, qu\u2019il importe d\u2019\u00e9tablir les circonstances pertinentes au moyen d\u2019un affidavit pour pouvoir invoquer la protection du secret des communications entre un avocat et son client. Dans l\u2019affaire qui nous occupe, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les d\u00e9fendeurs n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 d\u2019affidavit \u00e9tablissant les faits pertinents, je me trouve dans l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de d\u00e9terminer si le caract\u00e8re secret des communications entre avocat et client s\u2019applique aux passages occult\u00e9s des notes de service. Comme il incombait aux d\u00e9fendeurs de s\u2019acquitter du fardeau de la preuve, la requ\u00eate de la demanderesse est accueillie et les d\u00e9fendeurs devront d\u00e9poser les passages occult\u00e9s dans les dix jours de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance.\n[63] \u00c0 partir des principes invoqu\u00e9s ci-dessus, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que l\u2019invocation d\u2019un privil\u00e8ge de confidentialit\u00e9 ou de secret professionnel ne peut \u00eatre valablement invoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 moins que ne soit produit un document dans lequel se trouve les informations d\u00e9crivant d\u2019une part le document vis\u00e9 et d\u2019autre part, expliquant les raisons de l\u2019invocation du privil\u00e8ge de confidentialit\u00e9, ce document pouvant prendre la forme d\u2019un affidavit circonstanci\u00e9 de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Le tribunal mentionne que l\u2019exigence d\u2019un affidavit n\u2019appara\u00eet pas dans les r\u00e8gles de preuve du TCDP qui sont diff\u00e9rentes de celles de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada, mais le recours \u00e0 un affidavit est certes appropri\u00e9 et r\u00e9pond mieux \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019une r\u00e9ponse plus formaliste comme dans le cas sous \u00e9tude.\n[64] Or, le Tribunal n\u2019est saisi d\u2019aucun affidavit en l\u2019instance de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9, si ce n\u2019est qu\u2019une simple invocation du privil\u00e8ge de confidentialit\u00e9 de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[65] La simple invocation d\u2019un privil\u00e8ge de confidentialit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas acceptable en l\u2019absence de motivation appropri\u00e9e tel qu\u2019en a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 nos tribunaux et dont le Tribunal a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ci-avant.\n[66] Bien s\u00fbr, il n\u2019est pas dans les pouvoirs du Tribunal de d\u00e9battre la question de fond en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019existence de privil\u00e8ge de confidentialit\u00e9 en raison d\u2019une relation client\/avocat. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le Tribunal n\u2019a aucune juridiction pour ce faire tel qu\u2019en a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la jurisprudence plus particuli\u00e8rement dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Commissaire \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e du Commissaire \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e du Canada c. Blood Tribe Department of Health et Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada et al., [2008] 2 R.C.S. 574, 2008 CSC 44.\n[67] Toutefois, la simple invocation d\u2019un privil\u00e8ge de confidentialit\u00e9, sans explication valable ne compromettant pas ledit privil\u00e8ge, ne peut \u00eatre accept\u00e9 par le Tribunal.\n[68] Cons\u00e9quemment, si l\u2019intim\u00e9 veut invoquer valablement un privil\u00e8ge de confidentialit\u00e9 au regard des items apparaissant dans la liste de la requ\u00eate de la Commission, il lui est sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de fournir un affidavit suffisant pour chacun des items apparaissant dans ladite liste en indiquant ce en quoi lesdits documents ne peuvent \u00eatre produits soit en raison de leur caract\u00e8re confidentiel, soit \u00e0 cause d\u2019une relation client\/avocat et\/ou \u00e9tabli en vue de la pr\u00e9paration d\u2019un litige, et cela dans un d\u00e9lai de quinze (15) jours \u00e0 compter du pr\u00e9sent jugement.\n[69] \u00c0 d\u00e9faut par l\u2019intim\u00e9 de produire un tel affidavit dans le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, il est donc ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de produire les documents apparaissant dans la requ\u00eate de la Commission et ce, sans autre d\u00e9lai.\nIII. D\u00e9cisions Par ces motifs, le Tribunal ordonne ce qui suit :\nSur la requ\u00eate du plaignant Chris Hughes :\n(a) Il est ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de produire les documents apparaissant dans la requ\u00eate du plaignant dat\u00e9e du 11 mai 2012, en oblit\u00e9rant toutes informations devant permettre d\u2019identifier chacune des personnes en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 chacun des documents qui doivent \u00eatre produit par l\u2019intim\u00e9;\nSur la requ\u00eate de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne :\n(b) Il est ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de produire tous les documents non privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s qui sont requis par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, \u00e0 moins que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne produise un affidavit circonstanci\u00e9 indiquant ce en quoi l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne peut produire lesdits documents valablement, ledit affidavit devant \u00eatre produit dans un d\u00e9lai de quinze (15) jours \u00e0 compter de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019un tel affidavit, l\u2019intim\u00e9 devra fournir tous les documents non privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s apparaissant dans la requ\u00eate de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne;\n(c) Il est ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de produire tous les documents apparaissant dans la requ\u00eate de la Commission en ce qui a trait \u00e0 des documents privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019exception du document num\u00e9ro 16, \u00e0 moins que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne produise un affidavit circonstanci\u00e9 indiquant pour chacun des items une raison valable devant permettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019invoquer un privil\u00e8ge de confidentialit\u00e9, ledit affidavit devant \u00eatre produit dans un d\u00e9lai de quinze (15) jours \u00e0 compter de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019un tel affidavit, l\u2019intim\u00e9 devra fournir tous les documents apparaissant dans la requ\u00eate de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, au paragraphe (d) de sa requ\u00eate, \u00e0 l\u2019exception du paragraphe 16.\nSign\u00e9e par\nRobert Malo\nMembre du tribunal\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 25 octobre 2012\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1656\/01111\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Chris Hughes c.

La plainte [1] Le 26 octobre 2009, Mme Ravi Lally a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte, pi\u00e8ce C\u20111, en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi) contre TELUS Communications Inc. (TELUS). La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a men\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate sur la plainte, et ensuite, elle l\u2019a transmise au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) pour instruction.\nII. Les articles pertinents de la Loi [2] Les articles pertinents de la Loi sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9s en ces termes :\n3(1) Pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\nIII. L\u2019instruction [3] L\u2019instruction de la plainte de Mme Lally a commenc\u00e9 le 9 octobre 2012 et elle a continu\u00e9 les 10, 11 et 12 octobre 2012; la plainte \u00e9tait instruite par Wallace Gilby Craig, le membre instructeur du Tribunal. La plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des documents en preuve, et des t\u00e9moignages pour \u00e9tablir, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s (une cause prima facie), que TELUS avait commis un acte discriminatoire \u00e0 son encontre alors qu\u2019elle souffrait d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience due \u00e0 une d\u00e9pression clinique. \u00c0 la fin de la plaidoirie de la plaignante, TELUS a avanc\u00e9 que la plaignante n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de pr\u00e9senter une preuve prima facie de discrimination.\nIV. Le d\u00e9placement du fardeau de la preuve [4] Tout plaignant doit pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui \u00e9tablissent prima facie que la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9e. Le d\u00e9faut de le faire entra\u00eene le rejet de la plainte. Toutefois, une fois que le d\u00e9cideur a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, c\u2019est alors \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, soit qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas adopt\u00e9 la conduite qui fait l\u2019objet de la plainte, soit que cette conduite ne constituait pas un acte discriminatoire.\nV. La norme de la preuve et l\u2019examen de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 [5] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat F. H. c. McDougall, 2008 CSC 53, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a apport\u00e9 des \u00e9claircissements sur le droit en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la norme de preuve applicable dans les instances civiles : la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, ni plus ni moins. La preuve doit \u00eatre claire et convaincante pour satisfaire au crit\u00e8re de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s.\n[6] La Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le juge du proc\u00e8s ne devait pas consid\u00e9rer la preuve du t\u00e9moin en vase clos, mais qu\u2019il devait plut\u00f4t examiner l\u2019ensemble de la preuve et d\u00e9terminer l\u2019incidence des contradictions sur les questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de fiabilit\u00e9 touchant au c\u0153ur des questions en litige.\nVI. Le contexte [7] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Lally a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une employ\u00e9e de TELUS depuis 16 ans; elle a commenc\u00e9 comme t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniste et, finalement, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 accr\u00e9dit\u00e9e comme chef de projet. Mme Lally a parl\u00e9 des cours qu\u2019elle a suivis, des directives et de la formation qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7ue pour obtenir la certification professionnelle en gestion de projet.\n[8] En 2003, Mme Lally a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00eat\u00e9e au secteur Solutions aux PME de TELUS afin de travailler pour M. Brett Holt. Une fois le travail termin\u00e9, M. Holt a propos\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Lally de travailler avec lui \u00e0 temps plein. Elle a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019offre en raison d\u2019engagements qu\u2019elle avait pris \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un autre projet, lui promettant de lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner une fois qu\u2019elle aurait termin\u00e9 cet autre projet. Lors de discussions subs\u00e9quentes, Mme Lally a accept\u00e9 de travailler avec M. Holt dans le secteur des PME de TELUS (SSPME), en tant que chef de projet et analyste commerciale principale\nVII. Le projet clearwater [9] Entre mars et octobre 2007, TELUS a commenc\u00e9 un projet visant \u00e0 persuader les directeurs du service des ventes et les employ\u00e9s du service des ventes dont le rendement \u00e9tait insuffisant \u00e0 accepter, sur une base volontaire, une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part pour la cessation de leur emploi \u00e0 TELUS. Quatre indemnit\u00e9s de d\u00e9part \u00e9taient destin\u00e9es aux directeurs des ventes, et seize indemnit\u00e9s de d\u00e9part \u00e9taient destin\u00e9es aux employ\u00e9s des ventes syndiqu\u00e9s. Il est raisonnable de tirer l\u2019inf\u00e9rence selon laquelle le projet \u00e9tait approuv\u00e9 par le pr\u00e9sident et chef de la direction de TELUS ou son repr\u00e9sentant.\n[10] Le projet portait le nom de code suivant : [traduction] \u00ab Projet Clearwater \u00bb. Il \u00e9tait g\u00e9r\u00e9 par M. Holt, sous la direction de Dan Goldberg, un directeur principal. Sur le fondement de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve contenue dans le dossier de la plaignante, je conclus que le projet Clearwater \u00e9tait inusit\u00e9 et stressant. C\u2019\u00e9tait un projet important et confidentiel visant \u00e0 g\u00e9n\u00e9rer un grand potentiel de ventes, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accompli entre mars et octobre 2007.\n[11] La pi\u00e8ce C\u20115 est un \u00e9change de courriels informatif du 14 au 15 ao\u00fbt 2007, entre messieurs Goldberg et Holt.\n[12] Dans la pi\u00e8ce C\u20115, M. Goldberg \u00e9crit ce qui suit le 14 ao\u00fbt 2007 : [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] Honn\u00eatement, je m\u2019inqui\u00e8te de ce qu\u2019une fois que nous aurons mis en place le VDIP, le syndicat dira que, par ce moyen, nous ciblons des personnes pour leur licenciement. Cela dit, je ne sais pas si le syndicat a des moyens de recours \u2013 techniquement, nous respectons peut\u2011\u00eatre la lettre de la loi (la convention collective). Cela dit, je m\u2019inqui\u00e8te de notre visibilit\u00e9 et, de plus, \u00e7a semble simplement injuste \u00bb.\n[13] Selon moi, il est important que M. Goldberg ait parl\u00e9 de l\u2019injustice du projet. J\u2019en conclus que M. Goldberg \u00e9tait touch\u00e9 par le fait que de bons et loyaux employ\u00e9s seraient oblig\u00e9s de quitter TELUS simplement parce qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas des vendeurs \u00e0 haut rendement.\n[14] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Lally, elle a pris l\u2019engagement ferme et oral de travailler au projet Clearwater sur la base de l\u2019assurance orale r\u00e9ciproque de M. Holt selon laquelle elle recevrait l\u2019une des indemnit\u00e9s de d\u00e9part des chefs. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Lally a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle rappelait de temps en temps \u00e0 M. Holt leur engagement; toutefois, en octobre 2007, il a \u00e9vit\u00e9 toute conversation \u00e0 ce sujet et, finalement, le 16 octobre 2007, il a accept\u00e9 de parler de son indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part. M. Holt a retard\u00e9 la rencontre avec Mme Lally jusqu\u2019\u00e0 16 h 30, lorsqu\u2019il a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Lally pour lui dire qu\u2019elle ne recevrait pas d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part. M. Holt a dit : [traduction] \u00ab nous ne payons pas les bons \u00e9l\u00e9ments pour qu\u2019ils partent \u00bb. Lorsque Mme Lally lui a rappel\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait respect\u00e9 sa part du march\u00e9, M. Holt lui a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab tu devras faire avec \u00bb.\n[15] Les mots que Mme Lally a attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Holt : [traduction] \u00ab nous ne payons pas les bons \u00e9l\u00e9ments pour qu\u2019ils partent \u00bb donnent \u00e0 penser que M. Holt avait re\u00e7u la consigne de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019accord pr\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n[16] Je conclus que M. Holt et Mme Lally ont conclu un march\u00e9 priv\u00e9, inex\u00e9cutable, relatif \u00e0 l\u2019une des quatre indemnit\u00e9s de d\u00e9part de la gestion; si le march\u00e9 avait abouti, ce qui \u00e9tait hautement improbable, alors, Mme Lally aurait mis fin \u00e0 son emploi. Lorsqu\u2019elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 de l\u2019existence du \u00ab march\u00e9 \u00bb conclut avec M. Holt, Mme Lally a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas saisi les ramifications de cet accord non autoris\u00e9 et cach\u00e9, y compris la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019il soit interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme une tentative de frauder TELUS d\u2019une somme d\u2019argent importante.\n[17] Il para\u00eet \u00e9trange que pendant qu\u2019elle persuadait des employ\u00e9s cibl\u00e9s d\u2019accepter des indemnit\u00e9s de d\u00e9part destin\u00e9es en particulier aux employ\u00e9s dont le rendement n\u2019\u00e9tait pas satisfaisant, Mme Lally avait clandestinement n\u00e9goci\u00e9 avec M. Holt une trousse pour son propre compte.\n[18] Toutefois, si j\u2019ai tort de qualifier l\u2019accord conclu relativement \u00e0 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part de Mme Lally d\u2019acte malveillant, alors, elle s\u2019est au moins r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant malhonn\u00eate lorsqu\u2019elle a conclu un march\u00e9 non autoris\u00e9. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il est important que Mme Lally ait omis de s\u2019assurer que TELUS avait autoris\u00e9 M. Holt \u00e0 la r\u00e9compenser au cas o\u00f9 le projet serait un succ\u00e8s. \u00c0 tout le moins, elle aurait d\u00fb interroger M. Holt pour savoir s\u2019il avait l\u2019assurance de M. Goldberg qu\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 lui serait r\u00e9serv\u00e9e.\nVIII. Aper\u00e7u du travail de Mme Lally au project clearwater [19] La pi\u00e8ce C\u20116 est un document interne de TELUS sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement pour la p\u00e9riode de janvier \u00e0 juin 2007. Il est important de souligner, \u00e0 la page 14, le commentaire suivant du chef : [traduction] \u00ab la r\u00e9flexion strat\u00e9gique et les comp\u00e9tences en planification de Ravi ont excell\u00e9 dans le projet Clearwater. Merci d\u2019avoir pris la direction de cette initiative et d\u2019avoir favoris\u00e9 une telle croissance au sein du SSPME \u00bb.\n[20] La pi\u00e8ce C\u20117 est un \u00e9change de courriels, du 20 septembre 2007, entre Mme Lally et M. Holt, \u00e9change dans lequel elle rend compte des progr\u00e8s faits avec des employ\u00e9s choisis pr\u00e9cis et il conclut sa r\u00e9ponse par : [traduction] \u00ab Encore une fois, bon travail \u2013 Merci \u00bb.\n[21] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Lally a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que sa contribution au succ\u00e8s du projet Clearwater a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9e, en partie, par un cadeau : un cong\u00e9 de trois jours.\n[22] Mme Lally \u00e9tait probablement au bout du rouleau lorsque M. Holt lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 et qu\u2019il a d\u00e9mantel\u00e9, sans vergogne, ses attentes illusoires relatives \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part. Il est tr\u00e8s regrettable que Mme Lally souffrait de d\u00e9pression, qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de r\u00e9pondre aux communications mal r\u00e9dig\u00e9es de TELUS. Il est important de souligner qu\u2019en 2007, Mme Lally \u00e9tait \u00e9motionnellement fragile en raison d\u2019un fils adolescent et rebelle et d\u2019une m\u00e8re gravement malade, \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui se rajoutaient au caract\u00e8re stressant de l\u2019inaptitude de M. Holt \u00e0 lui donner une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part.\nIX. La d\u00e9pression clinique [23] La pi\u00e8ce C\u201129 est un courriel de Mme Lally \u00e0 Adriana Eanga, Catherine McColl et Brett Holt, dat\u00e9 du 2 novembre 2007, avec en pi\u00e8ce jointe un certificat du m\u00e9decin aussi dat\u00e9 du 2 novembre 2007. Mme Lally avait consult\u00e9 son m\u00e9decin de famille, le docteur S. Gnui. Selon le certificat, Mme Lally n\u2019\u00e9tait pas apte \u00e0 retourner au travail. [traduction] \u00ab Ravi souffre d\u2019un grave stress mental et physique et elle n\u2019est pas apte \u00e0 continuer \u00e0 travailler. Pri\u00e8re de la mettre en arr\u00eat de travail \u00bb.\n[24] Le 13 novembre 2007, le Dr Gnui a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9. Il a rempli le formulaire d\u2019\u00e9valuation du praticien (FEP) de TELUS, identifi\u00e9 comme pi\u00e8ce C\u201137; il y a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Lally souffrait d\u2019une [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9pression clinique majeure \u00bb, et il a recommand\u00e9 que Mme Lally ait recours aux services psychologiques offerts par son travail ou \u00e0 un psychiatre. Le Dr Gnui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Lally n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de travailler, que sa date de reprise du travail \u00e9tait inconnue, et que si sa d\u00e9pression persistait, il la r\u00e9f\u00e9rerait \u00e0 un psychiatre.\n[25] La pi\u00e8ce C\u201138 est un \u00e9change de courriels interne \u00e0 TELUS, entre Adriana Eanga, Alan Dabb et Corinne Wilander, qui faisaient des commentaires sur le formulaire m\u00e9dical du praticien Dr Gnui. Le 16 novembre 2007, Mme Eanga \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Wilander et \u00e0 M. Dabb : [traduction] \u00ab Bonjour Corinne, pouvez-vous me dire o\u00f9 nous en sommes avec l\u2019\u00e9valuation du FEP que nous re\u00e7u de Ravi au d\u00e9but de la semaine? Selon votre \u00e9valuation initiale, il semblerait que le cong\u00e9 ne serait pas approuv\u00e9 au-del\u00e0 de quatre semaines. Pouvez-vous nous informer de la d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive? Alan, la communication devrait\u2011elle venir de vous ou peut\u2011elle venir du service de sant\u00e9 \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 son dernier courriel? AE \u00bb. Le 19 novembre 2007, Mme Wilander a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 M. Dabb et \u00e0 Mme Eanga : [traduction] \u00ab Bonjour, les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux re\u00e7us ne sont pas ad\u00e9quats pour \u00e9tayer une absence prolong\u00e9e du travail. Cela \u00e9tant dit, serait\u2011il prudent de pr\u00e9voir une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale ind\u00e9pendante (EMI)? Mon raisonnement est le suivant : 1. elle refuse d\u2019y assister et nous pouvons alors dire que nous avons fait preuve de diligence raisonnable; 2. elle y assiste et il est conclu qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience; 3. elle est atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience, ce qui explique son comportement. Peu importe le r\u00e9sultat, nous aurons l\u2019information dont nous avons besoin pour soit clore le dossier, soit g\u00e9rer la d\u00e9ficience. Qu\u2019en pensez-vous? \u00bb Enfin, toujours le 19 novembre 2007, Mme Wilander a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Eanga et \u00e0 M. Dabb : [traduction] \u00ab Bonjour Adriana : EMI : demandez \u00e0 un sp\u00e9cialiste dans le bon domaine de rencontrer le membre d\u2019\u00e9quipe pour \u00e9tablir un diagnostic, un pronostic et le traitement recommand\u00e9, ainsi que pour donner un avis sur l\u2019aptitude de la personne \u00e0 travailler. En fonction du sp\u00e9cialiste, donc pas plus d\u2019un ou deux mois. Elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019on ait v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 qu\u2019elle est atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne peut pas vraiment la remplacer si elle est atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. Question : elle \u00e9tait absente sans permission pendant cinq semaines, et elle est partie comme si elle ne revenait pas. Devrions\u2011nous nous inqui\u00e9ter maintenant qu\u2019elle en fait une situation m\u00e9dicale? Honn\u00eatement, le certificat m\u00e9dical fourni est faible et il n\u2019appuie certainement pas son absence prolong\u00e9e \u00bb.\n[26] \u00c0 la demande de TELUS, Mme Lally a accept\u00e9 de subir une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale ind\u00e9pendante.\n[27] Le 6 f\u00e9vrier 2008, le Dr Jeffrey M. Claman, un professeur agr\u00e9g\u00e9 de clinique au d\u00e9partement de psychiatrie de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de la Colombie\u2011Britannique a fourni \u00e0 TELUS un rapport de 10 pages, r\u00e9sultat de son entrevue de la m\u00eame date avec Mme Lally. Le document a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 comme pi\u00e8ce C\u201159. \u00c0 la page 8, le diagnostic actuel bas\u00e9 sur les crit\u00e8res du Manuel diagnostique et statistique des troubles mentaux, 4e \u00e9dition \u00e9tait : trouble d\u00e9pressif majeur.\n[28] Je note que les m\u00e9decins utilisent l\u2019expression \u00ab d\u00e9pression clinique \u00bb de fa\u00e7on inclusive lorsqu\u2019ils font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux formes les plus graves de d\u00e9pression, l\u2019une de ces formes \u00e9tant le \u00ab trouble d\u00e9pressif majeur \u00bb.\n[29] La pi\u00e8ce C\u201158 est un courriel de Corinne Wilander, infirmi\u00e8re autoris\u00e9e, chef de service, Services de l\u2019entreprise en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 de TELUS, \u00e0 Joni Kert, et dont l\u2019objet est : Ravi Lally : [traduction] \u00ab Bonjour Joni, le rapport du sp\u00e9cialiste de l\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale ind\u00e9pendante que nous avons organis\u00e9e pour elle indique que Ravi est atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience et inapte au travail. Pri\u00e8re de changer de codage de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle soit pay\u00e9e, si elle ne l\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9. Je ne sais pas quel est le plan \u00e0 long terme, mais il est peu probable qu\u2019elle revienne \u00e0 son poste actuel \u00bb.\n[30] La pi\u00e8ce C\u201160 est un courriel qui continue la cha\u00eene de conversation de la pi\u00e8ce C\u201158. Adriana Eanga informe Brett Holt d\u2019une fa\u00e7on qui n\u2019est pas une reconnaissance de sa propre \u00e9valuation erron\u00e9e relative \u00e0 l\u2019absence du travail de Mme Lally : [traduction] \u00ab Oui, cela vient de la derni\u00e8re note qu\u2019Alan nous a envoy\u00e9e. Il semble qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 malade, et il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus simple si elle avait communiqu\u00e9 ouvertement avec son chef de service \u00bb.\nX. Le c\u0153ur de la plainte de Mme Lally [31] Mme Lally a commenc\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage par l\u2019affirmation selon laquelle sa plainte, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e comme pi\u00e8ce C\u20111, \u00e9tait honn\u00eate. Dans le deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe, elle parle de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment central de sa plainte : [traduction] \u00ab Il a dit qu\u2019il voulait quelqu\u2019un de fiable, et en qui on pouvait avoir confiance, puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un projet confidentiel et tr\u00e8s important. Je vivais d\u00e9j\u00e0 un \u00e9norme stress sur le plan personnel en raison de difficult\u00e9s familiales avec mon adolescent rebelle et du mauvais \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de ma m\u00e8re. J\u2019ai dit que j\u2019avais besoin de me concentrer sur ma famille, mais que j\u2019avais aussi besoin d\u2019un salaire pour boucler les fins de mois. Brett et moi avons en avons longuement parl\u00e9 et nous avons trouv\u00e9 une solution. Brett a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il me r\u00e9serverait une des indemnit\u00e9s de d\u00e9part de la gestion en cas de succ\u00e8s \u00e0 la fin du projet, \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2007. Cet accord \u00e9tait \u00e0 notre avantage \u00e0 tous les deux, nous nous y \u00e9tions engag\u00e9s oralement et j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du projet. Durant nos rencontres priv\u00e9es, j\u2019ai souvent v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 et confirm\u00e9 avec Brett que notre accord \u00e9tait bien compris et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait solide. J\u2019ai termin\u00e9 le projet Clearwater avec succ\u00e8s, \u00e0 la fin septembre 2007. Brett et moi avons discut\u00e9 de la p\u00e9riode transitoire, j\u2019ai donc eu presque la moiti\u00e9 du mois d\u2019octobre et tout le mois de novembre 2007 en cong\u00e9. Ce cong\u00e9 avait pour but de faciliter le d\u00e9tachement de l\u2019\u00e9quipe \u00e0 mon \u00e9gard et de donner assez de temps \u00e0 Brett pour finaliser mon retrait, tout en minimisant l\u2019interruption des affaires \u00bb.\nXI. La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la plaignante [32] Le t\u00e9moignage de vive voix et les documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve par Mme Lally \u00e9quivalaient \u00e0 une affirmation ordonn\u00e9e des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de sa plainte. Toutefois, lorsqu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 un contre\u2011interrogatoire serr\u00e9 relativement aux tentatives du chef Joni Kert de communiquer avec elle dans les semaines qui ont suivi le 17 octobre 2007, Mme Lally a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait l\u2019objet de harc\u00e8lement, et donc de discrimination. Bien que les communications de TELUS avec Mme Lally aient \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9es dans un vocabulaire sec et aust\u00e8re, je conclus qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de l\u2019expression du droit de TELUS de conna\u00eetre la raison de l\u2019absence de Mme Lally et qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas de harc\u00e8lement ni d\u2019actes discriminatoires entrant dans le champ d\u2019application de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi. Je tire la m\u00eame conclusion en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on bureaucratique dont les employ\u00e9s de TELUS ont g\u00e9r\u00e9 le droit de Mme Lally aux paiements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 court et \u00e0 long terme, et enfin, \u00e0 la couverture par la compagnie d\u2019assurance\u2011vie Sun Life (du Canada).\nXII. Les arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9e [33] TELUS avance que, avant le 29 octobre 2007, elle ne savait pas que la plaignante \u00e9tait atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience, en raison de sa d\u00e9pression clinique, et que l\u2019absence de d\u00e9ficience le 16 octobre 2007 (date \u00e0 laquelle M. Holt a inform\u00e9 Mme Lally qu\u2019elle ne recevrait pas d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part) porte un coup fatal aux all\u00e9gations de la plaignante selon lesquelles des actes discriminatoires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commis \u00e0 son endroit au motif de sa d\u00e9ficience. Le m\u00eame argument est avanc\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de Mme Lally selon laquelle, elle avait fait l\u2019objet de harc\u00e8lement lorsque les employ\u00e9s de TELUS ont tent\u00e9 de communiquer avec elle pour conna\u00eetre la raison pour laquelle elle \u00e9tait absente du travail et pour faire le point sur la situation au travail.\n[34] TELUS avance que, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de la d\u00e9ficience, Mme Lally n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet de traitement diff\u00e9rent; que la demande par TELUS d\u2019une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale ind\u00e9pendante \u00e9tait l\u00e9gitime et n\u00e9cessaire pour la confirmation de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, justifiant ainsi son absence autoris\u00e9e et son droit aux prestations en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[35] TELUS reconna\u00eet qu\u2019elle a commis des erreurs administratives lorsqu\u2019elle a trop pay\u00e9 Mme Lally, et lorsqu\u2019elle a trait\u00e9 son admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme, y compris le d\u00e9faut de s\u2019assurer que Mme Lally avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 temps une demande pour la r\u00e9ception de prestations d\u2019assurance suppl\u00e9mentaires de la compagnie d\u2019assurance\u2011vie Sun Life (du Canada). TELUS affirme que quand cela \u00e9tait possible, elle a corrig\u00e9 les erreurs et que le crit\u00e8re pour l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la discrimination n\u2019est pas de savoir si l\u2019employeur a agi de fa\u00e7on irr\u00e9prochable dans ses rapports avec un employ\u00e9 qui souffre de d\u00e9ficience, mais plut\u00f4t de savoir si l\u2019employeur a agi raisonnablement et s\u2019il n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment un employ\u00e9 en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[36] Les arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sont convaincants.\nXIII. D\u00e9cision [37] Selon mes conclusions dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, et selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je conclus que la plaignante n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli prima facie que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a commis un acte discriminatoire contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 de la Loi dans la p\u00e9riode du 16 octobre 2007 au 20 octobre 2009.\n[38] Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nWallace G.

Lustig\nDate : Le 31 octobre 2012\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2012 TCDP 28\nI. Le contexte [1] Les plaignantes ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne, all\u00e9guant que le financement in\u00e9quitable des services de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance fournis dans les r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00e9tait assimilable \u00e0 de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, LRC 1985, c H\u20116 (la Loi). La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) le 14 octobre 2008 et, le 3 novembre 2008, cette derni\u00e8re a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle participerait \u00e0 l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire.\n[2] Le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2009, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire rejeter la plainte au motif que les questions soulev\u00e9es exc\u00e9daient la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal (la requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence). Dans une d\u00e9cision publi\u00e9e sous la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence 2011 TCDP 4, le Tribunal s\u2019est prononc\u00e9 sur la requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence le 14 mars 2011 et il y a fait droit, rejetant ainsi la plainte. Cette d\u00e9cision a par la suite fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et, le 18 avril 2012, celle-ci a annul\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal et renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire \u00e0 un membre instructeur diff\u00e9rent pour nouvelle d\u00e9cision, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses motifs (2012 CF 445). Le 10 juillet 2012, une formation constitu\u00e9e de trois membres du Tribunal, soit Mme Marchildon et MM. Lustig et B\u00e9langer, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e pour instruire l\u2019affaire (2012 TCDP 16).\nII. La requ\u00eate de la SSEFPN en vue de faire radier le rapport d\u2019expert de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [3] Le 23 juillet 2012, l\u2019avocat de la SSEFPN a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis de requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire radier les deux parties et la lettre d\u2019accompagnement du rapport d\u2019expert de l\u2019intim\u00e9, \u00e9tabli par KPMG et d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le 15 septembre 2010, au motif que ce rapport ne satisfaisait pas aux exigences \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure). Le texte de ce paragraphe est le suivant :\nChaque partie doit signifier \u00e0 toutes les autres parties et d\u00e9poser devant le Tribunal, dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le membre instructeur,\na) un rapport pour chaque t\u00e9moin expert qu\u2019elle a l\u2019intention de citer. Ledit rapport doit\n(i) \u00eatre sign\u00e9 par l\u2019expert;\n(ii) pr\u00e9ciser le nom de l\u2019expert, son adresse et ses titres de comp\u00e9tence;\n(iii) indiquer l\u2019essentiel du t\u00e9moignage que l\u2019expert en question entend pr\u00e9senter;\nb) un rapport pour chaque t\u00e9moin expert qu\u2019elle a l\u2019intention de citer en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 un rapport d\u2019expert d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(3)a), lequel rapport doit \u00eatre conforme aux exigences \u00e9nonc\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(3)a).\n[4] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la SSEFPN a mis en \u00e9vidence le fait que le rapport n\u2019indiquait ou n\u2019\u00e9non\u00e7ait pas les qualifications d\u2019un expert quelconque de KPMG, une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019experts\u2011conseils que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait l\u2019intention de citer comme t\u00e9moin expert \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ce document. La SSEFPN a fait valoir que le rapport, s\u2019il ne mentionnait pas son auteur particulier et ses qualifications, ne pouvait pas \u00eatre admis \u00e0 titre de preuve d\u2019expert. Dans des lettres dat\u00e9es du 13 ao\u00fbt 2012, tant l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res Nations (l\u2019APN) que la Commission ont fait part de leur appui \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette requ\u00eate.\n[5] Le 27 ao\u00fbt 2012, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une lettre de Paul Ross, premier vice-pr\u00e9sident de KPMG, disant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait l\u2019auteur du rapport d\u2019expert en question; \u00e0 cette lettre \u00e9tait jointe une copie de son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de qualifications. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, cette lettre et l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de qualifications r\u00e9pondent aux pr\u00e9occupations que la SSEFPN a \u00e9voqu\u00e9es dans sa requ\u00eate, la SSEFPN n\u2019a subi aucun pr\u00e9judice par suite du temps mis \u00e0 fournir cette information et il y a donc lieu de rejeter la requ\u00eate.\nIII. La requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en vue de faire radier les rapports d\u2019expert des parties adverses [6] Le 29 ao\u00fbt 2012, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue de faire radier le rapport d\u2019expert des Chiefs of Ontario (COO); ce document, dat\u00e9 de juillet 2006, a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli par le Bureau d\u2019assistance \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille de l\u2019Ontario et r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par R. Hislop et J. Finlay sous le titre Conditions Facing First Nations Children in Remote Northern Communities in Ontario : Preliminary Impressions. La requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 visait aussi \u00e0 faire radier les rapports d\u2019expert de la Commission qui suivent :\n(a) Milloy, J. A National Crime : The Canadian Government and the Residential School System, 1879 to 1986 (University of Manitoba Press : 1999);\n(b) Greenwood, M. Places for the Good Care of Children : A Discussion of Indigenous Cultural Considerations and Early Childhood in Canada and New Zealand, juin 2009;\n(c) Greenwood, M. et Shawana, P. Whispered Gently Through Time, First Nations Quality Child Care;\n(d) Report of Dr. Nico Trocm\u00e9, dat\u00e9 du 2 septembre 2009;\n(e) Wien, F. Keeping First Nations children at home : A few Federal policy changes could make a big difference; et\n(f) Loxley, J. Wen:de The Journey Continues.\n[7] L\u2019intim\u00e9 met en doute la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, la pertinence et les co\u00fbts-avantages potentiels des rapports d\u2019expert propos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question en litige, se fondant \u00e0 cet effet sur les crit\u00e8res que la Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9tablis dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Mohan, [1994] 2 R.C.S. 9, en vue de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une preuve d\u2019expert, soit la pertinence, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019aider le juge des faits, l\u2019absence de toute r\u00e8gle d\u2019exclusion et la qualification suffisante de l\u2019expert. L\u2019intim\u00e9 se fonde \u00e9galement sur la nouvelle approche que la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario a adopt\u00e9e vis-\u00e0-vis de ces crit\u00e8res dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Abbey, 2009 ONCA 624, ainsi que sur le paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure.\n[8] L\u2019intim\u00e9 conteste \u00e0 la fois la pertinence de ces rapports et leur n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pour ce qui est d\u2019aider le juge des faits. Selon lui, aucun des rapports d\u2019expert propos\u00e9s n\u2019a trait \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle les fonds que verse le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral aux fournisseurs qui proposent des services aux enfants et aux familles dans les r\u00e9serves sont inf\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 ceux que procurent les gouvernements provinciaux et du Yukon aux fournisseurs de ces services qui sont situ\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur des r\u00e9serves. Par ailleurs, aucun des rapports d\u2019expert propos\u00e9s, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de celui de M. Trocm\u00e9, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis en vue de la pr\u00e9sente instance et les informations qu\u2019ils renferment d\u00e9bordent le cadre des all\u00e9gations que le Tribunal doit trancher. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient de plus que les experts propos\u00e9s qui sont \u00e0 l\u2019origine d\u2019un grand nombre de ces rapports ne sont pas d\u00fbment qualifi\u00e9s dans le domaine du financement des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille, que ces services soient fournis \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur ou \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur des r\u00e9serves.\n[9] L\u2019intim\u00e9 formule \u00e9galement des objections pr\u00e9cises au sujet des rapports intitul\u00e9s Wen:de The Journey Continues et Keeping First Nations children at home : A few Federal policy changes could make a big difference, dont Mme Cindy Blackstock, directrice administrative de la SSEFPN, est la coauteure. Il soutient qu\u2019au vu du r\u00f4le que joue Mme Blackstock dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente instance, ces rapports ne sont pas fiables, ont peu de valeur probante et ne peuvent pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme objectifs ou impartiaux. Il ajoute que toutes ces pr\u00e9occupations, de pair avec l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable que ces rapports peuvent avoir sur l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019emportent sur les avantages possibles de leur admission. Il convient donc d\u2019exclure ces rapports \u00e0 titre de preuve d\u2019expert.\n[10] En r\u00e9ponse, la SSEFPN fait valoir que la requ\u00eate est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e. Elle soutient que m\u00eame si l\u2019on peut invoquer \u00e0 titre pr\u00e9liminaire le non-respect des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure relativement \u00e0 la signification appropri\u00e9e des rapports de t\u00e9moins experts, la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne conteste pas la conformit\u00e9 des rapports \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle. L\u2019intim\u00e9 met plut\u00f4t en doute leur admissibilit\u00e9 en contestant les qualifications et l\u2019objectivit\u00e9 de leurs auteurs. En r\u00e9ponse, la SSEFPN fait valoir qu\u2019il est inappropri\u00e9 \u00e0 ce stade-ci d\u2019adopter cette approche. En fait, soutient-elle, ce sont l\u00e0 des questions que le Tribunal ne peut pas trancher avant que l\u2019audience ait commenc\u00e9 et que les membres instructeurs aient entendu l\u2019expert propos\u00e9 au stade initial de la d\u00e9termination des qualifications. \u00c0 ce stade, les membres instructeurs auront l\u2019occasion d\u2019\u00e9valuer l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019expertise de l\u2019auteur ainsi que sa pertinence par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019affaire, et l\u2019intim\u00e9 pourra contester les qualifications et l\u2019objectivit\u00e9 des auteurs en proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 un contre-interrogatoire.\n[11] La SSEFPN invoque la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate que le Tribunal a rendue dans l\u2019affaire AFPC c. Territoires du Nord-Ouest (Ministre du Personnel), [2001] D.C.D.P. no 26, aux paragraphes 5 et 12, dans laquelle le membre instructeur Groark a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : \u00ab [\u2026] [I]l convient particuli\u00e8rement d\u2019attendre que le t\u00e9moin soit cit\u00e9 avant de se prononcer sur les questions ayant trait \u00e0 la pertinence et \u00e0 la recevabilit\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage. \u00bb La SSEFPN est d\u2019avis qu\u2019en pr\u00e9sentant cette requ\u00eate au stade pr\u00e9liminaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9 demande au Tribunal de court-circuiter \u00e0 toutes fins pratiques le processus de d\u00e9termination des qualifications et d\u2019exclure d\u2019embl\u00e9e les preuves d\u2019expert sans entendre une preuve quelconque sur les qualifications des t\u00e9moins ou la port\u00e9e des t\u00e9moignages propos\u00e9s. Pour ces raisons, la SSEFPN soutient qu\u2019il y a lieu de rejeter la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et de laisser au Tribunal le soin de trancher de la mani\u00e8re habituelle les questions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des rapports ainsi qu\u2019aux qualifications et \u00e0 l\u2019objectivit\u00e9 d\u2019un t\u00e9moin expert quelconque. Dans un courriel dat\u00e9 du 21 septembre 2012, l\u2019APN a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle appuyait la position de la SSEFPN et de la Commission \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette requ\u00eate.\n[12] Les 25 et 26 septembre 2012, les membres instructeurs ont entendu les observations orales des parties au sujet de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 visant \u00e0 faire exclure les rapports d\u2019expert de la Commission. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a profit\u00e9 de l\u2019occasion pour plaider oralement sa r\u00e9plique \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de la SSEFPN au sujet de la requ\u00eate en radiation des rapports d\u2019expert. Outre ses observations initiales, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir de plus que la requ\u00eate n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e car les questions donnant lieu \u00e0 la requ\u00eate subsisteront pendant toute la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019audience. En fait, les questions d\u2019impartialit\u00e9 et d\u2019objectivit\u00e9 que suscitent les rapports dont Mme Blackstock est la coauteure ne changeront pas car cette derni\u00e8re continuera d\u2019\u00eatre une plaignante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Il soutient que Mme Blackstock peut rendre t\u00e9moignage, mais qu\u2019il serait inappropri\u00e9 de l\u2019autoriser \u00e0 le faire \u00e0 titre d\u2019experte m\u00eame s\u2019il est vrai qu\u2019elle poss\u00e8de les qualifications professionnelles et th\u00e9oriques requises.\n[13] Dans l\u2019ensemble, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a dit que m\u00eame s\u2019il comprend qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de situer la plainte dans son juste contexte, il s\u2019inqui\u00e8te du fait que les rapports d\u2019expert de la Commission d\u00e9bordent nettement le cadre de la plainte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e au d\u00e9part en 2007 et le fondement sur lequel la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal en 2008.\nIV. L\u2019analyse et la d\u00e9cision A. La requ\u00eate de la SSEFPN en vue de faire radier le rapport d\u2019expert de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [14] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la lettre dat\u00e9e du 27 ao\u00fbt 2010 de l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans laquelle ont \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9s le nom de l\u2019auteur du rapport de KPMG ainsi que son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de qualifications, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la SSEFPN si elle souhaitait maintenir sa requ\u00eate concernant la radiation du rapport. Cette derni\u00e8re a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait satisfaite des informations fournies et de la conformit\u00e9 du rapport au paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure, et elle a retir\u00e9 la requ\u00eate.\nB. La requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en vue de faire radier les rapports d\u2019expert de la Commission [15] Il est bien \u00e9tabli en droit, et reconnu par les parties, que l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan et les facteurs de la pertinence, de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019aider le juge des faits, de l\u2019absence de toute r\u00e8gle d\u2019exclusion et de la qualification suffisante de l\u2019expert constituent le crit\u00e8re qu\u2019il convient d\u2019appliquer pour d\u00e9cider si une preuve d\u2019expert est admissible ou non. Il est toutefois important de faire une distinction entre une demande d\u2019autorisation \u00e0 appeler des t\u00e9moins et les questions qui se posent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de leur t\u00e9moignage. Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision AFPC, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, il convient davantage de trancher cette derni\u00e8re question au moment o\u00f9 le t\u00e9moin est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\n[16] \u00c0 ce stade pr\u00e9liminaire de l\u2019instance, le Tribunal tente simplement d\u2019\u00e9tablir s\u2019il convient d\u2019autoriser ou non la Commission \u00e0 appeler ses t\u00e9moins experts. Il lui suffit \u00e0 cette fin de d\u00e9cider que le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019expert est n\u00e9cessaire pour trancher l\u2019une des questions de fait que comporte l\u2019affaire (Mellon c. Canada, au paragraphe 6) ou, autrement dit, de d\u00e9cider si la Commission a des motifs raisonnables d\u2019appeler les t\u00e9moins car leur t\u00e9moignage contribuerait de mani\u00e8re logique \u00e0 la position de la Commission : d\u00e9cision AFPC, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 5 et 6.\n[17] Pour les motifs qui suivent, nous sommes convaincus que la Commission et les plaignantes peuvent raisonnablement faire valoir qu\u2019elles ont besoin de la preuve que contiennent les rapports d\u2019expert. Le rapport de John Milloy, intitul\u00e9 A National Crime : The Canadian Government and the Residential School System, 1879 to 1986, semble \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue donner un contexte \u00e0 la plainte et aux services de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance au Canada. Les rapports de Margo Greenwood, intitul\u00e9s Places for the Good Care of Children : A Discussion of Indigenous Cultural Considerations and Early Childhood in Canada and New Zealand et Whispered Gently Through Time, First Nations Quality Child Care (\u00e9crits conjointement avec Perry Shawana), ont trait \u00e0 la question des services de garde destin\u00e9s aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations au Canada, et le rapport de Nico Trocm\u00e9, de pair avec celui de John Loxley et de Frederic Wien, portent sur la question cruciale des politiques et des formules de financement des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille du MAINC.\n[18] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que ces rapports contribuent logiquement \u00e0 la position de la Commission et, de ce fait, que cette derni\u00e8re peut appeler les t\u00e9moins experts propos\u00e9s. Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas en mesure \u2013 et il n\u2019est nul besoin \u2013 de d\u00e9terminer la pertinence de ces rapports ou leur n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pour ce qui est d\u2019aider les membres instructeurs comme le prescrit l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan et comme le conteste l\u2019intim\u00e9. Ce dernier fait valoir que les questions d\u2019impartialit\u00e9 que suscite la participation de Mme Blackstock \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction de deux des rapports ne changeront pas d\u2019ici l\u2019audition sur le fond de la plainte, mais cet argument a trait \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 de la preuve et, de ce fait, \u00e0 sa pertinence : arr\u00eat Mohan, aux paragraphes 18 et 19. Il est impossible au Tribunal de le d\u00e9terminer avant que Mme Blackstock ou ses coauteurs soient appel\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\n[19] Le Tribunal prend acte de la lettre des COO dat\u00e9e du 19 septembre 2012, informant les parties que le rapport de Mme Ruth Hislop et de M. Finlay intitul\u00e9 Conditions Facing First Nations Children in Remote Northern Communities in Ontario : Preliminary Impressions from the Perspective of the Office of Child and Family Services Advocacy ne sera pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en tant que rapport d\u2019expert dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente instance, quoique les COO se r\u00e9servent le droit d\u2019appeler M. Finlay comme t\u00e9moin. Cela \u00e9tant, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si ce rapport satisfait aux exigences du paragraphe 6(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure ou s\u2019il contribuerait logiquement \u00e0 la position des plaignantes.\n[20] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nPr\u00e9sidente de la formation coll\u00e9giale\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nMembre instructeur\nEdward P.

Introduction [1] Voici les motifs de ma d\u00e9cision relativement aux plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par Doris Cassidy contre Raj Thambirajah (l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel), un coll\u00e8gue et d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical, et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (Postes Canada), son employeur. La plaignante all\u00e8gue que M. Thambirajah l\u2019a harcel\u00e9e sexuellement, en contravention du paragraphe 14(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6, version modifi\u00e9e (la LCDP). La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 inclure trois incidents de repr\u00e9sailles qui seraient survenus durant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 se d\u00e9roulait l\u2019instance, en contravention de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP. La plainte contre Postes Canada est que cette derni\u00e8re aurait d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 Mme Cassidy et omis de lui assurer un lieu de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le sexe, en contravention de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) et du paragraphe 14(2) de la LCDP, respectivement. Les plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 instruites dans une seule instance. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\nII. D\u00e9cision [2] Les plaintes sont accueillies en partie.\nIII. Les retards et la longueur de la proc\u00e9dure [3] La gen\u00e8se des plaintes remonte au 9 novembre 2005 ou vers cette date (la plaignante ne se souvient pas de la date exacte), soit le jour o\u00f9 M. Thambirajah aurait harcel\u00e9 sexuellement la plaignante en effectuant des attouchements et en formulant des commentaires inappropri\u00e9s en milieu de travail. La plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ses plaintes le 27 mars 2007. La Commission les a achemin\u00e9es au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) le 26 mai 2009. Les plaintes ont fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une gestion de cas, puis m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9es en vue de la tenue d\u2019une audience. La premi\u00e8re journ\u00e9e d\u2019audience a eu lieu le 1er f\u00e9vrier 2010; la derni\u00e8re, le 11 octobre 2011. Le Tribunal a clos la proc\u00e9dure lorsqu\u2019il a rejet\u00e9 la demande de la plaignante visant la r\u00e9ouverture de l\u2019audience le 19 janvier 2012.\n[4] Ce d\u00e9lai \u00e9tait trop long \u2013 la cl\u00f4ture est survenue sept ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 l\u2019action. Je ne formulerai pas d\u2019observations sur le d\u00e9lai entre le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte \u00e0 la Commission et le renvoi de cette plainte au Tribunal. Toutefois, je me permettrais d\u2019en formuler sur le d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019affaire devant le Tribunal.\n[5] Depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, on me confie l\u2019arbitrage d\u2019affaires relatives aux droits de la personne; or, la pr\u00e9sente affaire est unique et s\u2019est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e plus difficile que d\u2019autres, pour diverses raisons. D\u2019abord, il y a eu des difficult\u00e9s li\u00e9es \u00e0 la communication et \u00e0 la production de la preuve. Ces difficult\u00e9s avaient trait aux six journaux de la plaignante. Pour respecter son droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e, j\u2019ai accept\u00e9 de les examiner pour en relever les \u00e9l\u00e9ments pertinents. Il y avait des centaines de pages \u00e0 parcourir attentivement. Lorsque j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 que certains extraits soient communiqu\u00e9s aux intim\u00e9s et que les autres journaux soient renvoy\u00e9s \u00e0 la plaignante, il y a eu de la confusion. La plaignante ou la personne qui la repr\u00e9sente a remis les documents non divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Machelak, l\u2019avocat de Postes Canada (mais pas \u00e0 M. Platt, le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel). La plaignante \u00e9tait perturb\u00e9e que M. Machelak ait des sections confidentielles de ses journaux qui devaient \u00eatre expurg\u00e9es et elle l\u2019a accus\u00e9 de les avoir prises dans ses effets personnels dans la salle d\u2019audience. \u00c9videmment, M. Machelak a r\u00e9agi \u00e0 cette accusation avec indignation. Par la suite, il y a eu des probl\u00e8mes avec les copies pr\u00e9par\u00e9es par la plaignante. Les copies fournies \u00e0 chacun des intim\u00e9s, celle fournie \u00e0 l\u2019agente du greffe et celle pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e lors du t\u00e9moignage ne correspondaient pas.\n[6] J\u2019aimerais \u00e9galement pr\u00e9ciser que, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la plaignante \u00e9tait, \u00e0 juste titre, troubl\u00e9e que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments intimes et priv\u00e9s aient \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s aux intim\u00e9s, particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel, j\u2019ai \u00e9galement rendu une ordonnance visant la mise sous scell\u00e9s de certains documents et contraignant les intim\u00e9s \u00e0 remettre certains des documents communiqu\u00e9s par la plaignante au terme de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure et de toute proc\u00e9dure subs\u00e9quente d\u2019appel ou de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. L\u2019inqui\u00e9tude de Mme Cassidy \u00e9tait palpable et j\u2019esp\u00e8re avoir trouv\u00e9 un \u00e9quilibre judicieux lorsque j\u2019ai examin\u00e9 les journaux et rendu l\u2019ordonnance.\n[7] De plus, l\u2019horaire des t\u00e9moignages a \u00e9t\u00e9 remani\u00e9 \u00e0 quelques reprises, parfois m\u00eame avant que les t\u00e9moins n\u2019aient achev\u00e9 leur t\u00e9moignage, afin de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes d\u2019horaire; je tiens \u00e0 remercier les parties de leur coop\u00e9ration, qui a nous a permis d\u2019\u00e9viter la perte de journ\u00e9es d\u2019audience. En outre, avec le temps, il y avait la difficult\u00e9 peu inhabituelle de trouver des dates de disponibilit\u00e9 communes pour les parties, leurs avocats ou repr\u00e9sentants et le Tribunal.\n[8] L\u2019audience elle-m\u00eame a n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 plus temps \u2013 soit 22 journ\u00e9es d\u2019audience, sans compter les nombreuses conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de gestion de l\u2019instance que j\u2019ai tenues avec les parties pour r\u00e9gler diverses questions soulev\u00e9es durant la proc\u00e9dure \u2013 en partie parce que le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante a dur\u00e9 plus longtemps que pr\u00e9vu. Comme nous le verrons ult\u00e9rieurement, parfois la plaignante r\u00e9pondait de mani\u00e8re \u00e9vasive, parfois ses r\u00e9ponses n\u2019\u00e9taient pas \u00e9vasives, mais elle avait tout de m\u00eame de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux questions, particuli\u00e8rement durant le contre-interrogatoire. Il y a \u00e9galement eu une m\u00e9diation, au milieu de la premi\u00e8re semaine de l\u2019audience, entre la plaignante et Postes Canada, men\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal. Un r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu, mais le lendemain la plaignante a dit qu\u2019elle souhaitait [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9chirer \u00bb l\u2019accord et aller de l\u2019avant avec l\u2019audience contre les deux intim\u00e9s.\n[9] Il y a aussi eu des requ\u00eates qui ont eu pour effet de prolonger l\u2019audience. Il y a eu une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 modifier la plainte contre M. Thambirajah pour y ajouter une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles relativement \u00e0 trois incidents survenus durant la premi\u00e8re semaine de l\u2019audience. Il y a aussi eu une requ\u00eate visant la pr\u00e9sentation de preuves factuelles similaires.\n[10] Une autre requ\u00eate a eu un effet plus important : celle visant \u00e0 rouvrir la cause de la plaignante apr\u00e8s sa cl\u00f4ture le 28 mai 2010 et \u00e0 y ajouter une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles contre Postes Canada. En fin de compte, cette requ\u00eate n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e avant le 14 mars 2011 \u2013 environ 10 mois plus tard. Et pendant ce d\u00e9lai, des changements sont survenus en ce qui concerne la repr\u00e9sentation de Mme Cassidy : Julie Marshall (repr\u00e9sentante) a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9e par William Kelly (avocat), puis la plaignante s\u2019est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e elle-m\u00eame pendant une br\u00e8ve p\u00e9riode apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de son avocat de se retirer du dossier. (Il est par la suite r\u00e9apparu \u00e0 titre d\u2019avocat de la plaignante le 25 avril 2011 et ce, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de l\u2019audience.)\nA. La requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 rouvrir la cause de la plaignante et les \u00e9v\u00e9nements subs\u00e9quents [11] La gen\u00e8se de la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 rouvrir la cause de la plaignante \u00e9tait la r\u00e9union que Mme Cassidy aurait eue avec ses superviseurs le 9 novembre 2005, soit le jour m\u00eame de l\u2019incident de harc\u00e8lement sexuel impliquant M. Thambirajah. J\u2019aborderai cette question plus loin dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs. Le 31 mai 2010, Mme Cassidy a dit pour la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019il y avait un t\u00e9moin qui l\u2019avait accompagn\u00e9e et qui avait assist\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. Elle ne s\u2019en \u00e9tait pas souvenue parce que, soutenait-elle, elle avait souffert de troubles de stress post-traumatique (TSPT) depuis ce jour en novembre 2005 et en souffrait encore le 28 mai 2010. J\u2019ai fix\u00e9 une date pour la pr\u00e9sentation de documents et la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019observations li\u00e9es \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate, y compris le rapport d\u2019expert d\u2019un psychiatre. La plaignante n\u2019avait pas consult\u00e9 de psychiatre et n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u de diagnostic de TSPT de la part d\u2019un m\u00e9decin. J\u2019ai discut\u00e9 avec les parties du crit\u00e8re juridique applicable \u00e0 la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019une cause, ainsi qu\u2019il est expos\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Johnson c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada, 1994 CanLII 284 (TCDP) (Vermette), confirm\u00e9e 1996 CanLII 3858 (CF). L\u2019audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date d\u2019examen de la requ\u00eate.\n[12] Plusieurs \u00e9v\u00e9nements sont alors survenus. Lors d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, Mme Marshall a dit que la plaignante s\u2019\u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e de son propre gr\u00e9 \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019unit\u00e9 psychiatrique de l\u2019h\u00f4pital Lakeridge apr\u00e8s la s\u00e9ance d\u2019audience du 31 mai 2010. Elle \u00e9tait maintenant sous les soins d\u2019un psychiatre, le docteur Malamed. La plaignante n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 sa premi\u00e8re \u00e9ch\u00e9ance pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la documentation li\u00e9e \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. L\u2019agente du greffe du Tribunal n\u2019a pu joindre ni Mme Marshall ni la plaignante. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9coulement de plusieurs semaines, Mme Marshall a finalement communiqu\u00e9 avec le Tribunal. J\u2019ai alors accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante un d\u00e9lai suppl\u00e9mentaire pour d\u00e9poser sa documentation. Lorsque cette documentation est arriv\u00e9e le 8 octobre 2010, elle ne respectait pas une des exigences expos\u00e9es le 31 mai 2010 : pour satisfaire au crit\u00e8re juridique, la partie requ\u00e9rante devait d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle souffrait de TSPT durant toute la p\u00e9riode allant de l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement ayant donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019action \u00e0 la cl\u00f4ture de la preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience. De plus, elle devait d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle avait fait preuve d\u2019une diligence raisonnable lors de la pr\u00e9paration de sa preuve (autrement dit, elle ne pouvait pas \u00eatre au fait de l\u2019existence de ce t\u00e9moin, comme en atteste le diagnostic de TSPT). La lettre du psychiatre de l\u2019h\u00f4pital, qui ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux exigences d\u2019un rapport d\u2019expert aux termes des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, ne comportait pas de diagnostic de TSPT pour la p\u00e9riode allant du 9 novembre 2005 \u00e0 mai 2010.\n[13] D\u00e9part de Mme Marshall; arriv\u00e9e de l\u2019avocat Kelly. Il convient de signaler qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un dossier difficile et que Mme Marshall, qui n\u2019avait aucune formation juridique, a repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 son amie Mme Cassidy \u00e0 titre b\u00e9n\u00e9vole. Elle a accompli du bon travail dans ce contexte. Le 10 novembre 2010, M. Kelly a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal que la plaignante avait retenu ses services. J\u2019ai tenu une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec les parties le 29 novembre 2010. Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019opposition des intim\u00e9s, j\u2019ai autoris\u00e9, encore une fois, la plaignante \u00e0 d\u00e9poser \u00e0 nouveau la documentation li\u00e9e \u00e0 sa requ\u00eate, la nouvelle \u00e9ch\u00e9ance \u00e9tant le 25 janvier 2011. Avec l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de l\u2019avocat de la plaignante, j\u2019esp\u00e9rais que la documentation serait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e correctement et qu\u2019il serait possible d\u2019instruire la requ\u00eate dans les plus brefs d\u00e9lais. Mes espoirs ne se sont pas concr\u00e9tis\u00e9s.\n[14] Je dois ajouter que, avant que les services de M. Kelly ne soient retenus, pour faire avancer le processus et avec le consentement des parties, j\u2019avais demand\u00e9 le 31 mai 2010 que l\u2019on entende d\u2019abord le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019A. B. (qui aurait assist\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tendue r\u00e9union du 9 novembre 2005), avant d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 la partie requ\u00e9rante de d\u00e9poser un rapport d\u2019expert r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par un psychiatre et avant que les autres parties ne r\u00e9pliquent en pr\u00e9sentant eux aussi un rapport d\u2019expert. Selon les intim\u00e9s, le t\u00e9moin ne se trouvait m\u00eame pas au bureau de service de Postes Canada en cause le 9 novembre 2005 \u2013 soit le jour de l\u2019incident et de la pr\u00e9tendue r\u00e9union entre la plaignante et ses superviseurs. Le 20 juillet 2010, j\u2019ai entendu le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019A. B. sur cette question, ainsi que les t\u00e9moignages des t\u00e9moins de Postes Canada. Les parties avaient convenu que la preuve se rapportant \u00e0 la requ\u00eate pourrait \u00e9galement servir \u00e0 trancher \u00ab sur le fond \u00bb de la cause principale, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, afin d\u2019\u00e9viter qu\u2019A. B. soit appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner une nouvelle fois dans le cadre de l\u2019audience \u00ab principale \u00bb.\n[15] L\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du 25 janvier 2011 pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t par la plaignante de la documentation li\u00e9e \u00e0 sa requ\u00eate est pass\u00e9e, sans un mot de la part de l\u2019avocat de la plaignante. Des semaines ont pass\u00e9. L\u2019avocat de la plaignante n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu aux lettres du Tribunal et aux messages laiss\u00e9s dans sa bo\u00eete vocale, lui signalant que l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance \u00e9tait pass\u00e9e. M. Machelak et M. Platt n\u2019ont pas eu de ses nouvelles non plus. Le 2 f\u00e9vrier 2011, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 au greffe du Tribunal d\u2019envoyer une lettre \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de la plaignante pour l\u2019aviser que, en raison de l\u2019omission de d\u00e9poser la documentation connexe, j\u2019avais conclu au d\u00e9sistement de la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 rouvrir la cause (et de l\u2019autre requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 ajouter une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles contre Postes Canada). L\u2019audience reprendrait le 14 mars 2011.\n[16] Une semaine avant la reprise de l\u2019audience, le Tribunal a re\u00e7u une lettre de l\u2019avocat de la plaignante demandant l\u2019ajournement de l\u2019audience et l\u2019autorisation de poursuivre la requ\u00eate et de d\u00e9poser \u00e0 nouveau la documentation connexe. Les autres parties se sont oppos\u00e9es \u00e0 cette demande. J\u2019ai rejet\u00e9 la demande. Le 9 mars 2011, l\u2019avocat de la plaignante a de nouveau \u00e9crit au Tribunal pour lui demander de revoir son rejet de la demande d\u2019ajournement. J\u2019ai r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il aurait [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019occasion d\u2019aborder cette question [en personne] lors de la reprise de l\u2019audience le 14 mars 2011 [\u2026] \u00bb L\u2019avocat de la plaignante a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 admis \u00e0 une clinique et a fait parvenir une note de son m\u00e9decin signalant qu\u2019il ne serait pas en mesure de participer \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Je lui ai alors demand\u00e9 de trouver quelqu\u2019un qui pourrait venir \u00e0 sa place \u00e0 l\u2019audience pour d\u00e9fendre la demande d\u2019ajournement; je lui ai \u00e9galement propos\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de tenir une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec les parties et moi en personne dans la salle d\u2019audience. Il a choisi la deuxi\u00e8me option. Ainsi, le 14 mars 2011, l\u2019audience a repris \u00e0 Toronto, avec la participation de l\u2019avocat de la plaignante (et de sa cliente) par t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence.\n[17] Ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 ce jour-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait vraiment bizarre. L\u2019avocat de la plaignante a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait souffert d\u2019une [traduction] \u00ab grippe intestinale \u00bb pendant un mois et que c\u2019\u00e9tait la raison pour laquelle il n\u2019avait pas respect\u00e9 les \u00e9ch\u00e9ances et n\u2019avait pas communiqu\u00e9 avec le Tribunal ou les autres parties. Il a \u00e9galement dit que, bien que trois mois et demi se fussent \u00e9coul\u00e9s depuis la date de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique \u00e0 laquelle sa cliente avait obtenu encore une fois un d\u00e9lai suppl\u00e9mentaire pour d\u00e9poser \u00e0 nouveau la documentation li\u00e9e \u00e0 sa requ\u00eate, il n\u2019avait toujours pas obtenu de rapport d\u2019expert de la part du Dr Malamed. La raison? Il avait \u00e9crit une lettre au psychiatre, mais venait d\u2019apprendre qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e au Dr Malamed. Il a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que, si je refusais la demande d\u2019ajournement et la poursuite de la requ\u00eate, il se verrait oblig\u00e9 de se retirer du dossier et d\u2019aviser son assureur de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une r\u00e9clamation pour n\u00e9gligence. Les autres parties ont accept\u00e9 un bref ajournement (\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que Mme Cassidy se trouvait \u00e0 Oshawa avec son avocat, et non dans la salle d\u2019audience) pour permettre \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019embaucher un nouvel avocat; toutefois, elles s\u2019opposaient cat\u00e9goriquement \u00e0 ce que la plaignante puisse poursuivre la requ\u00eate. Les autres parties ont fait valoir que j\u2019avais accord\u00e9 suffisamment de chances \u00e0 la plaignante pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa documentation, que neuf mois et demi s\u2019\u00e9taient \u00e9coul\u00e9s depuis la pr\u00e9sentation de la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 rouvrir sa cause (soit le 31 mai 2010), et que l\u2019avocat de la plaignante avait repris le travail et aurait certainement d\u00fb demander \u00e0 son adjointe de communiquer avec le Tribunal et les autres parties, s\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de le faire lui-m\u00eame. J\u2019\u00e9tais du m\u00eame avis. J\u2019ai accord\u00e9 un ajournement d\u2019un mois \u00e0 Mme Cassidy pour retenir les services d\u2019un nouvel avocat et pour en aviser le Tribunal. Une date d\u2019audience serait alors fix\u00e9e. La requ\u00eate ne serait pas accueillie. J\u2019ai fourni des motifs de vive voix.\n[18] Le mois s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9, sans un mot de Mme Cassidy ou de son nouvel avocat, contrairement \u00e0 mon ordonnance. J\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019agente du greffe de faire parvenir une lettre aux parties (\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que Mme Cassidy se repr\u00e9sentait elle-m\u00eame maintenant) pour pr\u00e9parer une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance o\u00f9 on fixerait les prochaines dates de l\u2019audience. Le Tribunal a re\u00e7u les r\u00e9ponses des parties, dont celle de M. Kelly, qui a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait de nouveau inscrit au dossier. J\u2019ai tenu la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique et fix\u00e9 les nouvelles dates de l\u2019audience pr\u00e9vues pour octobre 2011 afin de mener \u00e0 terme l\u2019audience.\n[19] Le mois d\u2019octobre est arriv\u00e9 et l\u2019audience s\u2019est assez bien d\u00e9roul\u00e9e. Nous avons achev\u00e9 le volet de la preuve. Les parties ont demand\u00e9 si elles pouvaient pr\u00e9senter des observations finales par \u00e9crit, suivies d\u2019une br\u00e8ve plaidoirie par t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence. J\u2019ai consenti \u00e0 leur demande. J\u2019ai fix\u00e9 les \u00e9ch\u00e9ances pour la pr\u00e9sentation des observations finales et pour la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique. Je dois ajouter que l\u2019avocat de la plaignante s\u2019est bien comport\u00e9 durant l\u2019audience. Mes r\u00e9serves ont trait \u00e0 son comportement avant et apr\u00e8s les dates d\u2019audience en octobre 2011.\n[20] L\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du 1er novembre 2011 pour la pr\u00e9sentation des observations finales est pass\u00e9e sans que la plaignante ne pr\u00e9sente les siennes et, de plus, sans la moindre communication de sa part. Encore une fois, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019agente du greffe de communiquer avec l\u2019avocat de la plaignante pour savoir ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9; aucune r\u00e9ponse. J\u2019ai demand\u00e9 aux autres parties de pr\u00e9senter leurs observations \u00e9crites selon l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance fix\u00e9e et elles l\u2019ont fait. Le 28 novembre 2011, le Tribunal a finalement eu des nouvelles de l\u2019avocat de la plaignante : une lettre demandant une prolongation du d\u00e9lai (bien apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du 1er novembre) pour la pr\u00e9sentation des observations \u00e9crites et l\u2019ajournement de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 6 d\u00e9cembre 2011 pr\u00e9vue pour la plaidoirie, car il devait compara\u00eetre devant la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de l\u2019Ontario \u00e0 Oshawa ce jour-l\u00e0, m\u00eame si le Tribunal avait retenu cette date auparavant. Les autres parties s\u2019opposaient cat\u00e9goriquement \u00e0 ces demandes, signalant qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait du m\u00eame type de comportement que l\u2019avocat de la plaignante avait adopt\u00e9 par le pass\u00e9. Elles avaient subi un pr\u00e9judice et souhaitaient achever l\u2019audience. J\u2019ai accueilli la demande d\u2019ajournement de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019avocat de la plaignante, \u00e0 la condition qu\u2019il communique avec M. Machelak et M. Platt pour \u00e9tablir une date de remplacement en d\u00e9cembre et qu\u2019il en avise le Tribunal au plus tard le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2011. J\u2019ai rejet\u00e9 sa demande visant la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019observations \u00e9crites, mais je lui ai dit qu\u2019il pourrait pr\u00e9senter des observations orales. N\u2019ayant pas re\u00e7u de nouvelles de l\u2019avocat de la plaignante malgr\u00e9 la directive ci-dessus, le Tribunal a \u00e9crit aux parties le 16 d\u00e9cembre 2011 pour les aviser que, s\u2019il n\u2019avait pas de nouvelles de l\u2019avocat de la plaignante au plus tard le 19 d\u00e9cembre, [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019audience sera r\u00e9put\u00e9e close et le Tribunal amorcera la r\u00e9daction des motifs de d\u00e9cision \u00bb. J\u2019ai \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019agente du greffe de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de la plaignante et, s\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible, de laisser un message dans sa bo\u00eete vocale faisant \u00e9tat du contenu de la lettre. Elle a joint la r\u00e9ceptionniste, qui a confirm\u00e9 l\u2019adresse de courriel \u00e0 laquelle le Tribunal a transmis la pr\u00e9sente lettre et la correspondance ant\u00e9rieure. La r\u00e9ceptionniste a dit que l\u2019avocat de la plaignante serait au bureau le 19 d\u00e9cembre 2011 et, par cons\u00e9quent, serait en mesure de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la lettre du Tribunal. Le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2011, le Tribunal a re\u00e7u une lettre t\u00e9l\u00e9copi\u00e9e en date de la veille en provenance de l\u2019avocat de la plaignante; il signalait, entre autres, qu\u2019il devait [traduction] \u00ab consacrer toute la journ\u00e9e \u00e0 des interrogatoires pr\u00e9alables \u00bb, mais qu\u2019il r\u00e9pondrait le lendemain. Il a pr\u00e9tendu n\u2019avoir jamais re\u00e7u la lettre du Tribunal en date du 5 d\u00e9cembre 2011. Le 23 d\u00e9cembre 2011, il a \u00e9crit pour indiquer qu\u2019il communiquerait avec les autres repr\u00e9sentants en janvier 2012 en vue de s\u2019entendre sur une date en janvier pour la tenue de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique consacr\u00e9e aux conclusions finales. J\u2019ai ensuite demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019envoyer une lettre aux autres parties pour prendre connaissance de leurs positions. Les autres parties s\u2019opposaient \u00e0 la demande. Comme M. Machelak l\u2019a not\u00e9 avec justesse, [traduction] \u00ab M. Kelly a choisi d\u2019ignorer la lettre [du Tribunal] tout comme il a ignor\u00e9 les autres \u00e9ch\u00e9ances fix\u00e9es par le Tribunal \u00bb. Le 19 janvier 2012, j\u2019ai fait parvenir une lettre aux parties leur indiquant que j\u2019avais rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de la plaignante visant la r\u00e9ouverture de l\u2019audience. L\u2019audience est demeur\u00e9e close.\n[21] Je tiens \u00e0 signaler que je suis tr\u00e8s conscient de la difficult\u00e9 et de la gravit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de clore une audience sans avoir re\u00e7u les observations de toutes les parties. En fait, je statue sur des affaires relatives aux droits de la personne aux niveaux f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provincial (en Ontario) depuis plus de 14 ans, j\u2019exerce l\u2019arbitrage et la m\u00e9diation en pratique priv\u00e9e, et il s\u2019agit de la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019une telle situation se produit. Toutefois, j\u2019estime que l\u2019essentiel n\u2019est pas tant de recevoir les observations finales de toutes les parties, mais d\u2019avoir accord\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les parties une occasion raisonnable de pr\u00e9senter leurs observations finales. Et je crois avoir accord\u00e9 une chance plus qu\u2019\u00e9quitable \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019exposer pleinement sa cause et aux intim\u00e9s de pr\u00e9senter leur d\u00e9fense. Mais, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, trop c\u2019est trop, au-del\u00e0 de ce point, l\u2019intim\u00e9 et la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal subissent un pr\u00e9judice. Cela constitue presque un usage abusif de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal et porte atteinte \u00e0 son aptitude \u00e0 g\u00e9rer sa propre proc\u00e9dure. La jurisprudence est pleine d\u2019exemples de tribunaux qui rejettent des causes (ce qui n\u2019est pas le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce) pour avoir omis de respecter les r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure.\n[22] De plus, je suis appel\u00e9 \u00e0 trancher une affaire de harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Dans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur le respect des droits, les personnes accus\u00e9es de harc\u00e8lement sexuel sont stigmatis\u00e9es. Souvent, le public ne fait pas de distinction entre les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement sexuel et celles d\u2019agression sexuelle criminelle. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Blencoe c. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 1998 CanLII 13300, inf. par 2000 CSC 44, la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique a \u00e9crit au paragraphe 57 : [traduction] \u00ab Bien que l\u2019arbitrage des droits de la personne soit souvent d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant une proc\u00e9dure de m\u00e9diation et de conciliation visant \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la discrimination et \u00e0 r\u00e9tablir la victime dans sa situation ant\u00e9rieure, et non \u00e0 punir la personne mise en cause, le fait demeure que des accusations non prouv\u00e9es de harc\u00e8lement sexuel et de discrimination sexuelle entra\u00eenent, dans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9, une forte stigmatisation. De telles accusations peuvent d\u00e9truire des vies. \u00bb La pr\u00e9sente affaire n\u2019a pas seulement des r\u00e9percussions sur M. Thambirajah, car il y a d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s (et anciens employ\u00e9s) de Postes Canada dont les r\u00e9putations sont mises en cause par les all\u00e9gations se rapportant \u00e0 leur action (ou inaction) \u00e0 la suite de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Cassidy contre la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes.\n[23] Je dois ajouter que la poursuite de la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 rouvrir la cause de la plaignante parce qu\u2019elle souffrait de TSPT n\u2019a pas d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pratique, compte tenu de ma conclusion \u2013 expos\u00e9e plus loin dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs \u2013 selon laquelle A. B. ne se trouvait pas \u00e0 la succursale D de Willowdale (Willowdale D) \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019incident des attouchements ou des commentaires ayant eu lieu vers midi le 9 novembre 2005; par cons\u00e9quent, elle ne pouvait pas avoir assist\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union pr\u00e9tendument tenue entre elle, Mme Cassidy, M. Tidman et M. Sultan. Par cons\u00e9quent, la partie requ\u00e9rante n\u2019aurait pas respect\u00e9 le troisi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re juridique expos\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Vermette, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e. Les trois volets du crit\u00e8re sont les suivants :\n[traduction]\n1) il doit \u00eatre \u00e9tabli que m\u00eame en faisant preuve de diligence raisonnable il n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 possible d\u2019obtenir les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour pr\u00e9sentation au proc\u00e8s;\n2) les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve doivent \u00eatre susceptibles d\u2019influer substantiellement sur l\u2019issue de l\u2019affaire, quoiqu\u2019ils n\u2019aient pas \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9terminants;\n3) les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve doivent \u00eatre vraisemblables ou, autrement dit, ils doivent para\u00eetre cr\u00e9dibles m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019ils soient irr\u00e9cusables.\n[24] M\u00eame si je n\u2019ai pas re\u00e7u les observations finales de la plaignante, les t\u00e9moignages oraux et la preuve documentaire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience ainsi que les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions et les formulaires de plainte m\u2019ont permis de formuler des conclusions de fait et de droit et de trancher les questions se rapportant \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration. Une derni\u00e8re remarque : mea culpa \u2013 il m\u2019a fallu dix mois depuis la cl\u00f4ture de la proc\u00e9dure le 19 janvier 2012 pour r\u00e9diger et publier l\u2019expos\u00e9 de mes motifs. Je remercie les parties de leur patience.\nIV. Cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 [25] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, je me reporte \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat maintes fois cit\u00e9 Faryna c. Chorney, [1952] 2 D.L.R. 354 (Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique) :\n[traduction]\n[\u2026]\nLes possibilit\u00e9s qu\u2019avait le t\u00e9moin d\u2019\u00eatre au courant des faits, sa capacit\u00e9 d\u2019observation, son jugement, sa m\u00e9moire, son aptitude \u00e0 d\u00e9crire avec pr\u00e9cision ce qu\u2019il a vu et entendu contribuent, de concert avec d\u2019autres facteurs, \u00e0 cr\u00e9er ce qu\u2019on appelle la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9.\n[\u2026]\nLe crit\u00e8re applicable consiste plut\u00f4t \u00e0 examiner si son r\u00e9cit est compatible avec les probabilit\u00e9s qui caract\u00e9risent les faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Bref, ce qui permet de v\u00e9rifier r\u00e9ellement si le t\u00e9moin dit la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 en pareil cas, c\u2019est que son t\u00e9moignage doit \u00eatre compatible avec la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s qu\u2019une personne pragmatique et bien renseign\u00e9e reconna\u00eetrait ais\u00e9ment comme raisonnable dans ce lieu et dans ces conditions.\n[26] Je me suis efforc\u00e9 de suivre l\u2019approche ci-dessus. \u00c0 titre d\u2019arbitre, je suis conscient que la salle d\u2019audience est un environnement artificiel o\u00f9 les t\u00e9moins r\u00e9agissent de mani\u00e8res diff\u00e9rentes et personnelles au stress d\u2019avoir \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, etc. Par cons\u00e9quent, leur comportement n\u2019est qu\u2019un des indices quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Ce qui compte davantage c\u2019est le contenu de leur t\u00e9moignage, ce qu\u2019ils ont fait, ce qu\u2019ils ont dit et \u00e9crit (car la preuve documentaire est importante aussi) au sujet des \u00e9v\u00e9nements pass\u00e9s qui constituent l\u2019objet de la plainte sur laquelle je dois rendre une d\u00e9cision, et comment leur t\u00e9moignage se tient dans le contexte de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Je souhaite \u00e9galement ajouter qu\u2019arriver \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019un t\u00e9moin est cr\u00e9dible ou pas ne revient pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 dire que tout ce que ce t\u00e9moin a dit ou \u00e9crit est admis ou rejet\u00e9. Un t\u00e9moin peut \u00eatre sinc\u00e8re, tout en ayant tort au sujet des faits. J\u2019ai t\u00e2ch\u00e9 de tirer le sens de tous ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et de formuler des conclusions de fait concernant ce qui s\u2019est v\u00e9ritablement produit.\n[27] Dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, je formulerai des conclusions quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 lorsque j\u2019aborderai les diverses all\u00e9gations. Toutefois, j\u2019aimerais signaler que j\u2019ai eu de s\u00e9rieux doutes au sujet de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9 de deux principaux t\u00e9moins dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire : Mme Cassidy et M. Thambirajah. Mme Cassidy r\u00e9pondait parfois de mani\u00e8re \u00e9vasive et demandait qu\u2019on lui r\u00e9p\u00e8te les questions \u00e0 plusieurs reprises. Le t\u00e9moin Cam Tidman a affirm\u00e9 que la plaignant n\u2019est pas une [traduction] \u00ab grande communicatrice \u00bb. J\u2019en ai tenu compte. Je conclus \u00e9galement que son t\u00e9moignage sur des questions cl\u00e9s comportait des contradictions et des omissions. Ce qu\u2019elle a dit \u00e0 l\u2019audience ne correspondait pas \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle a dit \u00e0 Postes Canada ou \u00e0 la Commission, verbalement ou dans ses documents. Je fournirai des exemples plus loin dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs. Sur certains points, je dois conclure qu\u2019elle a fabriqu\u00e9, embelli ou exag\u00e9r\u00e9 des choses. Mon doute est tel que j\u2019h\u00e9site \u00e0 admettre son t\u00e9moignage sur des questions importantes contest\u00e9es \u00e0 moins d\u2019avoir une forte preuve corroborante.\n[28] Je doute aussi de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de la fiabilit\u00e9 de M. Thambirajah. Sur certaines questions, il s\u2019est contredit durant son propre t\u00e9moignage. Mentionnons \u00e0 titre d\u2019exemple son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l\u2019audience au sujet de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles dans le parc de stationnement, ainsi que ce qui s\u2019est r\u00e9ellement produit le 9 novembre 2005. M\u00eame si l\u2019anglais n\u2019est pas sa langue maternelle, je suis convaincu qu\u2019il ma\u00eetrise suffisamment bien l\u2019anglais pour participer \u00e0 l\u2019audience, y compris pour t\u00e9moigner. Il est vrai qu\u2019il a un accent prononc\u00e9 et que les avocats, les t\u00e9moins et moi avions de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 le comprendre. Toutefois, il ne faut pas confondre le fait d\u2019avoir un accent prononc\u00e9 avec une difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 comprendre une langue ou \u00e0 s\u2019exprimer dans cette langue. M. Thambirajah est au Canada depuis plus de 30 ans, travaille \u00e0 Postes Canada depuis 22 ans et est d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical au Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses des postes (STTP) chez Postes Canada depuis 1998. \u00c0 ce titre, il est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter des documents juridiques complexes tels que la convention collective et une multitude de politiques et de r\u00e8gles organisationnelles et syndicales. Il communique en anglais et r\u00e9dige \u00e9galement ses journaux et ses documents de travail en anglais.\n[29] J\u2019ai aussi eu des doutes au sujet du t\u00e9moignage de John Pyziak. Bien que certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9taient cr\u00e9dibles et fiables, d\u2019autres ne l\u2019\u00e9taient pas. Par exemple, il a donn\u00e9 quatre versions diff\u00e9rentes de ce qui est arriv\u00e9 le 9 novembre 2005, qui se trouvent dans : sa d\u00e9claration \u00e0 Kelly Edmunds, charg\u00e9e de l\u2019enqu\u00eate relative aux droits de la personne \u00e0 Postes Canada; sa d\u00e9claration \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eateur de la Commission; ses d\u00e9clarations lors d\u2019une conversation enregistr\u00e9e avec M. Thambirajah; et son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[30] Par contre, j\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 que les t\u00e9moins de Postes Canada \u00e9taient cr\u00e9dibles et que leurs t\u00e9moignages \u00e9taient assez fiables ou exacts. En particulier, Mme Edmunds et Cam Tidman, chef de service \u00e0 la retraite, ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 longuement et avaient jou\u00e9 des r\u00f4les de premier plan dans les \u00e9v\u00e9nements d\u00e9crits ci-apr\u00e8s. Ils se sont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s des t\u00e9moins cr\u00e9dibles.\nV. Conclusions de fait [31] Mme Cassidy \u00e9tait factrice suppl\u00e9ante chez Postes Canada en 2005, affect\u00e9e \u00e0 Willowdale D. Elle est encore employ\u00e9e par Postes Canada. Au besoin, elle rempla\u00e7ait les facteurs r\u00e9guliers et effectuait leurs itin\u00e9raires. Elle n\u2019avait pas son propre itin\u00e9raire; elle pouvait \u00eatre affect\u00e9e \u00e0 divers itin\u00e9raires et \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents bureaux de service. M. Thambirajah travaillait comme facteur chez Postes Canada depuis 2005 au m\u00eame emplacement que Mme Cassidy. Il \u00e9tait \u00e9galement d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical.\nA. Le 9 novembre 2005 : l\u2019incident de l\u2019attouchement et du commentaire [32] Voici la gen\u00e8se des plaintes de Mme Cassidy. Le ou vers le 9 novembre 2005, elle se trouvait \u00e0 la succursale et parlait avec un coll\u00e8gue, John Pyziak. Mme Cassidy ne se souvient pas de la date exacte et ne l\u2019a jamais consign\u00e9e par \u00e9crit. Toutefois, selon son t\u00e9moignage, elle \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab certaine que c\u2019\u00e9tait au d\u00e9but de novembre \u00bb en 2005. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve documentaire, y compris des calendriers, je conclus que l\u2019incident est vraisemblablement survenu le 9 novembre 2005. Selon la plaignante, [traduction] \u00ab il \u00e9tait vers midi, [\u2026] les apr\u00e8s-midi apr\u00e8s le trajet [postal] [\u2026] il arrivait souvent que Raj [Thambirajah] reste un peu \u00e0 la succursale apr\u00e8s sa journ\u00e9e de travail \u00bb. L\u2019heure est importante, comme nous le verrons plus tard lors de l\u2019examen du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019A. B., qui a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019incident s\u2019\u00e9tait produit t\u00f4t le matin avant que les facteurs n\u2019effectuent leurs itin\u00e9raires. Je conclus qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00e8s de midi lorsque l\u2019incident est survenu.\n[33] Mme Cassidy a mentionn\u00e9 que la premi\u00e8re description de l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005 (y compris la date) se trouvait dans un de ses journaux. J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 les six journaux pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve. Ils comptaient des centaines de pages au total. Je n\u2019ai relev\u00e9 aucune description de l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement, ni de date. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que cette description se trouvait dans le journal qu\u2019elle avait remis \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eateur, M. Cecile. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que ce dernier ne lui avait pas rendu le journal. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Cecile, il avait examin\u00e9 les journaux pour v\u00e9rifier s\u2019ils contenaient des renseignements pouvant mener, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la demande de Mme Cassidy, \u00e0 une accusation d\u2019agression sexuelle contre M. Thambirajah. Selon l\u2019agent, il ne se souvenait pas d\u2019un renvoi \u00e0 une date exacte ou \u00e0 une description des \u00e9v\u00e9nements dans le journal. S\u2019il avait relev\u00e9 un tel renvoi, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 contraint de le signaler dans son rapport et d\u2019en aviser la Couronne pour qu\u2019elle le communique \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense; de plus, il aurait signal\u00e9 la date pr\u00e9cise dans le rapport de police. Il a mentionn\u00e9 avoir v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 avec les responsables de la salle de conservation des biens saisis et des preuves; le journal ne s\u2019y trouvait pas non plus. J\u2019admets ce t\u00e9moignage.\n[34] Parmi les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, la premi\u00e8re description \u00e9crite de l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005 se trouve dans la plainte de Mme Cassidy \u00e0 Postes Canada en date du 25 avril 2006. Dans cette plainte, elle a \u00e9crit que M. Thambirajah avait abord\u00e9 M. Pyziak et elle :\n[traduction]\n\u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9, mon coll\u00e8gue lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi il fixait ma poitrine. Puis, mon coll\u00e8gue a remarqu\u00e9 qu\u2019un bouton de ma chemise \u00e9tait d\u00e9fait et me l\u2019a signal\u00e9. Au moment o\u00f9 je me tournais pour attacher le bouton, Raj a dit \u2013 \u00ab je ne fixais pas sa poitrine, elle n\u2019a m\u00eame pas de seins \u00bb. Pendant qu\u2019il le disait, il a tir\u00e9 sur ma chemise de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 plonger un regard derri\u00e8re. J\u2019\u00e9tais tr\u00e8s f\u00e2ch\u00e9e, g\u00ean\u00e9e et constern\u00e9e de ce qui venait d\u2019arriver.\n[35] Dans sa plainte \u00e0 la Commission, elle a \u00e9crit : [traduction] \u00ab En novembre 2005, pendant que je travaillais \u00e0 Willowdale D, un coll\u00e8gue (Raj Thambirajah) a tir\u00e9 sur ma chemise et l\u2019a ouverte devant un autre coll\u00e8gue. \u00bb\n[36] D\u2019apr\u00e8s la description de Mme Cassidy \u00e0 l\u2019audience, elle parlait \u00e0 M. Pyziak, avec qui elle \u00e9tait en bons termes. Elle plaisantait avec lui. \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9, M. Thambirajah est arriv\u00e9 et, aux dires de la plaignante :\n[traduction]\nRaj me fixait. Johnny lui a demand\u00e9 ce qu\u2019il fixait [\u2026] Il [M. Thambirajah] a r\u00e9pondu : elle n\u2019a m\u00eame pas de seins. Il [John Pyziak] m\u2019a dit que mes boutons \u00e9taient d\u00e9faits. Au moment o\u00f9 je me tournais, il [Raj] a tendu les doigts et tir\u00e9 ma chemise vers le bas [\u2026] et a plong\u00e9 un regard derri\u00e8re ma chemise [\u2026] Un des boutons s\u2019est d\u00e9fait. J\u2019\u00e9tais g\u00ean\u00e9e et humili\u00e9e [\u2026] Mes seins \u00e9taient expos\u00e9s. Je lui ai dit de ne plus jamais me toucher, je l\u2019ai trait\u00e9 d\u2019imb\u00e9cile. Il a tir\u00e9 sur ma chemise et l\u2019a ouverte, je voulais juste m\u2019enfuir. Je me sentais humili\u00e9e. Raj a dit \u00ab elle n\u2019a m\u00eame pas de seins \u00bb. J\u2019ai dit que \u00e7a n\u2019a pas d\u2019importance, il n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb me toucher.\n[37] En contre-interrogatoire, on lui a demand\u00e9 si elle avait dit quelque chose du genre [traduction] \u00ab j\u2019ai de petits seins, on m\u2019a toujours taquin\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole secondaire \u00e0 cause de cela \u00bb, elle a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019en souvenait pas. Mais elle a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 que M. Thambirajah avait tir\u00e9 sur sa chemise et plong\u00e9 un regard derri\u00e8re. Quant \u00e0 son affirmation que ses seins avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9s, elle a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle portait un soutien-gorge balconnet. \u00c0 la barre des t\u00e9moins, elle s\u2019est servie d\u2019une chemise de Postes Canada comme accessoire pour faire une d\u00e9monstration de ce qui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9. Elle a clairement montr\u00e9 comment un bouton s\u2019arrache lorsqu\u2019on tire sur la chemise avec force, comme lorsque M. Thambirajah avait [traduction] \u00ab arrach\u00e9 \u00bb un des boutons et ouvert sa chemise.\n[38] Dans le rapport de police en date du 14 octobre 2006 li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019accusation d\u2019agression sexuelle (R1-33), il y a la d\u00e9claration suivante :\n[traduction]\n[Apr\u00e8s que M. Thambirajah s\u2019est joint \u00e0 la conversation entre la plaignante et M. Pyziak\u2026] Pendant ce temps, [expurg\u00e9 par la police] a remarqu\u00e9 que [expurg\u00e9] fixait la poitrine de Mme Cassidy, [expurg\u00e9] puis a regard\u00e9 Mme Cassidy et a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019un bouton de sa chemise \u00e9tait d\u00e9fait; Mme Cassidy s\u2019est tourn\u00e9e rapidement pour boutonner sa chemise et c\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment que [expurg\u00e9] a affirm\u00e9 : \u00ab je ne fixais pas sa poitrine, elle n\u2019a m\u00eame pas de seins \u00bb. Pendant que M. Thambirajah pronon\u00e7ait cette phrase, [expurg\u00e9] a tendu la main et saisi le haut de sa chemise de Mme Cassidy, puis l\u2019a tir\u00e9e vers le bas, faisant en sorte qu\u2019un troisi\u00e8me bouton s\u2019est d\u00e9fait. Mme Cassidy \u00e9tait tellement g\u00ean\u00e9e et constern\u00e9e qu\u2019elle s\u2019est tourn\u00e9e pour s\u2019en aller en traitant [expurg\u00e9] de trou-de-cul et en lui disant \u00ab \u00e7a d\u00e9montre encore une fois pourquoi personne ne t\u2019aime dans cette succursale \u00bb.\nLe t\u00e9moignage de M. Thambirajah sur cette question\n[39] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Thambirajah concernant ce qui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 ce jour-l\u00e0, si en fait quelque chose \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9, avait chang\u00e9 au terme de l\u2019audience. Lorsque Kelly Edmunds l\u2019avait questionn\u00e9 dans le cadre de son enqu\u00eate en juin 2006, il avait ni\u00e9 l\u2019incident. D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de M. Thambirajah d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience, [traduction] \u00ab L\u2019intim\u00e9 reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il y a eu un contact inappropri\u00e9 en novembre 2005, mais nie toute agression sexuelle envers la plaignante et, \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il se souvienne, l\u2019incident n\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019un \u00e9change de plaisanteries entre coll\u00e8gues \u00bb. Pour expliquer la position de son client \u00e0 l\u2019audience, M. Platt a affirm\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Le conflit en milieu de travail survenu en avril 2006 a d\u00e9clench\u00e9 la plainte [relative \u00e0 l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005]. L\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005 a eu lieu, mais pas de la fa\u00e7on d\u00e9crite par Mme Cassidy. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un flirt consensuel \u00bb. Dans ses observations finales, M. Platt a \u00e9crit au paragraphe 6 de son sommaire : [traduction] \u00ab Ni la plaignante ni aucun des autres t\u00e9moins, y compris M. Pyziak, n\u2019a signal\u00e9 d\u2019agression sexuelle \u00e0 Postes Canada en novembre 2005 parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y en a pas eu, \u00e0 moins que l\u2019effleurement de la chemise de Mme Cassidy par l\u2019intim\u00e9 puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant une agression sexuelle \u00bb.\n[40] Lors de l\u2019interrogatoire principal, M. Thambirajah a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab En novembre 2005, il n\u2019est rien arriv\u00e9 \u00bb. \u00c0 la question de savoir s\u2019il \u00e9tait possible qu\u2019il ait fait le commentaire du 9 novembre au sujet des seins de Mme Cassidy, il a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Non, je ne fais [sic] jamais \u00e7a. Peut-\u00eatre l\u2019effleurement avec la main. \u00bb Plus tard, en interrogatoire principal, M. Platt lui a demand\u00e9 : en supposant que la version de l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005 soit exacte et qu\u2019il avait touch\u00e9 Mme Cassidy de mani\u00e8re inappropri\u00e9e et formul\u00e9 le commentaire d\u00e9plac\u00e9 sur la taille de ses seins, le regrettait-il? Il a r\u00e9pondu par l\u2019affirmative. [traduction] \u00ab Pr\u00e9senteriez-vous vos excuses? \u00bb, lui a demand\u00e9 M. Platt. M. Thambirajah a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Je pr\u00e9sente mes excuses \u00e0 quiconque croit que j\u2019avais l\u2019intention de le toucher \u00e0 des fins sexuelles [\u2026] mille excuses. \u00bb\n[41] Durant son t\u00e9moignage en r\u00e9ponse aux questions de M. Machelak, M. Thambirajah a affirm\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nIl se peut qu\u2019il y ait eu un contact, mais pas de nature sexuelle. Pour une raison quelconque, Johnny, qui \u00e9tait un bon ami, a accept\u00e9 une entente avantageuse avec la direction [\u2026] pour me sortir de la succursale [\u2026] [L\u2019effleurement] est arriv\u00e9 avant ou apr\u00e8s le 8 ou le 9 novembre. Ma main n\u2019a pas eu de contact avec sa chemise, peut-\u00eatre que j\u2019ai effleur\u00e9 Johnny.\nLorsque M. Machelak lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi il avait dit en interrogatoire principal qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre produit quelque chose et qu\u2019il pr\u00e9sentait ses excuses, l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab il est possible que j\u2019aie effleur\u00e9 Johnny Pyziak, il est possible que j\u2019aie touch\u00e9 la main de Doris. Johnny la tenait dans ses bras. Il est possible que j\u2019aie touch\u00e9 le bras de Doris. \u00bb\n[42] En contre-interrogatoire, M. Thambirajah a convenu que l\u2019incident de l\u2019attouchement et du commentaire, pr\u00e9tendument survenu le 9 novembre 2005, aurait constitu\u00e9 un comportement d\u00e9plac\u00e9 si en fait une telle chose s\u2019\u00e9tait produite. Toutefois, il a maintenu que [traduction] \u00ab cela n\u2019est pas arriv\u00e9 \u00bb. Il n\u2019est pas clair ce qu\u2019il entendait par [traduction] \u00ab cela \u00bb : voulait-il dire que l\u2019attouchement et le commentaire n\u2019avaient jamais eu lieu? Ou qu\u2019un attouchement de nature sexuelle n\u2019avait jamais eu lieu? Ou que le commentaire (au sujet de la taille de ses seins, etc.) n\u2019a jamais eu lieu? Lorsque M. Kelly a laiss\u00e9 entendre qu\u2019il ne pr\u00e9sentait pas vraiment ses excuses \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il affirme n\u2019avoir rien fait de mal, M. Thambirajah a reconnu que c\u2019\u00e9tait vrai. [traduction] \u00ab Alors, pourquoi pr\u00e9senter des excuses? \u00bb, lui a demand\u00e9 M. Kelly. L\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Il est possible que ce soit arriv\u00e9 avant le 10 avril [2006]. On se taquinait, on riait [\u2026] on se lan\u00e7ait des jurons \u00bb. Pouss\u00e9 par M. Kelly \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre que l\u2019incident de l\u2019attouchement et du commentaire du 9 novembre avait peut-\u00eatre eu lieu, M. Thambirajah a r\u00e9agi : [traduction] \u00ab Non. On m\u2019a demand\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter mes excuses. Vaut mieux pr\u00e9senter des excuses si j\u2019avais fait une telle chose. Jamais je ne me sens mal parce que je ne reconnais pas ce que je n\u2019ai pas fait. Personne ne vit dans un monde parfait [\u2026] Encore une fois, si une telle chose est arriv\u00e9e, je pr\u00e9senterai mes excuses. L\u2019anglais n\u2019est pas ma langue maternelle. Si j\u2019avais effleur\u00e9 son corps, mais pas sa poitrine, je pr\u00e9senterais mes excuses. \u00bb Plus tard, il a affirm\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Je me sentirais mal si je l\u2019avais touch\u00e9e intentionnellement \u00bb. Il a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait la [traduction] \u00ab victime \u00bb dans cette affaire et que [traduction] \u00ab toute la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 sortira un jour \u00bb.\n[43] M. Thambirajah a ensuite affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible, comme l\u2019avait soutenu M. Pyziak, qu\u2019il ait [traduction] \u00ab effleur\u00e9 \u00bb la poitrine de Mme Cassidy avec la main : [traduction] \u00ab Il est possible que son souvenir soit exact \u00bb. Puis, il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il pouvait [traduction] \u00ab garantir \u00bb et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab certain \u00e0 100 pour 100 \u00bb que l\u2019incident n\u2019\u00e9tait pas survenu le 8 ou le 9 novembre 2005, car il n\u2019est pas consign\u00e9 dans son journal [ni dans celui de Mme Cassidy, d\u2019ailleurs]. Son journal signale une rencontre entre lui, Mme Cassidy et la d\u00e9funte Ann Jones, une coll\u00e8gue de travail, le 8 novembre, mais aucune rencontre avec Mme Cassidy le 9 novembre.\nLe t\u00e9moignage de John Pyziak sur cette question\n[44] M. Pyziak est le seul tiers qui ait vu ce qui est arriv\u00e9 ce jour-l\u00e0. M. Thambirajah a affirm\u00e9 que M. Pyziak et lui \u00e9taient [traduction] \u00ab de tr\u00e8s bons amis \u00bb et que M. Pyziak avait dirig\u00e9 sa campagne lors de son \u00e9lection \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical. Selon M. Pyziak, ils \u00e9taient amis jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab change \u00bb apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu le poste de d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical. Il est demeur\u00e9 en bons termes avec M. Thambirajah par la suite. Il \u00e9tait \u00e9galement en bons termes avec la plaignante.\n[45] M. Pyziak a affirm\u00e9 que le jour en cause :\n[traduction]\nRaj voulait aller fumer avec moi [\u2026] Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas intentionnel, mais il a mis la main sur la chemise de Doris [\u2026] J\u2019\u00e9tais stup\u00e9fi\u00e9. Je ne sais pas ce que Raj avait en t\u00eate. Doris a r\u00e9agi en faisant une farce, \u00ab dans ma famille, les femmes n\u2019ont pas de poitrine \u00bb, mais elle a rougi, elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s surprise, elle \u00e9tait g\u00ean\u00e9e. Elle ne l\u2019a pas gifl\u00e9 ou quelque chose du genre [\u2026] Le geste l\u2019avait rendue nerveuse. Elle a ri nerveusement.\nM. Pyziak a affirm\u00e9 que, apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident, il est all\u00e9 \u00e0 la plate-forme arri\u00e8re avec M. Thambirajah et celui-ci a dit [traduction] \u00ab Ah, ce n\u2019est rien. Il a tout simplement fait comme si de rien n\u2019\u00e9tait. \u00bb\n[46] En contre-interrogatoire, M. Pyziak a affirm\u00e9 avoir signal\u00e9 \u00e0 Postes Canada dans une entrevue : [traduction] \u00ab Ce qu\u2019il a fait m\u2019a stup\u00e9fi\u00e9. Il a tendu la main et a dit en plaisantant qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas de poitrine [\u2026] Il a fait un geste d\u2019effleurement. Sa main a touch\u00e9 la chemise de Doris. \u00bb Plus tard en contre-interrogatoire, il a affirm\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Il l\u2019a effleur\u00e9e de la main, a dit qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas de poitrine, et sa main a touch\u00e9 sa poitrine. Il n\u2019a pas saisi ses seins. Il a touch\u00e9 le haut de son corps. \u00bb En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la suggestion qu\u2019il ne savait pas si le geste avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accidentel, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019affirmation que Mme Cassidy n\u2019avait pas gifl\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9, mais avait plut\u00f4t fait une farce, et en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question de savoir pourquoi il avait trouv\u00e9 le geste [traduction] \u00ab totalement d\u00e9plac\u00e9 \u00bb, il a r\u00e9pondu [traduction] \u00ab ce que Raj a fait \u2013 le coup d\u2019\u0153il, l\u2019effleurement et le commentaire selon lequel elle n\u2019avait pas de poitrine \u2013 \u00e9tait d\u00e9plac\u00e9. Ce qu\u2019il a fait m\u2019a stup\u00e9fi\u00e9. \u00bb Il a \u00e9galement reconnu ne pas \u00eatre rest\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s d\u2019elle apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident : [traduction] \u00ab je serais rest\u00e9 avec elle si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 boulevers\u00e9e \u00bb.\n[47] D\u2019apr\u00e8s les notes de Mme Edmunds r\u00e9dig\u00e9es \u00e0 la suite de son entrevue avec M. Pyziak le 12 juillet 2006, ce dernier avait affirm\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nIl [M. Thambirajah] fixait Doris (\u00e0 la hauteur de sa poitrine). Elle s\u2019est rendu compte qu\u2019un bouton de sa chemise \u00e9tait d\u00e9fait et, lorsqu\u2019elle l\u2019a boutonn\u00e9, Raj a tendu la main vers elle et a accroch\u00e9 la chemise avec son index, puis a tir\u00e9 la chemise vers lui et a plong\u00e9 un regard derri\u00e8re. Doris ne savait pas quoi faire ou quoi dire, alors j\u2019ai l\u2019impression que, \u00e0 cause de nervosit\u00e9, elle a dit \u00ab Oh, j\u2019ai de petits seins. On m\u2019a toujours taquin\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole secondaire \u00e0 cause de cela [\u2026] \u00bb ou quelque chose du genre. Ensuite, il est parti. J\u2019ai regard\u00e9 Doris et je lui ai dit : \u00ab peux-tu croire ce qu\u2019il vient de te faire? \u00bb Peu apr\u00e8s, sur la plate-forme, j\u2019ai vu Raj et je lui ai dit : \u00ab je ne peux pas croire que tu as fait \u00e7a \u00bb. Je pense que Raj \u00e9tait conscient de ce qu\u2019il venait de faire et a tent\u00e9 de minimiser son geste en disant : \u00ab Oh, ce n\u2019est rien \u00bb et en faisant peu de cas de la situation.\n[48] La d\u00e9claration \u00e9crite de M. Pyziak \u00e0 la Commission en date du 19 septembre 2007 a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie par Mme Cassidy; cette d\u00e9claration \u00e9tait jointe \u00e0 une lettre de Mme Cassidy \u00e0 la Commission apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte. Dans cette d\u00e9claration, M. Pyziak a \u00e9crit :\n[traduction]\nJ\u2019ai remarqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il fixait la chemise de Doris, alors je lui ai demand\u00e9 ce qu\u2019il regardait. Il r\u00e9pond [sic] \u00ab rien, elle n\u2019a m\u00eame pas de seins \u00bb, je ne pouvais pas croire ce qu\u2019il venait de faire. En me retournant, j\u2019ai remarqu\u00e9 que le bouton du haut de la chemise de Doris \u00e9tait d\u00e9fait et je le lui ai dit. G\u00ean\u00e9e, elle voulait se tourner rapidement pour le boutonner, mais n\u2019a pas eu le temps parce que Raj a tendu la main et arrach\u00e9 un autre bouton, exposant la poitrine de Doris [\u2026]\nSelon les notes d\u2019entrevue de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur de la Commission en date du 12 septembre 2008, M. Pyziak a affirm\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] Je parlais \u00e0 Doris et Raj a accroch\u00e9 la chemise de Doris avec son doigt et l\u2019a tir\u00e9e vers lui et a dit \u201cpas de seins\u201d. Doris a rougi et \u00e9tait g\u00ean\u00e9e [\u2026] \u00bb\n[49] En contre-interrogatoire, M. Pyziak a reconnu que sa d\u00e9claration \u00e9crite en date du 19 septembre 2007 transmise \u00e0 la Commission par Mme Cassidy diff\u00e9rait dans sa description des \u00e9v\u00e9nements du 9 novembre 2005 en comparaison avec ses d\u00e9clarations \u00e0 Postes Canada et \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eateur de la Commission. On lui a soulign\u00e9 que la d\u00e9claration \u00e0 la Commission en date du 19 septembre 2007 [traduction] \u00ab embellissait \u00bb les \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Il a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab je ne l\u2019ai pas tap\u00e9e. Je ne me souviens plus qui me l\u2019a remise \u00bb; toutefois, il a reconnu que la d\u00e9claration porte sa signature. Le passage [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] Raj a tendu la main et arrach\u00e9 un autre bouton, exposant la poitrine de Doris \u00bb ne correspond pas \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il a vu ce jour-l\u00e0. Il a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Exactement \u00bb. Puis, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a dit : [traduction] \u00ab Mais vous l\u2019avez sign\u00e9e. \u00bb [traduction] \u00ab C\u2019est possible \u00bb, a r\u00e9pondu M. Pyziak. [traduction] \u00ab Doris l\u2019a \u00e9crite et vous a demand\u00e9 de la signer et de l\u2019envoyer \u00e0 la Commission des droits de la personne \u00bb, a affirm\u00e9 l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9. [traduction] \u00ab Je ne me souviens pas \u00bb, a r\u00e9pondu le t\u00e9moin.\n[50] Des conversations enregistr\u00e9es les 7 et 8 septembre 2006 (\u00e0 l\u2019insu de M. Pyziak) entre l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel et M. Pyziak ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en preuve. La qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019enregistrement n\u2019est pas bonne et certaines sections sont inaudibles. Toutefois, on entend clairement M. Thambirajah poser des questions \u00e0 M. Pyziak sur ce qui est arriv\u00e9 le 9 novembre 2005. Dans la premi\u00e8re partie, M. Pyziak affirme que M. Thambirajah [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019a pas saisi ses seins. \u00c7a ne l\u2019a pas d\u00e9rang\u00e9e. C\u2019est des conneries [\u2026] quatre mois plus tard, elle veut porter des accusations contre toi \u00bb [en fait, cinq mois et demi s\u2019\u00e9taient \u00e9coul\u00e9s entre l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005 et la plainte \u00e9crite de Mme Cassidy en date du 25 avril 2006 \u00e0 Postes Canada]. Sur l\u2019enregistrement du lendemain [encore une fois, M. Pyziak ne sait pas que leur conversation est enregistr\u00e9e], il a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Tu n\u2019as pas saisi ses seins [\u2026] Il ne va rien se passer. \u00c7a fait trop longtemps [\u2026] Elle revient plus tard parce qu\u2019elle est f\u00e2ch\u00e9e au sujet de quelque chose \u00bb [avoir fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une mesure disciplinaire en compagnie de M. Thambirajah pour avoir cri\u00e9 et prof\u00e9r\u00e9 des jurons en avril 2006]. M. Thambirajah affirme ensuite : [traduction] \u00ab Elle le fait pour obtenir un avantage [\u2026] annuler le travail que j\u2019ai fait pour le syndicat [\u2026] Je ne veux pas \u00eatre la victime \u00e0 cause de mon engagement syndical \u00bb. M. Pyziak affirme plus loin : [traduction] \u00ab C\u2019est une grosse connerie [\u2026] Pourquoi elle n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de plainte \u00e0 la direction \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque? C\u2019est tout ce que tu as \u00e0 leur dire. \u00bb Plus loin, M. Pyziak affirme : [traduction] \u00ab Ann Jones, la maudite vache [\u2026] tu as eu des probl\u00e8mes avec elle. C\u2019est elle [Mme Jones] qui a pouss\u00e9 cette femme [Mme Cassidy]. \u00bb M. Thambirajah a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab C\u2019est comme \u00e7a que \u00e7a se passe. \u00bb\n[51] En contre-interrogatoire, relativement \u00e0 la conversation enregistr\u00e9e le 8 septembre 2006, M. Pyziak a \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9 d\u2019expliquer ce qu\u2019il voulait dire quand il r\u00e9p\u00e9tait constamment : [traduction] \u00ab c\u2019est une connerie [\u2026] \u00bb Il a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Il m\u2019a pos\u00e9 la question une trentaine de fois, m\u2019a questionn\u00e9 constamment au sujet de ce qui est arriv\u00e9 [\u2026] Il ne l\u00e2che jamais : trente-deux fois il m\u2019a demand\u00e9 : \u201cde quelle fa\u00e7on je l\u2019ai touch\u00e9e?\u201d \u00bb Confront\u00e9 au fait qu\u2019il avait dit au moins huit fois que le geste commis lors de l\u2019incident \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab pour plaisanter \u00bb, et que pourtant il avait donn\u00e9 une version diff\u00e9rente aux responsables de Postes Canada et de la Commission, M. Pyziak a r\u00e9pondu :\n[traduction]\nJe c\u00e8de aux pressions exerc\u00e9es par Raj [\u2026] Il me harcelait pour que je fasse les choses \u00e0 sa fa\u00e7on [\u2026] Pour qu\u2019il me laisse tranquille, lui donner raison, c\u2019est le genre de personne qu\u2019il est [\u2026] il m\u2019a menac\u00e9e une fois, mon poste [\u2026] \u00e7a fait partie de la culture dont il est issu, c\u2019est l\u2019homme qui d\u00e9cide [se tournant vers M. Thambirajah dans la salle d\u2019audience :] Pourquoi tu n\u2019as pas tout simplement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 tes excuses pour ton geste? Ce n\u2019est pas dans sa personnalit\u00e9 [\u2026] Pour que ce gars-l\u00e0 te laisse tranquille, tu devais jouer selon ses r\u00e8gles. Voil\u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 [\u2026] J\u2019\u00e9tais surpris qu\u2019il se soit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 [en personne le 8 septembre]. C\u2019est comme \u00e7a qu\u2019il faut agir avec lui. Tu te plies \u00e0 ces exigences.\nToutefois, comme M. Machelak l\u2019a signal\u00e9 au t\u00e9moin, c\u2019est lui qui avait invit\u00e9 M. Thambirajah \u00e0 venir le rencontrer le 8 septembre.\n[52] Quand je lui ai demand\u00e9 ce qu\u2019il entendait par [traduction] \u00ab c\u2019est une connerie [\u2026] \u00bb, le t\u00e9moin a r\u00e9pondu que la [traduction] \u00ab connerie \u00bb n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la plainte de Mme Cassidy et l\u2019all\u00e9gation concernant l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005, mais le harc\u00e8lement de M. Pyziak par M. Thambirajah lors des conversations enregistr\u00e9es : c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire le fait de lui demander une trentaine de fois ce qui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9. M. Machelak l\u2019a interrog\u00e9 sur ce point : [traduction] \u00ab \u00cates\u2011vous en train de dire qu\u2019il a arr\u00eat\u00e9 l\u2019enregistreuse, que vous avez dit \u201carr\u00eate de me harceler\u201d et qu\u2019il a coup\u00e9 des bouts de votre conversation et a conserv\u00e9 seulement la partie o\u00f9 vous dites \u201cc\u2019est une connerie [\u2026] quatre mois\u201d [\u2026] qu\u2019il a manipul\u00e9 l\u2019enregistrement? \u00bb \u00c9tonnamment, M. Pyziak a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Il en serait capable. Je lui disais tout ce qu\u2019il voulait entendre. C\u2019est pourquoi je n\u2019ai pas d\u2019ennuis avec lui. Je suis toujours d\u2019accord avec lui. \u00bb M. Pyziak a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait probablement arr\u00eat\u00e9 l\u2019enregistrement par moments.\nB. Le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate de Postes Canada [53] Dans son rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate en date du 1er septembre 2006, Mme Edmunds a conclu que la plainte de Mme Cassidy \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e. Selon le rapport, le r\u00e9cit du [traduction] \u00ab t\u00e9moin A \u00bb (M. Pyziak) [traduction] \u00ab corrobore \u00bb la version de Mme Cassidy de l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005. Mme Edmunds a \u00e9crit :\n[traduction]\nCe t\u00e9moin corrobore \u00e9galement que le mis en cause a tendu la main, tir\u00e9 sur la chemise avec son index et plong\u00e9 un regard derri\u00e8re. M\u00eame si le t\u00e9moin ne se souvenait pas si le mis en cause avait prof\u00e9r\u00e9 des paroles telles que \u00ab je ne fixais pas sa poitrine, elle n\u2019a m\u00eame pas de seins \u00bb, il se souvient que la plaignante semblait abasourdie et stup\u00e9faite [\u2026]\n[54] Dans son rapport, Mme Edmunds signale aussi que M. Thambirajah niait qu\u2019il y ait eu un tel incident et soutenait ne pas avoir travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 Willowdale D pendant une partie du mois de novembre 2005. Dans le rapport, Mme Edmunds pr\u00e9cise que, selon les registres des pr\u00e9sences de Postes Canada pour le mois de novembre 2005, M. Thambirajah se trouvait \u00e0 Willowdale D tous les jours, pour la journ\u00e9e enti\u00e8re ou pour une partie de la journ\u00e9e, sauf le 2 et le 21 seulement.\nC. Conclusions concernant l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005 [55] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je ne peux admettre de mani\u00e8re int\u00e9grale aucune des versions de l\u2019incident pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les trois personnes qui y \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sentes \u2013 soit Mme Cassidy, M. Thambirajah et M. Pyziak. Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Cassidy ne cadre pas avec ses d\u00e9clarations pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes et d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaires. Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Pyziak att\u00e9nue l\u2019incident : un [traduction] \u00ab effleurement \u00bb de la chemise \u00e0 la hauteur de la poitrine plut\u00f4t que l\u2019accrochage de la chemise avec l\u2019index pour la tirer vers l\u2019avant et plonger un regard derri\u00e8re. Il ressort clairement des conversations enregistr\u00e9es que M. Pyziak disait \u00e0 M. Thambirajah ce que ce dernier esp\u00e9rait entendre, par exemple : [traduction] \u00ab c\u2019est une connerie, Raj \u00bb \u2013 faisant renvoi au fait que la plainte n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e qu\u2019en avril 2006. Il est clair que M. Pyziak \u00e9tait de mauvaise foi. De plus, il y a des divergences entre ce qu\u2019il a dit \u00e0 Mme Edmunds et son t\u00e9moignage.\n[56] Qu\u2019en est-il de la description des \u00e9v\u00e9nements du 9 novembre 2005 selon M. Thambirajah? Elle va de la d\u00e9n\u00e9gation cat\u00e9gorique au quasi-aveu d\u2019un attouchement. Je fais abstraction des observations de M. Platt (qui ont vari\u00e9 grandement du d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation des observations finales) et du contenu de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. M. Thambirajah s\u2019est contredit durant son t\u00e9moignage, lors de son interrogatoire principal et de son contre\u2011interrogatoire \u2013 il y avait m\u00eame des contradictions entre divers passages de son contre\u2011interrogatoire. Au bout du compte, je constate qu\u2019il est pass\u00e9 de la d\u00e9n\u00e9gation compl\u00e8te de l\u2019incident dans sa d\u00e9claration \u00e0 Mme Edmunds \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage selon lequel l\u2019attouchement ou [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019effleurement \u00bb de la chemise de Mme Cassidy \u00e0 la hauteur de sa poitrine est peut-\u00eatre survenu accidentellement. Toutefois, d\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, s\u2019il a touch\u00e9 la plaignante, il n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de la toucher \u00e0 des fins sexuelles. D\u2019o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9sentation de ses excuses qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas vraiment des excuses, lors de son interrogatoire principal et du contre-interrogatoire men\u00e9 par M. Kelly. Je conclus que, durant son t\u00e9moignage, M. Thambirajah a fait un aveu de facto qu\u2019il y avait eu un attouchement quelconque. De plus, M. Pyziak a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, durant les conversations enregistr\u00e9es en septembre 2006, l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel lui avait demand\u00e9 trente\u2011deux fois de quelle mani\u00e8re il avait touch\u00e9 Mme Cassidy. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la remarque [traduction] \u00ab elle n\u2019a m\u00eame pas de seins \u00bb, il a cat\u00e9goriquement ni\u00e9 l\u2019avoir faite. Il n\u2019y a pas eu de quasi-aveu, m\u00eame pas un aveu assorti de nuances ou de r\u00e9serves, \u00e0 ce chapitre.\n[57] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je suis convaincu que le 9 novembre 2005 ou vers cette date, M. Thambirajah a touch\u00e9 de la main la chemise de Mme Cassidy \u00e0 la hauteur de la poitrine, tout en faisant un commentaire sur la taille de ses seins. Il y a eu un contact physique entre sa main et la chemise \u00e0 la hauteur de la poitrine. Je n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un [traduction] \u00ab effleurement \u00bb ou d\u2019un [traduction] \u00ab l\u00e9ger attouchement \u00bb. Le geste n\u2019\u00e9tait pas accidentel. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un contact d\u00e9plac\u00e9 intentionnel avec la chemise de Mme Cassidy \u00e0 la hauteur de la poitrine, accompagn\u00e9 d\u2019un commentaire d\u00e9plac\u00e9 de nature sexuelle concernant la taille de ses seins. J\u2019aborderai les r\u00e9percussions juridiques de cette conclusion plus loin dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs.\nLa r\u00e9action de Mme Cassidy\n[58] Je suis convaincu que Mme Cassidy a dit une plaisanterie au sujet des femmes dans sa famille qui ont peu de poitrine, mais qu\u2019elle a aussi avis\u00e9 M. Thambirajah que l\u2019attouchement et le commentaire n\u2019\u00e9taient pas appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s. J\u2019admets \u00e9galement que M. Pyziak a fait une remarque \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 \u00e0 Mme Cassidy et par la suite \u00e0 M. Thambirajah, signalant clairement \u00e0 tous les deux qu\u2019il \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab stup\u00e9fi\u00e9 \u00bb par ce qui venait de se produire. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Cassidy, elle a, le jour m\u00eame, port\u00e9 plainte contre M. Thambirajah \u00e0 ses superviseurs, Cam Tidman et Moe Sultan. J\u2019examinerai cette question plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente section.\nD. Du 10 novembre 2005 au 9 avril 2006 : l\u2019interaction entre la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 [59] Il y a eu une certaine interaction entre Mme Cassidy et M. Thambirajah durant la p\u00e9riode qui a suivi l\u2019incident de l\u2019attouchement et du commentaire. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Cassidy a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il la narguait ou la [traduction] \u00ab harcelait \u00bb fr\u00e9quemment : [traduction] \u00ab presque tous les jours au travail, il faisait quelque chose \u00bb [durant la p\u00e9riode du 9 novembre 2005 \u00e0 2006]. Elle soutient que, en d\u00e9cembre 2005, elle est presque tomb\u00e9e dans un bac \u00e0 courrier au bureau de service et M. Thambirajah a dit : [traduction] \u00ab au moins, tu as un cul \u00bb. M. Thambirajah a ni\u00e9 l\u2019incident. Rien ne corrobore cet incident. Je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019il s\u2019est produit.\n[60] Quelle relation avaient-ils avant le 9 novembre 2005? Je conclus que la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel \u00e9taient en bons termes. Ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas dans un \u00e9tat de conflit permanent en milieu de travail. Ni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre ne contestent qu\u2019il en \u00e9tait ainsi avant le 9 novembre 2005. Par exemple, j\u2019admets que la note suivante tir\u00e9e du journal de M. Thambirajah, en date du 8 novembre 2005 (soit la veille de l\u2019incident de l\u2019attouchement et du commentaire) : [traduction] \u00ab Doriss [sic] est venue faire un tour et a plaisant\u00e9 avec moi [\u2026] \u00bb\n[61] Durant la p\u00e9riode apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005 jusqu\u2019au 10 avril 2006 (soit la date de l\u2019escalade du conflit), comment \u00e9tait leur relation au travail? Il y avait des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve contradictoires \u00e0 ce sujet. Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005 (que, selon ma conclusion ci-dessus, Mme Cassidy n\u2019a pas appr\u00e9ci\u00e9), je conclus que Mme Cassidy et M. Thambirajah n\u2019\u00e9taient pas dans un \u00e9tat de conflit permanent. Comme l\u2019a signal\u00e9 Postes Canada, elle n\u2019a pas pris un seul jour de cong\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019incident du 9 novembre et n\u2019a inclus aucune journ\u00e9e de ce genre dans sa r\u00e9clamation pour perte de salaire contre Postes Canada relativement \u00e0 cette p\u00e9riode (pi\u00e8ce C1-31). La premi\u00e8re journ\u00e9e signal\u00e9e dans cette r\u00e9clamation est le 12 avril 2006. Les notes cliniques d\u00e9taill\u00e9es de son m\u00e9decin de famille, le docteur Ung, ne font \u00e9tat d\u2019aucun conflit entre elle et M. Thambirajah durant cette p\u00e9riode.\n[62] De plus, je conclus qu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9 l\u2019aide de M. Thambirajah \u00e0 plusieurs reprises durant cette p\u00e9riode, malgr\u00e9 ses affirmations selon lesquelles elle avait peur de lui durant cette p\u00e9riode. Par exemple, M. Thambirajah a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, le 15 novembre 2005 \u2013 moins d\u2019une semaine apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident du 9 novembre \u2013, Mme Cassidy l\u2019avait abord\u00e9 pour qu\u2019il l\u2019aide \u00e0 remplir un formulaire de cong\u00e9 (pi\u00e8ce RT1-10, p. 10). L\u2019\u00e9criture sur ce formulaire est celle de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Elle a ni\u00e9 avoir jamais demand\u00e9 l\u2019aide de l\u2019intim\u00e9 durant cette p\u00e9riode. Toutefois, en contre interrogatoire, elle a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab je ne sais pas, ce n\u2019est pas mon \u00e9criture \u00bb. Plus tard, elle a dit : [traduction] \u00ab Je ne suis pas une experte en graphologie, c\u2019est possible. Il est certain que je ne lui aurais pas demand\u00e9 de l\u2019aide \u00e0 cause de l\u2019incident survenu ce mois-l\u00e0 [le 9 novembre]. \u00bb Plus tard encore, elle a affirm\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab je n\u2019irais pas voir Raj pour obtenir de l\u2019aide. J\u2019aurais demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Steward, \u00e0 Ann Jones ou \u00e0 Cam [\u2026] Je ne lui ai pas demand\u00e9 [\u00e0 M. Thambirajah]. \u00bb Je ne crois pas que M. Thambirajah aurait rempli ce formulaire sans raison et sans que Mme Cassidy lui ait demand\u00e9 son assistance. Le formulaire porte la signature de Mme Cassidy.\n[63] J\u2019admets \u00e9galement la preuve selon laquelle M. Thambirajah a aid\u00e9 la plaignante le 29 d\u00e9cembre 2005. La note dans son journal pour cette date indique que : [traduction] \u00ab Dorris [sic] a dit qu\u2019elle avait une migraine, alors je lui ai trouv\u00e9 un suppl\u00e9ant pour l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi \u00bb. Cela tend \u00e0 confirmer que Mme Cassidy n\u2019avait pas peur de M. Thambirajah \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en bons termes avec lui, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019incident du 9 novembre. Elle a fait appel \u00e0 son assistance \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical. Il convient de pr\u00e9ciser qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait rien d\u2019inappropri\u00e9 dans le fait qu\u2019elle ait demand\u00e9 de l\u2019aide \u00e0 son d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical et coll\u00e8gue.\n[64] Les entr\u00e9es dans le journal de M. Thambirajah pour le 3 et le 10 janvier 2006 indiquent qu\u2019il pr\u00eatait assistance \u00e0 Mme Cassidy. L\u2019entr\u00e9e du 10 janvier faisait \u00e9tat d\u2019un commentaire inappropri\u00e9 de Mme Cassidy au sujet d\u2019un employ\u00e9 handicap\u00e9. M. Thambirajah lui a demand\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter ses excuses et il n\u2019a pas signal\u00e9 l\u2019incident \u00e0 la direction. La plaignante reconna\u00eet que cet incident s\u2019est produit. Si leur relation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 empoisonn\u00e9e \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, le moment aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 bien choisi pour M. Thambirajah de signaler Mme Cassidy \u00e0 la direction. Il ne l\u2019a pas fait.\n[65] Du 19 janvier 2006 au 20 mars 2006, la plaignante s\u2019est absent\u00e9e du travail \u00e0 cause d\u2019une blessure \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9paule.\nE. Le conflit s\u2019intensifie en avril 2006 [66] Selon la th\u00e8se de la d\u00e9fense de M. Thambirajah, le conflit entre lui et Mme Cassidy s\u2019est amorc\u00e9 en avril 2006. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que l\u2019incident de l\u2019attouchement et du commentaire d\u00e9plac\u00e9s a eu lieu le 9 novembre 2005. Je conclus \u00e9galement que, dans une large mesure, leur relation \u00e9tait cordiale durant la p\u00e9riode qui a suivi cet incident jusqu\u2019au 10 avril 2006. C\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 que le conflit s\u2019est intensifi\u00e9 entre eux. Qu\u2019est-il arriv\u00e9?\n[67] Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que, le 10 avril 2006, la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel se sont \u00e9chang\u00e9s des jurons au sujet de la livraison de circulaires. Mme Cassidy devait remplacer M. Thambirajah et effectuer son itin\u00e9raire. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel, quand il lui a demand\u00e9 de livrer les circulaires, Mme Cassidy lui a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Va te faire foutre \u00bb. Selon la plaignante, il lui a r\u00e9pondu dans la m\u00eame veine. Le lendemain, ils se sont disput\u00e9s lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union syndicale et Mme Cassidy a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre coll\u00e8gue d\u2019accompagner M. Thambirajah \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la salle, sinon elle allait [traduction] \u00ab porter des accusations \u00bb contre lui. Le 12 avril 2006, ils ont eu une nouvelle dispute. M. Thambirajah a lanc\u00e9 des jurons \u00e0 Mme Cassidy et elle a pris un cong\u00e9 de maladie pour le reste de la journ\u00e9e.\n[68] Mme Cassidy all\u00e8gue que, le 18 avril 2006, M. Thambirajah [traduction] \u00ab m\u2019a touch\u00e9e, m\u2019a donn\u00e9 une tape sur le derri\u00e8re \u00bb et a dit [traduction] \u00ab au moins, tu as un cul \u00bb. Une autre fois, selon la plaignante, il a parl\u00e9 de lui [traduction] \u00ab prendre \u00bb [les fesses]. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la plaignante, il s\u2019agissait du plus troublant de ses torts envers elle apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005. M. Thambirajah rejette cette accusation. En contre-interrogatoire, pri\u00e9e d\u2019expliquer pourquoi elle n\u2019avait pas signal\u00e9 cet incident grave de l\u2019attouchement de son derri\u00e8re dans sa plainte \u00e9crite \u00e0 Postes Canada en date du 25 avril 2006 (seul le commentaire y figure), ou pourquoi elle n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 d\u2019accusations criminelles, elle a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab parfois on frappe un mur, \u00e7a ne sert \u00e0 rien de continuer \u00bb. Toutefois, tel que je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 signal\u00e9, elle n\u2019a pas h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 faire valoir ses droits \u00e0 d\u2019autres moments et relativement \u00e0 des infractions moins graves. En fait, elle n\u2019a m\u00eame pas fait allusion \u00e0 l\u2019incident de la tape ou de l\u2019attouchement dans son interrogatoire principal. Finalement, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 son omission de le signaler dans sa plainte \u00e0 Postes Canada en date du 25 avril 2006, elle a dit : [traduction] \u00ab si je ne l\u2019ai pas signal\u00e9, c\u2019\u00e9tait un gros oubli de ma part \u00bb. Plus tard, elle a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab plus probable \u00bb que [traduction] \u00ab la tape sur le derri\u00e8re \u00bb s\u2019est produite en d\u00e9cembre 2005, plut\u00f4t que le 18 avril 2006, [traduction] \u00ab parce que c\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 que tout se passait \u00bb. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a not\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait travaill\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps que M. Thambirajah que pendant deux jours en d\u00e9cembre 2005 et qu\u2019elle ne l\u2019avait peut\u2011\u00eatre pas crois\u00e9 durant ces deux jours. Je conclus qu\u2019elle a r\u00e9pondu de mani\u00e8re \u00e9vasive durant cette partie de son t\u00e9moignage et que son t\u00e9moignage manquait de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Elle ne se souvient pas d\u2019un incident d\u2019attouchement sexuel comme celui-l\u00e0, mais se rappelle le commentaire moins intrusif. Et pourtant, elle fait \u00e9tat de torts beaucoup moins graves commis contre elle par M. Thambirajah (ne comportant pas d\u2019attouchement) dans sa plainte en date du 25 avril 2006. Selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je ne suis pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 conclure que cet incident s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 tel que Mme Cassidy l\u2019a d\u00e9crit.\n[69] Le prochain incident important s\u2019est produit le 19 avril 2006. Des coll\u00e8gues de travail ont entendu une dispute entre Mme Cassidy et M. Thambirajah : ils criaient et se lan\u00e7aient des jurons dans le couloir \u00e0 Willowdale D. La dispute s\u2019est envenim\u00e9e au point o\u00f9 certains coll\u00e8gues se sont plaints aupr\u00e8s du chef de service Cam Tidman. Il est intervenu. M. Tidman les a convoqu\u00e9s tous les deux pour des entrevues et leur a impos\u00e9 des mesures disciplinaires. Il leur a d\u00e9cern\u00e9 une mise en garde, qu\u2019il a vers\u00e9e dans leurs dossiers respectifs. Durant son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Cassidy a affirm\u00e9 que cette mise en garde l\u2019avait beaucoup vex\u00e9e, car il \u00e9tait injuste qu\u2019elle subisse une mesure disciplinaire pour cet incident, m\u00eame si elle admet avoir lanc\u00e9 des jurons \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel dans le couloir. Elle \u00e9tait vex\u00e9e \u00e0 cause de ce que, selon elle, il lui avait fait subir auparavant, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005 et [traduction] \u00ab le harc\u00e8lement continuel \u00bb.\n[70] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tidman, \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019incident des jurons en avril, Mme Cassidy lui avait dit : [traduction] \u00ab tu t\u2019attends \u00e0 ce que j\u2019effectue l\u2019itin\u00e9raire, mais lui il ne coop\u00e8re pas \u00bb. Elle n\u2019a pas fait renvoi \u00e0 l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005 ou \u00e0 la promesse non tenue de Postes Canada de r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me \u00e0 l\u2019interne. Selon M. Tidman, il ne pouvait pas ignorer l\u2019incident des cris et des jurons du 19 avril 2006, ni omettre de prendre des mesures appropri\u00e9es. Et cet incident n\u2019est pas plus grave que celui de l\u2019attouchement et du commentaire survenu le 9 novembre 2005.\nF. La plainte \u00e9crite \u00e0 Postes Canada en date du 25 avril 2006 [71] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une date importante dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Ce jour-l\u00e0, Mme Cassidy a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Tidman une plainte \u00e9crite concernant l\u2019incident de l\u2019attouchement et du commentaire du 9 novembre 2005 et d\u2019autres all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement continu de la part de M. Thambirajah. Selon Mme Cassidy, apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005, elle a attendu pendant cinq mois et demi que Postes Canada r\u00e8gle la situation, mais en vain. D\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Cassidy, quand elle a port\u00e9 plainte le 9 novembre \u00e0 M. Tidman et \u00e0 M. Sultan, ils lui ont dit qu\u2019ils s\u2019en occuperaient et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de r\u00e9gler l\u2019affaire \u00e0 l\u2019interne. M. Sultan n\u2019a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Pour ce qui est de M. Tidman, il a affirm\u00e9 avec v\u00e9h\u00e9mence avoir pris connaissance pour la premi\u00e8re fois le 25 avril 2006 de l\u2019incident survenu le 9 novembre 2005.\nG. Est-ce que Postes Canada \u00e9tait au courant de l\u2019incident du 9 novembre avant le 25 avril 2006? [72] Durant son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Cassidy a fermement maintenu qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait rendue toute seule le 9 novembre 2005 au bureau que partageaient M. Tidman et M. Sultan et qu\u2019elle leur avait racont\u00e9 ce qui venait de se passer. Je note qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun renvoi \u00e0 cette rencontre avec ses superviseurs dans ses journaux volumineux et d\u00e9taill\u00e9s. J\u2019examinerai plus loin son all\u00e9gation en date du 31 mai 2010, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e apr\u00e8s avoir mis fin \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation de sa preuve, selon laquelle une employ\u00e9e d\u2019un autre bureau de service, A. B., l\u2019avait accompagn\u00e9e au bureau de M. Tidman et de M. Sultan et avait assist\u00e9 \u00e0 cette rencontre.\n[73] M. Tidman a longuement r\u00e9pondu aux questions sur ce point lors de son interrogatoire principal et de son contre-interrogatoire. Il a maintenu sans jamais reculer son affirmation selon laquelle c\u2019\u00e9tait le 25 avril 2006, et non le 9 novembre 2005, qu\u2019il avait pris connaissance de l\u2019incident pour la premi\u00e8re fois et que cela l\u2019avait renvers\u00e9. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nElle n\u2019est pas venue me voir [le 9 novembre 2005 ou \u00e0 un autre moment] et il est certain que personne n\u2019a dit quoi que ce soit au sujet d\u2019une agression ou d\u2019attouchements sexuels. Moe et moi partagions le m\u00eame bureau [\u2026] Non, pas du tout [en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question de savoir si Moe Sultan lui avait parl\u00e9 de cet incident ou si Mme Cassidy \u00e9tait venue le voir]. Moe et moi, on s\u2019entendait bien. S\u2019il y avait eu un probl\u00e8me, j\u2019en aurais entendu parler.\nIl a mentionn\u00e9 que Mme Cassidy venait parfois lui parler, mais c\u2019\u00e9tait au sujet de ses probl\u00e8mes personnels, comme la maladie chronique de sa fille.\nH. Les mesures prises par M. Tidman apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la plainte du 25 avril et la \u00ab com\u00e9die des erreurs \u00bb subs\u00e9quente [74] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tidman, le 25 avril 2006 a \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab la premi\u00e8re fois que j\u2019ai eu connaissance de cet incident et j\u2019ai eu un choc. Je n\u2019avais jamais eu \u00e0 faire face \u00e0 une telle situation dans ma vie professionnelle. J\u2019ai envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 Kelly [Edmunds], l\u2019avisant que j\u2019avais re\u00e7u une plainte relative aux droits de la personne, plus s\u00e9rieuse que celles dont on s\u2019occupe habituellement [\u2026] et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait donc pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de la confier aux sp\u00e9cialistes. \u00bb\n[75] M. Tidman a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que le probl\u00e8me entre la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel [traduction] \u00ab s\u2019est manifest\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois en avril 2006 avec cette engueulade. Je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas au courant de l\u2019attouchement [survenu le 9 novembre 2005] jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation de la plainte en avril. Je serais sorti de mes gonds si quelqu\u2019un m\u2019avait dit que quelqu\u2019un avait physiquement agress\u00e9 Doris. \u00bb Selon M. Tidman, la strat\u00e9gie que Moe Sultan et lui avaient adopt\u00e9e pour g\u00e9rer les conflits consistait \u00e0 demander aux employ\u00e9s de trouver une solution eux-m\u00eames. S\u2019ils n\u2019y parvenaient pas, M. Sultan ou lui intervenait et imposait une solution. Toutefois, il a affirm\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorique que cette approche ne s\u2019appliquait qu\u2019aux affaires graves, telles que [traduction] \u00ab les batailles, le harc\u00e8lement sexuel et les attouchements sexuels \u00bb. Cela est conforme \u00e0 la politique sur le harc\u00e8lement en vigueur \u00e0 Postes Canada. De telles [traduction] \u00ab affaires graves \u00bb auraient eu pour effet de [traduction] \u00ab sonner l\u2019alerte \u00bb chez lui. Il a affirm\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab quand j\u2019ai re\u00e7u sa plainte en avril, je l\u2019ai lue trois fois, pour d\u00e9sembrouiller mon cerveau \u00bb. Il nie \u00e9galement que la d\u00e9funte Ann Jones soit jamais venue le voir au sujet de l\u2019incident de novembre 2005.\nI. Les facteurs de stress dans la vie de Mme Cassidy [76] M. Tidman a signal\u00e9 avoir remarqu\u00e9 un changement dans le comportement de Mme Cassidy entre novembre 2005 et le 25 avril 2006 : [traduction] \u00ab elle \u00e9tait moins d\u00e9contract\u00e9e, plus stress\u00e9e. J\u2019attribuais ce changement en partie \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de sa fille [\u2026] Doris n\u2019\u00e9tait plus la m\u00eame [\u2026] \u00bb Comme nous le verrons plus loin, durant cette p\u00e9riode et par la suite, soit jusqu\u2019en 2009, Mme Cassidy vivait un stress important de plusieurs sources, comme en attestent son t\u00e9moignage, les notes dans ses journaux et les notes cliniques du Dr Ung. De plus, elle prenait du Prozac pour traiter sa d\u00e9pression. Les sources de stress incluaient des probl\u00e8mes familiaux relativement \u00e0 son conjoint de fait, la maladie de sa fille et d\u2019autres probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9, ses blessures professionnelles et ses absences du travail en 2006, sa crainte d\u2019\u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9e par Postes Canada, des probl\u00e8mes de sommeil et des migraines chroniques. En outre, \u00e9videmment, elle vivait un stress de plus en plus important en raison du harc\u00e8lement continu de la part de M. Thambirajah (selon les all\u00e9gations de Mme Cassidy, que j\u2019examinerai ci\u2011apr\u00e8s), qui se serait intensifi\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avril 2006 et qui se serait poursuivi jusqu\u2019en 2009. Je conclus qu\u2019elle vivait un grand stress \u2013 sur les plans personnel et professionnel \u2013 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque; toutefois, je signale qu\u2019il n\u2019y a rien dans les notes cliniques du Dr Ung du 17 novembre 2005 au 2 f\u00e9vrier 2006 en ce qui concerne le stress au travail. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, il a reconnu que, durant la p\u00e9riode allant de novembre 2005 au 5 mai 2006, elle ne lui avait pas parl\u00e9 de harc\u00e8lement sexuel de la part de M. Thambirajah, car, si elle avait abord\u00e9 cette question, il l\u2019aurait consign\u00e9 dans ses notes, comme il avait consign\u00e9 les autres probl\u00e8mes, notamment les facteurs de stress tels que la maladie de sa fille et d\u2019autres probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9.\nJ. La pr\u00e9tendue r\u00e9union entre Mme Cassidy et ses superviseurs (et A. B.) [77] Ainsi qu\u2019il est signal\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, Mme Cassidy a syst\u00e9matiquement maintenu que le jour de l\u2019incident de l\u2019attouchement et du commentaire, soit le 9 novembre 2005, elle s\u2019\u00e9tait rendue au bureau du chef de service M. Tidman et du superviseur M. Sultan pour d\u00e9poser une plainte. Selon Mme Cassidy, ces derniers lui avaient dit qu\u2019ils s\u2019occuperaient du dossier et demand\u00e9 de garder l\u2019affaire \u00e0 l\u2019interne. M. Tidman nie cette affirmation. M. Sultan n\u2019a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9.\n[78] Le 31 mai 2010, pour la premi\u00e8re fois depuis l\u2019incident survenu cinq ans plus t\u00f4t, mais seulement apr\u00e8s la cl\u00f4ture de sa preuve, Mme Cassidy a dit qu\u2019une autre personne avait assist\u00e9 \u00e0 cette r\u00e9union, soit A. B., une employ\u00e9e d\u2019un autre bureau de service qui se trouvait par hasard \u00e0 Willowdale D le 9 novembre 2005. Selon Mme Cassidy, la fin de semaine apr\u00e8s la cl\u00f4ture de sa preuve, elle se trouvait chez des amis \u2013 George et Pattie Tomaszewski, qui ont tous les deux t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u2013 et A. B. lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi elle ne l\u2019avait pas appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Mme Cassidy lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi. A. B. a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle avait assist\u00e9 \u00e0 une r\u00e9union avec la plaignante et ses superviseurs concernant la plainte de harc\u00e8lement sexuel contre M. Thambirajah le 9 novembre. Mme Cassidy a alors demand\u00e9 la r\u00e9ouverture de sa preuve et la chance d\u2019appeler A. B. \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Elle a affirm\u00e9 avoir compl\u00e8tement oubli\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019A. B. \u00e0 la r\u00e9union parce qu\u2019elle \u2013 c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire Mme Cassidy \u2013 souffrait de trouble de stress post\u2011traumatique (TSPT).\n[79] Postes Canada a contest\u00e9 cette affirmation, y compris la pr\u00e9sence m\u00eame d\u2019A. B. \u00e0 Willowdale D ce jour-l\u00e0. J\u2019ai accept\u00e9, \u00e0 titre pr\u00e9liminaire, d\u2019entendre les t\u00e9moignages d\u2019A. B. et des t\u00e9moins de Postes Canada sur cette question, afin de d\u00e9cider si A. B. se trouvait au bureau de service le 9 novembre 2005.\nA. B. et l\u2019incident du 9 novembre \u00e0 Willowdale D\n[80] En novembre 2005, A. B., une amie proche de Patti Tomaszewski qui est \u00e9galement une amie proche de la plaignante, \u00e9tait factrice suppl\u00e9ante \u00e0 la succursale de Thornhill, appel\u00e9e West Beaver Creek. Selon le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019A. B., ce jour-l\u00e0 \u2013 elle ne se souvenait pas de la date exacte et n\u2019avait jamais consign\u00e9 les \u00e9v\u00e9nements par \u00e9crit \u2013 un superviseur (elle ne se rappelait pas lequel) lui a demand\u00e9 d\u2019aller cueillir ou d\u00e9poser les envois mal dirig\u00e9s \u00e0 Willowdale D, le matin entre 7 h 30 et 9 h. \u00c0 son arriv\u00e9e, elle a crois\u00e9 la plaignante qui semblait [traduction] \u00ab boulevers\u00e9e \u00bb et [traduction] \u00ab agit\u00e9e \u00bb et qui \u00e9tait en larmes. La plaignante lui a racont\u00e9 ce qui venait d\u2019arriver avec M. Thambirajah. Le t\u00e9moin a alors insist\u00e9 pour qu\u2019elles aillent au bureau de M. Tidman pour signaler l\u2019incident. Selon A. B., elle a assist\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union o\u00f9 la plaignante a racont\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Tidman et \u00e0 M. Sultan ce qui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9.\n[81] En contre-interrogatoire, l\u2019avocat de Postes Canada a signal\u00e9 qu\u2019A. B. n\u2019avait jamais pris en note les \u00e9v\u00e9nements de cette journ\u00e9e, notamment la pr\u00e9tendue r\u00e9union. Elle a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab je ne pensais pas que c\u2019\u00e9tait important \u00bb. Il lui a signal\u00e9 que les autres t\u00e9moins de Postes Canada avaient mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rentable de lui demander de faire un aller-retour \u00e0 Willowdale D, alors que la pratique courante consistait \u00e0 faire appel \u00e0 un taxi (qui ferait un seul trajet pour acheminer les envois mal dirig\u00e9s) ou \u00e0 renvoyer les envois mal dirig\u00e9s au centre-ville en vue de leur redistribution le lendemain. Elle a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab j\u2019ai fait ce qu\u2019on m\u2019a demand\u00e9 de faire. J\u2019ai ob\u00e9i aux directives. J\u2019\u00e9tais une factrice suppl\u00e9ante. Si un superviseur te dit [\u2026] s\u2019il te retire de ton itin\u00e9raire, tu ob\u00e9is, tu d\u00e9poses un grief plus tard \u00bb. M. Machelak a r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Mais vous n\u2019avez pas r\u00e9clam\u00e9 d\u2019heures suppl\u00e9mentaires ce jour-l\u00e0 [\u2026] et dans un formulaire d\u2019heures suppl\u00e9mentaires, vous auriez justifi\u00e9 ces heures suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00bb. Le t\u00e9moin a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Oui, il faut pr\u00e9ciser la raison pour laquelle on r\u00e9clame [des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires] [\u2026] je l\u2019indique toujours d\u2019une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9e \u00bb. Toutefois, il n\u2019y a pas eu de telle r\u00e9clamation dans ce cas-ci. Ensuite, l\u2019avocat de Postes Canada lui a signal\u00e9 que les fiches d\u00e9pos\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience indiquent qu\u2019elle avait effectu\u00e9 l\u2019itin\u00e9raire 51 cette semaine-l\u00e0, un itin\u00e9raire qui se fait \u00e0 pied, et qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune note concernant un d\u00e9placement \u00e0 Willowdale D pour aller chercher ou d\u00e9poser du courrier mal dirig\u00e9. A. B. a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il fallait environ vingt minutes pour se rendre \u00e0 Willowdale D en fourgonnette vers 8 heures le matin.\n[82] L\u2019avocat de Postes Canada a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 son argument : [traduction] \u00ab Il serait illogique de verser des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 une factrice pour cette t\u00e2che alors que la pratique courante consiste \u00e0 envoyer un taxi, qui effectue un seul trajet. Et vous ne vous rappelez pas avoir r\u00e9clam\u00e9 des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires et cette t\u00e2che n\u2019aurait pas constitu\u00e9 des \u201cheures suppl\u00e9mentaires pour situation d\u2019urgence\u201d. \u00bb A.B. a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Alors, je me suis fait voler beaucoup d\u2019heures suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00bb. L\u2019avocat de Postes Canada a ensuite signal\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait r\u00e9clam\u00e9 des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires pour les 8 et 9 novembre, en \u00e9crivant [traduction] \u00ab volume \u00bb et [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9union syndicale \u00bb \u00e0 titre de justifications. Il a affirm\u00e9 que les r\u00e9unions syndicales se tiennent habituellement le matin. Elle a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Pas toujours \u00bb. Mais la question importante est qu\u2019A. B. n\u2019a pas inscrit le trajet \u00e0 Willowdale D dans son formulaire \u00e0 titre de justification. J\u2019ai demand\u00e9 au t\u00e9moin : [traduction] \u00ab Pourquoi n\u2019avez\u2011vous pas \u00e9crit \u201cr\u00e9cup\u00e9rer le courrier mal dirig\u00e9\u201d ou quelque chose du genre sur le formulaire? \u00bb A.B. a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Je n\u2019en ai pas la moindre id\u00e9e. Parfois je changeais les cadenas, mais je ne l\u2019indiquais pas. Si cela se produisait aujourd\u2019hui, je pr\u00e9ciserais la raison et j\u2019\u00e9crirais \u201cenvois mal dirig\u00e9s\u201d. \u00bb\n[83] Pour ce qui est du moment de la journ\u00e9e o\u00f9 est survenu l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005, l\u2019avocat de Postes Canada a signal\u00e9 \u00e0 A. B. que la plaignante avait affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019incident avec M. Thambirajah s\u2019\u00e9tait produit \u00e0 midi. A. B. a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab \u00c7a me surprend. \u00c0 mon souvenir, j\u2019\u00e9tais l\u00e0 le matin. \u00bb Il a r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Willowdale D est une tr\u00e8s petite succursale. \u00c0 8 heures le matin, elle serait entour\u00e9e de coll\u00e8gues, n\u2019est-ce pas? Mais aucun d\u2019entre eux ne l\u2019a approch\u00e9e et ne lui a demand\u00e9 \u201cDoris, pourquoi pleures-tu?\u201d Vous dites qu\u2019il a fallu qu\u2019une personne venant de l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur l\u2019aborde et lui demande pourquoi? \u00bb A.B. a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Je n\u2019ai vu aucun de ses coll\u00e8gues aupr\u00e8s d\u2019elle \u00bb.\n[84] M. Machelak lui a ensuite demand\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Vous avez \u00e9crit que vous \u00eates rest\u00e9e avec Mme Cassidy pour une quinzaine de minutes, 40 minutes pour le trajet aller-retour, une pause cigarette de 10 minutes, la r\u00e9union de 10 minutes dans le bureau de M. Tidman, etc., et ensuite encore 15 minutes avec Mme Cassidy. Quand vous \u00eates rentr\u00e9e, personne ne vous a pos\u00e9 de questions sur le temps que vous avez pris, qui \u00e9tait plus long que pr\u00e9vu? \u00bb Elle \u00e9tait d\u2019accord.\n[85] Postes Canada a appel\u00e9 Christopher Moore \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Il est un superviseur actuellement affect\u00e9 au bureau de service 2 de Willowdale (\u00e0 ne pas confondre Willowdale D) et \u00e9tait le [traduction] \u00ab superviseur des facteurs \u00bb \u00e0 la succursale de Thornhill en novembre 2005. Il s\u2019agit de la succursale o\u00f9 A. B. \u00e9tait affect\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Il a expliqu\u00e9 ce que sont les envois mal dirig\u00e9s et la pratique en vigueur pour r\u00e9gler ce probl\u00e8me. En termes simples, les \u00ab envois mal dirig\u00e9s \u00bb sont des envois postaux qui ne sont pas achemin\u00e9s au bon bureau de service de Postes Canada. Ces envois sont port\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019attention du superviseur le matin. Au bureau de service, la politique ou la pratique en vigueur consiste \u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 une compagnie de taxi, \u00e0 remplir un bon de taxi et \u00e0 remettre ce dernier au chauffeur avec les envois; ce dernier les livre ensuite au bon bureau de service. [traduction] \u00ab C\u2019\u00e9tait le moyen le plus rapide de les acheminer \u00e0 l\u2019autre succursale. On veut l\u2019acheminer pour que l\u2019erreur de direction ne dure pas toute la journ\u00e9e. Entre 8 h 30 et 9 h 30, les facteurs sortent. Il est important d\u2019acheminer les envois mal dirig\u00e9s avant 8 h. \u00bb Il a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019ils tenaient \u00e9galement compte des frais encourus.\n[86] Appel\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9agir \u00e0 l\u2019affirmation d\u2019A. B., M. Moore a affirm\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nSi le superviseur de Willowdale D m\u2019appelait, je lui dirais \u00ab envoie-les-moi par taxi \u00bb. Je n\u2019enverrais pas un employ\u00e9 et je ne dirais pas \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 de prendre un taxi. Il faudrait que je paie l\u2019aller-retour et il faudrait que je retire un facteur de son itin\u00e9raire et [A. B.] devait effectuer l\u2019itin\u00e9raire 51 [\u2026] Je n\u2019aurais jamais fait \u00e7a, retirer un facteur de son itin\u00e9raire. Le facteur s\u2019attendrait \u00e0 toucher des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[87] M. Machelak a avis\u00e9 M. Moore que le pr\u00e9tendu incident se serait produit \u00e0 midi le 9 novembre 2005 \u00e0 Willowdale D : [traduction] \u00ab S\u2019il y avait des envois mal dirig\u00e9s \u00e0 Willowdale D, est-ce que quelqu\u2019un irait les chercher \u00e0 midi pour les rapporter \u00e0 l\u2019autre succursale? \u00bb Affichant un air surpris, le t\u00e9moin a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Non, l\u2019erreur de direction aurait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 commise pour cette journ\u00e9e-l\u00e0 et les envois resteraient l\u00e0 jusqu\u2019au lendemain [\u2026] Il suffit de les renvoyer au bureau au centre-ville et ils seront distribu\u00e9s par camion le lendemain entre minuit et 8 heures. \u00bb\n[88] En contre-interrogatoire, la question suivante a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e au t\u00e9moin : [traduction] \u00ab \u00cates\u2011vous en train de dire qu\u2019il n\u2019est jamais arriv\u00e9 qu\u2019on demande \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 d\u2019aller chercher des envois mal dirig\u00e9s? \u00bb Il a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Je ne connais personne qui ait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de cette fa\u00e7on. Je n\u2019ai certainement jamais envoy\u00e9 un employ\u00e9 pour faire une telle chose. Il est arriv\u00e9 qu\u2019on envoie un facteur \u00e0 une autre succursale pour effectuer un itin\u00e9raire, une affectation temporaire d\u2019une succursale \u00e0 l\u2019autre pour un matin, mais pas pour acheminer des envois mal dirig\u00e9s. \u00bb\n[89] Postes Canada a \u00e9galement appel\u00e9 Gwen Kenyon \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Elle est chef de service \u00e0 Thornhill; auparavant, elle \u00e9tait directrice de la formation \u00e0 la division et, avant cela, elle \u00e9tait directrice des centres de tri. Elle est employ\u00e9e par Postes Canada depuis 34 ans. Elle a interrog\u00e9 les bases de donn\u00e9es informatiques de Postes Canada pour v\u00e9rifier si A. B. avait r\u00e9clam\u00e9 des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires du 7 au 9 novembre 2005. D\u2019apr\u00e8s les bases de donn\u00e9es, A. B. a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires, mais pas pour un d\u00e9placement \u00e0 Willowdale D. Les donn\u00e9es saisies indiquent qu\u2019elle a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 la succursale de Thornhill durant ces trois jours, y effectuant des heures r\u00e9guli\u00e8res et suppl\u00e9mentaires. La question suivante a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e au t\u00e9moin : si A. B. s\u2019\u00e9tait rendue \u00e0 Willowdale D pour aller chercher du courrier, l\u2019obligeant ainsi \u00e0 faire des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires, aurait-on consign\u00e9 ce d\u00e9placement ainsi que la raison de ce d\u00e9placement? Mme Kenyon a r\u00e9pondu par l\u2019affirmative. En contre-interrogatoire, l\u2019avocat de la plaignante a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Kenyon s\u2019il \u00e9tait possible qu\u2019un superviseur demande \u00e0 un facteur de d\u00e9poser des envois \u00e0 un autre bureau de service [traduction] \u00ab \u00e0 titre de faveur \u00bb. Le t\u00e9moin a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab B\u00e9n\u00e9volement? Je ne connais aucun de ces employ\u00e9s. Ils ne seraient pas pay\u00e9s pour ce trajet [\u2026] Et, en 2005, les employ\u00e9s r\u00e9clamaient des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires avec une plus grande fermet\u00e9 qu\u2019aujourd\u2019hui [\u2026] Cela n\u2019a pas de sens, sur le plan de la gestion du temps ou de l\u2019argent, je n\u2019ai jamais entendu parler d\u2019une telle chose [\u2026] \u00bb\n[90] Mme Kenyon a \u00e9galement corrobor\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de M. Moore concernant le syst\u00e8me en vigueur pour r\u00e9acheminer les [traduction] \u00ab envois mal dirig\u00e9s \u00bb.\n[91] Je conclus qu\u2019A. B. n\u2019est pas all\u00e9e \u00e0 Willowdale D le 9 novembre 2005, le jour de l\u2019incident, pour les motifs suivants :\n1) selon le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante, l\u2019incident s\u2019est produit vers midi. A. B. a affirm\u00e9 \u00eatre arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la succursale vers 9 h ce matin-l\u00e0;\n2) j\u2019admets les d\u00e9clarations des t\u00e9moins de Postes Canada selon lesquelles un superviseur n\u2019aurait pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 un facteur d\u2019aller chercher ou livrer des [traduction] \u00ab envois mal dirig\u00e9s \u00bb. Un superviseur aurait plut\u00f4t fait appel \u00e0 un chauffeur de taxi pour effectuer un trajet unique;\n3) si A. B. s\u2019\u00e9tait rendue \u00e0 Willowdale D ce jour-l\u00e0, elle aurait r\u00e9clam\u00e9 des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires pour cette t\u00e2che, comme elle l\u2019a fait pour d\u2019autres t\u00e2ches ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es ce jour-l\u00e0.\nK. Quand Postes Canada a-t-elle pris connaissance pour la premi\u00e8re fois de l\u2019incident du 9 novembre? [92] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question importante de savoir quand Postes Canada a pris connaissance pour la premi\u00e8re fois de l\u2019incident de l\u2019attouchement et du commentaire survenu le 9 novembre 2005, je conclus que c\u2019\u00e9tait le 25 avril 2006, lorsque Mme Cassidy a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa plainte \u00e9crite \u00e0 M. Tidman. Je conclus que ce dernier \u00e9tait un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible et que son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait fiable. Il a admis franchement que la r\u00e9action \u00e0 la plainte de Mme Cassidy apr\u00e8s le 25 avril laissait \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer. Il est \u00e0 la retraite et ne travaille plus pour Postes Canada.\n[93] De plus, j\u2019admets les t\u00e9moignages selon lesquels M. Sultan et Mme Edmunds ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Cassidy, chacun de leur c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u2013 lui, le 16 mai 2006 et elle, le 14 mai 2006 lors d\u2019une conversation avec Mme Cassidy \u2013 pourquoi elle n\u2019avait pas signal\u00e9 l\u2019incident auparavant. Lors de ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre de ces conversations, la plaignante n\u2019a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait en fait signal\u00e9 l\u2019incident \u00e0 M. Tidman et \u00e0 M. Sultan le jour m\u00eame o\u00f9 il s\u2019\u00e9tait produit. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Edmunds, qui concorde avec son rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate en date du 1er septembre 2006, lorsqu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante pourquoi elle avait attendu plus de cinq mois avant de signaler l\u2019incident \u00e0 Postes Canada, [traduction] \u00ab Mme Cassidy a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas voulu donner suite \u00e0 l\u2019affaire parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait stup\u00e9faite et abasourdie que M. Thambirajah ait m\u00eame eu l\u2019audace de faire ce qu\u2019il a fait; deuxi\u00e8mement, il \u00e9tait le repr\u00e9sentant syndical \u00e0 la succursale et il pouvait lui causer de nombreuses difficult\u00e9s [\u2026]. \u00bb\n[94] M. Tidman avait pris des mesures \u00e0 la suite d\u2019incidents moins graves, y compris un appel \u00e0 Mme Edmunds le 12 ou le 13 avril 2006 au sujet des incidents d\u2019\u00e9change de jurons. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Edmunds a parl\u00e9 de sa collaboration avec M. Tidman sur une p\u00e9riode de dix ans, y compris l\u2019habitude qu\u2019il avait de l\u2019appeler au sujet de certaines questions li\u00e9es aux droits de la personne moins importantes que l\u2019incident de l\u2019attouchement et du commentaire du 9 novembre. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la formation qu\u2019ils avaient suivie, M. Tidman et les autres gestionnaires devaient t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 l\u2019agente des droits de la personne chez Postes Canada lorsqu\u2019une affaire pouvant relever de la LCDP se produisait. De plus, je ne pense pas que M. Tidman et M. Sultan auraient demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Cassidy de prendre la rel\u00e8ve de M. Thambirajah et d\u2019effectuer son itin\u00e9raire en avril 2006 s\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 au courant de l\u2019incident du 9 novembre.\nL. Ce qui s\u2019est produit apr\u00e8s le 25 avril 2006 : la \u00ab com\u00e9die des erreurs \u00bb et les malentendus [95] M. Tidman, qui a pris sa retraite de Postes Canada depuis les \u00e9v\u00e9nements, a parl\u00e9 franchement de la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019organisation a trait\u00e9 la plainte de Mme Cassidy en date du 25 avril 2006. \u00c0 la question de savoir combien de temps il a fallu \u00e0 la direction pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la plainte apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 Mme Edmunds le jour m\u00eame o\u00f9 il a re\u00e7u la plainte, il a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Il suffit de lire les courriels pour se faire une id\u00e9e. J\u2019\u00e9tais d\u00e9\u00e7u de la lenteur de la r\u00e9action des personnes avec qui je communiquais. Kelly \u00e9tait absente du travail pendant un certain temps. Je souhaitais que les choses se d\u00e9roulent autrement [\u2026] J\u2019avais les mains li\u00e9es [\u2026] La machine ne s\u2019est pas mise en marche [\u2026] \u00bb.\n[96] J\u2019admets le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tidman selon lequel il a imm\u00e9diatement post\u00e9 la plainte de Mme Cassidy en date du 25 avril \u00e0 Mme Edmunds. \u00c0 ma surprise, il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur ou de num\u00e9riseur \u00e0 Willowdale D en novembre 2005. Il a \u00e9galement envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 Mme Edmunds [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019avisant [qu\u2019il avait] une plainte relative aux droits de la personne et [qu\u2019il avait] besoin de conseils \u00bb. N\u2019ayant pas eu de nouvelles apr\u00e8s quatre ou cinq jours, M. Tidman a envoy\u00e9 un autre courriel \u00e0 Mme Edmunds en guise de suivi, en incluant une copie conforme \u00e0 la gestionnaire de zone int\u00e9rimaire, Joanne Coe. Le 12 mai, il a envoy\u00e9 un autre courriel \u00e0 Mme Edmunds lui demandant [traduction] \u00ab d\u2019acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le traitement \u00bb de la plainte, car Mme Cassidy se plaignait de la tension entre elle et M. Thambirajah.\n[97] Pourquoi Mme Edmunds n\u2019a-t-elle pas r\u00e9pondu? Selon son t\u00e9moignage, elle s\u2019\u00e9tait absent\u00e9e du bureau du 28 avril et 16 mai 2006 pour des raisons professionnelles. Il semble que la plainte post\u00e9e par M. Tidman soit arriv\u00e9e vers le 28 avril. Mme Edmunds n\u2019avait pas d\u2019adjoint, si bien que l\u2019enveloppe est rest\u00e9e dans son bureau sans que personne l\u2019ouvre avant son retour le 16 mai. \u00c0 la m\u00eame \u00e9poque, il y a eu les engueulades et les \u00e9changes de jurons entre la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel, survenus entre le 10 et le 19 avril 2006. Mme Edmunds avait discut\u00e9 de ces incidents avec M. Tidman \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque. La \u00ab com\u00e9die des erreurs \u00bb \u2013 pour reprendre le terme utilis\u00e9 par Mme Edmunds durant son t\u00e9moignage \u2013 s\u2019est amorc\u00e9e lorsque, en \u00e9coutant les messages de M. Tidman dans sa bo\u00eete vocale et en lisant ses courriels, elle a (incorrectement) pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 qu\u2019ils avaient trait aux \u00e9changes de jurons en avril, et non \u00e0 l\u2019incident de l\u2019attouchement survenu quelque six mois auparavant. Ainsi, quand M. Tidman lui a \u00e9crit un courriel le 3 mai pour lui demander : [traduction] \u00ab Doris Cassidy aimerait savoir l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019avancement de sa plainte. As-tu des nouvelles? \u00bb, elle a r\u00e9pondu le 9 mai : [traduction] \u00ab Cam, je n\u2019ai pas de nouvelles pour l\u2019instant. En fait, j\u2019ai d\u00fb m\u2019absenter du bureau pour r\u00e9gler d\u2019autres dossiers. Je vais te t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner demain pour examiner celui-ci davantage. \u00bb Le 12 mai, M. Tidman a de nouveau envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 Mme Edmunds : [traduction] \u00ab Doris est dans mon bureau au moment o\u00f9 je t\u2019\u00e9cris ce message. Elle me dit qu\u2019elle vit une grande tension \u00e0 cause de ce probl\u00e8me et que le fait de c\u00f4toyer Raj tous les jours lui p\u00e8se au travail et apr\u00e8s le travail. Y a-t-il quelque chose \u00e0 faire en vue d\u2019acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le traitement de cette plainte? \u00bb Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Edmunds, \u00e0 ce point, elle n\u2019\u00e9tait toujours pas au courant de la plainte en date du 25 avril concernant l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005 et elle pensait que M. Tidman faisait renvoi aux engueulades et aux \u00e9changes de jurons en avril 2006. J\u2019admets son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Plus loin dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, j\u2019exposerai les r\u00e9percussions juridiques de cette [traduction] \u00ab com\u00e9die des erreurs \u00bb.\n[98] Ce n\u2019est que la fin de semaine suivante que Mme Edmunds a compris \u00e0 quoi faisaient renvoi les courriels de M. Tidman. Le dimanche 14 mai, elle a re\u00e7u un appel \u00e0 la maison de Mme Cassidy, qui \u00e9tait affol\u00e9e. C\u2019est durant cette conversation que Mme Edmunds a su que le probl\u00e8me n\u2019avait pas trait aux incidents d\u2019\u00e9changes de jurons en avril. En posant des questions \u00e0 Mme Cassidy, Mme Edmunds a pris connaissance pour la premi\u00e8re fois des all\u00e9gations relatives au 9 novembre 2005.\n[99] Mme Edmunds a amorc\u00e9 son enqu\u00eate en juin 2006 et a tenu des entrevues avec les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019incident du 9 novembre en juin et en juillet. Elle a rendu son rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate, comportant des conclusions et des recommandations, le 1er septembre 2006. Elle a tranch\u00e9 en faveur de Mme Cassidy relativement aux deux groupes d\u2019all\u00e9gations port\u00e9es contre M. Thambirajah : premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019incident du 9 novembre ayant trait \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019attouchement d\u00e9plac\u00e9 \u00bb; et deuxi\u00e8mement, [traduction] \u00ab les all\u00e9gations concernant le comportement et le langage d\u00e9plac\u00e9s \u00bb, y compris les jurons et [traduction] \u00ab le fait de g\u00eaner les d\u00e9placements de la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur et pr\u00e8s du milieu du travail \u00bb. Elle a formul\u00e9 des recommandations visant la prise de mesures disciplinaires.\nNon-respect du pr\u00e9avis de 10 jours\n[100] Mme Edmunds a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas habilit\u00e9e \u00e0 imposer des mesures disciplinaires aux employ\u00e9s. Elle formulait des recommandations et il incombait aux gestionnaires d\u2019imposer les mesures disciplinaires. Fait important, aux termes de l\u2019article 10 de la convention collective (sur les mesures disciplinaires, la suspension et le cong\u00e9diement), la direction doit donner un pr\u00e9avis de 10 jours apr\u00e8s [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019infraction all\u00e9gu\u00e9e \u00bb ou apr\u00e8s que cette infraction a \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab port\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019attention \u00bb de l\u2019employeur avant d\u2019imposer une mesure disciplinaire. D\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Edmunds, ce d\u00e9lai de 10 jours s\u2019est enclench\u00e9 le 25 avril 2006 avec l\u2019avis \u00e0 l\u2019employeur et a pris fin vers le 5 mai 2006. Il est \u00e9galement ressorti des t\u00e9moignages que la direction pouvait [traduction] \u00ab arr\u00eater le chronom\u00e8tre \u00bb si certaines mesures \u00e9taient prises. Aucune mesure de ce genre n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Ainsi, en raison de la [traduction] \u00ab com\u00e9die des erreurs \u00bb, le d\u00e9lai de 10 jours n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9. Quelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les r\u00e9percussions? Premi\u00e8rement, selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Edmunds, elle aurait recommand\u00e9 que M. Thambirajah soit suspendu sans solde pour cinq jours. Quant aux autres recommandations \u2013 une formation, le versement d\u2019une lettre dans son dossier pendant un an, etc. \u2013 M. Thambirajah n\u2019\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9 de s\u2019y soumettre. Toutefois, il a accept\u00e9 de suivre un cours sur les droits de la personne (deux ans plus tard). Pendant qu\u2019il suivait ce cours, il \u00e9tait de service et r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9. La lettre est demeur\u00e9e dans son dossier pendant une ann\u00e9e seulement, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la convention collective.\n[101] Du 15 mai au 16 octobre 2006, Mme Cassidy \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 en raison d\u2019une blessure sans lien avec ses interactions avec M. Thambirajah. M. Thambirajah a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 Willowdale D jusqu\u2019au 18 mai 2006. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mut\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre succursale dans le cadre d\u2019une mesure d\u2019accommodement sans rapport avec ses interactions avec Mme Cassidy. Par la suite, ils n\u2019ont plus jamais travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 la m\u00eame succursale. J\u2019admets \u00e9galement les t\u00e9moignages selon lesquels, du 25 avril au 23 mai 2006, la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel n\u2019ont pas eu la moindre interaction.\nM. Autres mesures prises par Postes Canada apr\u00e8s le 25 avril 2006 Postulation ou mutation \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de Willowdale D\n[102] Mme Cassidy soutient avoir maintes fois demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Candace Carpenter, une agente de dotation responsable de sept succursales, et \u00e0 Joanne Coe, gestionnaire de zone int\u00e9rimaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, une mutation lui permettant de quitter Willowdale D en raison du harc\u00e8lement de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel.\n[103] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Carpenter, la plaignante lui avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises et elles s\u2019\u00e9taient rencontr\u00e9es. Il \u00e9tait vrai qu\u2019elle avait demand\u00e9 une mutation, mais pas en raison de son conflit avec M. Thambirajah. Cette question n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e. Selon Mme Carpenter, la plaignante disait qu\u2019elle voulait \u00eatre plus pr\u00e8s de la maison et de sa fille malade : [traduction] \u00ab Il n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 question de Raj, [il \u00e9tait] question de ses enfants [\u2026] Il est tellement facile de postuler, tellement facile [pour elle] de se rapprocher de la maison. \u00bb D\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Carpenter, elle a dit \u00e0 la plaignante de pr\u00e9senter un formulaire de mutation et que, en raison de son anciennet\u00e9, elle l\u2019obtiendrait. Elle lui a m\u00eame propos\u00e9 de lui t\u00e9l\u00e9copier le formulaire de postulation\/mutation et de l\u2019aider \u00e0 le remplir. Mme Carpenter a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un formulaire simple qui ne compte qu\u2019une page. \u00c0 sa surprise et son grand \u00e9tonnement, la sc\u00e8ne s\u2019est r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e \u00e0 plusieurs reprises. Chaque fois, la plaignante revenait la voir, soulevait le m\u00eame probl\u00e8me et Mme Carpenter lui expliquait qu\u2019elle devait pr\u00e9senter un formulaire de mutation. Et, chaque fois, la plaignante repartait, mais sans avoir rempli ou pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de formulaire. Mme Carpenter ne savait pas pourquoi. Il est ressorti des t\u00e9moignages qu\u2019elle craignait peut-\u00eatre de se voir assigner un [traduction] \u00ab itin\u00e9raire difficile \u00bb.\n[104] Finalement, l\u2019employeur a [traduction] \u00ab plac\u00e9 \u00bb Mme Cassidy, \u00e0 titre de mesure d\u2019accommodement li\u00e9e \u00e0 la persistance de ses probl\u00e8mes avec M. Thambirajah. Elle n\u2019a pas eu \u00e0 remplir un formulaire de postulation. Comme nous le verrons plus tard, Mme Edmunds \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019origine de cette mutation.\n[105] Selon les t\u00e9moignages, un employ\u00e9 pouvait [traduction] \u00ab postuler \u00bb dans un autre bureau relevant du m\u00eame syndicat local ou demander une [traduction] \u00ab mutation \u00bb \u00e0 un autre bureau relevant d\u2019un autre syndicat local. Il y a un formulaire de [traduction] \u00ab postulation \u00bb, distinct du formulaire de [traduction] \u00ab mutation \u00bb. Il ressort clairement des fiches de [traduction] \u00ab postulation \u00bb d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en preuve que Mme Cassidy aurait obtenu une r\u00e9affectation si elle en avait fait la demande dans les mois qui ont suivi l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005. De plus, aux termes de l\u2019article 56.07 de la convention collective : [traduction] \u00ab Sur demande \u00e9crite du plaignant et \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une consultation et d\u2019une entente, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 peut accorder au plaignant le droit d\u2019\u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre t\u00e2che ou \u00e0 un autre poste sur une base temporaire \u00bb. Mme Cassidy n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 de mutation \u00ab temporaire \u00bb et Postes Canada ne lui a pas demand\u00e9 si elle en souhaitait une.\n[106] Le 17 mai 2006, la plaignante est all\u00e9e rencontrer Mme Carpenter et est pass\u00e9e voir Mme Coe. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, la plaignante \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 jusqu\u2019au 16 octobre 2006 en raison d\u2019une blessure dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions et M. Thambirajah allait bient\u00f4t \u00eatre mut\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre succursale dans une autre ville dans le cadre d\u2019une mesure d\u2019accommodement li\u00e9e \u00e0 une incapacit\u00e9. Je note que, dans son journal, Mme Cassidy a \u00e9crit qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait all\u00e9e voir Mme Coe ce jour-l\u00e0 non pas en raison de son conflit avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel, mais plut\u00f4t parce qu\u2019elle craignait que M. Sultan conteste sa demande de cong\u00e9 pour la blessure subie au travail.\n[107] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Coe, elle croyait que la plaignante \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab frustr\u00e9e de ne pas avoir un itin\u00e9raire, mais Candace [Carpenter] disait qu\u2019elle ne pr\u00e9sentait pas de demande pour en obtenir une \u00bb. Elle a corrobor\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Carpenter selon lequel Mme Cassidy n\u2019avait jamais indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle souhaitait postuler pour quitter Willowdale D \u00e0 cause de M. Thambirajah. De plus, Mme Coe a affirm\u00e9 que, le 17 mai, [traduction] \u00ab apr\u00e8s sa rencontre avec Candace au sujet du processus de postulation, elle [Mme Cassidy] m\u2019a parl\u00e9 de la maladie de sa fille. Elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s boulevers\u00e9e. \u00bb\n[108] La question suivante a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Coe : une fois que Postes Canada a pris connaissance le 25 avril 2006 de l\u2019incident survenu le 9 novembre 2005, quel \u00e9tait le degr\u00e9 d\u2019urgence selon elle de s\u00e9parer la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9? Mme Coe a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab pas tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9. Je n\u2019\u00e9tais au courant d\u2019aucun autre incident. Il fallait laisser l\u2019enqu\u00eate suivre son cours. \u00bb \u00c9videmment, il y avait aussi les incidents des engueulades et des injures en avril 2006.\n[109] Mme Edmunds a corrobor\u00e9 les t\u00e9moignages de Mme Coe et de Mme Carpenter selon lesquels la plaignante n\u2019avait jamais dit que M. Thambirajah \u00e9tait la raison pour laquelle elle souhaitait postuler ou demander une mutation; elle avait plut\u00f4t parl\u00e9 de la maladie de sa fille et de sa volont\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre plus pr\u00e8s de la maison. Toutefois, en fin de compte, Mme Cassidy a quitt\u00e9 Willowdale D, dans le cadre d\u2019une [traduction] \u00ab postulation \u00bb au 101 Placer Court, le 20 septembre 2006. Par la suite, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 mut\u00e9e \u00e0 Oshawa, \u00e0 l\u2019initiative et avec l\u2019assistance de Mme Edmunds. Le t\u00e9moin a affirm\u00e9 que :\n[traduction]\n\u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9, je lui ai demand\u00e9 si elle voulait quitter Willowdale D [\u2026] J\u2019ai t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Arthur, l\u2019agent de dotation [\u2026] pour qu\u2019il lui r\u00e9serve un poste. J\u2019ai dit \u00e0 Doris, tu ne croiseras plus Raj, qu\u2019est-ce que tu penses d\u2019Oshawa? Il n\u2019est pas facile de muter quelqu\u2019un d\u2019une zone \u00e0 un autre, le syndicat n\u2019aime pas \u00e7a \u00e0 cause des r\u00e9percussions sur les droits d\u2019anciennet\u00e9; il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une affectation temporaire. Il a fallu que je travaille avec les deux syndicats locaux, la d\u00e9marche contournait l\u2019article 56 [\u2026] Je vivais cette exp\u00e9rience avec elle.\nPlus tard, elle a ajout\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Je suis all\u00e9e voir les deux syndicats locaux et j\u2019ai obtenu leur autorisation pour un accommodement temporaire [\u2026] Oshawa est plus proche de sa r\u00e9sidence. Je ne sais pas si elle avait assez d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 pour obtenir la mutation par les voies normales [\u2026] Doris ne m\u2019a jamais demand\u00e9 cette mutation. De ma propre initiative, je lui ai trouv\u00e9 un poste \u00e0 Oshawa. Elle m\u2019avait parl\u00e9 du probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 de sa fille [\u2026] \u00bb Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un exemple des mesures proactives et pleines de compassion prises par Mme Edmunds au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la plaignante.\n[110] J\u2019admets les t\u00e9moignages des trois employ\u00e9es de Postes Canada concernant la question de la postulation ou de la mutation \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de Willowdale D. Elles \u00e9taient cr\u00e9dibles \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard; Mme Cassidy ne l\u2019\u00e9tait pas.\nLe Programme d\u2019aide aux employ\u00e9s offert \u00e0 Mme Cassidy\n[111] Selon Mme Edmunds, elle a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante pour l\u2019aviser qu\u2019il y avait eu un manquement \u00e0 la protection des renseignements personnels puisque, par inadvertance, on avait envoy\u00e9 les fiches de postulation \u00e0 M. Thambirajah. Durant cet appel, elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante si elle voulait avoir recours au Programme d\u2019aide aux employ\u00e9s (PAE). Mme Cassidy a r\u00e9pondu que non; elle comptait plut\u00f4t parler \u00e0 un ami qui est psychologue.\nVersement de deux semaines de paye de vacances\n[112] Mme Edmunds a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que la plaignante lui avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident du \u00ab rat mort \u00bb en d\u00e9cembre 2006. Selon Mme Edmunds : [traduction] \u00ab J\u2019\u00e9tais vraiment boulevers\u00e9e. Son r\u00e9cit m\u2019a touch\u00e9 droit au c\u0153ur jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019on re\u00e7oive la documentation de la Commission. J\u2019ai lu ses documents et j\u2019ai pens\u00e9 : \u201cce n\u2019est pas ce qui est arriv\u00e9\u201d. \u00bb Mme Edmunds a affirm\u00e9 \u00eatre all\u00e9e voir le directeur en d\u00e9cembre pour obtenir l\u2019autorisation d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la plaignante deux semaines de salaire \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019incident, [traduction] \u00ab comme si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 au travail \u00bb.\nAlerter le service de s\u00e9curit\u00e9\n[113] Mme Edmunds a affirm\u00e9 avoir communiqu\u00e9 avec le service de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de Postes Canada, souhaitant que les agents de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 veillent sur Mme Cassidy \u00e0 la suite de son transfert \u00e0 Oshawa, notamment en la suivant de temps \u00e0 autre. Elle avait agi ainsi parce que Mme Cassidy all\u00e9guait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel la harcelait encore et lui faisait peur.\nEntrevue avec M. Thambirajah le 8 d\u00e9cembre 2006\n[114] Le 17 octobre 2006, M. Tidman a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 Mme Coe et \u00e0 Mme Edmunds, les avisant que Mme Cassidy \u00e9tait venue le voir la veille et avait fait [traduction] \u00ab quelques all\u00e9gations au sujet de Raj dont il faudrait discuter \u00bb. Une de ces all\u00e9gations \u00e9tait que M. Thambirajah faisait [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019objet d\u2019un proc\u00e8s pour des agressions physiques contre son ex-\u00e9pouse. Doris dit que la source de ces renseignements est la police. \u00bb Elle a racont\u00e9 la m\u00eame chose \u00e0 Mme Edmunds. Mme Edmunds a demand\u00e9 au service de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de faire enqu\u00eate et le service lui a r\u00e9pondu que l\u2019all\u00e9gation \u00e9tait sans fondement. Dans son courriel, M. Tidman a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab accus\u00e9 \u00bb et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait vis\u00e9 par un engagement de ne pas troubler l\u2019ordre public. M. Tidman a \u00e9galement signal\u00e9 qu\u2019Anne Jones lui avait dit qu\u2019elle recevait, tout comme lui, des appels d\u2019une personne qui raccrochait imm\u00e9diatement. Ce sujet n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9 lors de l\u2019interrogatoire de M. Tidman, si bien que je ne lui accorde aucun poids.\n[115] \u00c0 la suite des \u00e9v\u00e9nements d\u00e9crits ci-dessus, Postes Canada a tenu une entrevue avec M. Thambirajah [traduction] \u00ab pour aviser l\u2019employ\u00e9 des d\u00e9clarations faites \u00e0 son sujet par une autre employ\u00e9e et lui dire qu\u2019un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la r\u00e9union serait vers\u00e9 \u00e0 son dossier \u00bb. M. Thambirajah a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief, mais n\u2019a pas eu gain de cause.\nN. Incidents survenus lorsque la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel ne travaillaient plus ensemble [116] Les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par Mme Cassidy en vertu de la LCDP concernent notamment des all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement lorsqu\u2019elle et M. Thambirajah ne travaillaient plus ensemble \u00e0 Willowdale D.\nVoiture \u00e9gratign\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9union syndicale\n[117] Le 19 septembre 2006, Mme Cassidy a assist\u00e9 \u00e0 une r\u00e9union syndicale. M. Thambirajah y assistait \u00e9galement, comme bon nombre de personnes. Lorsqu\u2019elle est partie, elle a remarqu\u00e9 que quelqu\u2019un avait fait des [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9gratignures \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019une cl\u00e9 \u00bb sur sa voiture et grav\u00e9 dans la peinture [traduction] \u00ab va te faire foutre \u00bb. Bien entendu, elle \u00e9tait assez boulevers\u00e9e. Elle a imm\u00e9diatement soup\u00e7onn\u00e9 M. Thambirajah, bien qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait aucune preuve directe. Elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un rapport de police. M. Thambirajah nie toute responsabilit\u00e9 pour l\u2019incident [traduction] \u00ab des \u00e9gratignures\/de la gravure \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019une cl\u00e9 \u00bb sur la voiture. Je conclus que l\u2019incident s\u2019est produit. Cependant, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je ne peux pas conclure que M. Thambirajah \u00e9tait bel et bien responsable de cet incident. Il n\u2019y a aucune preuve \u2013 p. ex. d\u00e9claration d\u2019un t\u00e9moin visuel, surveillance vid\u00e9o, etc. \u2013 autre que la preuve \u00ab circonstancielle \u00bb de la pr\u00e9sence de celui-ci \u00e0 la r\u00e9union syndicale ce soir-l\u00e0 et de sa relation tendue avec Mme Cassidy durant cette p\u00e9riode. Je reconnais que la preuve circonstancielle peut suffire dans certains cas. Cependant, elle est trop faible en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pour appuyer l\u2019inf\u00e9rence voulue.\nPlainte pour agression sexuelle d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la police; accusations port\u00e9es\n[118] Le 28 septembre 2006, Mme Cassidy a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la police pour agression sexuelle relativement \u00e0 l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005. Des accusations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es et M. Thambirajah a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en \u00e9tat d\u2019arrestation le 8 novembre 2006. Elle s\u2019est aussi adress\u00e9e au tribunal afin qu\u2019un engagement \u00e0 ne pas troubler l\u2019ordre public soit \u00e9mis \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Thambirajah. La Couronne a retir\u00e9 les accusations pour agression sexuelle le 31 mars 2008. L\u2019enqu\u00eateur, M. Cecile, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait rencontr\u00e9 Mme Cassidy et lui avait expliqu\u00e9 que la Couronne, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la preuve, n\u2019estimait pas qu\u2019il existait une possibilit\u00e9 raisonnable de d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 pour ces accusations et qu\u2019elle les retirerait donc.\nPneus crev\u00e9s apr\u00e8s la comparution au tribunal\n[119] Le 1er novembre 2006, Mme Cassidy et M. Thambirajah ont comparu \u00e0 la Cour de justice de l\u2019Ontario. Mme Cassidy a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019alors qu\u2019elle conduisait pour se rendre \u00e0 la maison, elle avait perdu le contr\u00f4le de sa voiture : [traduction] \u00ab mes pneus ont crev\u00e9. J\u2019ai presque tu\u00e9 une autre femme et son enfant \u00bb. Elle est parvenue \u00e0 conduire jusque chez elle, \u00e0 apporter la voiture au Canadian Tire et \u00e0 aller faire des emplettes. Elle affirme que M. Thambirajah est responsable de l\u2019incident. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir vu un jeune homme indien entrer dans la salle d\u2019audience et parler \u00e0 M. Thambirajah; il la regardait et souriait.\n[120] Son amie, Sue Baird, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident et que cette derni\u00e8re pleurait. Mme Cassidy a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un rapport de police. Elle a dit \u00e0 la police qu\u2019elle pensait que M. Thambirajah \u00e9tait responsable de l\u2019incident. Aucune accusation n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e.\n[121] M. Thambirajah a ni\u00e9 toute implication et d\u00e9clare que la personne \u00e0 qui il parlait dans la salle d\u2019audience \u00e9tait son avocat. L\u2019avocat de Postes Canada a contre-interrog\u00e9 la plaignante \u00e0 propos de l\u2019incident et a relev\u00e9 des incoh\u00e9rences dans son t\u00e9moignage (p. ex. en ce qui a trait \u00e0 son all\u00e9gation voulant qu\u2019elle ait presque tu\u00e9 une femme et son enfant sur l\u2019autoroute).\n[122] Je suis convaincu que les pneus de Mme Cassidy ont \u00e9t\u00e9 crev\u00e9s ce jour-l\u00e0. Le rapport du m\u00e9canicien de Canadian Tire permet de corroborer que les quatre pneus ont tous \u00e9t\u00e9 crev\u00e9s, bien qu\u2019il n\u2019indique pas si la crevaison des pneus \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou accidentelle (p. ex., en roulant sur des objets pointus). Toutefois, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je ne suis pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 conclure que M. Thambirajah \u00e9tait responsable. Bien qu\u2019il est [traduction] \u00ab possible \u00bb qu\u2019il puisse \u00eatre coupable, je ne suis pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 conclure que ce soit [traduction] \u00ab probable \u00bb uniquement vu les circonstances.\nDes \u00ab personnes au teint fonc\u00e9 \u00bb et des \u00ab Indiens \u00bb suivant la plaignante en novembre 2006\n[123] J\u2019ai entendu la plaignante d\u00e9clarer, lors de son t\u00e9moignage, que Postes Canada l\u2019avait autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 se faire accompagner par son neveu, Scott Parsons, durant son trajet. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, elle craignait du harc\u00e8lement et des repr\u00e9sailles de la part de M. Thambirajah malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019ils ne travaillaient plus dans le m\u00eame bureau de service ni dans le m\u00eame secteur depuis mai 2006. Le 17 novembre 2006, la plaignante et son neveu ont remarqu\u00e9 un \u00ab Indien \u00bb qui les suivait \u00e0 bord d\u2019une voiture pendant que Mme Cassidy effectuait son trajet. Ils n\u2019ont pas pris en note le num\u00e9ro de plaque d\u2019immatriculation. Par ailleurs, elle et M. Parsons ont tous deux t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, le 8 novembre 2006, ils ont aper\u00e7u une voiture quittant l\u2019entr\u00e9e de la r\u00e9sidence de Mme Cassidy situ\u00e9e \u00e0 la campagne, dans la r\u00e9gion de Durham. M. Parsons a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait [traduction] \u00ab deux personnes au teint fonc\u00e9 [\u00e0 bord de la voiture] quittant l\u2019entr\u00e9e \u00bb au moment o\u00f9 Mme Cassidy et lui arrivaient. Ils n\u2019ont pas pris en note le num\u00e9ro de plaque d\u2019immatriculation.\n[124] Pour sa part, M. Thambirajah nie m\u00eame le fait que Mme Cassidy et M. Parsons \u00e9taient suivis ou que l\u2019incident de la voiture dans l\u2019all\u00e9e se soit produit et, \u00e0 plus forte raison, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait responsable de leur prise en filature.\n[125] Je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 conclure que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements tels que d\u00e9crits ci-dessus par la plaignante et par M. Parsons sont vraiment survenus (p. ex., une voiture a quitt\u00e9 l\u2019entr\u00e9e chez Mme Cassidy), mais pas que cela impliquait leur [traduction] \u00ab filature \u00bb ou qu\u2019ils ont fait l\u2019objet de harc\u00e8lement ou d\u2019intimidation. En outre, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve et selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je n\u2019irai pas jusqu\u2019\u00e0 conclure qu\u2019il existait un lien entre M. Thambirajah et les incidents de la [traduction] \u00ab voiture sur le trajet de livraison du courrier \u00bb ou de la [traduction] \u00ab voiture dans l\u2019entr\u00e9e \u00bb.\nIncident du \u00ab rat dans la bo\u00eete aux lettres \u00bb\n[126] Mme Cassidy pr\u00e9tend que, le 4 d\u00e9cembre 2006, M. Thambirajah ou quelqu\u2019un agissant conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses directives, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un rat mort dans une enveloppe dans sa bo\u00eete aux lettres rurale. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle vivait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque \u00e0 la maison de campagne de son conjoint de fait sise sur un terrain de 180 acres bord\u00e9 sur trois c\u00f4t\u00e9s de terres agricoles. Le matin en question, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 s\u2019\u00eatre rendue \u00e0 sa bo\u00eete aux lettres, l\u2019avoir ouverte et avoir trouv\u00e9 une enveloppe (dans son journal, elle a parl\u00e9 d\u2019un [traduction] \u00ab sac brun \u00bb) dans laquelle se trouvait un rat mort (ou une souris). [traduction] \u00ab Je l\u2019ai lanc\u00e9 par terre sur notre propri\u00e9t\u00e9 (plus tard elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir lanc\u00e9 le rat dans les buissons); le rat pourrait toujours s\u2019y trouver aujourd\u2019hui [\u2026] \u00bb Elle est ensuite entr\u00e9e dans la maison en criant. Son neveu \u00e9tait l\u00e0 et sa fille dormait. Fait surprenant, elle ne s\u2019est pas r\u00e9veill\u00e9e avec toute cette agitation. Plus tard, sa fille a voulu aller r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer le rat, mais Mme Cassidy lui a interdit de sortir. Lorsqu\u2019ils sont partis plus tard et \u00e0 leur retour, ils n\u2019ont pas cherch\u00e9 le rat. Voici ce qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Je savais que Raj avait fait \u00e7a [\u2026] \u00bb. Elle a affirm\u00e9 avoir re\u00e7u un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de M. Thambirajah plus tard : \u00ab As-tu eu le rat? Ce n\u2019est pas encore fini. \u00bb\n[127] \u00c0 ce jour, personne \u00e0 part la plaignante n\u2019a vu le rat mort. Je trouve \u00e9trange que ni son neveu ni sa fille n\u2019aient \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moins de ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9, ou qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait pas pris de photo du rat mort \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019une cam\u00e9ra ou d\u2019un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire pour la montrer \u00e0 la police. Cela est particuli\u00e8rement surprenant \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 en d\u00e9cembre 2006, selon sa propre d\u00e9claration, son conflit avec M. Thambirajah s\u2019\u00e9tait intensifi\u00e9. Je ne reconnais pas que l\u2019incident du rat mort ou que l\u2019appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de suivi de M. Thambirajah ait eu lieu. Par contre, m\u00eame si je devais conclure qu\u2019une enveloppe contenant un rat mort a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans la bo\u00eete aux lettres de la plaignante, je n\u2019irais pas jusqu\u2019\u00e0 conclure que M. Thambirajah en \u00e9tait le responsable.\nAppels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de menaces\n[128] Selon l\u2019une des all\u00e9gations, M. Thambirajah, ou quelqu\u2019un ob\u00e9issant \u00e0 ses directives, a fait des appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de menaces \u00e0 la plaignante pendant trois ans. La plaignante a tout d\u2019abord d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019[traduction] \u00ab il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 me t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner lorsque Kelly Edmunds a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 enqu\u00eater. \u00bb \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9 durant son t\u00e9moignage, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 autre chose, affirmant que M. Thambirajah avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner peu apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005. Questionn\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la fr\u00e9quence \u00e0 laquelle il t\u00e9l\u00e9phonait, elle a r\u00e9pondu [traduction] \u00ab Aussi souvent que six \u00e0 dix fois par jour; certains jours rien [\u2026] Je connais la voix de Raj. Il dirait des choses telles que \u201ccombien de vies as-tu?\u201d \u201cla prochaine fois tu ne seras pas aussi chanceuse, ce sera ton visage\u201d \u00bb.\n[129] L\u2019amie de Mme Cassidy, Sue Baird, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab plusieurs fois \u00bb (plus tard elle a dit 3 ou 4 fois) en compagnie de la plaignante lorsque cette derni\u00e8re a re\u00e7u des appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de menaces. Mme Cassidy lui a dit que c\u2019\u00e9tait M. Thambirajah et elle a tenu le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone pr\u00e8s de leurs oreilles \u00e0 toutes deux afin que Mme Baird puisse entendre. Mme Baird a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une voix masculine avec un accent. Elle a dit qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas entendre clairement, mais qu\u2019une fois, elle avait entendu quelque chose ressemblant \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab au sujet de ton visage \u00bb, puis [traduction] \u00ab [...] vies as-tu \u00bb.\n[130] En contre-interrogatoire, Mme Baird s\u2019est fait demander si elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 entendu la voix de M. Thambirajah auparavant. Elle a r\u00e9pondu [traduction] \u00ab non \u00bb. Mme Cassidy lui avait dit que c\u2019\u00e9tait M. Thambirajah. [Traduction] \u00ab Je n\u2019ai aucune id\u00e9e de qui il s\u2019agissait \u00bb, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le t\u00e9moin.\n[131] Mme Corinne Pearce, une autre amie de la plaignante, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 quelques reprises que Mme Cassidy soit chez elle quand M. Thambirajah lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9, disant des choses telles que [traduction] \u00ab un rat dans la bo\u00eete aux lettres, aimes-tu ton cadeau, la prochaine fois ce sera peut-\u00eatre toi. \u00bb Mme Cassidy a tenu le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone pr\u00e8s de l\u2019oreille du t\u00e9moin afin qu\u2019elle puisse entendre. Lorsqu\u2019elle s\u2019est fait demander si elle comprenait la personne \u00e0 l\u2019autre bout du fil, voici ce qu\u2019elle a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Je le comprenais clairement, un accent, mais pas un fort accent, plut\u00f4t celui d\u2019un ressortissant des Indes orientales, je pouvais comprendre toutes les paroles. \u00bb Lors du second appel, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la personne \u00e0 l\u2019autre bout du fil a dit [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] Aimes\u2011tu l\u2019\u00e9gratignure sur ta voiture; la prochaine fois \u00e7a pourrait \u00eatre ton visage \u00bb.\n[132] Dans la salle d\u2019audience, M. Machelak a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Thambirajah de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter les paroles que le t\u00e9moin affirme avoir entendues lors des deux appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de menaces all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. Il l\u2019a fait pour le t\u00e9moin. [traduction] \u00ab C\u2019\u00e9tait clair? \u00bb a demand\u00e9 l\u2019avocat. [traduction] \u00ab Oui, et c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019accent, \u00bb a r\u00e9pondu le t\u00e9moin. L\u2019air \u00e9tonn\u00e9, M. Machelak a fait remarquer au t\u00e9moin que l\u2019audience durait depuis une semaine et que les parties et les avocats comprenaient difficilement M. Thambirajah, tandis que le t\u00e9moin a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait seulement un [traduction] \u00ab faible accent \u00bb. Voici ce que le t\u00e9moin a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Oui, je peux affirmer que je pouvais comprendre [M. Thambirajah]. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 des ressortissants des Indes orientales et je comprends leur accent mieux que les autres. \u00bb Mme Pearce a reconnu qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait jamais rencontr\u00e9 M. Thambirajah avant la tenue de l\u2019audience.\n[133] Ce qui s\u2019est ensuite produit \u00e9tait assez int\u00e9ressant. M. Thambirajah a lui-m\u00eame contre\u2011interrog\u00e9 le t\u00e9moin. Il a pos\u00e9 cinq questions. \u00c0 trois d\u2019entre elles, le t\u00e9moin a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Quoi, je vous demande pardon? \u00bb Lorsque j\u2019ai fait remarquer au t\u00e9moin qu\u2019elle a dit \u00ab pardon \u00bb plusieurs fois pendant qu\u2019il la questionnait indiquant qu\u2019elle ne pouvait le comprendre, le t\u00e9moin a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Je peux comprendre ce qu\u2019il a dit, mais pas ce qu\u2019il voulait dire. \u00bb Elle a aussi dit, [traduction] \u00ab Oui, j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 un peu confuse au sujet de ce qu\u2019il voulait dire. \u00bb Je n\u2019accepte pas son explication. Selon la preuve, je conclus que la personne qu\u2019elle pouvait comprendre clairement au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, parlant avec un [traduction] \u00ab faible accent \u00bb, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la m\u00eame personne \u2013 M. Thambirajah \u2013 que celle qu\u2019elle pouvait difficilement comprendre \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[134] Mme Marshall, qui a agi en qualit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentante de Mme Cassidy pendant une bonne partie des proc\u00e9dures, a aussi livr\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage. Elle est une amie proche de la plaignante. Mme Marshall a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Thambirajah, peu avant la date de d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, a [traduction] \u00ab persist\u00e9 \u00bb \u00e0 faire des appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de menaces \u00e0 Mme Cassidy. Elle affirme avoir entendu un appel, mais seulement certaines parties. La plaignante a plac\u00e9 le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire sur l\u2019oreille de Mme Marshall : [traduction] \u00ab J\u2019ai entendu \u201ctu te crois en s\u00e9curit\u00e9, tu ne peux pas te cacher.\u201d C\u2019\u00e9tait un homme indien. Je vis dans un quartier o\u00f9 habitent des ressortissants des Indes orientales. \u00bb Le t\u00e9moin a aussi confirm\u00e9 que le 21 octobre 2009, lorsque des observations devaient \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal, Mme Cassidy est arriv\u00e9e chez elle en pleurant, affirmant que M. Thambirajah venait de lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner et qu\u2019il avait fait une farce \u00e0 propos du d\u00e9c\u00e8s d\u2019Ann Jones, disant quelque chose comme [traduction] \u00ab ton t\u00e9moin est mort, et tu es la prochaine [\u2026] J\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 au bas de la page [dans la lettre adress\u00e9e au Tribunal] qu\u2019il a besoin de soins psychiatriques et qu\u2019il est cruel. \u00bb\n[135] Le m\u00e9pris de Mme Marshall \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel \u00e9tait assez \u00e9vident au cours de l\u2019audience. Elle est une amie proche de la plaignante et elle a pass\u00e9 beaucoup de temps \u2013 \u00e0 titre b\u00e9n\u00e9vole \u2013 \u00e0 agir en qualit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentante de Mme Cassidy dans le cadre des proc\u00e9dures. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, elle a mentionn\u00e9 avoir elle-m\u00eame souffert d\u2019abus et qu\u2019elle voulait s\u2019assurer que justice soit rendue dans le cas du harc\u00e8lement continu exerc\u00e9 par M. Thambirajah \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la plaignante.\n[136] Ni Mme Baird, Mme Pearce ou Mme Marshall, pas plus que la plaignante, ne connaissaient les dates exactes des appels. Elles n\u2019ont pas pris les dates en note. Bien qu\u2019elles affirment qu\u2019au\u2011del\u00e0 de 30 appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de menaces ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7us, \u00e0 raison de [traduction] \u00ab six ou dix par jour \u00bb parfois, la plaignante n\u2019a jamais consign\u00e9 un seul appel, elle n\u2019a pas communiqu\u00e9 avec la police (bien qu\u2019elle l\u2019ait fait pour des affaires moins graves, telles que des dommages \u00e0 sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9), elle n\u2019a pas communiqu\u00e9 avec la compagnie de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ou de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire pour savoir s\u2019il \u00e9tait possible de savoir qui avait appeler chez elle, etc. Ni les relev\u00e9s t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de celle-ci ni ceux de M. Thambirajah n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve. Je dispose seulement de son t\u00e9moignage et de celui d\u2019amies proches qui affirment avoir entendu une voix [traduction] \u00ab indienne \u00bb lors de certains appels, \u00e9tant certaines qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de M. Thambirajah. Bien qu\u2019il soit possible que M. Thambirajah ait bel et bien fait des appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de menaces, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s et en l\u2019absence d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve convaincants, je ne suis pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 rendre une conclusion au sujet d\u2019une affaire aussi s\u00e9rieuse, \u00e0 savoir que, m\u00eame si des appels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par M. Thambirajah lui-m\u00eame ou par quelqu\u2019un agissant suivant ses directives.\nProbl\u00e8me concernant la paie\n[137] Mme Cassidy all\u00e8gue que M. Thambirajah \u00e9tait responsable d\u2019une erreur de paie survenue en septembre 2006, alors qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u des cr\u00e9dits en trop. Elle pr\u00e9tend que M. Thambirajah lui a dit qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab rendrait ma vie mis\u00e9rable, qu\u2019il avait un ami au service de la paie. \u00bb M. Thambirajah nie ces propos. L\u2019avocat de Postes Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit \u00e0 la plaignante : [traduction] \u00ab J\u2019aimerais dire que la paie \u00e0 Postes Canada constitue un \u00e9norme probl\u00e8me, des cas de paiements insuffisants et de paiements en trop, il y a au-del\u00e0 de 60 000 employ\u00e9s et des erreurs se produisent. \u00bb Voici ce que la plaignante a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab J\u2019ai aussi eu des retenues sur mon salaire qui \u00e9taient trop \u00e9lev\u00e9es. Raj m\u2019a dit qu\u2019il avait un ami au service de la paie et que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait que le commencement. \u00bb\n[138] Mme Edmunds a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet du probl\u00e8me concernant la paie. Elle a dit que Mme Cassidy a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 une [traduction] \u00ab falsification de la paie \u00bb, soit un paiement en trop, et que de l\u2019argent lui \u00e9tait \u00e9galement d\u00fb relativement \u00e0 un cong\u00e9 de maladie. Mme Edmunds, Penny Comport, superviseure \u00e0 la succursale o\u00f9 elle travaillait \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 (101, Placer Ct.) et le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical Mark Sinclair, ont rencontr\u00e9 Mme Cassidy le 4 mai 2007 afin de discuter de la question du paiement insuffisant du cong\u00e9 de maladie. La superviseure a expliqu\u00e9 la raison pour laquelle l\u2019erreur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commise concernant le [traduction] \u00ab cong\u00e9 de maladie \u00bb, et a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli, apr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate, que Mme Cassidy n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sous-pay\u00e9e, mais qu\u2019elle avait en fait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e en trop et qu\u2019elle devait deux jours de plus \u00e0 Postes Canada. Postes Canada a simplement [traduction] \u00ab oubli\u00e9 l\u2019incident \u00bb et n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 de remboursement.\n[139] Selon les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, je n\u2019estime pas que M. Thambirajah \u00e9tait responsable des erreurs de paie d\u00e9crites ci-dessus.\nViolation de la vie priv\u00e9e : num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de la plaignante fourni par m\u00e9garde \u00e0 M. Thambirajah\n[140] La plaignante all\u00e8gue que Postes Canada a fourni, de fa\u00e7on inappropri\u00e9e, son num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone \u00e0 M. Thambirajah. \u00c0 Willowdale D, M. Thambirajah \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 partager une partie de l\u2019espace du classeur situ\u00e9 dans le bureau de MM. Tidman et Sultan pour y conserver ses documents syndicaux. Le 26 octobre 2006, alors que M. Thambirajah n\u2019\u00e9tait plus d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical \u00e0 cet endroit et qu\u2019il avait fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un transfert \u00e0 Unionville, un employ\u00e9 de Postes Canada lui a envoy\u00e9 par erreur le contenu du classeur \u00e0 son nouveau lieu de travail. Il lui a, entre autres, fait parvenir plusieurs [traduction] \u00ab demandes de formulaires de cong\u00e9 \u00bb d\u2019employ\u00e9s, dont ceux de Mme Cassidy. M. Thambirajah a signal\u00e9 cette erreur et a remis l\u2019enveloppe renfermant les formulaires de cong\u00e9 au syndicat, qui l\u2019a transmise \u00e0 la direction. Mme Cassidy pr\u00e9tend que son num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone figurait sur les formulaires de cong\u00e9. Cependant, apr\u00e8s examen des formulaires pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve, il semble qu\u2019elle ait indiqu\u00e9 le num\u00e9ro de Willowdale D sur le formulaire. Sur un formulaire, elle semble avoir ray\u00e9 un autre num\u00e9ro et y avoir inscrit celui de la succursale. Le 15 d\u00e9cembre 2006, Postes Canada a avis\u00e9 Mme Cassidy de la violation de la vie priv\u00e9e et a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des excuses.\n[141] L\u2019incident susmentionn\u00e9 a clairement contrari\u00e9 la plaignante. Elle croyait que M. Thambirajah avait obtenu son num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone sur les formulaires de cong\u00e9. Elle a aussi d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s du Commissaire \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e du Canada et d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief.\nO. Trois all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles durant l\u2019audience [142] Le 19 f\u00e9vrier 2010, j\u2019ai accueilli la requ\u00eate de la plaignante visant \u00e0 modifier sa plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre M. Thambirajah en y ajoutant trois incidents de repr\u00e9sailles en vertu de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP. Ainsi que je l\u2019ai d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque dans mes motifs expos\u00e9s de vive voix, le fait d\u2019accueillir la requ\u00eate, vu son seuil peu \u00e9lev\u00e9, ne veut pas dire qu\u2019une conclusion de responsabilit\u00e9 sera rendue \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de M. Thambirajah \u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019audience. Seules mes conclusions de fait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des trois incidents sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es ci-dessous.\nPremier incident : parc de stationnement le 2 f\u00e9vrier\n[143] Il s\u2019agissait du premier incident sur les trois \u00e0 survenir durant l\u2019audience. Mme Cassidy et Mme Marshall ont toutes deux t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de la deuxi\u00e8me journ\u00e9e d\u2019audience, soit le 2 f\u00e9vrier 2010, Mme Cassidy, son partenaire et Mme Marshall \u00e9taient \u00e0 bord de leur voiture dans le parc de stationnement face \u00e0 l\u2019immeuble o\u00f9 avait lieu l\u2019audience. Il tombait une faible neige. Voici ce que Mme Cassidy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage :\n[traduction]\n[\u2026] Julie [Marshall] a lev\u00e9 les yeux et dit \u201cIl [M. Thambirajah] est l\u00e0.\u201d Il regardait ma plaque d\u2019immatriculation. Il a lev\u00e9 les yeux, m\u2019a regard\u00e9e et a souri. Je me suis effondr\u00e9e. Mon petit ami \u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement contrari\u00e9. J\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 pleurer, je n\u2019arrivais pas \u00e0 croire qu\u2019il en faisait encore : du harc\u00e8lement, de l\u2019intimidation, tentant de me montrer \u00e0 sa mani\u00e8re qu\u2019il peut toujours m\u2019atteindre peu importe l\u2019endroit [\u2026] Il se tenait l\u00e0 juste devant.\nElle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait assise sur la banquette avant, du c\u00f4t\u00e9 passager. Dans son avis de requ\u00eate, voici ce qu\u2019elle \u00e9crit : [traduction] Julie l\u2019a vu traverser quatre voies de circulation et marcher en direction nord sur la rue Bay, avec son sac et son plateau. \u00bb\n[144] Mme Marshall a corrobor\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait march\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la voiture de la plaignante, stationn\u00e9e sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 oppos\u00e9 de la rue o\u00f9 se tenait l\u2019audience, sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 ouest de la rue Bay et qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab faufil\u00e9e sur la banquette arri\u00e8re \u00bb. Voici ce qu\u2019elle a affirm\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nLes essuie-glaces fonctionnaient, une faible neige fondait sur les vitres de la voiture, Doris et George \u00e9taient l\u00e0 et discutaient de ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 dit en cour [\u2026] J\u2019ai regard\u00e9 \u00e0 gauche et dit \u201cOh mon Dieu, le voil\u00e0\u201d [\u2026] Raj marchait entre les all\u00e9es. Nous \u00e9tions du c\u00f4t\u00e9 sud. Il \u00e9tait dans le stationnement, entre les deux all\u00e9es suivantes. Elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 trembler et \u00e0 pleurer [\u2026] Je l\u2019ai vu se diriger directement vers la voiture et Doris qui se trouvait du c\u00f4t\u00e9 passager, il a regard\u00e9 la plaque d\u2019immatriculation, puis a regard\u00e9 Doris, lui a souri et fait une mimique puis est parti. Le plus pr\u00e8s qu\u2019il s\u2019est approch\u00e9 \u00e9tait environ \u00e0 six pieds devant la voiture, face au pare-chocs du c\u00f4t\u00e9 passager. Il a rebrouss\u00e9 chemin, a travers\u00e9 quatre voies de [\u2026] march\u00e9 en direction nord sur la rue Bay.\nElle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Thambirajah n\u2019avait pas sa valise pendant qu\u2019il se trouvait dans le stationnement : [traduction] \u00ab Doris \u00e9tait hyst\u00e9rique, elle tremblait et pleurait. J\u2019ai jur\u00e9, et l\u2019ai trait\u00e9 d\u2019un mauvais nom. Il est effront\u00e9 pour faire quelque chose comme \u00e7a. J\u2019ai d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que je le signalerais imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 votre attention. \u00bb Mme Marshall a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 trois reprises au propri\u00e9taire du stationnement, The Hospital for Sick Children, afin de savoir s\u2019il y avait une bande vid\u00e9o de surveillance, mais qu\u2019ils ne l\u2019ont pas rappel\u00e9e. Elle n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 d\u2019ordonnance de production pour moi.\n[145] L\u2019incident susmentionn\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 le lendemain, le 3 f\u00e9vrier, en \u00ab audience publique \u00bb. M. Thambirajah (non asserment\u00e9) a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab J\u2019ai oubli\u00e9 o\u00f9 j\u2019\u00e9tais \u00bb. Il a dit que sa voiture n\u2019\u00e9tait pas gar\u00e9e dans le m\u00eame stationnement que Mme Cassidy. Il s\u2019est perdu. Il a dit avoir utilis\u00e9 son dispositif de commande \u00e0 distance pour tenter de trouver sa voiture. Il n\u2019a pas ni\u00e9 s\u2019\u00eatre trouv\u00e9 dans le stationnement o\u00f9 \u00e9tait gar\u00e9e la voiture de Mme Cassidy.\nIl a toutefois affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab Je n\u2019ai m\u00eame pas vu de qui ou de quoi il s\u2019agissait [\u2026] \u00e9tait plein de [sic] neiges. \u00bb Il a ni\u00e9 leur avoir souri. J\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9, lorsque l\u2019incident a initialement \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience, que leurs observations non asserment\u00e9es ne feraient pas [traduction] \u00ab \u00e0 ce moment-ci \u00bb partie de la preuve ou de mes conclusions, ou de toute ordonnance. J\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 que cela pourrait devenir pertinent \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure. Cela s\u2019est concr\u00e9tis\u00e9, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la plaignante a par la suite pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 modifier sa plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel. Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu la requ\u00eate, je l\u2019ai accueillie et j\u2019ai fourni des motifs de vive voix.\n[146] Dans le cadre de son t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sous serment l\u2019avant-dernier jour de l\u2019audience, M. Thambirajah s\u2019est fait demander s\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait approch\u00e9 du v\u00e9hicule de Mme Cassidy dans le stationnement. Il a r\u00e9pondu [traduction] \u00ab Je n\u2019ai pas fait \u00e7a. Je me trouvais l\u00e0, gar\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame stationnement, me rendant \u00e0 ma voiture. Je n\u2019ai pas regard\u00e9 sa plaque [d\u2019immatriculation]. \u00bb \u00c0 la fin du r\u00e9interrogatoire, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de clarifier son t\u00e9moignage. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait gar\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame stationnement que Mme Cassidy, mais dans une autre all\u00e9e, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment [traduction] \u00ab \u00e0 deux all\u00e9es devant eux en face de l\u2019h\u00f4pital. \u00bb Voici ce qu\u2019il a affirm\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab J\u2019ignorais o\u00f9 ils \u00e9taient gar\u00e9s et qui se trouvait \u00e0 bord de la voiture, je ne l\u2019ai d\u00e9couvert que le lendemain [quand la plaignante a initialement soulev\u00e9 la question \u00e0 l\u2019audience]. Ce r\u00e9cit est une pure invention. Je ne les ai pas vus ni leur voiture [\u2026] \u00bb J\u2019ai ensuite pos\u00e9 la question suivante \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Comment saviez-vous que vous \u00e9tiez dans le m\u00eame stationnement, dans une all\u00e9e diff\u00e9rente, si vous ne les avez pas vus ni vu leur voiture? \u00bb L\u2019intim\u00e9 a r\u00e9pondu [traduction] \u00ab C\u2019\u00e9tait le seul stationnement \u00e0 cet endroit. \u00bb M. Kelly a ensuite demand\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab En cour [le 3 f\u00e9vrier] vous avez avis\u00e9 le Tribunal que vous \u00e9tiez gar\u00e9 \u00e0 deux coins de rue, dans un autre stationnement. \u00bb La r\u00e9ponse de M. Thambirajah a \u00e9t\u00e9 difficile \u00e0 comprendre en raison de son accent. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne connaissait pas le coin, mais que le stationnement \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab deux all\u00e9es derri\u00e8re le Tribunal [immeuble sur la rue Bay]. Il a confirm\u00e9 que le stationnement se trouvait sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord-ouest de l\u2019intersection des rues Bay et Elm, \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 d\u2019un chantier de construction.\n[147] \u00c0 l\u2019examen des observations non asserment\u00e9es pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par M. Thambirajah lorsque l\u2019incident a initialement \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 le 2 f\u00e9vrier 2010, et de ses t\u00e9moignages du 7 et du 11 octobre 2011 (interrogatoire principal, contre-interrogatoire et r\u00e9interrogatoire, incluant mes questions), j\u2019ai eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 comprendre ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9. Il semble s\u2019\u00eatre contredit. Il affirme tout d\u2019abord qu\u2019il \u00e9tait gar\u00e9 dans un autre stationnement que Mme Cassidy, qu\u2019il s\u2019est perdu et s\u2019est retrouv\u00e9 dans le stationnement o\u00f9 sa voiture \u00e0 elle \u00e9tait gar\u00e9e, mais qu\u2019il ne s\u2019est jamais trouv\u00e9 face \u00e0 sa voiture \u00e0 elle, et qu\u2019il ne lui a donc pas souri et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas non plus regard\u00e9 la plaque d\u2019immatriculation. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, il affirme qu\u2019il \u00e9tait gar\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame stationnement qu\u2019elle, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas all\u00e9 devant la voiture de celle-ci, qu\u2019il ne l\u2019a pas regard\u00e9e et ne lui a pas fait de sourire, et qu\u2019il ne savait m\u00eame pas o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait gar\u00e9e. Il affirme ensuite qu\u2019il \u00e9tait l\u00e0, sa voiture \u00e9tant gar\u00e9e \u00e0 deux all\u00e9es de la sienne, mais qu\u2019il ne l\u2019a pas regard\u00e9e ou n\u2019a pas regard\u00e9 la plaque d\u2019immatriculation. Ses r\u00e9ponses sont alambiqu\u00e9es et contradictoires. M\u00eame si je devais fournir la meilleure interpr\u00e9tation qui soit de ses r\u00e9ponses et conclure qu\u2019il \u00e9tait gar\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame stationnement que Mme Cassidy, qu\u2019il s\u2019est perdu et s\u2019est retrouv\u00e9 sans le savoir devant la voiture de Mme Cassidy, je devrais m\u2019arr\u00eater l\u00e0. Je ne pourrais accepter le reste de sa version des \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Je conclus qu\u2019il s\u2019est tenu devant la voiture de Mme Cassidy apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience alors qu\u2019il neigeait. Je crois les affirmations de Mme Cassidy et de Mme Marshall selon lesquelles il a regard\u00e9 la plaque d\u2019immatriculation de Mme Cassidy, qu\u2019il a ensuite regard\u00e9 celle-ci, en souriant ou en faisant une mimique. Il a ensuite quitt\u00e9 le stationnement et march\u00e9 en direction nord, sans aucun doute pour se rendre dans l\u2019autre stationnement o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait gar\u00e9 en r\u00e9alit\u00e9. J\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Marshall selon lequel, apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9loign\u00e9 de leur voiture, [traduction] \u00ab Il a rebrouss\u00e9 chemin, a travers\u00e9 quatre voies de circulation [sur la rue Bay], a ramass\u00e9 son sac et a march\u00e9 en direction nord sur la rue Bay. \u00bb Le fait de s\u2019\u00eatre gar\u00e9 dans le stationnement situ\u00e9 au nord de l\u2019immeuble du Tribunal et au nord-est de l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 \u00e9tait gar\u00e9e Mme Cassidy, cadre avec sa d\u00e9claration initiale et avec le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Marshall et telle est ma conclusion dans les faits. J\u2019aborderai plus loin dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs la question de savoir si ses actes constituaient des \u00ab repr\u00e9sailles \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP.\n[148] Apr\u00e8s que la plaignante a initialement soulev\u00e9 l\u2019incident du stationnement \u00e0 l\u2019audience du 2 f\u00e9vrier, j\u2019ai averti les parties et les ai enjoints de ne pas communiquer entre elles et de traiter avec l\u2019autre par l\u2019entremise de leurs repr\u00e9sentants \u00e0 l\u2019audience. En d\u00e9pit de cette directive, deux autres incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s se sont produits.\nDeuxi\u00e8me incident : dans le couloir, \u00e0 l\u2019audience, le 16 f\u00e9vrier\n[149] Mme Cassidy all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab m\u2019a encore harcel\u00e9e verbalement lorsque je quittais la salle d\u2019audience. Nous avions soulev\u00e9 en cour la possibilit\u00e9 de convoquer un nouveau t\u00e9moin \u2013 Marcia Busarello (Iunni). \u00c0 ma sortie de la salle d\u2019audience, Raj m\u2019a dit \u2013 alors que personne ne se trouvait assez pr\u00e8s pour entendre \u2013 \u201cattends [jusqu\u2019\u00e0] l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de Iunni\u201d en continuant de m\u2019intimider. \u00bb La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle [traduction] \u00ab croyait qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 d\u2019une autre fa\u00e7on pour lui de m\u2019atteindre, de me faire du mal. \u00bb Personne ne peut corroborer son t\u00e9moignage; la plaignante \u00e9tait seule. M. Thambirajah nie que cette interaction soit m\u00eame survenue. Selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je ne suis pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 conclure que cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement s\u2019est produit comme la plaignante l\u2019a d\u00e9crit. Par ailleurs, m\u00eame s\u2019il s\u2019est produit, les paroles de l\u2019intim\u00e9 disant [traduction] \u00ab attends jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de Iunni \u00bb ne correspondent pas, \u00e0 elles seules, et d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, \u00e0 des repr\u00e9sailles en vertu de la LCDP.\nTroisi\u00e8me incident : sur la rue Bay \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de l\u2019immeuble du Tribunal, le 17 f\u00e9vrier\n[150] Le troisi\u00e8me incident all\u00e9gu\u00e9 s\u2019est soi-disant produit le 17 f\u00e9vrier. Voici ce que d\u00e9clare la plaignante dans son avis de requ\u00eate : [traduction] \u00ab Je suis sortie de l\u2019immeuble sis au 655, rue Bay, pour fumer une cigarette. Je me promenais sur la rue et M. Thambirajah a surgi de derri\u00e8re une colonne et m\u2019a dit \u201cton tour viendra\u201d. J\u2019\u00e9tais vraiment affol\u00e9e et je suis venue vous aviser [le Tribunal] imm\u00e9diatement [\u2026] \u00bb. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle, Mme Marshall et Mme Baird \u00e9taient sorties fumer une cigarette : [traduction] \u00ab Je me suis \u00e9loign\u00e9e en marchant, Raj \u00e9tait derri\u00e8re la colonne [\u2026] il a formul\u00e9 le commentaire \u201cton tour viendra\u201d. Je suis revenue et j\u2019ai dit \u201cJe ne peux m\u00eame pas fumer une cigarette et lui \u00e9chapper\u201d et je leur ai dit ce qui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9. \u00bb Mme Marshall confirme que la plaignante lui a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 peu apr\u00e8s que l\u2019incident est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment survenu. Mais personne n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin de l\u2019interaction qui a r\u00e9ellement eu lieu entre Mme Cassidy et M. Thambirajah. Ce dernier a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit au moment de t\u00e9moigner : [traduction] \u00ab Elle est venue vers moi. Je prenais une pause debout pr\u00e8s de la colonne. Elle a tent\u00e9 de provoquer quelque chose [\u2026] Je n\u2019ai rien dit. \u00bb Il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait eu aucun \u00e9change verbal ni visuel.\n[151] D\u2019apr\u00e8s les t\u00e9moignages de la plaignante et de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel, je conclus qu\u2019une interaction a eu lieu entre eux pr\u00e8s de la colonne. Toutefois, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je ne tire pas de conclusion selon laquelle il a formul\u00e9 le commentaire de menaces qu\u2019elle all\u00e8gue. Je m\u2019abstiens \u00e9galement de tirer une conclusion selon laquelle [traduction] \u00ab elle a tent\u00e9 de provoquer quelque chose \u00bb chez lui. Je dis cela en gardant pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 l\u2019esprit les probl\u00e8mes de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019ils ont tous deux eus pendant toute la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019audience.\nVI. La l\u00e9gislation [152] C\u2019est le plaignant ou la Commission qui a la charge initiale d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de la LCDP : Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O\u2019Malley c. Simpsons\u2011Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28. Une fois que cette preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de fournir une justification ou des explications quant \u00e0 l\u2019acte discriminatoire. L\u2019explication fournie par l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne devrait jouer aucun r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9termination de la question de savoir si une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par le plaignant : Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204, au paragraphe 22.\n[153] Le principe juridique suivant est aussi pertinent pour les affaires du Tribunal des droits de la personne : \u00ab pour faire droit \u00e0 une plainte, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les consid\u00e9rations li\u00e9es \u00e0 la discrimination soient le seul motif de la conduite reproch\u00e9e. Il suffit que la discrimination soit un des facteurs qui ont motiv\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019employeur \u00bb : Morris c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes) (2001), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/443 (T.C.D.P.), au paragraphe 69; Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12, au paragraphe 7.\n[154] La norme de preuve dans les affaires de discrimination est la norme civile habituelle, \u00e0 savoir la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Selon cette norme, on peut conclure qu\u2019il y a discrimination quand la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui rend cette conclusion plus probable que n\u2019importe quelle autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se possible : Premakumar c. Air Canada (no 2) (2002), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/63 (T.C.D.P.), au paragraphe 81. Ainsi que l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le membre instructeur Craig dans la d\u00e9cision Naistus c. Chief, 2009 TCDP 4, au paragraphe 72 : \u00ab La preuve doit toujours \u00eatre claire et convaincante afin de satisfaire au crit\u00e8re de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve. \u00bb\nA. Harc\u00e8lement sexuel [155] Selon l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la LCDP, constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, y compris sur le sexe, le fait de harceler un individu \u00ab en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi \u00bb. Le paragraphe 14(2) pr\u00e9cise que \u00ab le harc\u00e8lement sexuel est r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre un harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. \u00bb\n[156] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat de principe portant sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, Janzen c. Platy Enterprises Inc., [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1252, au paragraphe 1284, le harc\u00e8lement sexuel a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme \u00ab \u00e9tant une conduite de nature sexuelle non sollicit\u00e9e qui a un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le milieu de travail \u00bb. D\u2019autres tribunaux ou lois l\u2019ont d\u00e9fini comme le fait de formuler des commentaires ou d\u2019avoir des comportements sexuels vexatoires que l\u2019on sait importuns ou que l\u2019on devrait raisonnablement savoir importuns. Des termes identiques ou semblables sont pr\u00e9vus dans de nombreuses lois sur les droits de la personne au Canada. Fait \u00e0 noter, la LCDP n\u2019est pas l\u2019une d\u2019elles.\n[157] Dans une plainte de harc\u00e8lement sexuel au sens des articles 7 et 14 de la LCDP, la juge Tremblay-Lamer s\u2019est attard\u00e9 au principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Janzen, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es) et Franke, 1999 3 CF 653. Pour qu\u2019une all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement sexuel soit \u00e9tay\u00e9e, il faut pouvoir d\u00e9montrer ce qui suit :\n1) Les actes qui constituent le fondement de la plainte doivent \u00eatre importuns, ou devraient \u00eatre jug\u00e9s importuns par une personne raisonnable;\n2) La conduite doit \u00eatre de nature sexuelle. Cela n\u2019englobe pas seulement les contacts physiques ou les attouchements (p. ex., les remarques sexistes, les insultes d\u2019ordre sexuel, et les commentaires concernant l\u2019apparence d\u2019une personne, sa tenue vestimentaire ou ses habitudes sexuelles);\n3) Normalement, le harc\u00e8lement sexuel exige un degr\u00e9 de persistance ou de gravit\u00e9 de la conduite, mais dans certaines circonstances (comme dans une agression physique grave), un seul incident peut \u00eatre suffisamment grave pour cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail empoisonn\u00e9 ou hostile. La Cour a aussi appliqu\u00e9 \u00ab la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019inversement proportionnel \u00bb : moins la conduite est grave, plus doit se manifester la persistance. Plus la conduite est grave, moins la persistance doit \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9e. La norme objective de la \u00ab personne raisonnable \u00bb est aussi appliqu\u00e9e pour \u00e9valuer ce facteur; et\n4) Lorsque le harc\u00e8lement sexuel a lieu dans un milieu de travail, la victime de harc\u00e8lement doit aviser l\u2019employeur de la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conduite offensante.\nB. Responsabilit\u00e9 du fait d\u2019autrui (soci\u00e9t\u00e9) : article 65 de la LCDP [158] Une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intim\u00e9e (y compris un intim\u00e9 gouvernemental) peut \u00eatre tenue responsable d\u2019actes discriminatoires ou de harc\u00e8lement (similaire \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 du fait d\u2019autrui en droit de la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9lictuelle) commis par ses employ\u00e9s, ses mandataires, ses administrateurs ou ses dirigeants dans le cadre de leur emploi, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 65 de la LCDP. Il en est ainsi, \u00e0 moins que l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 puisse d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas consenti \u00e0 l\u2019acte discriminatoire, et a exerc\u00e9 \u00ab toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires \u00bb pour l\u2019emp\u00eacher et a tent\u00e9 d\u2019en att\u00e9nuer ou d\u2019en annuler l\u2019effet. Je dois ajouter que, \u00e0 mon avis, le qualificatif \u00ab toutes \u00bb pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant \u00ab mesures n\u00e9cessaires \u00bb ne n\u00e9cessite pas l\u2019application d\u2019une norme de \u00ab perfection \u00bb dans l\u2019exercice des mesures n\u00e9cessaires. Au contraire, le qualificatif exige que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intim\u00e9e ait toujours exerc\u00e9 les mesures n\u00e9cessaires raisonnables. Dans la d\u00e9cision Hinds c. Canada (Commission de l\u2019Emploi et de l\u2019Immigration) (1988), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/5683 (TCDP), au paragraphe 41611, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit en appliquant le paragraphe 48(6) de la LCDP [le paragraphe 65(2) alors en vigueur] :\nBien que la LCDP n\u2019exige pas que l\u2019employeur maintienne un milieu de travail irr\u00e9prochable, elle demande toutefois qu\u2019il prenne des mesures promptes et efficaces lorsqu\u2019il sait, ou qu\u2019il devrait savoir, que la conduite de certains employ\u00e9s dans le milieu de travail constitue du harc\u00e8lement raciste [\u2026] Pour se soustraire a la responsabilit\u00e9, l\u2019employeur doit prendre des mesures raisonnables pour att\u00e9nuer, autant qu\u2019il le peut, le malaise qui r\u00e8gne dans le milieu de travail et pour donner aux personnes int\u00e9ress\u00e9es l\u2019assurance qu\u2019il a la ferme volont\u00e9 de maintenir un milieu de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement raciste. La r\u00e9action appropri\u00e9e est donc \u00e0 la fois prompte et efficace et sa force doit \u00eatre fonction des circonstances du harc\u00e8lement, dans chaque cas. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[159] Dans cette obligation d\u2019att\u00e9nuer figure un examen des mesures prises par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intim\u00e9e pour enqu\u00eater, tirer des conclusions et imposer un m\u00e9canisme de r\u00e8glement. Dans la d\u00e9cision Sutton c. Jarvis Ryan Associates, et al., 2010 HRTO 2421, aux paragraphes 130 \u00e0 133, le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario a statu\u00e9 sur l\u2019obligation de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intim\u00e9e d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur une plainte de discrimination ou de harc\u00e8lement :\n[traduction]\nIl est bien \u00e9tabli dans la jurisprudence du Tribunal qu\u2019un employeur peut \u00eatre tenu responsable de la fa\u00e7on dont il r\u00e9pond \u00e0 une plainte de discrimination.\nLa raison d\u2019\u00eatre qui sous-tend le devoir d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur une plainte de discrimination est de veiller \u00e0 ce que les droits en vertu du Code soient efficaces. Ainsi qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Laskowska c. Marineland of Canada Inc., 2005 HRTO 30 (CanLII) (Laskowska), au paragraphe 53 :\nCe serait faire de la protection en vertu du paragraphe 5(1) visant \u00e0 permettre un milieu de travail exempt de discrimination vide de sens si un employeur pouvait rester les bras crois\u00e9s quand une plainte de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite et ne pas avoir \u00e0 mener une enqu\u00eate. Si tel \u00e9tait le cas, comment pourrait-il d\u00e9terminer si un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis ou d\u00e9terminer l\u2019existence d\u2019un milieu de travail empoisonn\u00e9? Le devoir d\u2019enqu\u00eater est un \u00ab moyen \u00bb qui permet \u00e0 l\u2019employeur de s\u2019assurer qu\u2019il atteint les \u00ab objectifs \u00bb dict\u00e9s par le Code visant \u00e0 offrir un environnement exempt de discrimination et \u00e0 fournir \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s un environnement de travail s\u00e9curitaire.\nLa jurisprudence du Tribunal a \u00e9tabli que l\u2019obligation de l\u2019employeur d\u2019enqu\u00eater s\u2019appr\u00e9cie suivant la norme du caract\u00e8re raisonnable, non pas celles de la d\u00e9cision correcte ou de la perfection. Dans la d\u00e9cision Laskowska, le Tribunal a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ainsi le crit\u00e8re pertinent dont doit tenir compte l\u2019employeur dans son devoir d\u2019enqu\u00eater :\n(1) Sensibilisation aux questions de discrimination\/harc\u00e8lement, m\u00e9canisme de plainte pr\u00e9vu par la politique et formation : \u00e9tait-on sensibilis\u00e9 au probl\u00e8me de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement dans le milieu de travail lors de l\u2019incident? Existait-il une politique anti\u2011discrimination\/harc\u00e8lement appropri\u00e9e? Existait-il un m\u00e9canisme de plainte proprement dit en place? La direction et les employ\u00e9s ont-ils b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019une formation ad\u00e9quate;\n(2) Apr\u00e8s la plainte : la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019incident, la rapidit\u00e9 d\u2019intervention, la prise en charge de son employ\u00e9, l\u2019enqu\u00eate et la mesure prise : Apr\u00e8s qu\u2019une plainte interne a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e, l\u2019employeur a-t-il trait\u00e9 le dossier s\u00e9rieusement? A-t-il r\u00e9gl\u00e9 la question rapidement et avec doigt\u00e9? A-t-il men\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate et agi de mani\u00e8re raisonnable?;\n(3) R\u00e8glement de la plainte (y compris fournir au plaignant un environnement de travail sain) et communication : L\u2019employeur a\u2011t-il propos\u00e9 une solution raisonnable dans les circonstances? Si le plaignant a choisi de retourner au travail, l\u2019employeur pouvait-il lui assurer un environnement de travail sain, exempt de discrimination? A-t-il communiqu\u00e9 ses conclusions et interventions au plaignant?\nDans la d\u00e9cision Laskowska, le Tribunal a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit au paragraphe 60 :\nBien que les trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments ci-dessus soient de nature g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, leur application doit conserver une certaine souplesse pour tenir compte des faits propres \u00e0 chaque cas. La norme est celle du caract\u00e8re raisonnable, non pas celles de la d\u00e9cision correcte ou de la perfection. Il y aurait eu plusieurs options \u2013 toutes des mesures raisonnables \u2013 auxquelles aurait pu recourir l\u2019employeur. Ce dernier n\u2019est pas tenu de satisfaire \u00e0 chacun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments dans tous les cas afin d\u2019\u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant agi de fa\u00e7on raisonnable, bien que ce serait l\u2019exception plut\u00f4t que la norme. Il faut regarder chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment individuellement, puis dans l\u2019ensemble avant de porter un jugement \u00e0 savoir si l\u2019employeur a agi de mani\u00e8re raisonnable.\nC. Repr\u00e9sailles : article 14.1 de la LCDP [160] L\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant, constitue un acte discriminatoire.\n[161] Dans la d\u00e9cision Witwicky c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2007 TCDP 25, le membre instructeur Doucet \u00e9tablit et analyse les deux \u00e9coles de pens\u00e9e oppos\u00e9es quant \u00e0 savoir si l\u2019\u00ab intention \u00bb est requise pour \u00e9tablir une plainte au sens de l\u2019article 14.1. La d\u00e9cision Witwicky est l\u2019analyse la plus r\u00e9cente que le Tribunal a r\u00e9alis\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Il y a des d\u00e9cisions contradictoires au niveau du Tribunal, ainsi que dans certains tribunaux provinciaux des droits de la personne, des cours d\u2019appel provinciales et des cours sup\u00e9rieures. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada ne se sont pas encore pench\u00e9es sur cette question.\n[162] Dans la d\u00e9cision Witwicky, voici les propos tenus par le Tribunal dans les paragraphes suivants :\n[121] Le Tribunal a adopt\u00e9 deux interpr\u00e9tations l\u00e9g\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rentes quant au cadre juridique dans lequel une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e. Ces interpr\u00e9tations sont illustr\u00e9es dans deux d\u00e9cisions : Wong c. Banque royale du Canada, [2001] D.C.D.P. no 11, et Virk c. Bell Canada (Ontario), [2005] D.C.D.P. no 2. La principale diff\u00e9rence entre ces deux interpr\u00e9tations a trait \u00e0 l\u2019importance accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intention de la personne \u00e0 qui on reproche d\u2019avoir exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles.\n[122] Dans la d\u00e9cision Wong, le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 que, compte tenu du caract\u00e8re r\u00e9parateur de la Loi, le plaignant ne doit pas \u00eatre tenu de prouver que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait l\u2019intention d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre lui. L\u2019essentiel de l\u2019analyse porte plut\u00f4t sur la perception du plaignant et sur la question de savoir si le plaignant aurait pu ou non croire raisonnablement que la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 constituait des repr\u00e9sailles : [\u2026]\n[124] L\u2019autre interpr\u00e9tation est expos\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Virk [aux paragraphes 155 \u00e0 157] :\nEn vertu de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi, constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\nL\u2019exercice de repr\u00e9sailles comporte une certaine forme d\u2019acte volontaire visant \u00e0 infliger un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la personne qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 cette plainte. Ce point de vue d\u00e9roge en partie \u00e0 ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9s dans les d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures du Tribunal sur la question des repr\u00e9sailles (Wong c. Banque Royale du Canada, [2001] TCDP 11; Bressette c. Conseil de bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle et de Stony Point, 2004 CHRT 40 (CanLII).\nDans Wong et Bressette, les points de vue exprim\u00e9s portent qu\u2019un plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e0 prouver une intention d\u2019exercer des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles et que, si un plaignant per\u00e7oit raisonnablement que la conduite reproch\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 constitue des repr\u00e9sailles contre la plainte relative aux droits de la personne, il pourrait \u00e9galement s\u2019agir de repr\u00e9sailles, nonobstant l\u2019absence de toute preuve de l\u2019intention de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[163] Je souscris au raisonnement adopt\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Virk, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, de m\u00eame que dans d\u2019autres d\u00e9cisions judiciaires et d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux exigeant un \u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u2019intention. L\u2019\u00ab intention \u00bb englobe la pens\u00e9e et l\u2019acte volontaires et t\u00e9m\u00e9raires d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre un plaignant ou de le punir pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne. Bien que la LCDP consid\u00e8re l\u2019exercice de \u00ab repr\u00e9sailles \u00bb comme \u00e9tant un acte discriminatoire, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une disposition diff\u00e9rente de l\u2019interdiction visant la discrimination et le harc\u00e8lement du fait que les \u00ab repr\u00e9sailles \u00bb ne doivent pas \u00eatre li\u00e9es \u00e0 un motif de distinction illicite selon la LCDP. Comme on le verra plus loin dans les motifs, l\u2019application de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des approches concernant l\u2019intention, soit celle dans la d\u00e9cision Virk ou celle dans la d\u00e9cision Wong, donnerait le m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nVII. Responsabilit\u00e9 A. Responsabilit\u00e9 vis-\u00e0-vis la plainte contre M. Thambirajah All\u00e9gation 1 : Incident de l\u2019attouchement et du commentaire survenu le 9 novembre 2005\n[164] D\u2019apr\u00e8s mes conclusions de fait, je suis convaincu que M. Thambirajah savait ou, \u00e0 tout le moins, aurait d\u00fb savoir que son attouchement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Cassidy sur sa chemise au niveau de sa poitrine et son commentaire sur la taille de sa poitrine \u00e9taient \u00ab importuns \u00bb. Sa position sur ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9, y compris le fait qu\u2019il ait tout d\u2019abord ni\u00e9 directement ce qui c\u2019\u00e9tait produit \u00e0 Mme Edmunds de Postes Canada au d\u00e9part, puis qu\u2019il ait chang\u00e9 de position \u00e0 l\u2019audience, met en doute sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. \u00c0 tout le moins, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, il a admis avoir fait le commentaire, puis l\u2019attouchement, sans toutefois y attribuer d\u2019intention sexuelle. Il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019une \u00ab agression sexuelle \u00bb, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9. Je n\u2019ai, bien s\u00fbr, pas comp\u00e9tence pour trancher une all\u00e9gation d\u2019agression sexuelle au criminel ou au civil. C\u2019est le \u00ab harc\u00e8lement sexuel \u00bb qui rel\u00e8ve de ma comp\u00e9tence, comme le pr\u00e9voit la LCDP.\n[165] Le contact physique qu\u2019a eu M. Thambirajah avec sa main s\u2019est fait sur une partie sexuelle du corps de la femme, \u00e0 savoir les seins de la plaignante ou sa poitrine. En outre, son commentaire prof\u00e9r\u00e9 au m\u00eame moment au sujet de la taille de ses seins \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment de nature sexuelle. Je suis \u00e9galement convaincu que l\u2019attouchement, assorti du commentaire, d\u00e9clenche la responsabilit\u00e9 au titre de la LCDP. Bien que l\u2019incident se soit produit qu\u2019une seule fois, le contact physique sur la poitrine est suffisamment grave pour entra\u00eener une responsabilit\u00e9. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une simple plaisanterie. C\u2019est ce qui ressort de la r\u00e9action de Mme Cassidy et de M. Pyziak et de ce que penserait objectivement une \u00ab personne raisonnable \u00bb. Bien que la LCDP et le Tribunal n\u2019ont pas pour objectif d\u2019aseptiser tous les comportements en milieu de travail au point de devenir un environnement st\u00e9rile moins humain, il y a tout de m\u00eame des limites. Et M. Thambirajah a clairement exc\u00e9d\u00e9 les limites d\u2019un comportement acceptable et ne d\u00e9clenchant pas l\u2019application de la LCDP. Il a clairement harcel\u00e9 sexuellement la plaignante le 9 novembre 2005. Cela est d\u2019autant plus inqui\u00e9tant \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 sa position en tant que d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical du Syndicat. Comme M. Tomaszewski, lui-m\u00eame un repr\u00e9sentant syndical, l\u2019a dit dans son t\u00e9moignage, les d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s syndicaux sont tenus de respecter une norme plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e. Ils agissent comme [traduction] \u00ab tampon \u00bb entre le syndicat, l\u2019employ\u00e9 et la direction. Ils sont \u00e9lus par leurs coll\u00e8gues. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un poste de confiance. L\u2019on serait en droit de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que les d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s syndicaux donnent l\u2019exemple en ce qui concerne les droits de la personne, pas qu\u2019ils soient des auteurs de harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Cette question sera abord\u00e9e plus loin dans la section des pr\u00e9sents motifs qui porte sur les mesures de r\u00e9paration.\nAll\u00e9gation 2 : Incidents de la chute dans le bac \u00e0 courrier et de celui o\u00f9 il a [traduction] \u00ab pris mes fesses (ou tap\u00e9 mon derri\u00e8re) \u00bb\n[166] Ainsi qu\u2019il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans la section \u00ab Conclusions de fait \u00bb, le t\u00e9moignage et la preuve documentaire de la plaignante \u00e9taient contradictoires sur cette question. Ils n\u2019\u00e9taient certes pas \u00ab clairs et convaincants \u00bb. \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9, elle a sembl\u00e9 dire qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de deux incidents distincts : l\u2019un concernant la chute dans un bac \u00e0 courrier et le commentaire de M. Thambirajah indiquant [traduction] \u00ab au moins, tu as un cul \u00bb (voir son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions) et l\u2019autre, concernant le v\u00e9ritable geste pos\u00e9 sur ses fesses tout en faisant le m\u00eame commentaire. Elle s\u2019est contredite quant \u00e0 la date : d\u00e9cembre 2005 par opposition au 18 avril 2006. C\u2019est peut-\u00eatre parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait bien d\u2019un seul \u00e9v\u00e9nement. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 mes conclusions de fait, je ne reconnais pas que ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s comme elle les a d\u00e9crits, et pour les motifs qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019est pas conclu qu\u2019il y a eu violation des dispositions de la LCDP.\nAll\u00e9gation 3 : Incidents du 10 au 19 avril li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9change de jurons \/ un langage inappropri\u00e9\n[167] Les conclusions de fait entourant ces incidents ne justifient pas une conclusion de responsabilit\u00e9. Les jurons, les cris et le langage inappropri\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9taient pas de nature sexuelle (ou li\u00e9s au motif de distinction illicite qu\u2019est le sexe) ou d\u2019une assez grave nature pour engager la responsabilit\u00e9 en vertu de la LCDP. La plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel ont tous deux \u00e9chang\u00e9 des insultes de nature p\u00e9jorative de haut niveau. Ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sanctionn\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e par M. Tidman.\nAll\u00e9gation 4 : \u00c9gratignures sur la voiture \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019une cl\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union syndicale : 19 septembre 2006\n[168] J\u2019ai tir\u00e9 une conclusion de fait selon laquelle on a bel et bien fait \u00e9gratigner avec une cl\u00e9 la voiture de Mme Cassidy en y inscrivant des mots grossiers au cours de la r\u00e9union syndicale. Selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, il m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de conclure que M. Thambirajah (ou un complice ob\u00e9issant \u00e0 ses instructions) \u00e9tait responsable. En cons\u00e9quence, je n\u2019ai pas besoin de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il est responsable en vertu de la LCDP de cet incident, y compris si un tel geste constitue m\u00eame du \u00ab harc\u00e8lement sexuel \u00bb au sens de la LCDP.\nAll\u00e9gation 5 : Incident de la crevaison des pneus\n[169] J\u2019ai tir\u00e9 une conclusion de fait selon laquelle les pneus de sa voiture ont \u00e9t\u00e9 crev\u00e9s le 1er novembre 2006. Encore une fois, je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas convaincu, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que M. Thambirajah (ou son complice) \u00e9tait responsable, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve dont je suis saisi. Ainsi, les dispositions de la LCDP ne sont pas vis\u00e9es ici.\nAll\u00e9gation 6 : Incidents de la filature de la plaignante sur le trajet de livraison du courrier et du v\u00e9hicule dans son entr\u00e9e\n[170] Je ne suis pas convaincu, d\u2019apr\u00e8s mes conclusions de fait ant\u00e9rieures, que M. Thambirajah, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, \u00e9tait responsable de ces incidents ou si d\u2019ailleurs ils constituent m\u00eame du harc\u00e8lement sexuel en vertu de la LCDP.\nAll\u00e9gation 7 : Rat dans la bo\u00eete aux lettres : 4 d\u00e9cembre 2006\n[171] Cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement ne s\u2019est pas produit tel que la plaignante l\u2019a d\u00e9crit, selon moi. La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9 de sa preuve sur ce point, ainsi qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, soul\u00e8vent de s\u00e9rieuses inqui\u00e9tudes. En revanche, si le rat mort a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans sa bo\u00eete aux lettres ainsi qu\u2019elle l\u2019a d\u00e9crit, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve permettant de conclure que M. Thambirajah \u00e9tait responsable de cet incident, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Je n\u2019ai pas accept\u00e9 comme une conclusion de fait qu\u2019il avait fait un suivi des menaces par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone \u00e0 la plaignante sur le rat mort. D\u2019apr\u00e8s mes conclusions de fait, je n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s\u2019il existe une base juridique permettant de conclure que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a viol\u00e9 les droits de la plaignante en vertu de la LCDP concernant cet incident.\nAll\u00e9gations 8 : Appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de menaces\n[172] Mes conclusions de fait illustrent mon inqui\u00e9tude selon laquelle la preuve n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00ab claire et convaincante \u00bb \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. J\u2019avais d\u2019importantes r\u00e9serves quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9\/fiabilit\u00e9 de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. J\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ces pr\u00e9occupations dans la section intitul\u00e9e \u00ab Conclusions de fait \u00bb. J\u2019ai conclu que la plaignante avait exag\u00e9r\u00e9 le nombre desdits appels. M\u00eame si certains d\u2019entre eux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas en mesure de conclure que M. Thambirajah (ou une personne agissant en son nom) les a faits. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019application des dispositions de la LCDP n\u2019est pas d\u00e9clench\u00e9e. Si j\u2019avais fait un tel constat, il est plus probable qu\u2019une conclusion de \u00ab repr\u00e9sailles \u00bb aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus appropri\u00e9e que celle de \u00ab harc\u00e8lement sexuel \u00bb.\nAll\u00e9gation 9 : Falsification de la paie\n[173] Auparavant dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, j\u2019ai tir\u00e9 une conclusion de fait selon laquelle, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une enqu\u00eate approfondie men\u00e9e par Postes Canada, y compris une r\u00e9union avec la plaignante, la direction et son repr\u00e9sentant syndical, il ressortait clairement que son salaire n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trafiqu\u00e9. En effet, elle a re\u00e7u un montant [traduction] \u00ab en trop \u00bb et son employeur ne lui a pas demand\u00e9 qu\u2019il lui soit rembours\u00e9. De plus, j\u2019ai conclu que la preuve ne permettait pas de justifier une conclusion selon laquelle M. Thambirajah \u00e9tait responsable de la falsification de ses registres de paie. Ainsi, je n\u2019ai pas besoin de passer \u00e0 la prochaine \u00e9tape, soit de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il avait viol\u00e9 les droits de la plaignante en vertu de la LCDP.\nAll\u00e9gations 10 \u00e0 12 : Les trois incidents de repr\u00e9sailles pendant la tenue de l\u2019audience\n[174] J\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 que soit modifi\u00e9e la plainte contre l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel pour inclure trois cas de repr\u00e9sailles qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 commis au cours de l\u2019audience. En ce qui concerne le premier cas \u2013 l\u2019incident dans le \u00ab stationnement \u00bb \u2013 j\u2019ai tir\u00e9 une conclusion de fait selon laquelle M. Thambirajah a vraiment surgi devant le v\u00e9hicule de la plaignante, a regard\u00e9 sa plaque d\u2019immatriculation, puis a regard\u00e9 la plaignante, lui a souri ou fait une mimique, puis est parti. J\u2019ai aussi constat\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas gar\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame stationnement qu\u2019elle.\n[175] Que j\u2019applique ou non le crit\u00e8re d\u2019\u00ab intention \u00bb aux faits en cause, l\u2019issue serait la m\u00eame : M. Thambirajah a exerc\u00e9 des \u00ab repr\u00e9sailles \u00bb contre la plaignante pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte de harc\u00e8lement sexuel contre lui. Je suis convaincu que le comportement \u00ab volontaire \u00bb ou \u00ab t\u00e9m\u00e9raire \u00bb fait partie de \u00ab l\u2019intention \u00bb. En appliquant le crit\u00e8re objectif de la \u00ab personne raisonnable \u00bb, je conclus que M. Thambirajah \u00e9tait, \u00e0 tout le moins, indiff\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses actions dans le stationnement. Il \u00e9tait au courant des sentiments agit\u00e9s qu\u2019\u00e9prouvait la plaignante envers lui et du stress que celle-ci subissait, lesquels ont tous deux clairement \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9s lors de l\u2019audience. Il a donn\u00e9 des t\u00e9moignages contradictoires au cours de l\u2019audience sur l\u2019incident qui s\u2019est produit dans le stationnement. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas cr\u00e9dible ou plus fiable; j\u2019ignorais que croire de son t\u00e9moignage. J\u2019ai d\u00fb me rabattre sur le t\u00e9moignage corrobor\u00e9 de la plaignante et Mme Marshall.\n[176] \u00c0 ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de s\u2019ajoute l\u2019importance pour l\u2019administration de la justice que les parties et les t\u00e9moins se sentent en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans un proc\u00e8s ou une audience devant une cour ou un tribunal de justice. Les participants doivent s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ne pas \u00eatre la cible de menaces ou d\u2019intimidation, que ce soit implicitement ou autrement, pour les amener \u00e0 renoncer \u00e0 participer \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s ou \u00e0 une audience. Ainsi, un plaignant ne doit pas \u00eatre victime de repr\u00e9sailles ou de menaces pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en vertu de la LCDP. Je suis convaincu qu\u2019une personne raisonnable, qui examine objectivement ces faits, conclurait que M. Thambirajah s\u2019est comport\u00e9 ainsi dans le stationnement pour se venger de Mme Cassidy ou la punir parce qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre lui en vertu de la LCDP, y compris les autres choses qu\u2019elle a faites, comme le fait qu\u2019elle a port\u00e9 des accusations d\u2019agression sexuelle. M\u00eame si tel n\u2019\u00e9tait pas son \u00ab intention \u00bb en agissant ainsi, il savait que la plaignante pouvait les interpr\u00e9ter de cette fa\u00e7on et il ne s\u2019en est pas souci\u00e9 (ou arr\u00eat\u00e9 aux cons\u00e9quences probables de ses actions). Ses actions ont eu un impact n\u00e9faste sur elle ce soir-l\u00e0 et le lendemain \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus qu\u2019il a port\u00e9 atteinte aux droits de la plaignante en vertu de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP.\n[177] En ce qui concerne les deux autres all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles, j\u2019ai conclu, comme conclusion de fait, que ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements ne se sont pas pass\u00e9s comme la plaignante le pr\u00e9tend. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis incapable de conclure que M. Thambirajah a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre elle dans ces cas.\nB. Responsabilit\u00e9 vis-\u00e0-vis la plainte contre Postes Canada [178] La plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre Postes Canada repose principalement sur le fait que cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 fournir \u00e0 la plaignante un environnement de travail s\u00fbr et exempt de harc\u00e8lement. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise au courant de l\u2019incident de l\u2019attouchement et du commentaire survenu le 9 novembre 2005 le m\u00eame jour et n\u2019a rien fait pour y rem\u00e9dier. Elle a ensuite continu\u00e9 de ne pas r\u00e9gler correctement par la suite le conflit qui s\u2019intensifiait entre la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel. Bien que la Commission ait renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal au motif d\u2019une violation all\u00e9gu\u00e9e des articles 7 et 14 de la LCDP, les parties, dans leurs d\u00e9clarations (expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions), et la pr\u00e9sentation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et arguments (la plaignante n\u2019a pas fait d\u2019observations finales) \u00e0 l\u2019audience, ont port\u00e9 sur l\u2019article 14 seulement. Par cons\u00e9quent, je consid\u00e8re que la violation all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de l\u2019article 7 a \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e.\n[179] J\u2019ai tir\u00e9 de nombreuses conclusions de fait concernant ces questions. Je vais aborder la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 en analysant l\u2019application de la loi en ce qui concerne l\u2019article 65 de la LCDP \u2013 Responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019entreprise\/d\u2019autrui. Cet article pr\u00e9voit que \u00ab la personne, l\u2019organisme ou l\u2019association \u00bb peut se soustraire \u00e0 son application s\u2019il peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablit que l\u2019acte ou l\u2019omission, et que, par la suite, l\u2019acte ou l\u2019omission ne doivent pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme un acte ou une omission commis par la \u00ab personne, l\u2019organisme ou l\u2019association \u00bb s\u2019il peut \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9 :\n1) \u00ab que l\u2019acte ou l\u2019omission a eu lieu sans son consentement \u00bb;\n2) \u00ab qu\u2019il avait pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour l\u2019emp\u00eacher \u00bb;\n3) que, \u00ab par la suite, il a tent\u00e9 d\u2019en att\u00e9nuer ou d\u2019en annuler les effets \u00bb.\n[180] J\u2019ai tir\u00e9 des conclusions de responsabilit\u00e9 contre M. Thambirajah pour l\u2019incident de l\u2019attouchement et du commentaire survenu le 9 novembre 2005 et l\u2019incident des repr\u00e9sailles \u00ab du stationnement \u00bb qui s\u2019est produit en f\u00e9vrier 2010; ce dernier incident ne fait pas partie de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre Postes Canada. Une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intim\u00e9e peut uniquement \u00eatre tenue responsable en vertu de la LCDP pour avoir omis de fournir un milieu de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement dans les cas o\u00f9 une conclusion de harc\u00e8lement a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. L\u2019article 4 de la LCDP stipule qu\u2019un intim\u00e9 peut faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une ordonnance corrective pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 53 ou 54, s\u2019il est reconnu coupable d\u2019avoir commis un acte discriminatoire. En cons\u00e9quence, mon analyse ici portera sur les trois crit\u00e8res ci-dessus de l\u2019article 65 concernant ma conclusion contre M. Thambirajah pour l\u2019incident de l\u2019attouchement et du commentaire survenu le 9 novembre 2005.\nLe premier crit\u00e8re : le harc\u00e8lement a eu lieu sans le consentement de Postes Canada\n[181] Je suis convaincu que le harc\u00e8lement sexuel dont a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime la plaignante de la part M. Thambirajah, incident survenu le 9 novembre 2005, a eu lieu sans le consentement de Postes Canada. D\u2019abord, j\u2019ai tir\u00e9 une conclusion de fait selon laquelle Postes Canada n\u2019en avait pas eu vent avant que Mme Cassidy remette sa plainte \u00e9crite du 25 avril 2006 \u00e0 M. Tidman ce m\u00eame jour. Postes Canada a sign\u00e9 des dispositions de lutte contre la discrimination et le harc\u00e8lement, y compris des proc\u00e9dures pour r\u00e9gler lesdites plaintes, dans ses conventions collectives successives avec le STTP. Elle a mis en place de vastes politiques\/proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. J\u2019ai entendu des t\u00e9moignages au sujet de la formation qu\u2019ont re\u00e7us les gestionnaires et les travailleurs \u00e0 ce sujet. De plus, Postes Canada n\u2019avait aucun moyen de pr\u00e9venir les actes commis par M. Thambirajah. En fait, elle ne s\u2019attendrait pas \u00e0 un tel comportement de la part d\u2019un d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical.\n[182] La r\u00e9action que M. Tidman et Mme Edmunds ont eue en apprenant l\u2019incident du 25 novembre 2006 et les mesures qu\u2019ils ont prises par la suite illustrent \u00e0 quel point ils ont pris l\u2019affaire au s\u00e9rieux et r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que Postes Canada n\u2019accepterait ou ne tol\u00e9rerait jamais un tel comportement. Il ne fait aucun doute que ce genre de comportement est contraire aux politiques de lutte contre la discrimination et le harc\u00e8lement de Postes Canada et constitue un manquement aux responsabilit\u00e9s et aux obligations de M. Thambirajah en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9.\nLe deuxi\u00e8me crit\u00e8re : Postes Canada avait pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour emp\u00eacher l\u2019acte ou l\u2019omission\n[183] Les commentaires que j\u2019ai formul\u00e9s ci-dessus d\u00e9montrent aussi que Postes Canada avait pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour emp\u00eacher que se produisent de tels actes.\nLe troisi\u00e8me crit\u00e8re : Postes Canada a tent\u00e9 d\u2019en att\u00e9nuer ou d\u2019en annuler les effets\n[184] Postes Canada a pris beaucoup de mesures concr\u00e8tes en vue de respecter ce troisi\u00e8me crit\u00e8re, dont certaines sont all\u00e9es au-del\u00e0 des exigences de la LCDP. Cependant, il y avait beaucoup d\u2019autres exemples flagrants o\u00f9 elle a omis de respecter le seuil de diligence raisonnable pour r\u00e9gler l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005, pour lequel je dois conclure qu\u2019elle est responsable.\n[185] D\u2019abord, je vais aborder les mesures concr\u00e8tes. J\u2019aimerais, d\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu, f\u00e9liciter M. Tidman et Mme Edmunds pour les mesures qu\u2019ils ont prises. Ce sont les principaux gestionnaires de Postes Canada qui se sont occup\u00e9s de cette question. Parmi les choses qu\u2019ils ont faites pour [traduction] \u00ab att\u00e9nuer les effets \u00bb de l\u2019incident de harc\u00e8lement sexuel de novembre, pr\u00e9cisons les suivantes :\n1) M. Tidman a imm\u00e9diatement tent\u00e9 de communiquer avec Mme Edmunds, l\u2019agente responsable des droits de la personne;\n2) Ils ont tous deux fait preuve de compassion et de sensibilit\u00e9 face \u00e0 Mme Cassidy. M. Tidman a tent\u00e9 de savoir \u00e0 maintes reprises o\u00f9 en \u00e9tait l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Mme Edmunds a souvent parl\u00e9 avec elle, pour la r\u00e9conforter. Elle \u00e9prouvait de l\u2019empathie envers la plaignante, elle avait de la [traduction] \u00ab compassion \u00bb pour elle. J\u2019accepte son t\u00e9moignage selon lequel, [traduction] \u00ab Doris m\u2019avait touch\u00e9e droit au c\u0153ur \u00bb jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle demande ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite de la lecture de la plainte de mars 2007 que Mme Cassidy a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission;\n3) Mme Edmunds a elle-m\u00eame pris l\u2019initiative de proc\u00e9der au transfert de Mme Cassidy de Willowdale D \u00e0 Oshawa en octobre 2006. Je dis cela malgr\u00e9 le fait que M. Thambirajah avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre endroit \u2013 Unionville \u2013 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0;\n4) Le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate et les conclusions de Mme Edmunds \u00e9taient justes et raisonnables, bien que j\u2019aie certaines r\u00e9serves pr\u00e9cises ainsi qu\u2019il est indiqu\u00e9 ci\u2011dessous.\n[186] D\u2019autres mesures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9es de d\u00e9centes, r\u00e9fl\u00e9chies et att\u00e9nuantes, notamment celle d\u2019accorder \u00e0 Mme Cassidy deux semaines de \u00ab paye de vacances \u00bb et celle d\u2019alerter le service de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de veiller sur elle \u00e0 Oshawa. Ces mesures sont davantage une r\u00e9ponse au [traduction] \u00ab harc\u00e8lement continuel \u00bb dont s\u2019est plainte Mme Cassidy, que je n\u2019ai pas jug\u00e9 discriminatoire au titre de la LCDP en raison de mes conclusions de fait et\/ou de la loi. Cependant, il pourrait \u00eatre soutenu que ces mesures d\u2019att\u00e9nuation d\u00e9coulent de l\u2019incident qui est \u00e0 l\u2019origine du conflit, soit l\u2019incident de l\u2019attouchement et du commentaire du 9 novembre 2005, et visent \u00e0 le r\u00e9gler.\n[187] Qu\u2019est-ce qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour respecter les normes de la LCDP vis-\u00e0-vis l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005? Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, je vais me concentrer sur ce qui suit : la [traduction] \u00ab la com\u00e9die des erreurs et les malentendus \u00bb, pour reprendre les termes de Mme Edmunds. Il n\u2019y a pas de doute qu\u2019il y a eu un profond malentendu entre M. Tidman et Mme Edmunds entre le 25 avril et le 14 mai 2006. Il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019un malentendu volontaire, mais il s\u2019est n\u00e9anmoins produit et aurait pu \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9. Quelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019incidence de ce malentendu :\n[traduction]\n1) Le d\u00e9lai de dix jours pour imposer une mesure disciplinaire \u00e0 M. Thambirajah n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9. Quelle en est la port\u00e9e? D\u2019abord, si le d\u00e9lai avait \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9, la direction aurait pu appliquer la recommandation de Mme Edmunds formul\u00e9e dans son rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate du 1er septembre 2006, \u00e0 savoir imposer une [traduction] \u00ab suspension pour inconduite grave \u00bb de cinq jours sans solde \u00e0 M. Thambirajah. Cette mesure, assortie des autres recommandations disciplinaires, aurait d\u00fbment rem\u00e9di\u00e9 au tort qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Cassidy le 9 novembre 2005 et aurait envoy\u00e9 un message \u00e0 M. Thambirajah et aux autres employ\u00e9s, soit que le harc\u00e8lement sexuel en milieu de travail est un comportement jug\u00e9 vraiment inacceptable. Les employ\u00e9s\u2011plaignants, comme Mme Cassidy, \u00e9taient raisonnablement en droit de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que lesdites modalit\u00e9s de la convention collective n\u00e9goci\u00e9e entre Postes Canada et le STTP soient respect\u00e9es. En outre, les autres mesures disciplinaires recommand\u00e9es auraient pu \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es par Postes Canada, y compris celles qui ont eu lieu uniquement par voie de consentement de M. Thambirajah;\n2) Postes Canada aurait pu commencer l\u2019enqu\u00eate trois semaines plus t\u00f4t et la terminer plus t\u00f4t, au lieu de transmettre le rapport et les recommandations aux parties en septembre 2006. Le syndicat s\u2019\u00e9tait plaint, non sans raison, au sujet du d\u00e9lai en ao\u00fbt 2006. Le paragraphe 56.05 (enqu\u00eate) de la convention collective est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ainsi :\na) Lorsque la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7oit une plainte sign\u00e9e, elle entame une enqu\u00eate dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable et, dans tous les cas, s\u2019efforce de commencer l\u2019enqu\u00eate dans les trois (3) jours ouvrables suivant r\u00e9ception de la plainte.\nb) La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 veille \u00e0 ce que l\u2019enqu\u00eate soit effectu\u00e9e dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable.\n3) Postes Canada aurait d\u00fb r\u00e9agir plus t\u00f4t et demander \u00e0 Mme Cassidy si elle souhaitait \u00eatre mut\u00e9e temporairement \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la succursale Willowdale D, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 56.07 de la convention collective. Apr\u00e8s tout, lorsque Mme Cassidy a remis sa plainte \u00e9crite \u00e0 M. Tidman le 25 avril 2006, il (et par cons\u00e9quent Postes Canada) \u00e9tait au courant des r\u00e9centes altercations verbales et injures en avril survenues entre la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel, qui ont abouti \u00e0 la prise de mesures disciplinaires \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de tous les deux.\nQu\u2019est-ce qui aurait pu emp\u00eacher le malentendu\n[188] Je reconnais que [traduction] \u00ab les examens a posteriori sont plus faciles \u00bb. Cependant, il y a un avantage \u00e0 examiner la question, non seulement pour d\u00e9celer ce qui a fait fausse route, mais pour \u00e9viter que cela se reproduise. Parmi les pouvoirs que conf\u00e8re l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la LCDP au Tribunal figurent les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir les actes semblables dans les [traduction] \u00ab pratiques ult\u00e9rieures \u00bb.\n[189] Premi\u00e8rement, je reconnais que le malentendu est survenu entre deux personnes intelligentes et exp\u00e9riment\u00e9es. Deuxi\u00e8mement, le malentendu est attribuable \u00e0 une erreur humaine et favoris\u00e9 par la technologie ou l\u2019absence de technologie. Enfin, d\u2019autres circonstances ont contribu\u00e9 au malentendu, notamment l\u2019absence de Mme Edmunds du bureau pendant cette p\u00e9riode cruciale apr\u00e8s le 25 avril 2006. Ce malentendu aurait pu \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9 si M. Tidman avait express\u00e9ment indiqu\u00e9 dans son courrier \u00e9lectronique et les appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques effectu\u00e9s \u00e0 Mme Edmunds qu\u2019il communiquait maintenant avec elle concernant une all\u00e9gation non divulgu\u00e9e auparavant de harc\u00e8lement sexuel : \u00e0 savoir l\u2019incident de l\u2019attouchement et du commentaire du 9 novembre 2005, non pas au sujet des incidents li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9change de jurons et au langage inappropri\u00e9 survenus entre le 10 et le 19 avril 2006. Et, bien s\u00fbr, Mme Edmunds, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, aurait pu raisonnablement soup\u00e7onner, ou \u00e0 tout le moins disposer d\u2019un motif pour mener une enqu\u00eate, si son courriel et ses messages vocaux avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9rents, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que deux semaines (12 ou 13 avril) s\u2019\u00e9taient \u00e9coul\u00e9es depuis qu\u2019il l\u2019avait appel\u00e9e au sujet des incidents li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9change de jurons et au langage inappropri\u00e9.\n[190] L\u2019absence d\u2019un t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur ou d\u2019un num\u00e9riseur \u00e0 Willowdale D et d\u2019un \u00ab message automatis\u00e9 d\u2019absence \u00bb pour le compte de messagerie de Mme Edmunds a \u00e9galement contribu\u00e9 au malentendu. En outre, lorsque Mme Edmunds \u00e9tait absente, l\u2019enveloppe comportant la plainte du 25 avril que M. Tidman avait envoy\u00e9e est rest\u00e9e dans le bureau de Mme Edmunds pendant trois semaines sans que personne ne l\u2019ouvre. Elle n\u2019avait aucun adjoint ou rempla\u00e7ant pour r\u00e9gler les questions urgentes en son absence, ou, si une personne avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e, M. Tidman l\u2019ignorait.\nC. Participation du syndicat dans cette affaire [191] Le STTP n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 comme partie intim\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Par cons\u00e9quent, je n\u2019ai pas fait de conclusions d\u00e9favorables contre celui-ci, y compris la fa\u00e7on dont il a trait\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement formul\u00e9es par l\u2019un de ses membres contre un autre de ses membres, qui est d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical.\nVIII. Mesures de r\u00e9paration [192] Apr\u00e8s avoir conclu que les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre M. Thambirajah et Postes Canada \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es en partie, je passe maintenant \u00e0 la question de la r\u00e9paration en vertu de l\u2019article 53 de la LCDP. La LCDP et d\u2019autres lois antidiscriminatoires sur les droits de la personne visent \u00e0 \u00ab r\u00e9tablir un plaignant dans sa situation ant\u00e9rieure \u00bb, \u00e0 mettre cette personne dans une position dans laquelle elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 si elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination. La LCDP est une loi r\u00e9paratrice. Elle vise \u00e0 compenser, non pas \u00e0 punir un intim\u00e9. Cela dit, les facteurs aggravants (par opposition aux facteurs punitifs) et att\u00e9nuants sont pertinents le moment venu d\u2019accorder une indemnit\u00e9. La r\u00e9paration doit \u00eatre raisonnable et avoir un lien de causalit\u00e9 avec l\u2019acte discriminatoire dont a constat\u00e9 l\u2019existence.\nA. R\u00e9paration vis-\u00e0-vis la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre M. Thambirajah Indemnit\u00e9 pour acte \u00ab d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00bb et pour \u00ab pr\u00e9judice moral \u00bb : harc\u00e8lement sexuel\n[193] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 la jurisprudence suivante du Tribunal en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement sexuel concernant l\u2019indemnisation \u00e0 accorder pour le pr\u00e9judice moral dont la victime a souffert en raison de l\u2019acte discriminatoire, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $, et celle \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 titre d\u2019\u00ab indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale \u00bb pour les actes discriminatoires qui sont d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9s ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9s, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) et au paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP, respectivement. En plus de la jurisprudence que les parties ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, j\u2019ai examin\u00e9 les d\u00e9cisions suivantes : Woiden c. Lynn, 2002 CanLII 8171; Bushey c. Sharma, 2003 TCDP 21; Des Rosiers et al. C. Barbe, 2003 TCDP 24; Goodwin c. Birkett, 2004 TCDP 29; Mowat c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 31; Hunt c. Transport One Ltd., 2008 TCDP 23 et Naistus c. Chief, 2009 TCDP 4.\n[194] Je suis convaincu qu\u2019il est appropri\u00e9 d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la victime en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce une indemnit\u00e9 pour avoir subi un acte discriminatoire \u00ab d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00bb et \u00ab inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00bb. M. Thambirajah aurait d\u00fb savoir que le geste et le commentaire du 9 novembre 2005 \u00e9taient \u00ab non sollicit\u00e9s \u00bb par Mme Cassidy. Je crois qu\u2019il savait que ce comportement \u00e9tait indigne d\u2019un coll\u00e8gue et surtout, d\u2019un d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical. \u00c0 tout le moins, son geste et son commentaire constituaient du harc\u00e8lement sexuel \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de Mme Cassidy, un acte \u00ab t\u00e9m\u00e9raire \u00bb commis, sans tenir compte des cons\u00e9quences.\n[195] Ainsi, j\u2019accorde \u00e0 la plaignante une indemnit\u00e9 de 5 000 $ pour le pr\u00e9judice moral subi et une \u00ab indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale \u00bb d\u2019un montant de 2 500 $. J\u2019ai d\u00e9termin\u00e9 le montant apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es dans les cas de harc\u00e8lement sexuel pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s ci-dessus. Ici, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un seul \u00e9v\u00e9nement et le contact physique a \u00e9t\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e et de nature relativement moins s\u00e9v\u00e8re que dans d\u2019autres cas.\nIndemnit\u00e9 pour acte \u00ab d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00bb et pour \u00ab pr\u00e9judice moral \u00bb : repr\u00e9sailles\n[196] L\u2019interdiction d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles en vertu de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP constitue un type distinct d\u2019\u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb. Il n\u00e9cessite l\u2019examen d\u2019un type distinct de dommages sous la forme d\u2019une indemnisation. J\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t l\u2019importance que les plaignants puissent pouvoir d\u00e9poser une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission en vertu de la LCDP tout en pr\u00e9servant leurs droits en vertu de la LCDP d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019abri de toute discrimination et tout harc\u00e8lement sans crainte de repr\u00e9sailles. Cela est d\u2019autant plus important pendant le d\u00e9roulement de la proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, la violation de son droit \u00e0 \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9e contre les repr\u00e9sailles donne lieu \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 pour le \u00ab pr\u00e9judice moral \u00bb qu\u2019a subi Mme Cassidy. J\u2019estime aussi que M. Thambirajah a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre elle (p. ex., l\u2019incident du parc de stationnement) de mani\u00e8re \u00ab d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00bb ou \u00e0 tout le moins \u00ab inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00bb. Vu les incidents qu\u2019il a eus avec Mme Cassidy qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 l\u2019audience et qui sont survenus pendant l\u2019audience, il n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb se trouver \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 du v\u00e9hicule de la plaignante et de celle-ci apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience, et encore moins regarder la plaque d\u2019immatriculation, puis la regarder avec un sourire ou en faisant une mimique.\n[197] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, j\u2019accorde \u00e0 la plaignante une indemnit\u00e9 de 2 000 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral et une \u00ab indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale \u00bb d\u2019un montant de 500 $. Le montant refl\u00e8te l\u2019impact relativement limit\u00e9 que l\u2019exercice de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 titre d\u2019acte discriminatoire a eu sur la plaignante.\nAutres r\u00e9parations sollicit\u00e9es par la plaignante\n[198] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, la plaignante a demand\u00e9 que les r\u00e9parations additionnelles suivantes soient impos\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel : qu\u2019il soit renvoy\u00e9 de Postes Canada, ou encore, qu\u2019une mesure disciplinaire soit prise \u00e0 son \u00e9gard; qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab soit radi\u00e9 de tous ses comit\u00e9s syndicaux \u00bb et perde son poste \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical.\n[199] Il n\u2019est pas clair si j\u2019ai comp\u00e9tence pour accorder ces r\u00e9parations demand\u00e9es, vu l\u2019absence d\u2019observations sur ce point par les parties. Ceci est distinct de la question de savoir si ces r\u00e9parations auraient un lien de causalit\u00e9 appropri\u00e9 avec les actes discriminatoires relatifs au harc\u00e8lement sexuel et aux repr\u00e9sailles que j\u2019ai constat\u00e9s. En outre, le STTP n\u2019est pas partie \u00e0 cette proc\u00e9dure et aurait sans doute \u00e9t\u00e9 touch\u00e9 par lesdites r\u00e9parations qui ont trait \u00e0 la convention collective n\u00e9goci\u00e9e entre le STTP et Postes Canada. Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je refuse d\u2019ordonner lesdites r\u00e9parations.\nB. R\u00e9paration vis-\u00e0-vis la plainte contre Postes Canada [200] L\u2019avocat de Postes Canada soutient ce qui suit au paragraphe 88 de ses observations finales : [traduction] \u00ab Puisque Mme Cassidy n\u2019a formul\u00e9 aucune observation en ce qui concerne la r\u00e9paration, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 estime qu\u2019il est maintenant trop tard pour qu\u2019elle demande une r\u00e9paration \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du salaire ou une indemnit\u00e9 pour le pr\u00e9judice moral subi \u00bb. Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. M\u00eame s\u2019il est vrai que la plaignante n\u2019a pas fait d\u2019observations finales (pour les raisons \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es en d\u00e9tail dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision), Postes Canada (et M. Thambirajah) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9s des r\u00e9parations demand\u00e9es d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de la proc\u00e9dure, ainsi qu\u2019il est indiqu\u00e9 dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Il y a aussi une preuve abondante \u2013 de vive voix et documentaire \u2013 se rapportant aux r\u00e9parations demand\u00e9es, et sur laquelle M. Machelak a fait un contre-interrogatoire. En effet, l\u2019avocat de Postes Canada aborde le bien-fond\u00e9 de la r\u00e9clamation de la plaignante pour perte de salaire aux paragraphes 89 et 90 de ses observations finales.\nIndemnit\u00e9 pour acte \u00ab d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00bb et pour \u00ab pr\u00e9judice moral \u00bb\n[201] J\u2019ai soulign\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t dans la section Responsabilit\u00e9 mes conclusions tir\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de Postes Canada. Elles \u00e9taient li\u00e9es uniquement \u00e0 l\u2019incident de l\u2019attouchement et du commentaire du 9 novembre 2005. La r\u00e9paration doit donc correspondre au comportement discriminatoire reconnu comme tel \u2013 le \u00ab lien de causalit\u00e9 \u00bb. J\u2019ai aussi pris en compte les circonstances att\u00e9nuantes, y compris les nombreuses mesures concr\u00e8tes que Postes Canada a prises pour am\u00e9liorer la situation de la plaignante, surtout suivant les directives de Mme Edmunds. En outre, j\u2019ai tenu compte de l\u2019absence d\u2019intervention et des [traduction] \u00ab signaux contradictoires \u00bb envoy\u00e9s par la plaignante, notamment concernant la postulation ou la mutation \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de Willowdale D. De plus, je ne crois pas que Postes Canada ait viol\u00e9 les droits de la plaignante de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e; par cons\u00e9quent une telle indemnit\u00e9 ne sera pas accord\u00e9e. Je tiens \u00e0 ajouter que le simple fait que l\u2019employeur n\u2019ait pas exerc\u00e9 \u00ab toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires \u00bb ne signifie pas en soi qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00ab irresponsable \u00bb ou \u00ab volontaire \u00bb, donnant ainsi droit \u00e0 une telle indemnisation en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP.\n[202] En cons\u00e9quence et \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, j\u2019accorde une indemnit\u00e9 de 5 000 $ pour le \u00ab pr\u00e9judice moral \u00bb que Postes Canada a fait subir \u00e0 la plaignante. Le montant a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 en tenant compte du choc \u00e9motif et de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 que le manque de diligence raisonnable de Postes Canada a caus\u00e9s \u00e0 la plaignante.\nPerte de salaire\n[203] \u00c0 la fin du contre-interrogatoire de Mme Cassidy, celle-ci r\u00e9clamait une indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire pour 17 jours, entre le 12 avril 2006 et le 30 novembre 2007. Aucune r\u00e9clamation n\u2019\u00e9tait faite pour des jours entre le 9 novembre 2005 et le 11 avril 2006. Lors de l\u2019audience, la plaignante, \u00e0 la fois directement et par l\u2019entremise de sa repr\u00e9sentante, Mme Marshall, a clairement mentionn\u00e9 que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire qu\u2019elle demandait concernait Postes Canada et non M. Thambirajah.\n[204] Comme c\u2019est le cas en ce qui concerne les autres types de r\u00e9parations, une ordonnance quant au paiement d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 pour la perte de salaire doit \u00eatre li\u00e9e \u00e0 la violation des droits de la plaignante en vertu de la LCDP par Postes Canada. M\u00eame si je devais \u00e9valuer cette demande de r\u00e9paration particuli\u00e8re du point de vue du paragraphe 65(1) \u2013 c.-\u00e0-d. Postes Canada \u00ab prise \u00e0 la place de \u00bb M. Thambirajah \u2013 les jours vis\u00e9s par l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire devraient encore avoir un lien de causalit\u00e9 avec les actes discriminatoires constat\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de M. Thambirajah (c.-\u00e0-d. l\u2019incident de l\u2019attouchement et du commentaire du 9 novembre 2005 et l\u2019incident de repr\u00e9sailles). La premi\u00e8re journ\u00e9e vis\u00e9e par l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e \u2013 le 12 avril 2006 \u2013 correspond au jour o\u00f9 la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel se sont \u00e9chang\u00e9s des jurons et se sont parl\u00e9s avec un langage inappropri\u00e9. J\u2019ai conclu que Postes Canada n\u2019\u00e9tait pas responsable de ce comportement de la plaignante et de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel entre le 10 et le 19 avril 2006, et je n\u2019ai pas non plus conclu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel \u00e9tait responsable de ces incidents. En cons\u00e9quence, Postes Canada n\u2019est pas tenue d\u2019indemniser la plaignante parce qu\u2019elle a utilis\u00e9 un jour de vacances le 12 avril 2006.\n[205] Les 16 autres jours vis\u00e9s par l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 demand\u00e9e, entre le 15 novembre 2006 et le 30 novembre 2007, correspondent tous \u00e0 des jours apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9nonciation faite par Mme Cassidy le 25 avril 2006 de l\u2019incident du 9 novembre 2005. Ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pris, aux dires de la plaignante, \u00e0 la suite du stress et du [traduction] \u00ab harc\u00e8lement continuel \u00bb de la part de M. Thambirajah. Ils ne sont pas li\u00e9s aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments pour lesquels j\u2019ai conclu \u00e0 un manque de diligence raisonnable de la part de Postes Canada \u2013 par exemple, pour ne pas avoir respect\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai de mesure disciplinaire de 10 jours, ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 davantage proactive et avoir tent\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t de s\u00e9parer la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel, etc. Il n\u2019existe pas non plus de liens de causalit\u00e9 entre ces jours et les actes discriminatoires que j\u2019ai conclus que l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel avait commis ou ces jours ne sont pas \u00ab attribuables aux actes discriminatoires \u00bb. En cons\u00e9quence, je refuse de rendre une ordonnance d\u2019indemnisation contre Postes Canada pour ces pertes de salaire.\nLa plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel ne travaillant plus jamais ensemble\n[206] Afin d\u2019\u00e9viter que Mme Cassidy soit de nouveau victime de harc\u00e8lement ou de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de M. Thambirajah pendant qu\u2019ils occupent tous deux un emploi aupr\u00e8s de Postes Canada, j\u2019accueille la demande de la plaignante visant \u00e0 obtenir une ordonnance afin que Postes Canada veille \u00e0 ce que Mme Cassidy et M. Thambirajah ne soient plus jamais affect\u00e9s dans la m\u00eame succursale ou le m\u00eame bureau de service. Je suis convaincu qu\u2019une telle ordonnance entre dans le cadre du vaste pouvoir de redressement qui m\u2019est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 en vertu de la LCDP[1].\nSon propre trajet d\u00e9sign\u00e9 de livraison du courrier\n[207] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, la plaignante a demand\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance enjoignant Postes Canada de lui affecter un trajet d\u00e9sign\u00e9 de livraison du courrier. Voici ce qu\u2019elle a \u00e9crit : [traduction] \u00ab Je pense que je l\u2019ai m\u00e9rit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s ce que j\u2019ai d\u00fb endurer pendant les quatre derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, et j\u2019aimerais avoir la libert\u00e9 de choisir. \u00bb Je refuse d\u2019accorder cette r\u00e9paration puisqu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il existe un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre la r\u00e9paration demand\u00e9e et les actes discriminatoires au sujet desquels j\u2019ai tir\u00e9 une conclusion d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Postes Canada (ou de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre personnel plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment).\nC.

Le droit applicable et l\u2019analyse. 1\nI. La plainte et la demande d\u2019ajournement [1] Le 25 ao\u00fbt 2011, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a demand\u00e9, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi), que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) instruise la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Diane Carolyn Emmett (la plaignante) contre l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (l\u2019intim\u00e9e). La plaignante all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable dans le cadre de son emploi, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019on ne lui a pas accord\u00e9 les m\u00eames chances de perfectionnement et d\u2019avancement que celles qu\u2019on avait accord\u00e9 \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues masculins et \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s plus jeunes. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, elle soutient \u00e9galement que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait preuve de discrimination syst\u00e9mique \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des femmes en leur refusant des possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi. Elle pr\u00e9tend donc avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination du fait de son sexe et de son \u00e2ge, ce qui est contraire aux articles 7 et 10 de la Loi.\n[2] Le 26 septembre 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis de demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire concernant la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer la pr\u00e9sente affaire au Tribunal. Le 16 novembre 2011, elle a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal ajourne l\u2019instruction de la pr\u00e9sente affaire en attendant l\u2019issue de sa demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, de l\u2019appel connexe.\nII. Le droit applicable et l\u2019analyse [3] Aux termes du paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi, l\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. C\u2019est donc dire que, pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il convient d\u2019accorder un ajournement ou non, le Tribunal doit soupeser l\u2019objectif consistant \u00e0 r\u00e9gler en temps opportun les plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de faire preuve d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers toutes les parties et de donner \u00e0 ces derni\u00e8res la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leur position (voir Leger c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [1999] D\u00e9cision no 1, dossier du\nTCDP no T527\/2299, (26 novembre 1999), aux paragraphes 4 \u00e0 6 [Leger]; et Baltruweit c. Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, 2004 TCDP 14, aux paragraphes 12 \u00e0 17 [Baltruweit]).\n[4] Se fondant sur les d\u00e9cisions Leger et Baltruweit, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que, comme le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de ses propres proc\u00e9dures, il a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019ajourner une instance lorsqu\u2019il le juge appropri\u00e9, en tenant compte des principes de justice naturelle. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, elle soutient que l\u2019absence de d\u00e9cision sur le contr\u00f4le judiciaire nuit \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9parer sa d\u00e9fense contre les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante. Comme l\u2019enqu\u00eateur de la Commission a recommand\u00e9 que la plainte soit rejet\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle ne dispose pas de motifs \u00e9crits ad\u00e9quats dans lesquels la Commission expose le fondement du renvoi, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019est pas au courant des arguments pr\u00e9liminaires qu\u2019il lui faut r\u00e9futer et, de ce fait, elle ne peut pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 la plaignante une r\u00e9ponse valable, ce qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 par ailleurs le cas si des motifs avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis.\n[5] L\u2019argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne tient pas compte des r\u00f4les distincts que jouent la Commission et le Tribunal sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi. Pour ce qui est d\u2019une plainte de discrimination d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi, le r\u00f4le de la Commission consiste \u00e0 faire enqu\u00eate sur cette plainte et \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s\u2019il est justifi\u00e9 que le Tribunal l\u2019instruise (voir les articles 43, 44 et 49 de la Loi). Si la Commission demande que la plainte soit instruite, l\u2019article 50 de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal donne \u00e0 toutes les parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations. Cela \u00e9tant, l\u2019instruction du Tribunal se d\u00e9roule sans que ce dernier se fonde sur le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission ou sur les motifs de renvoi de la plainte. Dans chaque affaire dont le Tribunal est saisi, la partie plaignante doit \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination et, si cette preuve est \u00e9tablie, la partie intim\u00e9e a la possibilit\u00e9 de prouver que la discrimination en question n\u2019a pas eu lieu ou qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e selon la Loi. C\u2019est donc dire qu\u2019au moyen de l\u2019instruction du Tribunal, la partie intim\u00e9e sera mise au courant de la position de la plaignante et aura une possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter la sienne.\n[6] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait \u00e9galement valoir que, si la demande d\u2019ajournement est refus\u00e9e et si la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire est accueillie, l\u2019instruction du Tribunal deviendra nulle en droit et il y sera mis fin. Il s\u2019agirait donc d\u2019une d\u00e9pense inutile de ressources tant publiques que priv\u00e9es. De plus, elle fait remarquer que la plaignante a aussi d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux autres plaintes comportant des all\u00e9gations semblables et que ces plaintes se situent actuellement au stade de l\u2019enqu\u00eate devant la Commission. Il serait peut-\u00eatre donc avantageux pour toutes les parties que les trois plaintes soient instruites ensemble.\n[7] Ces deux arguments sont de nature conjecturale et ne soul\u00e8vent pas de questions de justice naturelle ou d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. \u00c0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019une question d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 quelconque, suivant le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi, l\u2019instruction de la plainte dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce doit se poursuivre de la mani\u00e8re la plus exp\u00e9ditive possible.\n[8] Pour ces motifs, il est justifi\u00e9 \u00e0 mon avis que le Tribunal rejette la demande d\u2019ajournement de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nShirish P.

La plainte [1] Le 8 juin 2011, en vertu du paragraphe 49(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H-6 (la Loi), la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a demand\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) d\u2019instruire les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par Stephen Closs (le plaignant) contre Fulton Forwarders Inc. (FFI) et Stephen Fulton (M. Fulton). Le plaignant affirme que FFI a commis des actes discriminatoires, en contravention des alin\u00e9as 7a) et 7b) de la Loi, pour des motifs de distinction fond\u00e9s sur la d\u00e9ficience et la situation de famille. Le plaignant affirme \u00e9galement que FFI ou M. Fulton ont commis un acte discriminatoire en contravention de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi, pour les m\u00eames motifs.\nII. La prevue du plaignant [2] Dans le contexte de l\u2019instruction de ces plaintes, une audience s\u2019est tenue le 2 f\u00e9vrier 2012 \u00e0 Cambridge, en Ontario. Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits au Tribunal. En plus des faits qui ont fait l\u2019objet de l\u2019entente, le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa version des faits qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu aux pr\u00e9sentes plaintes.\n[3] Le plaignant \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 comme camionneur par FFI. Situ\u00e9e \u00e0 Cambridge, en Ontario, FFI est une entreprise de camionnage qui livre des marchandises en Ontario et \u00e9galement entre l\u2019Ontario et le Qu\u00e9bec. En 2008, le plaignant travaillait sous la supervision de Terence Fulton, pr\u00e9sident de FFI, en tant que chauffeur suppl\u00e9ant, rempla\u00e7ant les chauffeurs malades ou en vacances. En f\u00e9vrier 2009, Stephen Fulton, chef des op\u00e9rations de FFI, a engag\u00e9 le plaignant comme chauffeur \u00e0 temps partiel. Le plaignant affirme que quand il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps partiel pour FFI, il effectuait principalement des quarts de jour. Il arrivait parfois qu\u2019on lui demande d\u2019effectuer des quarts de nuit en plus de ses quarts de jour. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019au fil du temps, ces demandes \u00e9taient devenues tellement fr\u00e9quentes qu\u2019il effectuait jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quatre quarts de nuit par semaine, en plus de sa journ\u00e9e de travail. Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir [traduction] \u00ab travaill\u00e9 dur \u00bb pour FFI pendant cette p\u00e9riode, effectuant de 60 \u00e0 70 heures de travail par semaine et n\u2019ayant que peu de temps pour dormir entre ses quarts de travail. Du 9 f\u00e9vrier 2009 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son dernier quart de travail pour le compte de FFI le 14 mai 2010, le plaignant relevait directement de Stephen Fulton et lui rendait directement compte de son travail.\n[4] Le plaignant a inform\u00e9 FFI qu\u2019il souffrait d\u2019une [traduction] \u00ab maladie \u00bb affectant sa vision. Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir dit aussi bien \u00e0 Terrence qu\u2019\u00e0 Stephen Fulton, au d\u00e9but de sa relation d\u2019emploi avec chacun d\u2019eux, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait atteint de la maladie de Jessner-Kanoff, forme de lupus. Le plaignant affirme que son lupus agit sur son syst\u00e8me nerveux et lui cause de la fatigue. Le plaignant a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019une partie des m\u00e9dicaments qu\u2019il prend pour se soigner affecte sa vision. Il doit ainsi passer un examen de la vue tous les six mois. Il lui arrivait de devoir s\u2019absenter du travail pour se rendre \u00e0 des rendez\u2011vous m\u00e9dicaux ou \u00e0 cause des effets secondaires des m\u00e9dicaments qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prescrits. Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019au d\u00e9but, FFI s\u2019adaptait \u00e0 la situation et faisait preuve de compr\u00e9hension \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des cong\u00e9s qu\u2019il devait prendre en raison de ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9. Le plaignant affirme que, du fait de son \u00e9tat, il a aussi demand\u00e9 \u00e0 emmener son ami, Tim Caskenette, dans ses parcours pour que ce dernier l\u2019aide \u00e0 rester \u00e9veill\u00e9. Le plaignant soutient que FFI \u00e9tait au courant du fait que Tim Caskenette l\u2019accompagnait dans son camion pour cette raison. En fait, le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 n\u2019avoir aucune raison de se plaindre des mesures d\u2019adaptation que FFI lui a accord\u00e9es \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[5] Sous le titre [traduction] \u00ab L\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de M. Closs \u00bb, au paragraphe 12 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits, il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le plaignant a inform\u00e9 M. Fulton qu\u2019il ne pourrait plus conduire la nuit et que FFI a acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 cette demande. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 FFI de ne plus lui attribuer de quarts de nuit. Comme il avait l\u2019impression que son horaire de travail jour\/nuit l\u2019\u00e9puisait, il a plut\u00f4t demand\u00e9 l\u2019autorisation de rentrer chez lui pour dormir entre ses quarts de travail ou une r\u00e9duction de son nombre d\u2019heures de travail. Le plaignant soutient \u00eatre all\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sugg\u00e9rer \u00e0 M. Fulton d\u2019engager un autre chauffeur afin de voir sa charge de travail r\u00e9duite.\n[6] En avril 2009, le plaignant et sa femme ont appris qu\u2019ils allaient avoir un enfant. Le 13 avril 2009, ou autour de cette date, la femme du plaignant s\u2019est rendue \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital pour y passer une \u00e9chographie. L\u2019\u00e9chographie a montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il se pr\u00e9sentait des complications, et la femme du plaignant a pris rendez-vous avec son m\u00e9decin plus tard ce jour\u2011l\u00e0 pour discuter de la nature de ces complications. Le plaignant \u00e9tait au travail quand il a appris que la grossesse pr\u00e9sentait des complications et qu\u2019un rendez-vous avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9. Il a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Fulton pour l\u2019aviser de la situation et lui faire part de son d\u00e9sir d\u2019accompagner sa femme \u00e0 son rendez\u2011vous. Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Fulton avait pris des dispositions pour acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le processus de chargement et de d\u00e9chargement de son camion, ce qui lui avait permis de terminer ses livraisons t\u00f4t et de quitter le travail pour aller au rendez\u2011vous.\n[7] Lors du rendez-vous, le plaignant et sa femme ont appris que cette derni\u00e8re avait perdu le b\u00e9b\u00e9 et qu\u2019elle devrait se rendre \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital afin d\u2019y recevoir un traitement. Comme le plaignant devait effectuer un autre quart de travail ce soir\u2011l\u00e0, il a appel\u00e9 M. Fulton pour discuter de la situation et demander \u00e0 prendre cong\u00e9 pour la nuit afin d\u2019accompagner sa femme \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital. Le plaignant affirme que cela lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9 et qu\u2019on l\u2019a menac\u00e9 de renvoi dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 il ne travaillerait pas. Le plaignant affirme que M. Fulton lui a dit quelque chose comme [traduction] \u00ab Tu as un travail \u00e0 faire \u2013 fais-le. \u00bb Le plaignant a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rester \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 la fausse couche se produirait, et il a dit \u00e0 M. Fulton qu\u2019il le rappellerait \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0.\n[8] Autour de minuit, le 14 avril 2009, la femme du plaignant a fait une fausse couche. Peu de temps apr\u00e8s, le plaignant affirme avoir rappel\u00e9 M. Fulton pour discuter de la situation et avoir demand\u00e9 quelques jours de cong\u00e9 pour faire le deuil de cette fausse couche avec sa femme. Le plaignant soutient que quand il a inform\u00e9 M. Fulton de la fausse couche, ce dernier lui a r\u00e9pondu quelque chose comme [traduction] \u00ab Dans ton int\u00e9r\u00eat, la premi\u00e8re chose que tu as \u00e0 faire c\u2019est de remonter dans ce camion et de prendre l\u2019autoroute parce que \u00e7a va te faire penser \u00e0 autre chose. \u00bb Le plaignant a compris que M. Fulton s\u2019\u00e9tait adress\u00e9 \u00e0 lui en ces termes parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait lui\u2011m\u00eame pass\u00e9 par une fausse couche et qu\u2019il y avait fait face de cette mani\u00e8re, mais le plaignant n\u2019avait pas l\u2019impression que le travail \u00e9tait la meilleure solution pour lui. Le plaignant affirme que, par la suite, on lui a refus\u00e9 tous les cong\u00e9s qu\u2019il a demand\u00e9s et qu\u2019on l\u2019a menac\u00e9 de cong\u00e9diement s\u2019il ne travaillait pas. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le plaignant, M. Fulton lui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 quelque chose comme [traduction] \u00ab Je vais devoir te renvoyer et embaucher un vrai camionneur parce que tu ne peux pas faire ton travail correctement. \u00bb Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant est all\u00e9 travailler.\n[9] En septembre 2009, le plaignant et sa femme ont de nouveau appris que cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait enceinte, de jumeaux cette fois. Le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2009, ou autour de cette date, la femme du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 hospitalis\u00e9e en raison de complications li\u00e9es \u00e0 sa seconde grossesse. Le plaignant travaillait quand il a appris que sa femme avait \u00e9t\u00e9 hospitalis\u00e9e. Le plaignant a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Fulton pour le mettre au courant de la situation et lui faire part de son d\u00e9sir de se trouver aupr\u00e8s de sa femme. Le plaignant affirme qu\u2019on lui a refus\u00e9 la permission de quitter son poste pour se rendre \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de sa femme. Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Fulton lui avait tenu des propos comme [Traduction] \u00ab C\u2019est une fausse couche, elle va s\u2019en remettre, contente\u2011toi de faire ton travail. \u00bb Pendant le quart de travail du plaignant, le vendredi 18 d\u00e9cembre 2009 ou autour de cette date, la femme du plaignant a fait une seconde fausse couche. Le plaignant affirme que, par la suite, il a de nouveau demand\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre quelques jours de cong\u00e9 pour faire le deuil de cette grossesse avec sa femme. Le plaignant affirme que M. Fulton lui a de nouveau fait savoir qu\u2019il serait cong\u00e9di\u00e9 s\u2019il ne venait pas travailler. Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant a effectu\u00e9 son quart de travail suivant, le lundi 21 d\u00e9cembre 2009.\n[10] Le vendredi 9 avril 2010, ou autour de cette date, le plaignant s\u2019est bless\u00e9 \u00e0 la jambe. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir gliss\u00e9 sur de la boue dans la cour de FFI, au moment de descendre de son camion. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 avoir essay\u00e9 de joindre M. Fulton les 10 et 11 avril afin de discuter de sa blessure et lui avoir laiss\u00e9 des messages. Le 11 avril 2010, M. Fulton a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au plaignant et ils ont parl\u00e9 de la blessure \u00e0 la jambe de ce dernier au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Au cours de cette conversation, le plaignant a dit \u00e0 M. Fulton qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas travailler parce qu\u2019il avait du mal \u00e0 marcher et qu\u2019il devait consulter son m\u00e9decin au sujet de sa blessure. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 que lors de cette conversation, M. Fulton lui avait demand\u00e9 de ne pas soumettre de formulaire \u00e0 la Commission de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 professionnelle et de l\u2019assurance contre les accidents du travail (CSPAAT) au sujet de sa blessure, et qu\u2019il l\u2019avait assur\u00e9 que FFI l\u2019indemniserait pour son temps de cong\u00e9. Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 la suite de cette conversation, il avait obtenu un certificat de son m\u00e9decin, qu\u2019il a remis \u00e0 M. Fulton, certificat selon lequel il devait prendre une semaine de cong\u00e9 pour permettre \u00e0 sa blessure \u00e0 la jambe de gu\u00e9rir.\n[11] Pendant sa semaine de cong\u00e9, le plaignant a de nouveau consult\u00e9 son m\u00e9decin au sujet de sa blessure, et ce dernier lui a recommand\u00e9 de prendre une autre semaine de cong\u00e9 pour permettre \u00e0 sa blessure de gu\u00e9rir. Le m\u00e9decin a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 un nouveau certificat, dat\u00e9 du 20 avril 2010, lequel pr\u00e9cisait que le plaignant devait s\u2019absenter du travail du 12 au 26 avril. Le plaignant a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Fulton pour lui faire savoir qu\u2019il devait s\u2019absenter pendant une autre semaine et qu\u2019il ne pourrait revenir au travail que le 26 avril 2010. Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Fulton avait alors exig\u00e9 qu\u2019il se rende \u00e0 la cour de FFI le 23 avril 2010 pour nettoyer son camion afin de permettre \u00e0 un autre chauffeur de le conduire en son absence.\n[12] Le 23 avril 2010, ou autour de cette date, le plaignant s\u2019est rendu \u00e0 la cour de FFI pour y rencontrer M. Fulton et nettoyer son camion. Le plaignant a alors remis \u00e0 M. Fulton le certificat m\u00e9dical dat\u00e9 du 20 avril 2010. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 avoir demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Fulton pourquoi, consid\u00e9rant qu\u2019il revenait au travail le 26, il devait nettoyer son camion. Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Fulton lui avait dit qu\u2019un nouveau chauffeur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 pour le remplacer et qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait plus de travail pour lui. Un relev\u00e9 d\u2019emploi (RE) dat\u00e9 du 23 avril 2010, sur lequel figurait le code D \u00ab Maladie ou blessure \u00bb, a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit \u00e0 l\u2019intention du plaignant. Sur ce RE, sous \u00ab Date pr\u00e9vue de rappel \u00bb, il est \u00e9crit \u00ab Date non connue \u00bb. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 ce stade, le ton de la conversation \u00e9tait mont\u00e9, et qu\u2019au cours de l\u2019\u00e9change, M. Fulton lui avait dit de [traduction] \u00ab profiter \u00bb des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi pour soigner sa [Traduction] \u00ab maladie \u00bb.\n[13] \u00c0 ce moment, le plaignant a compris qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait plus d\u2019emploi pour lui chez FFI; il se souvient toutefois du fait que M. Fulton lui a offert de le rappeler pour des remplacements, en cas de besoin. Pour cette raison, et comme il craignait que le fait de refuser du travail puisse mettre en p\u00e9ril sa demande de prestations d\u2019assurance\u2011emploi, le plaignant a effectu\u00e9 un autre quart de travail pour FFI, le 14 mai 2010, en remplacement d\u2019un chauffeur qui \u00e9tait malade. Par la suite, le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, du fait qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les pr\u00e9sentes plaintes, on lui avait d\u00e9conseill\u00e9 de retourner travailler pour FFI, parce que cela pourrait mettre en p\u00e9ril ses actions en justice et plaintes \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cette derni\u00e8re.\n[14] M. Tim Caskenette a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour le compte du plaignant lors de l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 susmentionn\u00e9, et comme M. Caskenette l\u2019a confirm\u00e9, ce dernier accompagnait le plaignant pendant ses trajets en camion afin de l\u2019aider \u00e0 rester \u00e9veill\u00e9. En dehors du fait que M. Caskenette ne se rappelait pas avoir vu le certificat m\u00e9dical et le RE changer de main le 23 avril 2010, son t\u00e9moignage a corrobor\u00e9 sa d\u00e9claration, qu\u2019il a affirm\u00e9 avoir pr\u00e9par\u00e9e tout seul, en se fondant sur ses propres souvenirs des \u00e9v\u00e8nements en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Dans l\u2019ensemble, le t\u00e9moignage de M. Caskenette est venu appuyer la version que le plaignant a donn\u00e9e des \u00e9v\u00e8nements ayant donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\nIII. Le Plaignant a-t-il \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination? [15] Dans les proc\u00e9dures intent\u00e9es devant le Tribunal, le plaignant doit \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Une preuve prima facie est \u00ab [\u2026] celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9. [\u2026] \u00bb (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 RCS 536, au paragraphe 28 (O\u2019Malley)). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait eu contravention aux alin\u00e9as 7a), 7b) et 14(1)c) de la Loi.\nA. Les all\u00e9gations du plaignant fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi [16] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement, le plaignant affirme que sa blessure au genou et son traitement pour le lupus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 des facteurs dans la d\u00e9cision de FFI de le cong\u00e9dier. Le plaignant a ajout\u00e9 que, consid\u00e9rant les commentaires que M. Fulton a formul\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa femme, sa situation de famille a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision de le cong\u00e9dier. Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant soutient avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination au travail fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience et sa situation de famille, en contravention de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi.\n[17] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects, de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu. Dans les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a), le plaignant doit \u00e9tablir un lien entre un motif de distinction illicite et la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019employeur de refuser de l\u2019employer ou de continuer de l\u2019employer (voir Roopnarine c. Banque de Montr\u00e9al, 2010 TCDP 5, au paragraphe 49). Cela \u00e9tant dit, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la discrimination constitue le seul fondement de la d\u00e9cision en cause. Il suffit que la discrimination soit un des facteurs qui ont jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision (voir Holden c. Chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [1990] A.C.F. n\u00b0 419 (C.A.F.) (Q.L.); et Khiamal c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), 2009 CF 495, au paragraphe 61).\n[18] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant a souffert d\u2019une blessure au genou, d\u00e9ficience physique qui a impos\u00e9 une limite fonctionnelle \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de conduire un camion. Dans les circonstances, je conclus que la blessure au genou du plaignant constituait une d\u00e9ficience physique au sens de la Loi (voir la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab d\u00e9ficience \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019article 25 de la Loi; et Desormeaux c. Ottawa (Ville), 2005 CAF 311, au paragraphe 15 (Desormeaux)). Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u du plaignant un certificat m\u00e9dical pr\u00e9cisant que ce dernier pouvait retourner au travail le 26 avril 2010, FFI a remis au plaignant un RE, dat\u00e9 du 23 avril 2010, dans lequel figurait le code D \u00ab Maladie ou blessure \u00bb. Ce RE constitue une indication du fait que le plaignant ne travaillait plus pour FFI en date du 23 avril 2010. En outre, FFI a engag\u00e9 un autre chauffeur pour faire le travail du plaignant et a fait savoir \u00e0 ce dernier que, bien qu\u2019il soit en mesure de revenir travailler une fois que son genou serait gu\u00e9ri, on ne ferait appel \u00e0 ses services que pour des remplacements (de chauffeurs malades ou en vacances). Cette situation est bien diff\u00e9rente des 60 \u00e0 70 heures de travail par semaine que le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 avoir faites sur une base r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. M\u00eame s\u2019il se peut que le plaignant n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9, on ne lui a plus offert le m\u00eame type d\u2019emploi qu\u2019il avait avant d\u2019\u00eatre bless\u00e9. Nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une situation similaire \u00e0 celle qui pr\u00e9valait dans Tanzos c. AZ Bus Tours Inc., 2007 TCDP 33, confirm\u00e9e par 2009 CF 1134, dans laquelle le Tribunal a conclu que le refus d\u2019un employeur de consentir au retour \u00e0 temps plein d\u2019une employ\u00e9e et le fait de ne lui offrir que du travail \u00e0 temps partiel, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une recommandation du m\u00e9decin selon laquelle cette employ\u00e9e ne devrait plus travailler de soir, constituait une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi. Compte tenu de la preuve du plaignant, je conclus que ce dernier a \u00e9tabli un lien entre sa blessure et la d\u00e9cision de FFI de lui d\u00e9livrer un RE et de ne plus lui offrir le m\u00eame type d\u2019emploi que celui qu\u2019il occupait avant d\u2019\u00eatre bless\u00e9.\n[19] M\u00eame si l\u2019\u00e9mission du RE r\u00e9sultait de la blessure \u00e0 la jambe du plaignant, ce dernier a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que d\u2019autres motifs discriminatoires ont pu jouer un r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision de FFI. Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que quand il lui avait remis le RE le 23 avril 2010, M. Fulton lui avait conseill\u00e9 de [Traduction] \u00ab profiter \u00bb des prestations d\u2019assurance\u2011emploi pour soigner sa [traduction] \u00ab maladie \u00bb. Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir inform\u00e9 FFI, tant Terence que Stephen Fulton, et ce d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait atteint de la maladie de Jessner\u2011Kanoff, forme de lupus. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le plaignant, il arrivait que ce lupus limite sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 conduire un camion. Pour faire face \u00e0 ses limites, il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre cong\u00e9 occasionnellement et \u00e0 \u00eatre accompagn\u00e9 par M. Caskenette lors de ses d\u00e9placements. Compte tenu de ce t\u00e9moignage, je suis convaincu que le lupus dont le plaignant souffre est aussi une d\u00e9ficience physique au sens de la Loi (voir la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab d\u00e9ficience \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019article 25 de la Loi; et Desormeaux, au paragraphe 15). FFI a soutenu que le plaignant ne lui a jamais fourni de documents m\u00e9dicaux, pas plus qu\u2019il n\u2019en a fourni au Tribunal, \u00e9tablissant qu\u2019il souffre de lupus, mais cette d\u00e9claration mise \u00e0 part, FFI n\u2019a pas r\u00e9fut\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration que le plaignant a faite devant le Tribunal selon laquelle il est atteint de lupus. FFI n\u2019a pas non plus avanc\u00e9 de raisons pour expliquer pourquoi les affirmations du plaignant selon lesquelles il souffre de lupus ne sont pas cr\u00e9dibles. Par cons\u00e9quent, compte tenu du t\u00e9moignage du plaignant concernant les commentaires formul\u00e9s par M. Fulton au moment o\u00f9 ce dernier lui a remis le RE, je conclus \u00e9galement qu\u2019il y a des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u2019un lien entre le lupus dont le plaignant souffre et la d\u00e9cision de FFI de ne plus continuer de l\u2019employer.\n[20] Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le motif de distinction de la d\u00e9ficience, tant en ce qui a trait \u00e0 sa blessure \u00e0 la jambe qu\u2019\u00e0 son lupus, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi.\n[21] En ce qui a trait aux commentaires que M. Fulton aurait faits au sujet de la femme du plaignant, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par ce dernier a montr\u00e9 que ces commentaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9s dans le contexte de ses demandes de cong\u00e9 cons\u00e9cutives \u00e0 chaque fausse couche. Le plaignant n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour \u00e9tablir que ces \u00e9v\u00e8nements et les commentaires qui en ont d\u00e9coul\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 de quelque mani\u00e8re des facteurs dans la d\u00e9cision de FFI de lui remettre un RE en avril 2010. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne vois pas de lien entre les commentaires que M. Fulton aurait formul\u00e9s au sujet de la femme du plaignant et les gestes pos\u00e9s par FFI en avril 2010.\nB. Les all\u00e9gations du plaignant fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi [22] Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que FFI lui a refus\u00e9 des mesures d\u2019adaptation quand sa femme a fait ses deux fausses couches. Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant affirme avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, en contravention de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi.\n[23] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects, de d\u00e9favoriser un employ\u00e9 en cours d\u2019emploi. Le terme \u00ab d\u00e9favoriser \u00bb renvoie au fait d\u2019op\u00e9rer une distinction ou de traiter quelqu\u2019un diff\u00e9remment (voir Gendarmerie royale du Canada c. Tahmourpour, 2009 CF 1009, au paragraphe 44 (Tahmourpour); modifi\u00e9e pour d\u2019autres motifs dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Tahmourpour c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2010 CAF 192 (Tahmourpour (CAF)); et Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 445, au paragraphe 254). Toutefois, toutes les distinctions ne sont pas discriminatoires; en anglais, la Loi met d\u2019ailleurs l\u2019accent sur le fait qu\u2019on doit \u00eatre en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une \u00ab diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable \u00bb (\u00ab to differentiate adversely \u00bb). D\u2019apr\u00e8s la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, \u00ab d\u00e9favorable \u00bb est un adjectif dont le sens ordinaire est pr\u00e9judiciable, dommageable ou mauvais (voir Tahmourpour, au paragraphe 44; voir aussi Tahmourpour (CAF), au paragraphe 12). Enfin, la \u00ab diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable \u00bb doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant affirme que FFI l\u2019a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 du fait de sa situation de famille.\n[24] Pour \u00e9tablir la port\u00e9e de la protection offerte contre la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e en faveur d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation ax\u00e9e sur le pr\u00e9judice subi par l\u2019individu, que ce dernier fasse clairement partie ou non d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie identifiable de personnes touch\u00e9es de semblable mani\u00e8re (voir B. c. Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne), 2002 CSC 66, au paragraphe 46 (B.)). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019objet de la Loi, \u00e0 l\u2019article 2, semble militer en faveur d\u2019une d\u00e9finition de la discrimination ax\u00e9e sur le pr\u00e9judice subi par l\u2019individu :\n[\u2026] le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations [\u2026]\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nLe Tribunal a clairement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, dans un contexte d\u2019emploi, l\u2019article 2 de la Loi \u00e9tait une reconnaissance manifeste, dans le contexte de la \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb, du droit et de l\u2019obligation d\u2019un individu de trouver un \u00e9quilibre entre ses exigences professionnelles et ses besoins familiaux, assortie de l\u2019obligation claire pour l\u2019employeur de rendre possible l\u2019atteinte de cet \u00e9quilibre et d\u2019accorder les mesures d\u2019adaptation n\u00e9cessaires (voir Brown c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re du revenu), 1993 CanLII 683 (TCDP), \u00e0 la page 20 (Brown)). En partant de ce principe, le Tribunal a reconnu que la port\u00e9e de l\u2019expression \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb pouvait \u00e9galement viser les t\u00e2ches et les obligations d\u2019un individu dans sa famille (voir Brown; Hoyt c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2006 TCDP 33 (Hoyt); Johnstone c. Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, 2010 TCDP 20 (Johnstone); et Seeley, Denise c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada , 2010 TCDP 23 (Seeley)).\n[25] La Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique a laiss\u00e9 entendre que seule une [traduction] \u00ab interf\u00e9rence s\u00e9rieuse \u00bb entre les exigences professionnelles et les besoins familiaux \u00e9tablira une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le statut de famille dans un contexte d\u2019emploi (voir Health Sciences Assoc. of B.C. v. Campbell River and North Island Transition Society, 2004 BCCA 260). Toutefois, le Tribunal et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ont rejet\u00e9 cette approche au motif qu\u2019elle fusionnait le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire de discrimination \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue et l\u2019analyse, \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, relative \u00e0 l\u2019exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, et au motif qu\u2019elle imposait une hi\u00e9rarchie des motifs de discrimination, le motif de la situation de famille \u00e9tant isol\u00e9 et devant faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une norme diff\u00e9rente et plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la preuve prima facie (voir Hoyt; Johnstone; Seeley; et Johnstone c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CF 36).\n[26] FFI a pr\u00e9tendu que les exigences visant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille \u00e9taient les suivantes :\n[\u2026] la preuve doit indiquer que la situation de famille comprend le fait d\u2019\u00eatre parent et les t\u00e2ches et obligations de cette personne comme membre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et que la plaignante \u00e9tait un parent qui devait remplir ces t\u00e2ches et obligations. La preuve doit aussi d\u00e9montrer que, en raison de ces t\u00e2ches et obligations ainsi que de la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019emploi impartial, la plaignante n\u2019a pas eu de chances de travail \u00e9gales et enti\u00e8res.\n[Johnstone, au paragraphe 55.]\nCompte tenu de ces exigences, FFI soutient que le plaignant ne peut \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 de parent; qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune r\u00e8gle de l\u2019employeur emp\u00eachant le plaignant d\u2019accomplir son travail de fa\u00e7on \u00e9gale et enti\u00e8re; et que la demande du plaignant visant \u00e0 \u00e9largir la d\u00e9finition de la \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle inclue les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a pour effet d\u2019\u00e9largir cette d\u00e9finition au\u2011del\u00e0 des limites \u00e9tablies par la jurisprudence, ce qui ne donnerait pas lieu \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable.\n[27] M\u00eame si les exigences d\u00e9crites dans la d\u00e9cision Johnstone sont instructives, elles ne peuvent pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es automatiquement \u00e0 tous les cas, de mani\u00e8re rigide ou arbitraire. Il faut plut\u00f4t examiner les circonstances propres \u00e0 chaque affaire pour v\u00e9rifier si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie, conform\u00e9ment au crit\u00e8re d\u00e9fini dans l\u2019arr\u00eat O\u2019Malley. J\u2019ajouterais que la Loi ne d\u00e9finit pas l\u2019expression \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb comme certaines l\u00e9gislatures provinciales ont choisi de le faire dans leurs textes l\u00e9gislatifs en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne (voir par exemple la d\u00e9finition d\u2019\u00ab \u00e9tat familial \u00bb au paragraphe 10(1) du Code des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario et l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(1)f) du Alberta Human Rights Act). Par cons\u00e9quent, le Parlement a investi le Tribunal de la responsabilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9finir l\u2019expression \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas non plus renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 des d\u00e9cisions restreignant la d\u00e9finition juridique de la \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb au fait d\u2019\u00eatre parent ou d\u2019\u00eatre dans une relation parent-enfant. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 susmentionn\u00e9, pour \u00e9tablir la port\u00e9e de la protection contre la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, il faut examiner le pr\u00e9judice subi par l\u2019individu, que ce dernier fasse clairement partie ou non d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie identifiable de personnes touch\u00e9es de semblable mani\u00e8re (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat B., au paragraphe 46).\n[28] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de la peine qu\u2019il a \u00e9prouv\u00e9e de ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent pour soutenir sa femme pendant et apr\u00e8s ses fausses couches. Il a \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 du chagrin qu\u2019il avait ressenti du fait de la perte des b\u00e9b\u00e9s et des effets que ces pertes continuaient d\u2019avoir sur lui. Pour ce qui est de la seconde grossesse en particulier, le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il se sentait aujourd\u2019hui encore bless\u00e9 de ne pas avoir pu \u00eatre aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de sa femme pendant et apr\u00e8s la fausse couche. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que ces exp\u00e9riences de fausses couches l\u2019avaient rendu craintif \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019attendre un autre enfant et qu\u2019il \u00e9vitait de fr\u00e9quenter les gens qui pouvaient attendre un enfant. Il affirme que le fait de ne pas avoir eu le temps de faire le deuil des grossesses l\u2019avait d\u00e9prim\u00e9, ce qui avait eu des r\u00e9percussions sur sa vie de famille. Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il cherchait maintenant \u00e0 suivre une th\u00e9rapie pour faire face \u00e0 ces probl\u00e8mes.\n[29] Dans leurs observations finales, les intim\u00e9s ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les d\u00e9clarations du plaignant t\u00e9moignaient clairement du fait qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 profond\u00e9ment touch\u00e9 par les fausses couches de sa femme. J\u2019en conviens, mais je crois que, compte tenu des circonstances, il convient mieux de parler des fausses couches comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 subies tout \u00e0 la fois par le plaignant et par sa femme, en tant que famille. La relation entre \u00e9poux est couverte par le motif de la situation de famille (voir la signification de \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb dans la d\u00e9cision Schaap c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 1988 CanLII 125 (TCDP), \u00e0 la page 27, infirm\u00e9e pour d\u2019autres motifs [1989] 3 C.F. 172 (C.A.); et dans l\u2019ouvrage des juges Walter Surma Tarnopolsky et William F. Pentney, Discrimination and the Law, vol. 2 (Toronto, Carswell, 2004) \u00e0 la page 9-3).\n[30] Quand sa femme a souffert de certaines complications li\u00e9es \u00e0 ses grossesses et qu\u2019elle a d\u00fb se rendre \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital, le plaignant a eu le sentiment d\u2019avoir l\u2019obligation familiale d\u2019\u00eatre aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de sa femme pour lui offrir r\u00e9confort et soutien. Quand sa femme a fait ses fausses couches, le plaignant a \u00e9galement eu le sentiment d\u2019avoir l\u2019obligation familiale de prendre cong\u00e9 afin de faire son deuil avec sa femme. Le plaignant affirme qu\u2019il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 FFI des cong\u00e9s pour s\u2019acquitter de ses obligations familiales, mais que cela lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9.\n[31] Le plaignant affirme qu\u2019en lui refusant des cong\u00e9s, FFI a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une distinction blessante entre les obligations familiales et professionnelles du plaignant. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessus, en emp\u00eachant le plaignant de s\u2019acquitter de ses obligations familiales, cette distinction a port\u00e9 pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 ce dernier. Selon le plaignant, aucun effort n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour lui permettre d\u2019atteindre un \u00e9quilibre entre ses obligations familiales et professionnelles. Au lieu de cela, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant, FFI ne voulait que s\u2019assurer que le plaignant fasse son travail, sans se soucier de ses obligations familiales. Pour cette raison, je suis convaincu que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, en contravention de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi.\nC. Les all\u00e9gations du plaignant fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi [32] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi. Le plaignant d\u00e9clare que Stephen Fulton l\u2019a harcel\u00e9 pendant tout le temps o\u00f9 il a travaill\u00e9 pour FFI, en contravention de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que M. Fulton a eu constamment recours \u00e0 un langage cru pour s\u2019adresser \u00e0 lui et lui donner des ordres; que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a refus\u00e9 de donner suite aux requ\u00eates raisonnables qu\u2019il a formul\u00e9es, sans m\u00eame les examiner ou lui donner d\u2019explication; et que l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019a fr\u00e9quemment menac\u00e9 de cong\u00e9diement dans le cas o\u00f9 [traduction] \u00ab il d\u00e9ciderait d\u2019exercer ses droits pr\u00e9vus par la loi \u00bb ou quand le plaignant a fait part de ses doutes au sujet de la conformit\u00e9 des pratiques de son employeur aux r\u00e8gles en mati\u00e8re d\u2019heures de travail. Le plaignant a ajout\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a syst\u00e9matiquement fait fi de la gravit\u00e9 des fausses couches ou des r\u00e9percussions cumulatives qu\u2019elles ont eues sur lui. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, en plus des commentaires que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a formul\u00e9s au moment o\u00f9 les fausses couches se sont produites, le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement formul\u00e9 ce commentaire : [traduction] \u00ab peut-\u00eatre que si tu te d\u00e9barrassais de ta femme, tu pourrais travailler plus et tu n\u2019aurais plus \u00e0 penser \u00e0 rentrer chez toi pour passer du temps avec elle. \u00bb Le plaignant a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019une discussion au sujet de son lupus, M. Fulton lui a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de questionner son m\u00e9decin au sujet de la prise de marijuana \u00e0 des fins m\u00e9dicales.\n[33] Au sens de l\u2019article 14 de la Loi, le harc\u00e8lement a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9fini comme une conduite non sollicit\u00e9e, dirig\u00e9e contre une autre personne et fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite. Par d\u00e9finition, un acte de harc\u00e8lement exige la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de persistance ou de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition; toutefois, plus la conduite est grave et ses cons\u00e9quences manifestes, moins la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition sera exig\u00e9e. La gravit\u00e9 de la conduite reproch\u00e9e est \u00e9valu\u00e9e selon la norme de la personne raisonnable dans les m\u00eames circonstances (voir les d\u00e9cisions Janzen c. Platy enterprises ltd., [1989] 1 RCS 1252; et Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es), [1999] 3 CF 653).\n[34] En ce qui a trait aux all\u00e9gations de recours \u00e0 un langage cru et aux menaces relatives aux droits pr\u00e9vus par la loi et aux heures de travail, le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e9taient li\u00e9s \u00e0 un motif de distinction illicite. J\u2019ajouterais que les all\u00e9gations du plaignant concernant ses obligations familiales ont fait l\u2019objet de l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) ci\u2011dessus ; et, en dehors des raisons qui ont pouss\u00e9 FFI \u00e0 \u00e9mettre un RE, le plaignant \u00e0 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait aucune plainte \u00e0 formuler \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la conduite de FFI relativement \u00e0 son lupus.\n[35] Au sujet du commentaire formul\u00e9 par M. Fulton au sujet de la prise de marijuana \u00e0 des fins m\u00e9dicales, le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas certain de savoir si ce commentaire \u00e9tait une v\u00e9ritable suggestion ou une simple boutade. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que les commentaires relatifs \u00e0 la marijuana avaient persist\u00e9 au\u2011del\u00e0 d\u2019un incident isol\u00e9 ou que la gravit\u00e9 du commentaire isol\u00e9 \u00e9tait telle qu\u2019il constituait en soi du harc\u00e8lement.\n[36] Je conclus \u00e9galement qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il y a eu harc\u00e8lement sur le fondement de l\u2019all\u00e9gation du plaignant selon laquelle M. Fulton a syst\u00e9matiquement fait fi de la gravit\u00e9 des fausses couches ou de leurs r\u00e9percussions cumulatives. Le plaignant a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 les commentaires formul\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9 au moment o\u00f9 les fausses couches ont eu lieu; toutefois, il n\u2019y a que tr\u00e8s peu d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve montrant qu\u2019il y a eu un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de persistance dans ces commentaires en dehors des moments o\u00f9 le plaignant a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre cong\u00e9. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait formul\u00e9 un commentaire additionnel selon lequel le plaignant devrait se d\u00e9barrasser de sa femme, mais il n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 quand et dans quel contexte ce commentaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9, ou s\u2019il avait continu\u00e9 de recevoir ce type de commentaire apr\u00e8s cet incident isol\u00e9.\n[37] La persistance mise \u00e0 part, je conclus que la gravit\u00e9 des commentaires ne suffit pas \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il y a eu harc\u00e8lement. Les commentaires pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s de M. Fulton ont trait au fait que le plaignant devait s\u2019acquitter de ses obligations professionnelles. M\u00eame si une telle priorit\u00e9 t\u00e9moigne d\u2019une certaine insensibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la situation du plaignant et de ses obligations familiales, le plaignant n\u2019a pas laiss\u00e9 entendre que ces commentaires en tant que tels l\u2019avaient s\u00e9rieusement touch\u00e9. Je comprends plut\u00f4t du t\u00e9moignage du plaignant que c\u2019est le refus de lui accorder des cong\u00e9s en tant que tel qui lui a caus\u00e9 pr\u00e9judice lorsqu\u2019il a d\u00fb faire face aux fausses couches. J\u2019ajouterais que le plaignant a reconnu que les commentaires formul\u00e9s par M. Fulton au sujet des fausses couches avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9s par le fait qu\u2019il avait d\u00fb lui aussi faire face \u00e0 une fausse couche. Pour faire face \u00e0 sa peine, M. Fulton avait choisi de travailler pour se changer les id\u00e9es. M\u00eame si le plaignant a trouv\u00e9 qu\u2019une telle strat\u00e9gie ne lui convenait pas, et qu\u2019il se peut que M. Fulton ait fait preuve d\u2019insensibilit\u00e9 en incitant le plaignant \u00e0 adopter la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on de faire, je conclus que cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment met les commentaires de M. Fulton en perspective et appuient ma conclusion selon laquelle la gravit\u00e9 de ces commentaires ne suffit pas \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il y a eu harc\u00e8lement.\n[38] Compte tenu des motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, je conclus que le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie pour l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi.\nIV. La Preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [39] Pour les raisons susmentionn\u00e9es, j\u2019ai conclu que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, pour l\u2019application des alin\u00e9as 7a) et 7b) de la Loi, fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience et la situation de famille. Une fois qu\u2019un plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer que la discrimination prima facie n\u2019a pas eu lieu comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9, ou que la conduite en cause peut se justifier au regard de la Loi.\n[40] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, Stephen Fulton a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour le compte de FFI.\nA. La r\u00e9ponse aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination prima facie fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi [41] M. Fulton a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9, avant de se blesser au genou, qu\u2019un autre chauffeur partagerait sa charge de travail. D\u2019apr\u00e8s M. Fulton, la d\u00e9cision d\u2019embaucher un autre chauffeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise apr\u00e8s que le plaignant a fait savoir qu\u2019il ne pouvait plus conduire la nuit en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9. M. Fulton a affirm\u00e9 que le plaignant avait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9, en avril 2010, du fait que FFI avait vu son volume de travail de jour diminuer consid\u00e9rablement et qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait plus suffisamment de travail pour le plaignant, compte tenu de son impossibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 conduire la nuit.\n[42] D\u2019apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de M. Fulton, le plaignant lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre bless\u00e9 au genou pour l\u2019informer qu\u2019il avait gliss\u00e9 dans la cour. M. Fulton affirme que le plaignant lui a d\u2019abord dit qu\u2019il lui faudrait six mois pour gu\u00e9rir de sa blessure. M. Fulton ajoute avoir offert au plaignant de pr\u00e9senter une demande \u00e0 la CSPAAT; mais le plaignant lui a r\u00e9pondu de ne pas s\u2019en faire et qu\u2019il dirait qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait bless\u00e9 chez lui. M. Fulton pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019au cours de leur conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, ils ont \u00e9galement discut\u00e9 de l\u2019option consistant \u00e0 demander des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi pour compenser le fait que le plaignant devait prendre cong\u00e9.\n[43] La rencontre qui a eu lieu dans la cour le 23 avril 2010 s\u2019est tenue \u00e0 la demande du plaignant, lequel souhaitait r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer les effets personnels qu\u2019il avait laiss\u00e9s dans son camion, alors conduit par un autre chauffeur. M. Fulton affirme que quand le plaignant s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans la cour le 23 avril 2010, il boitait et semblait beaucoup souffrir. Le plaignant avait fourni \u00e0 M. Fulton un certificat dat\u00e9 du 20 avril 2010 dans lequel il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le plaignant serait incapable de travailler pendant la p\u00e9riode allant du 12 au 26 avril 2010, mais M. Fulton a demand\u00e9 un nouveau certificat, plus pr\u00e9cis, en plus de ce premier certificat succinct. D\u2019apr\u00e8s M. Fulton, le plaignant a refus\u00e9 de fournir un autre certificat en raison des co\u00fbts associ\u00e9s \u00e0 une telle d\u00e9marche.\n[44] Dans l\u2019ensemble, M. Fulton a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les raisons pour lesquelles il a produit le RE \u00e9taient que le plaignant l\u2019avait inform\u00e9 que sa [traduction] \u00ab maladie \u00bb ne lui permettrait plus de conduire la nuit et que le volume de travail de jour de FFI diminuait de beaucoup. M. Fulton a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir dit au plaignant : [traduction] \u00ab tu dois faire face \u00e0 ta maladie \u00bb, et avoir ajout\u00e9 que FFI n\u2019offrait pas de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e, mais que l\u2019Assurance\u2011emploi pouvait lui fournir ce genre de prestations. Dans ses observations finales, au paragraphe 31, FFI a ajout\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nCompte tenu du manque de travail, du fait que M. Closs n\u2019a pas fourni de certificat m\u00e9dical concernant [un] retour au travail, de ses avis r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s au sujet d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de probl\u00e8mes d\u2019ordre m\u00e9dical et de l\u2019absence de prestations d\u2019assurance-invalidit\u00e9, M. Fulton a inform\u00e9 M. Closs qu\u2019il pourrait obtenir des prestations d\u2019assurance\u2011emploi et que cela lui permettrait d\u2019avoir du temps pour aller \u00e0 ses rendez-vous m\u00e9dicaux et se soigner.\n[45] FFI soutient ne pas avoir cong\u00e9di\u00e9 le plaignant. Elle fait plut\u00f4t remarquer qu\u2019un RE n\u2019est pas un avis de cong\u00e9diement et que, apr\u00e8s que le RE a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis, le plaignant s\u2019est vu offrir plusieurs quarts de travail en mai 2010. Apr\u00e8s le quart de travail qu\u2019il a effectu\u00e9 le 14 mai 2010, le plaignant n\u2019est plus revenu au travail.\n[46] M\u00eame s\u2019il est possible que le plaignant n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 au moment o\u00f9 le RE a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis, FFI n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019\u00e0 partir de ce moment, elle n\u2019a plus employ\u00e9 le plaignant de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re qu\u2019avant. M\u00eame si le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de chauffeur \u00e0 temps partiel, il lui arrivait de travailler jusqu\u2019\u00e0 70 heures par semaine; apr\u00e8s que le RE a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis, on lui a seulement offert d\u2019effectuer des remplacements, quand d\u2019autres chauffeurs \u00e9taient malades ou s\u2019absentaient du travail.\n[47] Il est curieux qu\u2019en d\u00e9pit du fait que FFI ait demand\u00e9 un autre certificat m\u00e9dical au sujet de la blessure \u00e0 la jambe du plaignant et des possibles r\u00e9percussions de cette blessure sur la capacit\u00e9 du plaignant \u00e0 conduire un camion, elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 encore dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 ce que le plaignant travaille pour elle dans les cas o\u00f9 il lui faudrait un chauffeur de remplacement. Dans ces circonstances, sans que le plaignant ait fourni un autre certificat m\u00e9dical attestant que sa blessure \u00e0 la jambe \u00e9tait gu\u00e9rie, FFI a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce dernier d\u2019effectuer d\u2019autres quarts de travail en mai 2010. Par cons\u00e9quent, je n\u2019accepte pas le fait que le refus du plaignant de fournir un autre certificat m\u00e9dical au sujet de sa blessure ait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision de FFI d\u2019\u00e9mettre un RE. Je n\u2019accepte pas non plus le fait que le RE ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis afin de permettre au plaignant de pr\u00e9senter une demande de prestations d\u2019assurance\u2011emploi au motif que FFI n\u2019offrait pas de prestations d\u2019assurance-invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 court terme. Cela n\u2019est pas cr\u00e9dible, consid\u00e9rant que le RE est dat\u00e9 du 23 avril 2010 et que le plaignant s\u2019est absent\u00e9 du travail \u00e0 compter du 12 avril 2010; en outre, le RE est incompatible avec le fait que le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Fulton un certificat m\u00e9dical selon lequel il pouvait retourner travailler.\n[48] M\u00eame si les circonstances ayant donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9mission du RE \u00e9taient li\u00e9es \u00e0 la demande de cong\u00e9 du plaignant cons\u00e9cutive \u00e0 sa blessure \u00e0 la jambe, M. Fulton a lui\u2011m\u00eame admis que la d\u00e9cision de FFI d\u2019\u00e9mettre le RE s\u2019expliquait avant tout par la [traduction] \u00ab maladie \u00bb dont le plaignant souffrait ainsi que par l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de FFI d\u2019offrir des mesures d\u2019adaptation en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la demande du plaignant de ne plus conduire la nuit. C\u2019est ce que confirment les observations finales des intim\u00e9s, dans lesquelles on peut lire : [traduction] \u00ab Compte tenu [...] de ses avis r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s au sujet d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de probl\u00e8mes d\u2019ordre m\u00e9dical [...] [l\u2019]assurance\u2011emploi [...] lui permettrait d\u2019avoir du temps pour aller \u00e0 ses rendez-vous m\u00e9dicaux et se soigner \u00bb. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Fulton a \u00e9galement admis avoir nourri quelques craintes au sujet du fait que le plaignant abusait peut-\u00eatre de ses cong\u00e9s, mais il a dit ne pas avoir fait part de ces craintes \u00e0 celui\u2011ci. On peut conclure de ces d\u00e9clarations que FFI ne croyait pas que la demande de cong\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant en avril 2010 \u00e9tait li\u00e9e \u00e0 sa blessure \u00e0 la jambe, ou que FFI n\u2019\u00e9tait tout simplement pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 accepter d\u2019autres demandes de cong\u00e9 de la part du plaignant. C\u2019est ce que confirme le fait que FFI ait \u00e9mis un RE en d\u00e9pit du fait que le plaignant ait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un certificat m\u00e9dical selon lequel il \u00e9tait en mesure de retourner au travail.\n[49] En d\u00e9pit des raisons qui ont pouss\u00e9 M. Fulton \u00e0 \u00e9mettre le RE, FFI pr\u00e9tend que le plaignant n\u2019a jamais fourni de documents, que ce soit \u00e0 FFI ou au Tribunal, pour \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il souffrait de lupus. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 susmentionn\u00e9, en dehors de cette d\u00e9claration, FFI n\u2019a pas r\u00e9fut\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration du plaignant selon laquelle il \u00e9tait atteint de lupus devant le Tribunal. J\u2019ajouterais que, nonobstant l\u2019absence de documents m\u00e9dicaux, FFI a accept\u00e9 le fait que le plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tait plus en mesure de travailler la nuit et que, compte tenu de cette restriction et de la diminution du volume de travail de jour, FFI ne pouvait pas offrir de mesures d\u2019adaptation au plaignant. M\u00eame s\u2019il est vrai que le plaignant a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ne plus conduire la nuit du fait de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, ce que le plaignant nie, une fois que la demande de prise de mesure d\u2019adaptation a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, FFI avait le devoir d\u2019obtenir toutes les informations pertinentes relatives \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant et d\u2019examiner s\u00e9rieusement des mani\u00e8res de lui offrir ces mesures d\u2019adaptation (voir les d\u00e9cisions Adga Group Consultants Inc. v. Lane, 91 OR (3d) 649 (C. sup. Ont.), au paragraphe 160; et Colombie\u2011Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 RCS 3, aux paragraphes 64 \u00e0 66 (Meiorin)). Vu que FFI n\u2019a jamais demand\u00e9 de documents m\u00e9dicaux attestant du fait que le plaignant \u00e9tait atteint de lupus, je ne peux pas accepter qu\u2019elle a s\u00e9rieusement examin\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de fournir \u00e0 ce dernier des mesures d\u2019adaptation en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la demande qu\u2019il aurait faite de ne plus travailler la nuit. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas non plus pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9tablissant que la mise en place de mesures d\u2019adaptation en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la demande du plaignant de ne plus conduire la nuit aurait constitu\u00e9 une contrainte excessive pour FFI. En fait, FFI n\u2019a jamais pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) et le paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi pour essayer de justifier sa conduite.\n[50] Compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments susmentionn\u00e9s, je conclus que la d\u00e9cision de FFI d\u2019\u00e9mettre un RE constitue un acte discriminatoire. Au lieu d\u2019examiner s\u00e9rieusement la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019offrir des mesures d\u2019adaptation au plaignant apr\u00e8s que celui-ci s\u2019est bless\u00e9 \u00e0 la jambe, FFI a remplac\u00e9 le plaignant par un autre chauffeur, soit parce qu\u2019elle ne le croyait pas, soit parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 accepter sa demande de cong\u00e9. Je prends acte du t\u00e9moignage de M. Fulton, qui a affirm\u00e9 que FFI \u00e9tait une petite entreprise et que l\u2019industrie du camionnage pr\u00e9sentait des d\u00e9fis uniques en ce concerne les mesures d\u2019adaptation qu\u2019il faut s\u2019efforcer d\u2019accorder aux employ\u00e9s; toutefois, ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s en parall\u00e8le avec \u00ab [\u2026] les capacit\u00e9s uniques ainsi que la valeur et la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rentes de chaque personne, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela n\u2019impose aucune contrainte excessive \u00bb (Meiorin, au paragraphe 62). Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 susmentionn\u00e9, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce n\u2019appuient pas la d\u00e9cision de FFI d\u2019\u00e9mettre le RE et de ne plus continuer d\u2019employer le plaignant en temps que chauffeur \u00e0 temps partiel.\n[51] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que FFI n\u2019a pas fourni d\u2019explication ou de justification satisfaisante \u00e0 sa conduite discriminatoire prima facie, qui a consist\u00e9 \u00e0 refuser de continuer d\u2019employer le plaignant du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience, tant en ce qui concerne sa blessure \u00e0 la jambe que son lupus, en contravention de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi.\nB. La r\u00e9ponse aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination prima facie fonde\u00e9s sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi [52] M. Fulton a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que quand le plaignant l\u2019a avis\u00e9 de l\u2019hospitalisation de sa femme le 13 avril 2009, c\u2019\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019il entendait parler du fait que le plaignant attendait un enfant. Le plaignant \u00e9tait alors en route pour effectuer une livraison et des dispositions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises pour lui permettre de retourner plus rapidement \u00e0 son point d\u2019attache. Apr\u00e8s la fausse couche de la femme du plaignant, ce dernier et M. Fulton ont discut\u00e9 du retour au travail du plaignant par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. M. Fulton a affirm\u00e9 que pour faire preuve de sensibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la situation, il avait dit au plaignant qu\u2019il fallait se tenir l\u2019esprit occup\u00e9 et que le temps gu\u00e9rissait les blessures, et il avait \u00e9voqu\u00e9 sa propre exp\u00e9rience d\u2019une fausse couche. M. Fulton a ni\u00e9 n\u2019avoir pas tenu compte de la situation ou des sentiments du plaignant. D\u2019apr\u00e8s M. Fulton, le plaignant n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre cong\u00e9 apr\u00e8s les fausses couches, mais il a plut\u00f4t d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer moins d\u2019heures de travail, pour continuer \u00e0 gagner un revenu, \u00e0 des moments o\u00f9 sa femme se reposait et o\u00f9 d\u2019autres membres de la famille \u00e9taient disponibles pour aider celle\u2011ci.\n[53] Les feuilles de route du plaignant pour la p\u00e9riode allant du 4 au 17 avril 2009 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal au cours du t\u00e9moignage de M. Fulton. Les feuilles de route, qui sont remplies par le chauffeur du camion, font \u00e9tat des informations relatives au trajet, y compris les dates de d\u00e9part et d\u2019arriv\u00e9e, les lieux de chargement et de livraison de la marchandise et le nombre de kilom\u00e8tres parcourus pour un jour donn\u00e9. M. Fulton se souvenait que le 14 avril 2009, le plaignant \u00e9tait all\u00e9 travailler t\u00f4t le matin parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait all\u00e9 voir sa femme \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital le soir pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. D\u2019apr\u00e8s M. Fulton, des dispositions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises pour que le plaignant effectue une livraison et retourne ensuite directement \u00e0 la cour de FFI. Le plaignant a ensuite effectu\u00e9 un quart de travail le 15 avril 2009, lequel s\u2019est achev\u00e9 le jour suivant, le 16 avril 2009, \u00e0 Bowmanville, en Ontario. D\u2019apr\u00e8s M. Fulton, le plaignant a commenc\u00e9 son quart de travail tard le 15 avril 2009, parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 avec sa femme jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que d\u2019autres membres de la famille puissent tenir compagnie \u00e0 celle\u2011ci. Le 16 avril 2009, au d\u00e9part de Bowmanville, le plaignant est all\u00e9 prendre un chargement \u00e0 Etobicoke. D\u2019apr\u00e8s M. Fulton, comme la femme du plaignant ne se sentait pas bien, des dispositions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises pour exp\u00e9dier le chargement du camion du plaignant \u00e0 Etobicoke, pour permettre \u00e0 ce dernier de revenir rapidement \u00e0 la cour de FFI. M. Fulton a ajout\u00e9 que le plaignant n\u2019a pas travaill\u00e9 le soir du 16 avril 2009. M. Fulton a cru que, le 17 avril 2009, le plaignant avait travaill\u00e9 pendant que sa femme dormait.\n[54] D\u2019apr\u00e8s M. Fulton, \u00e0 la suite de la premi\u00e8re fausse couche, le plaignant ne s\u2019est pas plaint de sa conduite ou du fait qu\u2019il devait travailler. M. Fulton se souvient que le plaignant lui a dit \u00e9prouver des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 faire face \u00e0 la fausse couche, mais qu\u2019il l\u2019a consol\u00e9 en lui disant que le temps gu\u00e9rissait les blessures et qu\u2019il devait aller de l\u2019avant.\n[55] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la seconde fausse couche, M. Fulton a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 possible de relever le plaignant les 17 et 18 d\u00e9cembre 2009. Le journal de bord du plaignant pour le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2009 ainsi que ses feuilles de route pour les 17 et 18 d\u00e9cembre 2009 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis au Tribunal. Le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2009, le plaignant a effectu\u00e9 une livraison \u00e0 Belleville, en Ontario, et s\u2019est ensuite rendu dans la nuit de Bellville \u00e0 Scarborough, en Ontario, pour aller chercher un autre chargement dans la matin\u00e9e du 18 d\u00e9cembre 2009. De Scarborough, il a livr\u00e9 le chargement \u00e0 Toronto, et est ensuite retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 la cour de FFI \u00e0 Cambridge. D\u2019apr\u00e8s M. Fulton, pendant ce temps, un autre chauffeur a eu un accident. Quand le plaignant l\u2019a inform\u00e9 de l\u2019hospitalisation de sa femme et a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 se rendre aupr\u00e8s d\u2019elle, il a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que le chauffeur qui avait eu un accident vienne le remplacer. Compte tenu de l\u2019accident et du fait que l\u2019autre chauffeur avait d\u00e9pass\u00e9 son nombre d\u2019heures de travail pour la journ\u00e9e, M. Fulton ne pensait pas qu\u2019il \u00e9tait prudent que l\u2019autre chauffeur aille remplacer le plaignant. De plus, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le plaignant \u00e9tait de toute mani\u00e8re sur le chemin du retour avec un chargement, M. Fulton ne pensait pas que le plaignant serait de retour chez lui plus t\u00f4t, qu\u2019on le rel\u00e8ve ou qu\u2019il termine ses livraisons. M. Fulton a ajout\u00e9 que, de nouveau, des dispositions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises pour acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le chargement du camion du plaignant \u00e0 Toronto, afin de permettre \u00e0 ce dernier de rentrer chez lui plus vite.\n[56] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2009 \u00e9tait un vendredi, le plaignant n\u2019a pas travaill\u00e9 le week\u2011end des 19 et 20 d\u00e9cembre 2009. M. Fulton se rappelle \u00eatre entr\u00e9 en contact avec le plaignant au cours de ce week-end pour lui demander comment il allait et s\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 retourner au travail. D\u2019apr\u00e8s M. Fulton, le plaignant \u00e9tait soucieux d\u2019avoir de l\u2019argent pour No\u00ebl. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Fulton lui a offert d\u2019effectuer un quart de travail le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2009. M. Fulton affirme que le plaignant lui a dit que d\u2019autres membres de la famille pouvaient tenir compagnie \u00e0 sa femme et qu\u2019il serait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2009. Le journal de bord et la feuille de route du plaignant pour le lundi 21 d\u00e9cembre 2009 montrent qu\u2019il a travaill\u00e9 de 5 h 30 \u00e0 19 h. Le plaignant n\u2019a pas effectu\u00e9 de quart de soir cette nuit\u2011l\u00e0.\n[57] M. Fulton ne se souvient pas avoir eu d\u2019autres discussions avec le plaignant apr\u00e8s le quart de travail du 21 d\u00e9cembre au sujet de son retour au travail ou de demandes de cong\u00e9. Le plaignant est revenu travailler le 28 d\u00e9cembre 2009.\n[58] Dans l\u2019ensemble, FFI soutient que le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 du fait de sa situation de famille. FFI fait valoir qu\u2019elle s\u2019est efforc\u00e9e de r\u00e9pondre aux urgences m\u00e9dicales relatives aux grossesses et aux fausses couches en acc\u00e9l\u00e9rant le retour du plaignant \u00e0 son point d\u2019attache et en fournissant \u00e0 celui\u2011ci le travail qu\u2019il avait demand\u00e9. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, FFI affirme que les gestes qu\u2019elle a pos\u00e9s \u00e9taient raisonnables compte tenu de la situation.\n[59] Encore une fois, sans se pr\u00e9valoir de la d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) et au paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi, FFI pr\u00e9tend avoir accord\u00e9 des mesures d\u2019adaptation au plaignant dans les circonstances qui ont entour\u00e9 les fausses couches. Avant les deux fausses couches, quand la femme du plaignant a eu des complications li\u00e9es \u00e0 ses grossesses et a d\u00fb se rendre \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital, FFI a pris des dispositions pour acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le retour du plaignant \u00e0 la cour de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il puisse partir t\u00f4t du travail pour \u00eatre aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de sa femme. Toutefois, le n\u0153ud de la plainte concerne le fait que le plaignant s\u2019est vu refuser la permission de quitter le travail avant d\u2019avoir termin\u00e9 ses livraisons. M\u00eame si FFI a pris des dispositions, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas suffi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que du fait de ces dispositions, FFI s\u2019\u00e9tait acquitt\u00e9e de son obligation d\u2019offrir des mesures d\u2019adaptation. Le paragraphe 15(2) est ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9 :\nLes faits [...] sont des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es [...] s\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019une personne [\u2026] constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\nEn g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, il y a contrainte excessive quand un employeur montre qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pu prendre aucune autre mesure raisonnable ou pratique pour \u00e9viter les cons\u00e9quences f\u00e2cheuses pour l\u2019individu (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin, aux paragraphes 38 et 64 \u00e0 65; et l\u2019arr\u00eat Conseil des Canadiens avec d\u00e9ficiences c. VIA Rail Canada Inc., 2007 CSC 15, au paragraphe 130). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour \u00e9tablir que FFI avait envisag\u00e9 de prendre d\u2019autres mesures d\u2019adaptation que le fait d\u2019acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le retour du plaignant \u00e0 la cour, ou bien que le fait d\u2019autoriser le plaignant \u00e0 quitter son poste avant la fin de son parcours aurait constitu\u00e9 pour elle une contrainte excessive. M\u00eame si M. Fulton a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 possible de permettre au plaignant de quitter son poste avant la seconde fausse couche, encore une fois, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve montrant que FFI avait examin\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019offrir une autre mesure d\u2019adaptation que celle que le plaignant avait propos\u00e9e (soit qu\u2019un chauffeur pr\u00e9cis vienne le relever) ou dans quelle mesure le fait que le plaignant ne termine pas ses livraisons aurait constitu\u00e9 une contrainte excessive pour FFI.\n[60] Le plaignant affirme aussi qu\u2019on lui a refus\u00e9 des cong\u00e9s apr\u00e8s les fausses couches. Par ailleurs, FFI soutient que le plaignant n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre cong\u00e9, mais qu\u2019il a plut\u00f4t exprim\u00e9 le souhait que son horaire de travail soit modifi\u00e9, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 continuer de gagner un revenu, \u00e0 des moments o\u00f9 sa femme disposait du soutien d\u2019autres personnes. Vu les t\u00e9moignages contradictoires que les parties ont donn\u00e9s, ce volet de la plainte exige du Tribunal qu\u2019il proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Le journal de bord et les feuilles de route fournies par FFI ne sont pas tr\u00e8s utiles \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Elles \u00e9tablissent que le plaignant a travaill\u00e9 pendant les journ\u00e9es en cause, ce qui n\u2019a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019aucune contestation, mais elles n\u2019apportent aucun \u00e9clairage additionnel \u00e0 l\u2019affirmation de M. Fulton selon laquelle le plaignant n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre cong\u00e9 apr\u00e8s les fausses couches.\n[61] Apr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 l\u2019ensemble de la preuve relative \u00e0 ce volet de la plainte, je ne trouve pas que la version des faits que FFI a donn\u00e9e soit cr\u00e9dible. Je conclus qu\u2019il est plus probable que le plaignant ait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre cong\u00e9 apr\u00e8s les fausses couches. J\u2019ai notamment pu relever certaines incoh\u00e9rences dans la version des faits de FFI. M. Fulton a admis qu\u2019apr\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re fausse couche, il avait fait des recherches pour savoir si FFI avait l\u2019obligation d\u2019accorder des cong\u00e9s, pay\u00e9s ou non, en pareilles circonstances. Si le plaignant n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 de cong\u00e9s, pay\u00e9s ou non, et souhaitait en fait continuer \u00e0 travailler, pourquoi M. Fulton aurait\u2011il pris des renseignements au sujet des obligations de FFI \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard? En outre, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la seconde fausse couche, on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Fulton : [traduction] \u00ab Consid\u00e9rez\u2011vous qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 raisonnable de sa part [le plaignant] de vous demander des cong\u00e9s? \u00bb En r\u00e9ponse, M. Fulton a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Je lui ai donn\u00e9 des cong\u00e9s [...] Pendant la p\u00e9riode des F\u00eates, il a travaill\u00e9 une journ\u00e9e \u00bb. Dans ses observations finales, au paragraphe 22, FFI a ajout\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nLe fait que M. Closs n\u2019a pas travaill\u00e9 entre le 22 d\u00e9cembre 2009 et le 29 d\u00e9cembre 2009 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9. M. Fulton a confirm\u00e9 que, pendant ce temps, son entreprise de camionnage continuait ses activit\u00e9s comme d\u2019habitude, exception faite des jours f\u00e9ri\u00e9s, selon les exigences de la charge de travail. M. Closs \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que, pour une raison ou une autre, cette p\u00e9riode d\u2019inactivit\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas compt\u00e9 comme un cong\u00e9, sans toutefois expliquer sa position.\nAlors qu\u2019elle soutient que le plaignant n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 de cong\u00e9s, FFI d\u00e9crit ici la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 22 et le 29 d\u00e9cembre 2009 comme une p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par FFI au plaignant. Pour finir, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question [traduction] \u00ab Il [le plaignant] vous causait des probl\u00e8mes, n\u2019est\u2011ce pas? \u00bb, M. Fulton a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Pas quand il travaillait. \u00bb\n[62] Ce dernier commentaire corrobore l\u2019all\u00e9gation du plaignant selon laquelle, dans le contexte des fausses couches de sa femme et des cong\u00e9s qu\u2019il a demand\u00e9s apr\u00e8s ces fausses couches, la principale pr\u00e9occupation de FFI \u00e9tait de s\u2019assurer qu\u2019il continuait de travailler et terminait ses parcours. Le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 clair et compatible avec cette affirmation. Si je me fie au comportement et aux r\u00e9ponses du plaignant, je n\u2019ai aucune raison de mettre en doute la capacit\u00e9 de celui\u2011ci \u00e0 se rem\u00e9morer les \u00e9v\u00e8nements qui ont entour\u00e9 les fausses couches ou la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de son affirmation selon laquelle il a bien demand\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre cong\u00e9 apr\u00e8s les fausses couches.\n[63] Ayant accept\u00e9 qu\u2019il est plus probable que le plaignant a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre cong\u00e9 apr\u00e8s les fausses couches, je consid\u00e8re que FFI avait le devoir d\u2019\u00e9tudier la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019accorder des mesures d\u2019adaptation au plaignant en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette demande. M. Fulton a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, parmi les mesures d\u2019adaptation disponibles, il aurait pu faire appel \u00e0 des chauffeurs de remplacement pour effectuer les quarts de travail du plaignant. Toutefois, la possibilit\u00e9 de prendre une telle mesure ne semble pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tudi\u00e9e. Cela ne signifie pas que FFI devait donner cong\u00e9 au plaignant ou qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas de raisons valables de lui refuser ce cong\u00e9; toutefois, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 susmentionn\u00e9, ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s en m\u00eame temps que \u00ab [...] les capacit\u00e9s uniques ainsi que la valeur et la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rentes de chaque personne, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela n\u2019impose aucune contrainte excessive \u00bb (arr\u00eat Meiorin, au paragraphe 62). M\u00eame s\u2019il se peut que M. Fulton ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que le plaignant devait travailler pour oublier le chagrin caus\u00e9 par les fausses couches, en se fondant sur son exp\u00e9rience personnelle d\u2019une fausse couche, il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une strat\u00e9gie que le plaignant souhaitait adopter, ou qui aurait n\u00e9cessairement pu \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 ce dernier. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, \u00ab [l]e caract\u00e8re individualis\u00e9 du processus d\u2019accommodement ne saurait \u00eatre minimis\u00e9. En effet, l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement varie selon les caract\u00e9ristiques de chaque entreprise, les besoins particuliers de chaque employ\u00e9 et les circonstances sp\u00e9cifiques dans lesquelles la d\u00e9cision doit \u00eatre prise. \u00bb (Centre universitaire de sant\u00e9 McGill (H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al) c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, 2007 CSC 4, au paragraphe 22). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, consid\u00e9rant que FFI r\u00e9fute le fait que le plaignant ait demand\u00e9 des cong\u00e9s, ce que je ne trouve pas cr\u00e9dible, il n\u2019y a aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve donnant \u00e0 penser que FFI a s\u00e9rieusement examin\u00e9 les besoins du plaignant quand celui\u2011ci a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre cong\u00e9 apr\u00e8s les fausses couches ou que FFI s\u2019est s\u00e9rieusement pench\u00e9e sur la question de savoir si elle pouvait r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces besoins.\n[64] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que FFI n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 ou justifi\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on satisfaisante sa conduite discriminatoire prima facie fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille du plaignant, en contravention de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi.\nV. Conclusion [65] Compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve et du raisonnement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ci\u2011dessus, je conclus que les plaintes fond\u00e9es sur les alin\u00e9as 7a) et 7b) de la Loi sont fond\u00e9es.\nVI. Ordonnance [66] En application du paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi, \u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction, le membre instructeur du Tribunal qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e peut ordonner \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire de prendre certaines mesures. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le plaignant demande au Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance imposant les mesures de redressement suivantes : indemnit\u00e9 pour les pertes de salaire et int\u00e9r\u00eats sur ces pertes de salaire; indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral; indemnit\u00e9 pour le fait que l\u2019acte discriminatoire dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est rendu coupable a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9; et toute autre mesure de redressement que le Tribunal estimera juste.\n[67] Le fait de rendre une ordonnance en application du paragraphe 53(2) ne vise pas \u00e0 punir la personne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire, mais \u00e0 \u00e9liminer, autant que possible, les effets discriminatoires de cet acte (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84, au paragraphe 13). Pour y parvenir, l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal en mati\u00e8re de redressement doit ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 des principes, compte tenu du lien entre l\u2019acte discriminatoire et la perte all\u00e9gu\u00e9e (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 268, au paragraphe 37). Autrement dit, le Tribunal doit exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en mati\u00e8re de redressement raisonnablement, en fonction des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de la plainte et de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e (Hughes c. \u00c9lections Canada, 2010 TCDP 4, au paragraphe 50).\nA. Les pertes de salaire [68] Le plaignant demande \u00e0 \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 pour les pertes de salaire qu\u2019il a subies pendant la p\u00e9riode allant du 9 avril 2010 au 15 d\u00e9cembre 2011. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le plaignant, son revenu annuel pr\u00e9vu pour les ann\u00e9es 2010 et 2011 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de 63 000 $, soit 1 220 $ par semaine. Par cons\u00e9quent, sur une p\u00e9riode de 83 semaines, il aurait gagn\u00e9 101 260 $. Toutefois, cette perte de salaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 compens\u00e9e par une somme de 25 729 $, constitu\u00e9e de prestations d\u2019assurance\u2011emploi et du revenu d\u2019un autre emploi que le plaignant a re\u00e7us. Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant affirme qu\u2019on lui doit 75 531 $ au titre de ses pertes de salaire.\n[69] FFI conteste la demande d\u2019indemnisation au titre des pertes de salaire. D\u2019apr\u00e8s FFI, le calcul ne s\u2019applique pas parce que leurs chauffeurs sont pay\u00e9s au kilom\u00e8tre. FFI ajoute que le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant relatif \u00e0 ses efforts pour compenser ses pertes de salaire est discutable. Le plaignant a d\u2019abord affirm\u00e9 \u00eatre rest\u00e9 sans travailler jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 il n\u2019a plus eu droit aux prestations d\u2019assurance\u2011emploi. Le plaignant a alors trouv\u00e9 un emploi et est rest\u00e9 employ\u00e9 depuis d\u00e9cembre 2010, ou autour de cette date. FFI pr\u00e9tend que, par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant semble capable d\u2019obtenir et de conserver un emploi quand il le veut bien.\n[70] Le RE dat\u00e9 du 23 avril 2010 que FFI a \u00e9mis \u00e0 l\u2019attention du plaignant montre que le 9 avril 2010 est le dernier jour pour lequel le plaignant a re\u00e7u un salaire. La preuve montre que le plaignant a effectu\u00e9 un autre quart de travail pour le compte de FFI le 14 mai 2010. Par la suite, le plaignant affirme avoir re\u00e7u des prestations d\u2019assurance\u2011emploi jusque vers la fin du mois de novembre 2010. Le Tribunal a re\u00e7u le feuillet T4E du plaignant pour 2010, \u00c9tat des prestations d\u2019assurance\u2011emploi et autres prestations. Ce document montre que le plaignant a re\u00e7u des prestations d\u2019assurance\u2011emploi totalisant 12 755 $ en 2010.\n[71] Le plaignant a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour Challenger Motor Freight Inc. (Challenger) en d\u00e9cembre 2010. Le Tribunal a re\u00e7u le feuillet T4 du plaignant, \u00c9tat de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pay\u00e9e, que Challenger a d\u00e9livr\u00e9 \u00e0 ce dernier pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2010, et qui montrait qu\u2019il avait gagn\u00e9 5 550,27 $. Le document ne fait pas \u00e9tat d\u2019une date de d\u00e9but ou de fin d\u2019emploi du plaignant chez Challenger. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le plaignant, comme Challenger ne lui donnait pas suffisamment de travail, seulement 5 \u00e0 6 heures par jour, deux \u00e0 trois jours par semaine, il a quitt\u00e9 Challenger et a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour Wag-mar Transport Inc. le jour m\u00eame. Le Tribunal a re\u00e7u un RE \u00e9mis par Wag-mar le 18 mai 2011. Ce document montre que le plaignant a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour Wag-mar le 11 f\u00e9vrier 2011 et que le dernier jour pour lequel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 le 15 mai 2011. On peut y lire que la raison d\u2019\u00e9mission du RE est le code M \u00ab Cong\u00e9diement \u00bb. Le RE ne fait pas \u00e9tat du revenu du plaignant pendant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 Wag-mar l\u2019a employ\u00e9, seulement de sa [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration assurable totale \u00bb. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 la situation d\u2019emploi du plaignant apr\u00e8s que Wag-mar l\u2019a cong\u00e9di\u00e9.\n[72] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le plaignant s\u2019est retrouv\u00e9 sans emploi entre avril 2010 et d\u00e9cembre 2010, du fait de la d\u00e9cision prise par FFI d\u2019\u00e9mettre le RE, j\u2019accepte qu\u2019il a subi des pertes de salaire pendant cette p\u00e9riode. M\u00eame si FFI met en doute les efforts fournis par le plaignant pour att\u00e9nuer ses pertes de salaire pendant cette p\u00e9riode, elle n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour appuyer son all\u00e9gation. En outre, j\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant selon lequel quand il a travaill\u00e9 pour Challenger, ses heures de travail se sont trouv\u00e9es significativement r\u00e9duites par rapport \u00e0 celles qu\u2019il effectuait pour le compte de FFI. M\u00eame s\u2019il a en partie att\u00e9nu\u00e9 ses pertes de salaire en travaillant pour Challenger, le plaignant a continu\u00e9 de subir des pertes de salaire pendant cette p\u00e9riode.\n[73] Toutefois, m\u00eame s\u2019il a obtenu un emploi chez Wag-mar, qui lui offrait plus d\u2019heures de travail que Challenger, le plaignant affirme avoir continu\u00e9 de subir des pertes de salaire jusqu\u2019en d\u00e9cembre 2011. Le plaignant n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour expliquer les raisons pour lesquelles il a continu\u00e9 de subir des pertes de salaire apr\u00e8s avoir commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour Wag\u2011mar, ou par la suite. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, je note que le calcul que le plaignant a fait de son [traduction] \u00ab revenu annuel pr\u00e9vu pour 2010 et 2011 \u00bb ne permet pas d\u2019expliquer pourquoi son emploi chez Wag-mar a pris fin, et comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 susmentionn\u00e9, quelle \u00e9tait la situation d\u2019emploi du plaignant pendant la p\u00e9riode comprise entre mai et d\u00e9cembre 2011. En outre, m\u00eame si le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la poursuite judiciaire qu\u2019il avait intent\u00e9e contre FFI a fait en sorte qu\u2019il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 difficile de trouver et de garder un emploi, il n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour \u00e9tayer cette all\u00e9gation.\n[74] Compte tenu de la preuve et du raisonnement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ci\u2011dessus, et en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 FFI d\u2019indemniser le plaignant de ses pertes de salaire pour la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le lundi 12 avril 2010 et le 10 f\u00e9vrier 2011. Cela repr\u00e9sente 43 semaines et 4 jours de salaire.\n[75] Pour d\u00e9finir le montant \u00e0 accorder au plaignant au titre de cette mesure de redressement, il faut calculer le montant du salaire du plaignant en usant de la m\u00eame m\u00e9thode que celle \u00e0 laquelle les parties ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu recours, comme il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 au paragraphe 29 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits, pour \u00e9tablir le montant du revenu hebdomadaire du plaignant :\n[traduction]\nInstance conduite sous le r\u00e9gime du CCT\n29. Aucune d\u00e9cision n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue quant au bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la plainte et aucune conclusion n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question du cong\u00e9diement injustifi\u00e9. Aucune plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e ni entendue. Une entente de r\u00e8glement sous r\u00e9serve de tous droits a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue, en cons\u00e9quence de laquelle FFI a vers\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Closs deux semaines de salaire.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[76] En vue d\u2019\u00e9viter une double indemnisation, le salaire que le plaignant a touch\u00e9 pour le quart de travail qu\u2019il a effectu\u00e9 le 14 mai 2010 sera d\u00e9duit de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9. En outre, la somme de 12 755 $ sera \u00e9galement d\u00e9duite de cette indemnit\u00e9 pour tenir compte des prestations d\u2019assurance\u2011emploi que le plaignant a re\u00e7ues pendant la p\u00e9riode en cause. La somme de 5 550,27 $ sera \u00e9galement d\u00e9duite de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour tenir compte du revenu que le plaignant a re\u00e7u de Challenger en 2010. Pour finir, le revenu que Challenger a vers\u00e9 au plaignant en 2011 sera \u00e9galement d\u00e9duit de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9.\n[77] En application du paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi, le plaignant a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que des int\u00e9r\u00eats lui soient accord\u00e9s sur toute indemnit\u00e9 qu\u2019il pourrait toucher au titre de ses pertes de salaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, et en application du paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, j\u2019accorde au plaignant des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur ses pertes de salaire, pour la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 23 avril 2010, date \u00e0 laquelle le RE a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis, et la date de versement de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats seront calcul\u00e9s \u00e0 taux simple sur une base annuelle en se fondant sur le taux officiel d\u2019escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle).\n[78] Je resterai saisi de la question de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e au titre des pertes de salaire dans le cas o\u00f9 il s\u2019av\u00e9rerait n\u00e9cessaire de donner d\u2019autres pr\u00e9cisions, et ce, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que les parties confirment que les modalit\u00e9s de cet aspect de l\u2019ordonnance ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en \u0153uvre.\nB. L\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral [79] Le plaignant demande la somme de 20 000 $ \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour le pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019il a subi du fait de l\u2019acte discriminatoire en cause. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le plaignant, la fa\u00e7on dont FFI l\u2019a trait\u00e9 lors des fausses couches de sa femme et les souffrances que cette conduite lui a caus\u00e9es justifie que lui soit accord\u00e9e une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral. Le plaignant fait \u00e9galement valoir qu\u2019il souffre de sympt\u00f4mes associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9tresse psychologique et \u00e0 l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, qui ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se manifester apr\u00e8s que son emploi chez FFI a pris fin et qui ont progressivement empir\u00e9 depuis son cong\u00e9diement. Le plaignant affirme qu\u2019on lui a prescrit des m\u00e9dicaments pour traiter ces sympt\u00f4mes.\n[80] D\u2019apr\u00e8s FFI, la somme que le plaignant demande est excessive consid\u00e9rant que la preuve montre que ce dernier souffrait de probl\u00e8mes pr\u00e9existants et que des facteurs externes influaient sur sa sant\u00e9 mentale.\n[81] En application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi, 20 000 $ est la somme maximale que le Tribunal peut accorder \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal n\u2019accorde cette somme maximale que dans les cas les plus graves : quand l\u2019\u00e9tendue et la dur\u00e9e du pr\u00e9judice que le plaignant a subi du fait de l\u2019acte discriminatoire justifient l\u2019octroi du plein montant.\n[82] Le Tribunal a re\u00e7u les [traduction] \u00ab Ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents m\u00e9dicaux du patient \u00bb, document imprim\u00e9 de Shoppers Drug Mart faisant \u00e9tat de l\u2019historique des ordonnances du plaignant. Entre autres m\u00e9dicaments, le plaignant s\u2019est vu prescrire de la trimipramine, qu\u2019il a d\u00e9crit comme un antid\u00e9presseur, et de la ratio-fluoxetine, qu\u2019il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir pris pour soigner ses crises de panique. Ces deux ordonnances ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es le 27 janvier 2009, avant que M. Fulton embauche le plaignant. Le plaignant a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et de crises de panique avant de travailler pour FFI, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin d\u2019un accident de voiture dans un emploi pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. Par cons\u00e9quent, je n\u2019accepte pas la d\u00e9claration du plaignant selon laquelle il n\u2019a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 souffrir de d\u00e9tresse psychologique et d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir travaill\u00e9 pour FFI. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas non plus re\u00e7u d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9tayant l\u2019affirmation selon laquelle ces sympt\u00f4mes ont empir\u00e9 apr\u00e8s que le RE a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis.\n[83] Cela \u00e9tant dit, j\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant selon lequel l\u2019\u00e9mission du RE a \u00e9t\u00e9 source de troubles \u00e9motionnels, ce qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un vif \u00e9change avec M. Fulton et au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[84] En ce qui a trait aux fausses couches, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 susmentionn\u00e9 et comme FFI l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, le plaignant a clairement prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 profond\u00e9ment touch\u00e9 par les fausses couches de sa femme. Toutefois, en accordant la r\u00e9paration pr\u00e9vue par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi, le Tribunal ne cherche pas \u00e0 corriger le pr\u00e9judice moral que le plaignant a subi du fait des fausses couches. Il s\u2019efforce plut\u00f4t de corriger les effets des actes discriminatoires en cause. En refusant au plaignant les cong\u00e9s qu\u2019il a demand\u00e9s pour s\u2019acquitter de ses obligations familiales, sans v\u00e9ritablement s\u2019interroger sur ses besoins, FFI a aggrav\u00e9 le chagrin ressenti par le plaignant du fait des fausses couches. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 que le fait de ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent pour soutenir sa femme pendant ses fausses couches et de ne pas avoir eu de temps pour faire son deuil avaient eu sur lui des effets \u00e0 long terme, parmi lesquels la d\u00e9pression. M\u00eame s\u2019il se peut que le plaignant ait souffert de d\u00e9pression avant cela, de nouveau, j\u2019accepte le fait que la situation en cause ait pu aggraver son \u00e9tat. En outre, le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il cherchait \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 suivre une th\u00e9rapie pour faire face \u00e0 ces probl\u00e8mes, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que ces souffrances affectent maintenant ses relations avec sa femme et avec d\u2019autres personnes. Cela \u00e9tant dit, et sans n\u00e9gliger les effets de la conduite de FFI, je crois que la preuve du plaignant montre que l\u2019essentiel du pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019il a subi au moment des fausses couches r\u00e9sultait des fausses couches en tant que telles.\n[85] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, et en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi, il me semble qu\u2019il convient d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 FFI de verser au plaignant une indemnit\u00e9 de 5 000 $ au titre du pr\u00e9judice moral que ce dernier a subi du fait des actes discriminatoires en cause.\nC. L\u2019indemnit\u00e9 au titre d\u2019un acte discriminatoire commis de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e Le plaignant demande la somme de 20 000 $ \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour le fait que FFI a commis les actes discriminatoires en cause de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e. D\u2019apr\u00e8s FFI, il n\u2019y a aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve montrant que sa conduite a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle donnerait lieu \u00e0 des r\u00e9parations \u00e0 ce titre.\n[86] Pour que la conduite en cause soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e, il faut conclure qu\u2019il y a eu \u00ab [\u2026] dans une certaine mesure, une intention ou un comportement si d\u00e9nu\u00e9 de prudence, ou encore, un m\u00e9pris des cons\u00e9quences de ce comportement \u00bb (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Collins, 2011 CF 1168, au paragraphe 33). En application du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi, 20 000 $ est l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 maximale que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019auteur d\u2019un acte discriminatoire de payer s\u2019il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019octroi de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 maximale devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux cas les plus graves.\n[87] M\u00eame si je ne crois pas que la preuve montre que FFI ait intentionnellement cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 faire preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du plaignant, je crois que FFI a fait preuve de manque de consid\u00e9ration pour les cons\u00e9quences de sa conduite. Lors des fausses couches, le plaignant a inform\u00e9 FFI de ses besoins et a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que des mesures d\u2019adaptation soient prises, mais FFI a choisi de se concentrer sur ses propres besoins, sans d\u00fbment prendre en consid\u00e9ration les obligations familiales du plaignant. Pour ce qui est de la situation qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9mission du RE, de nouveau, le plaignant a fait part de ses besoins \u00e0 FFI et a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que des mesures d\u2019adaptation soient prises. Les raisons que FFI avait d\u2019ignorer cette demande faisaient fi des besoins du plaignant, et en rempla\u00e7ant ce dernier par un autre chauffeur, FFI a montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait aucune consid\u00e9ration pour le processus relatif \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation.\n[88] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, et en application du paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi, il me semble qu\u2019il convient d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 FFI de verser au plaignant une indemnit\u00e9 de 5 000 $ pour avoir commis les actes discriminatoires en cause de mani\u00e8re inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSusheel Gupta\nPr\u00e9sident du tribunal par int\u00e9rim\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 30 novembre 2012\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1693\/4811 et T1694\/4911\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Stephen Closs v.

Le contexte [1] La plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne le 21 mai 2003, all\u00e9guant que son employeur, l\u2019Agence des douanes et du revenu du Canada (l\u2019ADRC), aujourd\u2019hui appel\u00e9e l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (l\u2019ARC), avait fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience et avait refus\u00e9 de prendre \u00e0 son \u00e9gard des mesures d\u2019accommodement, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, LRC 1985, c H-6 (la Loi), dont le texte est le suivant :\nEmploi\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\n[2] La plaignante, qui est aveugle au sens de la loi, travaillait comme agente des contacts pour les recouvrements \u00e0 temps plein et pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. En 1998, elle a subi une l\u00e9sion de nature non professionnelle au cou et au haut du dos, et elle souffre depuis ce temps de douleur chronique. \u00c0 la suite de cet incident, elle a pris un cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de deux ans. Son m\u00e9decin l\u2019a jug\u00e9e apte \u00e0 entreprendre un retour graduel au travail au d\u00e9but de 2001.\n[3] Dans le formulaire de plainte qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission), la plaignante all\u00e8gue qu\u2019\u00e0 de nombreuses reprises, \u00e0 compter d\u2019avril 2001, elle a demand\u00e9 l\u2019autorisation de travailler \u00e0 partir de chez elle (t\u00e9l\u00e9travail), ce qui lui aurait permis de mieux g\u00e9rer les effets n\u00e9fastes, dus \u00e0 ses d\u00e9ficiences, de plusieurs aspects de son lieu de travail, dont le fait d\u2019\u00eatre assise \u00e0 un bureau pendant un temps prolong\u00e9, de soulever des graphiques ou des dossiers et de se servir d\u2019une chaise ordinaire, d\u2019un \u00e9cran d\u2019ordinateur et d\u2019une souris. La plaignante all\u00e8gue que son employeur a soit \u00e9vit\u00e9, soit refus\u00e9 ces demandes de mesures d\u2019accommodement. Elle all\u00e8gue \u00e9galement qu\u2019en juin 2001 un plan de retour au travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en application sans son consentement et malgr\u00e9 les recommandations de son m\u00e9decin en faveur d\u2019un retour au travail graduel et restreint. Selon elle, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9valuation ergonomique que son m\u00e9decin avait recommand\u00e9e.\n[4] Au milieu de novembre 2001, l\u2019employeur a organis\u00e9 une r\u00e9union en vue de discuter des progr\u00e8s accomplis par la plaignante en vue d\u2019un retour au travail \u00e0 temps plein. Lors de cette r\u00e9union, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu qu\u2019il serait bon que la plaignante subisse une \u00e9valuation ergonomique. Cette derni\u00e8re a eu lieu en janvier 2002 et dans un rapport, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la direction le 11 mars 2002, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 recommand\u00e9 que le mat\u00e9riel n\u00e9cessaire soit command\u00e9 et mis en place avant la fin du mois de mars 2002. Selon la plaignante, en f\u00e9vrier 2003, elle n\u2019avait toujours pas re\u00e7u le mat\u00e9riel recommand\u00e9.\n[5] En f\u00e9vrier 2002, la plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de cong\u00e9 avec \u00e9talement du revenu. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a rejet\u00e9 cette demande en avril 2002 parce que la plaignante n\u2019avait pas encore \u00e9tabli une base de travail de 37,5 heures par semaine. En juin 2002, on a dit \u00e0 la plaignante qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 choisie pour un projet pilote de t\u00e9l\u00e9travail et qu\u2019on lui accorderait aussi le cong\u00e9 avec \u00e9talement du revenu qu\u2019elle avait demand\u00e9. Elle dit que, bien qu\u2019heureuse de cette d\u00e9cision, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9rout\u00e9e par le fait que l\u2019on avait acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 sa demande relative \u00e0 ce programme en fonction des crit\u00e8res du projet, mais non pour des raisons li\u00e9es \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[6] En f\u00e9vrier 2009, la plaignante a eu un accident de travail. Le logiciel qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 install\u00e9 pour tenir compte de ses probl\u00e8mes d\u2019acuit\u00e9 visuelle fonctionnait cens\u00e9ment mal et, \u00e0 cause de cela, le curseur sautillait sur tout l\u2019\u00e9cran. La plaignante dit qu\u2019\u00e0 cause de ce probl\u00e8me elle devait se servir de sa souris de mani\u00e8re excessive et qu\u2019elle a fini par subir un microtraumatisme au coude, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9paule et au cou. Elle n\u2019est pas retourn\u00e9e au travail depuis ce temps.\n[7] La plaignante dit que pendant toute cette p\u00e9riode elle a eu le sentiment d\u2019\u00eatre victime de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement. Elle signale que, m\u00eame si l\u2019ADRC a instaur\u00e9 des politiques sur le t\u00e9l\u00e9travail, l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, ces politiques n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suivies dans son cas.\n[8] La plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne aupr\u00e8s de la Commission le 21 mai 2003. Dans une d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 9 f\u00e9vrier 2007, la Commission a rejet\u00e9 la plainte. Cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et, le 22 mai 2008, l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission pour nouvel examen. La Commission a men\u00e9 deux enqu\u00eates et renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal le 10 septembre 2010.\nII. La modification de la plainte [9] Le 28 juin 2012, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions (EP) aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal. Les deux premiers paragraphes de ce document sont les suivants :\n[traduction]\nIl s\u2019agit d\u2019une affaire de discrimination, de diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable et de harc\u00e8lement, ce qui est contraire aux articles 7 et 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9e la \u00ab Loi \u00bb). La plaignante, Pamela Egan, pr\u00e9tend que son employeur, l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (l\u2019\u00ab intim\u00e9e \u00bb), a contrevenu \u00e0 la Loi en agissant de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 son endroit et en adoptant des politiques et des pratiques qui ont eu sur elle, du fait de ses d\u00e9ficiences, des effets d\u00e9favorables. Mme Egan soutient de plus que l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019a harcel\u00e9e du fait de ses d\u00e9ficiences.\nMme Egan affirme par ailleurs que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a appliqu\u00e9 des politiques et des pratiques qui lui ont fait subir un traitement d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses possibilit\u00e9s de carri\u00e8re. Afin de s\u2019assurer que toutes les dispositions pertinentes de la Loi s\u2019appliquent aux faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s, Mme Egan pr\u00e9voit demander au Tribunal qu\u2019il lui soit permis de modifier sa plainte de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 inclure une all\u00e9gation de discrimination contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 de la Loi.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]\n[10] Outre les faits d\u00e9crits dans la plainte initiale, l\u2019EP d\u00e9crit une s\u00e9rie d\u2019incidents de harc\u00e8lement qui sont cens\u00e9ment survenus pendant la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019emploi que la plaignante a exerc\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. L\u2019EP contient \u00e9galement des all\u00e9gations concernant le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas fourni \u00e0 la plaignante les activit\u00e9s de formation et le mat\u00e9riel accessible qui \u00e9taient \u00e0 la disposition de ses coll\u00e8gues voyants et qui lui auraient permis de combler ses ambitions professionnelles. Malgr\u00e9 ses excellents ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de travail, 15 ans plus tard, la plaignante se situe toujours au niveau PM01 (aujourd\u2019hui SP4), soit celui auquel elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e, et elle lie son absence de promotions aux pratiques discriminatoires de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[11] Peu apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019EP de la plaignante, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9crit au Tribunal pour faire part de ses doutes au sujet des nouvelles all\u00e9gations soulev\u00e9es dans l\u2019EP, des all\u00e9gations qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019intim\u00e9e, n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es lors du processus tenu devant la Commission. La plaignante a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ces doutes, qualifiant l\u2019ajout des articles 10 et 14 d\u2019une simple modification d\u2019ordre administratif d\u00e9coulant des faits fondamentaux de la plainte. Insatisfaite de cette r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait valoir que le meilleur moyen de r\u00e9gler ces questions \u00e9tait de faire en sorte que la plaignante d\u00e9pose une requ\u00eate formelle, \u00e0 la suite de quoi l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9senterait des observations plus compl\u00e8tes sur la demande de modification de la plainte. La plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte le 6 septembre 2012.\n[12] Par souci de commodit\u00e9, voici le texte des articles 10 et 14 de la Loi :\nLignes de conduite discriminatoire\n10 Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et s\u2019il est susceptible d\u2019annihiler les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement d\u2019un individu ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019individus, le fait, pour l\u2019employeur, l\u2019association patronale ou l\u2019organisation syndicale :\na) de fixer ou d\u2019appliquer des lignes de conduite;\nb) de conclure des ententes touchant le recrutement, les mises en rapport, l\u2019engagement, les promotions, la formation, l\u2019apprentissage, les mutations ou tout autre aspect d\u2019un emploi pr\u00e9sent ou \u00e9ventuel.\nHarc\u00e8lement\n14(1) Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu :\na) lors de la fourniture de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public;\nb) lors de la fourniture de locaux commerciaux ou de logement;\nc) en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi,\nIII. Les positions des parties La position de la plaignante\n[13] La plaignante est d\u2019avis que toutes les all\u00e9gations contest\u00e9es ne font qu\u2019apporter des pr\u00e9cisions \u00e0 la plainte initiale et que l\u2019ajout des articles 10 et 14 de la Loi \u00e0 la plainte d\u00e9coule naturellement des faits qu\u2019elle a all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans sa plainte. Elle conteste que l\u2019annihilation de ses chances d\u2019emploi, au sens de l\u2019article 10, et le harc\u00e8lement, au sens de l\u2019article 14 de la loi, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en consid\u00e9ration au cours de l\u2019enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e sur sa plainte.\n[14] La plaignante soutient que la d\u00e9cision Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 1 fixe un seuil relativement peu exigeant pour ce qui est de modifier une plainte et que, contrairement \u00e0 la situation dont il \u00e9tait question dans les d\u00e9cisions Cook c. Premi\u00e8re nation d\u2019Onion Lake, (2002), 43 CHRR D\/77, et Tran c. Canada (Agence du revenu), 2012 TCDP 31, o\u00f9 il n\u2019y avait aucun lien factuel entre la plainte initiale et la modification que les plaignants souhaitaient apporter, dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate les modifications propos\u00e9es ajoutent simplement les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives que mettent en jeu les all\u00e9gations existantes de la plaignante. Dans la d\u00e9cision Gaucher, aux paragraphes 14, 15 et 17, le Tribunal a statu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de ligne de d\u00e9marcation nette entre les articles 7 et 10 de la Loi. La plaignante soutient que son all\u00e9gation selon laquelle l\u2019application des politiques de l\u2019intim\u00e9e donne lieu \u00e0 de la discrimination oblige in\u00e9vitablement \u00e0 examiner l\u2019application de ces politiques en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Selon la plaignante, l\u2019ajout de l\u2019article 10 ne fait que [traduction] \u00ab clarifier les aspects juridiques \u00bb de la plainte et satisfait donc au crit\u00e8re qui s\u2019applique aux modifications.\n[15] La plaignante soutient que les all\u00e9gations contest\u00e9es servent simplement d\u2019exemples qui illustrent les habitudes constantes de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de ne pas prendre de mesures d\u2019accommodement, ce qui cadre avec l\u2019objet de l\u2019EP. Contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle all\u00e8gue, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 de nouvelles all\u00e9gations qu\u2019elle ignorait quand le processus a d\u00e9but\u00e9. La plaignante soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a amplement de temps \u00e0 ce stade-ci pour pr\u00e9parer ses observations en se fondant sur les dispositions ajout\u00e9es et que, de ce fait, la modification ne lui cause aucun pr\u00e9judice. La plaignante convient que la plainte a subi de nombreux d\u00e9lais, mais ces derniers ont eu un effet \u00e9gal sur les deux parties. Elle soutient par ailleurs que la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e vingtaine de nouveaux t\u00e9moins que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a nomm\u00e9s auraient raisonnablement d\u00fb \u00eatre anticip\u00e9s, car ces personnes sont li\u00e9es aux all\u00e9gations initiales d\u2019absence de mesures d\u2019accommodement de la plaignante.\nLa position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[16] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que l\u2019essentiel des all\u00e9gations que contient la plainte initiale de la plaignante a trait au pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 manquement de sa part \u00e0 fournir en temps opportun du mat\u00e9riel ergonomique ainsi qu\u2019au temps mis avant d\u2019approuver la demande de t\u00e9l\u00e9travail et de cong\u00e9 avec \u00e9talement du revenu de la plaignante. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 des questions que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a eu \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre devant la Commission au stade de l\u2019enqu\u00eate\n[17] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que les nouvelles all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement et de discrimination syst\u00e9mique n\u2019ont aucun lien avec la plainte initiale, ne sont mentionn\u00e9es dans aucun des rapports d\u2019enqu\u00eate que la Commission a examin\u00e9s et sont assimilables au d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une nouvelle plainte. Elle ajoute que le fait d\u2019\u00e9tendre la port\u00e9e de la plainte de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 englober les articles 10 et 14 de la Loi revient dans les faits \u00e0 court-circuiter le processus de renvoi de la Commission, qui se situe \u00e0 la base m\u00eame de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) et au paragraphe 49(1) de la Loi. L\u2019intim\u00e9 se fonde sur la position qu\u2019a exprim\u00e9e le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Gaucher, au paragraphe 8 :\nLa Commission, lorsqu\u2019elle a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal, doit avoir examin\u00e9 la situation essentielle qui constitue le sujet de l\u2019affaire \u00e0 instruire. Cela cr\u00e9e certaines limites \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des modifications qui doivent avoir leur historique dans les circonstances soumises \u00e0 la Commission.\n[18] L\u2019intim\u00e9e est d\u2019avis qu\u2019en faisant droit \u00e0 la modification on minerait s\u00e9rieusement l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du processus et on ouvrirait une voie nouvelle et impr\u00e9vue pour l\u2019instruction. Elle d\u00e9clare que, sur les 37 t\u00e9moins qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s lors de son examen de l\u2019EP de la plaignante, 20 sont de nouveaux t\u00e9moins que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vu d\u2019appeler et qu\u2019il lui faudrait interroger en vue de pouvoir r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gations. Il faudra un temps consid\u00e9rable pour trouver et interroger ces t\u00e9moins, dont certains ne travaillent plus au sein de la fonction publique, car ils ont chang\u00e9 d\u2019emploi, ont pris leur retraite ou sont d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s. L\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend \u00eatre entr\u00e9e en contact avec certains de ces t\u00e9moins et qu\u2019un certain nombre d\u2019entre eux ne se souvenaient pas des faits \u00e9voqu\u00e9s par la plaignante dans son EP et avaient d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019ils entendaient les all\u00e9gations contest\u00e9es. De plus, la politique de conservation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e oblige les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 conserver des documents pendant une p\u00e9riode maximale de deux ans et il y a donc peu de chances que ces \u00e9ventuels t\u00e9moins aient conserv\u00e9 des documents quelconques relativement \u00e0 ces questions.\n[19] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plaignante a eu de nombreuses occasions de modifier sa plainte et, pourtant, la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e deux ans apr\u00e8s que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire. Si la plaignante avait soulev\u00e9 ces all\u00e9gations lors de l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la plainte, la Commission aurait interrog\u00e9 ces t\u00e9moins pour d\u00e9terminer la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de l\u2019all\u00e9gation et l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait re\u00e7u l\u2019avis qui est exig\u00e9 pour la conservation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que le temps consid\u00e9rable qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 l\u2019emp\u00eachera de pr\u00e9senter une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re. Permettre que l\u2019on soul\u00e8ve ces all\u00e9gations pour la premi\u00e8re fois, plus de neuf ans apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte initiale, causera \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e un pr\u00e9judice consid\u00e9rable. Il faudrait donc rejeter la requ\u00eate en modification et modifier en cons\u00e9quence l\u2019EP de la plaignante de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 supprimer les paragraphes portant sur les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement et de discrimination syst\u00e9mique.\nLa position de la Commission\n[20] La Commission a fait savoir au d\u00e9part qu\u2019elle ne d\u00e9poserait pas d\u2019observations sur la requ\u00eate de la plaignante, car elle ne participerait pas \u00e0 l\u2019audience sur la pr\u00e9sente affaire, mais elle a revu sa position et a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des observations le 4 octobre 2012. La Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la plaignante, car elle est d\u2019avis que les modifications ne changent pas le fond de la plainte et ne porteront pas pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nIV. Le dossier suppl\u00e9mentaire de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e [21] Le 15 octobre 2012, \u00e0 la suite des observations de la Commission sur la requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un dossier suppl\u00e9mentaire de requ\u00eate, contenant une copie d\u2019une note de service provenant de George Kolk, de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, et dat\u00e9e du 15 novembre 2006. Dans cette note de service, M. George Kolk, gestionnaire des enqu\u00eates, informait le repr\u00e9sentant de la plaignante que, si cette derni\u00e8re avait des probl\u00e8mes qui portaient sur une p\u00e9riode post\u00e9rieure aux faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans le formulaire de plainte, il faudrait qu\u2019elle d\u00e9pose une nouvelle plainte. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la position actuelle de la Commission ne cadre pas avec l\u2019avis qu\u2019elle a formul\u00e9 le 15 novembre 2006.\n[22] En r\u00e9plique, la plaignante a fait valoir que cette preuve est du ou\u00ef-dire, car l\u2019auteur pr\u00e9sum\u00e9, M. Kolk, n\u2019a pas souscrit d\u2019affidavit dans l\u2019affaire. La plaignante a soutenu que, de toute fa\u00e7on, la preuve n\u2019avait aucun rapport avec la requ\u00eate et qu\u2019il fallait donc en faire abstraction. Elle soutient en effet qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de cas dans lesquels on a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration cens\u00e9ment faite par un enqu\u00eateur de la Commission \u00e0 l\u2019ancien repr\u00e9sentant d\u2019un plaignant en vue de d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e d\u2019une plainte. La plaignante est d\u2019avis que les communications qu\u2019il peut y avoir entre le personnel de la Commission et les parties au cours du processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate sont extrins\u00e8ques et n\u2019aident pas \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si une modification tombe sous le coup ou non de la plainte initiale. Par ailleurs, la note de service a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9e au cours de la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e sur la plainte de la plaignante, enqu\u00eate que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a par la suite jug\u00e9e inad\u00e9quate. La plaignante soutient qu\u2019il serait absurde de d\u00e9finir la port\u00e9e de la plainte en se fondant sur une enqu\u00eate que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a jug\u00e9e insuffisamment compl\u00e8te.\nV. L\u2019analyse et la d\u00e9cision [23] Le pouvoir qu\u2019a le Tribunal de modifier une plainte est bien \u00e9tabli, et les parties ne le contestent pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale confirme clairement le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Parent, 2006 CF 1313, au paragraphe 30 :\nLe Tribunal jouit d\u2019une discr\u00e9tion consid\u00e9rable relativement \u00e0 l\u2019instruction des plaintes en vertu des paragraphes 48.9(1) et (2) et des articles 49 et 50 de la Loi. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de cette discr\u00e9tion pour traiter d\u2019une demande d\u2019amendement, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canderel Lt\u00e9e c. Canada (C.A.), [1994] 1 C.F. 3, 1993 IIJCan 2990 (C.A.F.), le juge Robert D\u00e9cary a rappel\u00e9 que : \u00ab [\u2026] la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est qu\u2019une modification devrait \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 tout stade de l\u2019action aux fins de d\u00e9terminer les v\u00e9ritables questions litigieuses entre les parties, pourvu, notamment, que cette autorisation ne cause pas d\u2019injustice \u00e0 l\u2019autre partie que des d\u00e9pens ne pourraient r\u00e9parer, et qu\u2019elle serve les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice \u00bb.\n[24] Il est \u00e9vident que la \u00ab plainte \u00bb doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re large de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 englober l\u2019\u00e9tendue compl\u00e8te des all\u00e9gations du plaignant, et que cette plainte est susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e. Tant que l\u2019on respecte le fond de la plainte initiale ou, autrement dit, tant que les all\u00e9gations sont, de par leur nature, li\u00e9es entre elles, le plaignant et la Commission sont autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 clarifier et \u00e0 expliciter les all\u00e9gations initiales avant la tenue d\u2019une audience : Gaucher, au paragraphe 11. Ce n\u2019est plus le cas par contre quand la modification que l\u2019on souhaite apporter \u00e0 la plainte ne peut plus \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un \u00ab simple amendement \u00bb mais devient fondamentalement une nouvelle plainte. \u00ab Il ne peut \u00eatre dit, dans de telles circonstances, que la Commission a demand\u00e9 une instruction et le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour proc\u00e9der \u00bb : Cook c. Premi\u00e8re nation d\u2019Onion Lake, au paragraphe 11.\n[25] En plus d\u2019\u00e9tablir un lien entre la plainte et la modification, le Tribunal doit \u00e9galement examiner le pr\u00e9judice que pourrait causer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 le fait d\u2019autoriser le plaignant \u00e0 modifier sa plainte. La jurisprudence ne pr\u00e9cise pas le degr\u00e9 de pr\u00e9judice qui doit \u00eatre \u00e9tabli de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 pouvoir rejeter une modification, mais il faut qu\u2019il soit \u00ab r\u00e9el et important \u00bb. Comme il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Cook c. Premi\u00e8re nation d\u2019Onion Lake, au paragraphe 20, il faut qu\u2019il existe un \u00ab pr\u00e9judice effectivement subi \u00bb et \u00ab [i]l peut aussi exister des facteurs implicitement pr\u00e9judiciables, comme le retard. Ces facteurs pourraient inclure la perte de l\u2019enqu\u00eate et du processus de conciliation \u00bb.\n[26] Si l\u2019on applique ces principes aux faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je signale que les deux modifications souhait\u00e9es sont distinctes, tant pour ce qui est de leur nature que de leur port\u00e9e. J\u2019ai donc examin\u00e9 chacune d\u2019elle s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le.\nL\u2019ajout de l\u2019article 14 de la Loi \u00e0 la plainte\n[27] Pour \u00e9tablir si la modification souhait\u00e9e constitue une \u00ab nouvelle plainte \u00bb ou non, le point de d\u00e9part consiste \u00e0 examiner les all\u00e9gations contest\u00e9es. Les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement de la plaignante sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 142 de son EP :\n[traduction]\n142. Au cours de l\u2019emploi qu\u2019elle a exerc\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Mme Egan a \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9e par des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e du fait de ses d\u00e9ficiences. Ces cas de harc\u00e8lement incluaient les suivants :\na) Sa chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe, Ellen Howard, s\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 plainte \u00e0 Mme Egan que l\u2019on \u00ab d\u00e9versait \u00bb chez elle tous les cas de d\u00e9ficience. C\u2019\u00e9tait Mme Howard que Mme Egan \u00e9tait cens\u00e9e consulter pour v\u00e9rifier son solde de cong\u00e9 et son niveau de salaire, car elle n\u2019avait pas acc\u00e8s au portail de libre-service des employ\u00e9s.\nb) Mme Kitchen, la personne-ressource des Ressources humaines pour ce qui \u00e9tait de la plateforme d\u2019\u00e9criture de Mme Egan, a transmis un courriel et t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Egan pour se plaindre du co\u00fbt \u00e9lev\u00e9 de cette plateforme, m\u00eame si ce co\u00fbt n\u2019\u00e9tait pas support\u00e9 par le Bureau des services fiscaux de Hamilton.\nc) La commis \u00e0 qui l\u2019on avait donn\u00e9 instruction d\u2019aider Mme Egan \u00e0 inscrire son temps, Barb Nelson, s\u2019est r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement plainte \u00e0 Mme Egan et \u00e0 leur gestionnaire, lvano Feltrin, parce que Mme Egan pr\u00e9sentait ses donn\u00e9es sous une forme incorrecte. Mme Egan \u00e9tait peu famili\u00e8re avec le formatage requis, car elle n\u2019avait pas acc\u00e8s au syst\u00e8me.\nd) La chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe de Mme Egan, Ellen Howard, a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 et diffus\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les membres de son \u00e9quipe un \u00ab Plan d\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail pour 2003-2004 \u00bb. Mme Egan et deux autres coll\u00e8gues souffrant d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience ont \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9s comme \u00ab invalides \u00bb aupr\u00e8s de tous les autres membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipe sans raison apparente. Mme Egan a \u00e9t\u00e9 embarrass\u00e9e et contrari\u00e9e par le fait d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9crite de mani\u00e8re aussi r\u00e9ductrice aupr\u00e8s de ses coll\u00e8gues alors que cela n\u2019avait manifestement rien \u00e0 voir avec les objectifs du document.\ne) Mme Egan a \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9e par le service de TI local lors des visites que ce dernier a faites \u00e0 son domicile en vue d\u2019y installer des appareils pour son bureau \u00e0 domicile. M. Tony Gazzalone et M. Brad Moore ont souvent donn\u00e9 l\u2019impression \u00e0 Mme Egan qu\u2019elle en demandait trop, alors qu\u2019ils faisaient simplement ce que la direction les avait charg\u00e9s de faire. \u00c0 une de ces occasions, M. Gazzalone a accus\u00e9 Mme Egan d\u2019avoir trop de mat\u00e9riel. Il a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 un second ordinateur \u00e0 domicile, alors qu\u2019en fait, l\u2019appareil dont il parlait \u00e9tait une d\u00e9chiqueteuse.\n[28] En plus de ces all\u00e9gations, l\u2019intim\u00e9e souligne aussi un certain nombre d\u2019autres all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement \u00e9voqu\u00e9es ailleurs dans l\u2019EP de la plaignante. Plus particuli\u00e8rement :\n[traduction]\na) l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle Mme Mary Wesko, une employ\u00e9e de Sant\u00e9 Canada, a empil\u00e9 des reliures pour que Mme Egan puisse s\u2019en servir comme plateforme (au paragraphe 7 de l\u2019EP);\nb) l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle Mme Steacy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union tenue le 29 janvier 2004, qu\u2019elle ne voulait pas \u00eatre \u00ab inond\u00e9e \u00bb de demandes de mesures d\u2019accommodement (au paragraphe 82 de l\u2019EP);\nc) l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle M. Bill Julian a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : \u00ab vous avez bien fait semblant \u00bb (au paragraphe 127 de l\u2019EP).\n[29] Bien que ces incidents ne soient pas mentionn\u00e9s dans le formulaire de plainte (FP) de la plaignante ou dans le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate (RE) de la Commission, la plaignante d\u00e9crit tout de m\u00eame un milieu de travail dans lequel elle est trait\u00e9e diff\u00e9remment de ses coll\u00e8gues de travail (FP, page 2, par. 1; page 4, par. 1 et 3; RE, al. 33c). Elle all\u00e8gue que les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019ont pas tenu compte des difficult\u00e9s associ\u00e9es \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle. Par exemple, elle d\u00e9crit une r\u00e9union tenue avec le directeur adjoint Tony Prosia et au cours de laquelle, selon ses dires, ce dernier a minimis\u00e9 tout ce qu\u2019elle avait subi et a refus\u00e9 de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle en la laissant utiliser une enregistreuse \u00e0 ruban comme moyen de prendre des notes lors de l\u2019une de leurs r\u00e9unions. La plaignante all\u00e8gue aussi que les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont fait abstraction des mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour tenir compte de la douleur chronique dont elle souffrait depuis son accident. Cela inclut les all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas tenu compte de ses demandes de t\u00e9l\u00e9travail, qui lui auraient permis de mieux g\u00e9rer sa douleur, ainsi que de ses demandes concernant une \u00e9valuation ergonomique. La plaignante conclut le formulaire de plainte en disant qu\u2019elle croit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement et de discrimination au cours de son emploi aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[30] M\u00eame si les incidents pr\u00e9cis de harc\u00e8lement ne figurent pas dans le formulaire de plainte, ces all\u00e9gations s\u2019inscrivent toutes sous un th\u00e8me plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral : les difficult\u00e9s pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es auxquelles la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9e dans ses demandes de mesures d\u2019accommodement concernant ses d\u00e9ficiences. Si l\u2019on ajoute foi \u00e0 ses all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement, les demandes de mesures d\u2019accommodement de la plaignante, aupr\u00e8s du service de TI local ou aupr\u00e8s de la personne-ressource des Ressources humaines, se sont heurt\u00e9es \u00e0 de l\u2019hostilit\u00e9, ce qui lui a souvent [traduction] \u00ab donn\u00e9 l\u2019impression qu\u2019elle en demandait trop \u00bb. Cela concorde avec l\u2019observation ant\u00e9rieure de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur de la Commission selon laquelle [traduction] \u00ab Mme Cordeiro a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Steacy \u201cfaisait sentir \u00e0 la plaignante qu\u2019elle \u2018n\u2019en valait pas la peine\u2019\u201d\u00bb (voir le rapport suppl\u00e9mentaire de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur, au paragraphe 13), de m\u00eame qu\u2019avec les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante, dans son formulaire de plainte, selon lesquelles on n\u2019avait pas tenu compte de ses autres demandes de mesures d\u2019accommodement, comme le t\u00e9l\u00e9travail et une \u00e9valuation ergonomique. La plaignante n\u2019all\u00e8gue pas qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement dans le cadre de ces demandes pr\u00e9cises de mesures d\u2019accommodement, et il est \u00e9vident que les incidents de harc\u00e8lement d\u00e9crits dans l\u2019EP de la plaignante n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s auparavant. Cependant, \u00e0 mon avis, ces incidents explicitent la plainte initiale de la plaignante et sont suffisamment li\u00e9s \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re pour satisfaire au crit\u00e8re relatif aux modifications.\n[31] Pour ce qui est de l\u2019observation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle la modification lui causera un grave pr\u00e9judice, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a amplement le temps de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces all\u00e9gations et qu\u2019elle aura amplement l\u2019occasion de le faire. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a peut-\u00eatre bien relev\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins additionnels qu\u2019elle ne pr\u00e9voyait pas appeler au d\u00e9part, mais on ne m\u2019a pas convaincu qu\u2019\u00e0 cause du d\u00e9lai, il est impossible d\u2019obtenir leur t\u00e9moignage. Il se peut qu\u2019en raison du temps qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 un certain nombre des t\u00e9moins appel\u00e9s aient de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 se souvenir des incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un point que j\u2019examinerai une fois qu\u2019ils seront appel\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je signale que je demeure comp\u00e9tent, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la totalit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve fournis, pour rejeter les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement de la plaignante si je conclus que les d\u00e9lais subis ont emp\u00each\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de r\u00e9pondre convenablement aux all\u00e9gations, ce qui compromettrait l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale du processus.\nL\u2019ajout de l\u2019article 10 de la Loi \u00e0 la plainte\n[32] En plus des all\u00e9gations susmentionn\u00e9es, l\u2019EP de la plaignante contient des all\u00e9gations concernant le d\u00e9faut de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de fournir \u00e0 la plaignante les activit\u00e9s de formation et le mat\u00e9riel accessible dont disposaient ses coll\u00e8gues voyants. Dans une section intitul\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab Acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information \u00bb, aux paragraphes 110 \u00e0 123 de son EP, la plaignante soutient, notamment, que :\n[traduction]\na) \u00e0 trois occasions distinctes sa demande d\u2019affectation int\u00e9rimaire \u00e0 un poste PM02 a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e parce que le mat\u00e9riel requis n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fourni dans un format accessible et qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas donc d\u00e9montrer sa comp\u00e9tence (paragraphe 112);\nb) il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de remplir un plan d\u2019apprentissage individuel (PAI) que l\u2019intim\u00e9e cr\u00e9ait annuellement avec chaque employ\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 faire ressortir les comp\u00e9tences que ce dernier devait am\u00e9liorer et perfectionner, car les formulaires n\u2019\u00e9taient pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s sous un format accessible (paragraphe 114);\nc) il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de suivre la formation que ses chefs d\u2019\u00e9quipe recommandaient dans le cadre du programme Campusdirect car elle \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9e de se coller le visage contre l\u2019\u00e9cran pour pouvoir en regarder le contenu et que cela \u00e9tait trop douloureux (paragraphe 115);\nd) malgr\u00e9 la promesse de son directeur d\u2019essayer de lui fournir des formulaires accessibles qui lui permettraient de faire partie d\u2019un r\u00e9pertoire de candidats pr\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s, ce qui \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour pouvoir participer \u00e0 des concours, les formulaires accessibles ne lui ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis (paragraphe 116).\n[33] La plaignante soutient que l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ces activit\u00e9s de formation et \u00e0 ce mat\u00e9riel lui aurait permis de combler ses ambitions professionnelles et que le d\u00e9faut de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard a s\u00e9rieusement nui \u00e0 ses chances de promotion, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 de la Loi.\n[34] Contrairement aux all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement, toutefois, ni le formulaire ni l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission ne traitent d\u2019une perte de chances de promotion imputable \u00e0 la discrimination exerc\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e. M\u00eame si la plaignante fait \u00e9tat du paragraphe 41 du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate, o\u00f9 il est dit que la plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab on ne lui a pas fourni d\u2019activit\u00e9s de formation qui lui \u00e9taient accessibles \u00bb, cette d\u00e9claration n\u2019est pas li\u00e9e \u00e0 une perte de chances de promotion, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e lui a fourni le mat\u00e9riel dont il pensait qu\u2019elle aurait besoin, plut\u00f4t que de l\u2019\u00e9valuer en vue de s\u2019assurer qu\u2019on lui fournissait le bon mat\u00e9riel. Cela sert seulement \u00e0 illustrer davantage les difficult\u00e9s auxquelles la plaignante s\u2019est heurt\u00e9e dans les demandes qu\u2019elle a faites \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour que l\u2019on prenne des mesures d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses d\u00e9ficiences.\n[35] Les all\u00e9gations de perte de chances de promotion sont li\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aux d\u00e9ficiences de la plaignante. Comme cette derni\u00e8re l\u2019a fait valoir : n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 la discrimination exerc\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la plaignante du fait de ses d\u00e9ficiences, cette derni\u00e8re aurait obtenu les activit\u00e9s de formation n\u00e9cessaires et, compte tenu de ses excellents ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de travail, elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 promue. Cependant, je ne crois pas que le crit\u00e8re soit aussi vaste. Le fait d\u2019adopter ce raisonnement voudrait dire que n\u2019importe quel acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante, ind\u00e9pendamment des all\u00e9gations initiales de cette derni\u00e8re ou de l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission, pourrait \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 plus tard \u00e0 la plainte. Cela ferait abstraction de l\u2019importance d\u2019un lien logique entre les faits sur lesquels la Commission a fait enqu\u00eate et les nouvelles all\u00e9gations qui, selon moi, sont lacunaires en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[36] Les probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s \u00e0 la dotation en personnel requi\u00e8rent aussi des consid\u00e9rations diff\u00e9rentes de celles qui entourent le fait de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un employ\u00e9 au sein du poste que ce dernier occupe. Outre l\u2019examen du rendement de la plaignant, il faut \u00e9galement prendre en consid\u00e9ration, notamment, le nombre et le type de processus de promotion que l\u2019employeur a entrepris au cours de la p\u00e9riode applicable, la relation entre ces processus et les activit\u00e9s de formation qui, comme l\u2019all\u00e8gue la plaignante, \u00e9taient inaccessibles \u00e0 elle ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u2019autres candidats b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant des processus, et rien de tout cela n\u2019a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate au stade de la Commission en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. \u00c0 mon avis, lancer maintenant le Tribunal dans cette voie d\u2019enqu\u00eate nouvelle et impr\u00e9vue r\u00e9sulterait en une audience plus longue et plus compliqu\u00e9e et obligerait \u00e0 analyser et \u00e0 examiner des all\u00e9gations qui d\u00e9bordent le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e au stade de la Commission. Cette demande exc\u00e8de donc la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal : Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), [1991] A.C.F. no 334 [Q.L.]. De plus, contrairement \u00e0 la situation dont il \u00e9tait question dans l\u2019affaire Gaucher, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e de ces all\u00e9gations avant de recevoir l\u2019EP de la plaignante. Faire droit \u00e0 cette modification et exiger de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qu\u2019elle d\u00e9fende ces nouvelles all\u00e9gations minerait, selon moi, l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du processus.\n[37] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter la partie de la requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte de la plaignante qui vise \u00e0 inclure l\u2019article 10 de la Loi, et je radierais les paragraphes 110 \u00e0 123 de l\u2019EP de la plaignante qui contiennent les all\u00e9gations concernant la perte de chances de promotion. Je ferai droit \u00e0 la partie de la requ\u00eate en modification qui vise \u00e0 faire ajouter \u00e0 la plainte l\u2019article 14 de la Loi.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

La plaignante all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Rogers Communications Inc., a fait preuve \u00e0 son endroit de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe, en la traitant d\u2019une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente par rapport \u00e0 d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s masculins et, en fin de compte, en la cong\u00e9diant, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP.\n[2] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision portant sur une requ\u00eate dat\u00e9e du 15 septembre 2011 par laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 qu\u2019il soit ordonn\u00e9 de rejeter la plainte. Les moyens invoqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate sont que la plaignante ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9e \u00e0 ses obligations de divulgation, qu\u2019elle a omis \u00e0 maintes reprises de se conformer aux r\u00e8gles et \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal et que, en raison de sa conduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e, tant le Tribunal que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 contrecarr\u00e9s dans leurs efforts pour faire avancer le dossier. L\u2019intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il y aura abus de proc\u00e9dure si la plainte n\u2019est pas rejet\u00e9e.\n[3] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je fais droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et je rejette la plainte.\nI. Le contexte factuel A. L\u2019historique de la correspondance et des communications [4] Le 8 avril 2011, la Commission a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal et les parties qu\u2019elle ne participerait pas \u00e0 l\u2019audience relative au fond de la plainte. Cependant, dans sa lettre, elle a mentionn\u00e9 le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es du conseiller juridique de la Commission qui \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 au dossier, au cas o\u00f9 la plaignante aurait des questions \u00e0 poser.\n[5] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il fait dans le cas de toutes les plaintes, le Tribunal a donn\u00e9 aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 de participer volontairement \u00e0 une s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation organis\u00e9e par lui, et, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, le 12 avril 2011 il a fait parvenir un \u00ab questionnaire de m\u00e9diation \u00bb aux parties (la lettre no 1), en leur demandant d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre avant le 26 avril 2011.\n[6] Le 19 avril 2011, la Commission a \u00e9crit au Tribunal pour indiquer qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 participer \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation. Le 20 avril 2011, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9crit au Tribunal pour indiquer que sa cliente ne souhaitait pas y participer. Le Tribunal n\u2019a rien re\u00e7u de la plaignante.\n[7] D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019historique de suivi du service de messagerie, ce dernier a tent\u00e9 de livrer la lettre \u00e0 la plaignante le 14 avril 2011. Le 19 avril 2011, le service de messagerie a fait une nouvelle tentative et a laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019adresse de la plaignante une carte de [traduction] \u00ab dernier avis \u00bb dans laquelle il l\u2019informait que [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019article sera renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9diteur si personne ne vient le chercher dans les 10 jours qui suivent \u00bb. La lettre a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9e au Tribunal.\n[8] Il convient de signaler que le Tribunal recourt habituellement \u00e0 un service de messagerie et au courrier recommand\u00e9 quand il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019obtenir la signature du destinataire nomm\u00e9 ou d\u2019une autre personne pour le compte de ce dernier. Cela lui permet ainsi d\u2019avoir une preuve que ses communications transmises par la poste ont bien \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ues.\n[9] Le service de m\u00e9diation du Tribunal est un r\u00e9gime volontaire; toutes les parties doivent donner leur consentement pour qu\u2019une \u00ab m\u00e9diation \u00bb ait lieu. \u00c0 cause de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une audience, sans m\u00e9diation, l\u2019absence de r\u00e9ponse de la plaignante est devenue th\u00e9orique. Le Tribunal est donc pass\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape suivante, qui consiste \u00e0 fixer les dates relatives \u00e0 la divulgation et \u00e0 la production des documents de toutes les parties en pr\u00e9vision d\u2019une audition de la plainte.\n[10] Le 28 avril 2011, par service de messagerie, le Tribunal a \u00e9crit aux parties pour leur faire part du calendrier de production de leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et de divulgation de leurs documents respectifs (lettre no 2), conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure). C\u2019\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois que ce dernier fixait un calendrier ou un \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier. Cette lettre est une lettre-type qui explique en d\u00e9tail ce qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de divulguer \u00e0 la partie adverse, soit : les \u00e9l\u00e9ments que doit contenir l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, les redressements propos\u00e9s, les listes des preuves documentaires ou des pi\u00e8ces, les listes des t\u00e9moins et des d\u00e9clarations de t\u00e9moins, y compris les experts et un calcul d\u00e9taill\u00e9 de la perte de salaire.\n[11] Les dates fix\u00e9es \u00e0 chacune des parties pour cette communication \u00e9taient les suivantes :\ni. la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne : le 10 mai 2011\nii. la plaignante, Mme Labelle : le 24 mai 2011\niii. l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Rogers Communications Inc. : le 14 juin 2011\niv. la r\u00e9plique de la plaignante : le 21 juin 2011\n[12] La lettre indiquait que les parties qui avaient besoin d\u2019aide pouvaient communiquer avec l\u2019agent du greffe du Tribunal; elle comprenait aussi le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es de l\u2019agent du greffe affect\u00e9 au dossier.\n[13] La lettre no 2 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9e au Tribunal, avec la mention [traduction] \u00ab Retour \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9diteur \u00bb. Le dossier ne pr\u00e9cise pas \u00e0 quelle date exacte le Tribunal a re\u00e7u la lettre ni l\u2019historique de suivi de cette derni\u00e8re, mais il indique toutefois que l\u2019agent du greffe s\u2019est entretenu avec la plaignante apr\u00e8s la date \u00e0 laquelle la lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9e au Tribunal; \u00e0 ce moment, la plaignante a dit avoir re\u00e7u de Postes Canada une carte d\u2019avis lui indiquant d\u2019aller chercher une lettre. Elle a de plus d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas eu le temps de le faire et que Postes Canada avait probablement retourn\u00e9 la lettre en question au Tribunal.\n[14] Le 17 mai 2011, le Tribunal a tent\u00e9 une deuxi\u00e8me fois de faire parvenir la lettre \u00e0 la plaignante. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le dossier du Tribunal, le service de messagerie a fait une premi\u00e8re tentative de livraison le 19 mai 2011. Une carte d\u2019avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019adresse de la plaignante pour lui indiquer qu\u2019il y avait une lettre qui l\u2019attendait au bureau de poste. Le 25 mai 2011, le service de messagerie a laiss\u00e9 une carte de dernier avis indiquant qu\u2019elle pouvait passer la prendre au bureau de poste et que, si cela n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fait dans les dix jours suivants, elle serait retourn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9diteur. Selon l\u2019historique de suivi, Mme Labelle est all\u00e9e chercher la lettre et en a accus\u00e9 r\u00e9ception le 2 juin 2011.\n[15] Ce qui demeure vague dans le dossier du Tribunal, c\u2019est la lettre exacte que la plaignante a re\u00e7ue; est-ce la lettre no 1 du Tribunal ou la lettre no 2 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e de nouveau \u00e0 la plaignante?\n[16] Le 24 mai 2011, par service de messagerie, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 une troisi\u00e8me lettre (la lettre no 3) \u00e0 chacune des parties pour leur faire part d\u2019un nouveau calendrier de divulgation. Comme le disait cette lettre, cette mesure avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise pour la raison suivante : [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] \u00e0 cause d\u2019une erreur, les parties n\u2019ont pas toutes re\u00e7u la lettre initiale dat\u00e9e du 28 avril 2011. Par souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers toutes les parties, de nouvelles dates de divulgation sont fix\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente \u00bb.\n[17] Les nouvelles dates fix\u00e9es pour la divulgation et la production des documents de chaque partie \u00e9taient les suivantes :\ni. la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne : le 3 juin 2011\nii. la plaignante, Mme Labelle : le 17 juin 2011\niii. l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Rogers Communications Inc. : le 8 juillet 2011\niv. la r\u00e9plique de la plaignante : le 15 juillet 2011\n[18] La Commission a produit ses documents le 31 mai 2011.\n[19] La lettre no 3 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9e de nouveau au Tribunal par le service de messagerie utilis\u00e9, soit le 3 juillet 2011, parce que personne n\u2019\u00e9tait all\u00e9 la chercher, et le Tribunal l\u2019a finalement re\u00e7ue le 7 juillet 2011.\n[20] Le 27 juin 2011, dix jours apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance fix\u00e9e pour les obligations de divulgation de la plaignante, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9crit au Tribunal pour indiquer que cette derni\u00e8re ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas conform\u00e9e \u00e0 ses obligations en mati\u00e8re de divulgation et demander que le Tribunal rejette la plainte.\n[21] Le greffe du Tribunal a tent\u00e9 de joindre la plaignante au cours des semaines du 27 juin et du 4 juillet 2011, mais sans succ\u00e8s. L\u2019agent du greffe a laiss\u00e9 des messages aux num\u00e9ros de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire et r\u00e9sidentiel de la plaignante pour demander que celle-ci communique avec le greffe du Tribunal au sujet de son dossier.\n[22] Le 6 juillet 2011, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 une autre lettre (la lettre no 4) \u00e0 la plaignante, par service de messagerie; il y faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la lettre no 3 et indiquait ne pas avoir re\u00e7u les [traduction] \u00ab pr\u00e9cisions \u00e9crites \u00bb qui \u00e9taient demand\u00e9es pour le 17 juin 2011. Une fois de plus, le Tribunal a fix\u00e9 une nouvelle date pour la plaignante, soit le 12 juillet 2011, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que cette derni\u00e8re puisse se conformer \u00e0 ses obligations de divulgation et \u00e0 ses obligations documentaires connexes.\n[23] Le 7 juillet, le greffe du Tribunal a appel\u00e9 la plaignante, Mme Labelle, et s\u2019est entretenu avec elle; il l\u2019a inform\u00e9e qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7u la lettre no 3 portant la mention [traduction] \u00ab Retour \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9diteur \u00bb. La plaignante a expliqu\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas chez elle durant la journ\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle ne pouvait donc pas accuser r\u00e9ception d\u2019une lettre livr\u00e9e par service de messagerie. Elle a demand\u00e9 que toutes les communications ult\u00e9rieures soient envoy\u00e9es par le courrier ordinaire et laiss\u00e9es dans sa bo\u00eete aux lettres, ce que le greffe du Tribunal a accept\u00e9 de faire.\n[24] De plus, lors de cette conversation, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de la requ\u00eate en rejet que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle avait omis de produire son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et de se conformer aux exigences en mati\u00e8re de divulgation que pr\u00e9voient les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure; en r\u00e9ponse, la plaignante a mis fin \u00e0 la conversion t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique.\n[25] Le 12 juillet 2011, le Tribunal n\u2019avait toujours pas re\u00e7u les documents requis. L\u2019agent du greffe du Tribunal a re\u00e7u un message vocal dans lequel la plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7u la lettre no 4 lui demandant de communiquer les documents requis et se disait [traduction] \u00ab tr\u00e8s contrari\u00e9e par cette lettre, [que] toute cette affaire \u00e9tait une farce et qu\u2019elle [voulait] parler au superviseur de l\u2019agent du greffe afin de lui faire part de son d\u00e9go\u00fbt \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des droits de la personne \u00bb.\n[26] Le 12 juillet 2011 ou vers cette date[1], l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au greffe du Tribunal pour dire qu\u2019il \u00e9tait m\u00e9content du fait que la plaignante avait obtenu une prorogation de d\u00e9lai additionnelle (accord\u00e9e dans la lettre no 4), mais pas l\u2019intim\u00e9e. L\u2019agent a expliqu\u00e9 que les lettres que le Tribunal avait ant\u00e9rieurement envoy\u00e9es \u00e0 la plaignante lui avaient toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9es avec la mention [traduction] \u00ab Retour \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9diteur \u00bb, ce qui signifiait qu\u2019elle ne les avait pas re\u00e7ues. De plus, l\u2019agent du greffe a mentionn\u00e9 que l\u2019on pouvait mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la lettre no 4 et qu\u2019une nouvelle lettre, comportant de nouvelles dates pour toutes les parties, leur serait envoy\u00e9e.\n[27] Le 12 juillet 2011, compte tenu de la nouvelle information selon laquelle la lettre no 3 que le Tribunal avait envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9e, une nouvelle lettre (dat\u00e9e du 11 juillet 2011 (la lettre no 5)), contenant une nouvelle s\u00e9rie de dates de divulgation, a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 toutes les parties. Il y \u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab \u00e0 cause de r\u00e9cents probl\u00e8mes d\u2019envoi par la poste et du fait que la plaignante n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u les lettres pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes du Tribunal, ce dernier modifie tous les d\u00e9lais de production et proroge une fois de plus les d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s pour toutes les parties \u00bb. C\u2019\u00e9tait la troisi\u00e8me fois que le Tribunal fixait un \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier, et cela repr\u00e9sentait un retard d\u2019environ deux mois au cours de la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[28] Les nouvelles dates qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9es pour chacune des parties \u00e9taient les suivantes :\ni. la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne : le 3 juin 2011\nii. la plaignante, Mme Labelle : le 26 juillet 2011\niii. l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Rogers Communications Inc. : le 16 ao\u00fbt 2011\niv. la r\u00e9plique de la plaignante : le 23 ao\u00fbt 2011\n[29] Le 26 ou le 27 juillet 2011[2], l\u2019intim\u00e9e a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019agent du greffe du Tribunal pour lui faire savoir qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait toujours pas re\u00e7u l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait m\u00e9contente des prorogations r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es que le Tribunal avait accord\u00e9es.\n[30] Le 27 juillet 2011, apr\u00e8s 21 h, le greffe du Tribunal a re\u00e7u une t\u00e9l\u00e9copie de la plaignante, soit apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9lai du 26 juillet 2011 qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante pour r\u00e9pondre aux exigences en mati\u00e8re de production et de divulgation. La lettre t\u00e9l\u00e9copi\u00e9e indiquait ceci :\n[traduction]\nDossier no 20090592\nEn r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 votre message vocal.\nEn r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette lettre, je souhaite obtenir de Rogers une ann\u00e9e de salaire \u2013 42 000 $. J\u2019ai effectivement touch\u00e9 des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi durant ce temps.\nLes documents justificatifs sont les nombreux documents que j\u2019ai plusieurs fois transmis \u00e0 diverses personnes aux droits de la personne depuis les deux derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es.\nJe travaille jusqu\u2019\u00e0 16 h et je ne suis disponible pour aucune conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avant cette heure-l\u00e0.\nDebbie Labelle\n[31] Le 5 ao\u00fbt 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a envoy\u00e9 un courriel au Tribunal pour confirmer la conversation qu\u2019elle avait eue le 27 juillet 2011 avec l\u2019agent du greffe du Tribunal, soit que la plaignante n\u2019avait pas respect\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 pour la signification et la production de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, soit le 26 juillet 2011. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9crit de plus que l\u2019agent du greffe du Tribunal l\u2019avait inform\u00e9e qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenue de signifier et de produire son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions avant l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du 16 ao\u00fbt 2011. De plus, le Tribunal lui donnerait un pr\u00e9avis raisonnable s\u2019il exigeait par la suite qu\u2019elle signifie et produise son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[32] Le m\u00eame jour, le greffe du Tribunal a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 joindre la plaignante par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Il l\u2019a inform\u00e9e qu\u2019il n\u2019avait en main aucun des documents qu\u2019elle avait peut-\u00eatre envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 la Commission parce que le Tribunal est un organisme diff\u00e9rent et que, lorsqu\u2019une plainte lui est renvoy\u00e9e, le seul document qu\u2019il re\u00e7oit de la Commission est le formulaire de plainte. L\u2019agent du greffe a mentionn\u00e9 que la lettre ou l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante \u00e9tait incomplet, car ce document n\u2019\u00e9tait pas conforme aux exigences de divulgation (\u00e9nonc\u00e9 des faits, liste de divulgation, t\u00e9moins, etc.) et que le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas en main les documents que la Commission pouvait avoir parce que ces deux organismes sont distincts.\n[33] La plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019agent du greffe du Tribunal qu\u2019elle ignorait que ces services \u00e9taient distincts, qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas pris le temps de lire les lettres qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieurement et qu\u2019elle aurait besoin de temps pour r\u00e9unir ses documents et produire son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. L\u2019agent du greffe du Tribunal a dit \u00e0 la plaignante que, si elle avait besoin d\u2019aide pour la pr\u00e9sentation proprement dite de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, il serait utile qu\u2019elle consulte l\u2019avocat de la Commission qui \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son dossier. La plaignante a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l\u2019agent qu\u2019elle allait communiquer avec l\u2019avocat aussit\u00f4t que possible, et elle s\u2019est excus\u00e9e du retard.\n[34] Le 8 ao\u00fbt 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a envoy\u00e9 au Tribunal une lettre demandant que la plainte soit rejet\u00e9e. Il ne semble pas que cette lettre ait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante ou \u00e0 la Commission.\n[35] Le 10 ao\u00fbt 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a envoy\u00e9 au Tribunal une autre lettre demandant le rejet de la plainte. Cette lettre \u00e9toffait celle du 8 ao\u00fbt 2011, et ne semble pas non plus avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante ou \u00e0 la Commission.\n[36] Le 16 ao\u00fbt 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9crit une fois de plus au Tribunal \u00e0 propos des lettres du 8 et du 10 ao\u00fbt 2011, ainsi que d\u2019un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique qu\u2019elle avait fait \u00e0 l\u2019agent du greffe du Tribunal quatre jours plus t\u00f4t. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le 16 ao\u00fbt 2011 \u00e9tait le dernier d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9e produise son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et se conforme aux exigences en mati\u00e8re de divulgation de documents et aux autres conditions que pr\u00e9voient les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne produirait pas ses documents avant le 16 ao\u00fbt 2011, car elle n\u2019avait re\u00e7u aucun document de la plaignante et n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9pondre \u00bb \u00e0 des informations qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7ues. Elle a de plus mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle attendait une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ses lettres du 8 et du 10 ao\u00fbt 2011.\n[37] Le dossier m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 ce jour-l\u00e0. J\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019agent du greffe de confirmer aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e que le Tribunal avait re\u00e7u ses r\u00e9centes lettres, et aussi que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait plus tenue de d\u00e9poser et de signifier son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, comme l\u2019exigeait le calendrier de divulgation indiqu\u00e9 dans la lettre du Tribunal du 11 juillet 2011. De plus, j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 que l\u2019on tienne une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance (CTGI) afin de discuter des lettres de requ\u00eate en rejet de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, de l\u2019historique du dossier et de la mani\u00e8re de proc\u00e9der.\n[38] L\u2019agent du greffe du Tribunal est parvenu \u00e0 joindre la plaignante par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone le 16 ao\u00fbt 2011 pour lui dire que j\u2019avais demand\u00e9 que l\u2019on tienne une CTGI sur l\u2019affaire d\u2019ici le 25 ao\u00fbt 2011.\n[39] De plus, l\u2019agent du greffe a transmis les lettres de requ\u00eate en rejet de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 la Commission, car les deux n\u2019avaient pas re\u00e7u ces documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. L\u2019agent du greffe a \u00e9galement \u00e9crit par courriel \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour l\u2019aviser de faire une copie de toute autre lettre concernant une requ\u00eate ou une objection \u00e0 l\u2019intention de la plaignante et de la Commission, en plus de l\u2019envoyer au Tribunal.\n[40] Le 19 ao\u00fbt 2011, la CTGI a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e avec toutes les parties au 25 ao\u00fbt 2011, \u00e0 17 h.\nB. La conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance du 25 ao\u00fbt [41] Le 25 ao\u00fbt 2011, la CTGI a eu lieu en pr\u00e9sence de moi-m\u00eame, d\u2019un agent du greffe du Tribunal, de la plaignante et d\u2019avocats repr\u00e9sentant l\u2019intim\u00e9e. L\u2019ordre du jour que j\u2019avais fix\u00e9 pour la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique consistait \u00e0 parler des points suivants : 1) des \u00e9claircissements sur les lettres ant\u00e9rieures du Tribunal, 2) la requ\u00eate en rejet de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et 3) les prochaines \u00e9tapes\/la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre.\n[42] J\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait, au sujet des lettres de \u00ab divulgation \u00bb ant\u00e9rieures, un certain nombre de probl\u00e8mes de communication dont il \u00e9tait important, selon moi, de discuter afin de veiller \u00e0 ce que les parties aient toutes une compr\u00e9hension commune des faits, car toutes n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mises au courant de la totalit\u00e9 des faits entourant ces lettres. J\u2019ai inform\u00e9 les parties que les deux premi\u00e8res lettres, dat\u00e9es du 28 avril et du 24 mai 2011 \u2013 les copies envoy\u00e9es \u00e0 la plaignante \u2013 avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9es au Tribunal par le service de messagerie avec la mention [traduction] \u00ab Retour \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9diteur \u00bb. J\u2019ai de plus expliqu\u00e9 que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce que j\u2019avais compris, chaque fois qu\u2019une lettre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9e au Tribunal, une nouvelle lettre contenant de nouvelles dates de divulgation avait alors \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e; par exemple, la lettre no 3 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 cause du retour de la lettre no 2 et la lettre no 4 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 cause du retour de la lettre no 3.\n[43] Mme Labelle a mentionn\u00e9 que la Commission[3] lui a envoy\u00e9 environ quatre lettres qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas re\u00e7ues. Elle n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 comment elle savait qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u ces lettres. Cependant, elle a de plus mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7u la lettre no 5. Elle a fait savoir en outre qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas chez elle durant la journ\u00e9e et qu\u2019il lui \u00e9tait impossible d\u2019accuser r\u00e9ception d\u2019une lettre recommand\u00e9e. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que si le Tribunal voulait lui envoyer quoi que ce soit d\u2019autre, il devait le faire par le courrier ordinaire.\n[44] J\u2019ai ensuite expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante que la Commission n\u2019est pas le Tribunal et que les deux sont des entit\u00e9s distinctes. De plus, tout ce qu\u2019elle avait transmis \u00e0 la Commission ne se trouvait pas n\u00e9cessairement entre les mains du Tribunal. La plaignante a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pris connaissance de cette distinction que depuis peu, apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre entretenue avec l\u2019agent du greffe du Tribunal le 5 ao\u00fbt 2011.\n[45] J\u2019ai ensuite r\u00e9sum\u00e9 la conversation qu\u2019il y avait eue entre l\u2019agent du greffe du Tribunal et la plaignante, conversation qui s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9roul\u00e9e le 7 juillet 2011 et dans laquelle la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e que le Tribunal avait re\u00e7u la lettre no 3 portant la mention [traduction] \u00ab Retour \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9diteur \u00bb.\n[46] La plaignante a dit avoir ensuite envoy\u00e9 une t\u00e9l\u00e9copie d\u2019une page \u00e0 la Commission le 25 juillet 2011 et avoir ensuite envoy\u00e9 la m\u00eame t\u00e9l\u00e9copie d\u2019une page au Tribunal le 27 juillet 2011. Ce document \u00e9tait son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. La plaignante n\u2019en a pas envoy\u00e9 une copie \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[47] J\u2019ai ensuite r\u00e9sum\u00e9 la conversation que la plaignante avait eue avec l\u2019agent du greffe du Tribunal le 5 ao\u00fbt 2011 (voir les paragraphes 32 et 33 qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent).\n[48] La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de la CTGI qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas communiqu\u00e9 avec la Commission pour obtenir de l\u2019aide, m\u00eame si, lors de son appel du 5 ao\u00fbt 2011, elle avait dit qu\u2019elle le ferait. La partie de la conversation qui s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e entre la plaignante et moi-m\u00eame est la suivante, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019enregistrement de la CTGI :\n[traduction]\nLe membre instructeur : Le 5 ao\u00fbt, notre greffe vous a parl\u00e9, Mme Labelle, pour dire que nous n\u2019avions pas re\u00e7u les documents que la Loi oblige \u00e0 divulguer. Il a mentionn\u00e9 aussi que la Commission \u00e9tait une entit\u00e9 distincte. Vous avez dit que vous n\u2019aviez pas re\u00e7u les lettres du Tribunal. Vous avez dit aussi que notre agent du greffe vous avait mentionn\u00e9 le 5 que si vous aviez besoin d\u2019aide pour remplir les documents requis, vous pouviez communiquer avec la Commission des droits de la personne. Avez-vous communiqu\u00e9 avec elle?\nLa plaignante : Je ne m\u2019en suis pas occup\u00e9e du tout.\nLe membre instructeur : Y a-t-il une raison \u00e0 cela?\nLa plaignante : Une vie assez charg\u00e9e, je m\u00e8ne une vie assez charg\u00e9e. Et je vous ai envoy\u00e9 le, comme, et en ce qui me concerne, vous avez toutes les informations. Comme j\u2019ai dit, je vous ai envoy\u00e9 probablement, pas \u00e0 vous, mais \u00e0 l\u2019autre entit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle vous avez fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, probablement dix documents environ et vous voulez que je le refasse. Je n\u2019en reviens tout simplement pas; toutes les informations que je vous ai envoy\u00e9es, vous ne les avez pas.\nLe membre instructeur : Nous sommes des organismes gouvernementaux distincts, Mme Labelle. Le comprenez-vous? Le Tribunal est comme une cour distincte de la Commission, qui est un organisme d\u2019enqu\u00eate.\nLa plaignante : Oui, je le sais, c\u2019est l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de farce avec laquelle je suis aux prises depuis deux ans, j\u2019en suis consciente.\n[49] \u00c0 ce stade de la CTGI, j\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e que je m\u2019\u00e9tais rendu compte en examinant le dossier qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mise au courant du fait que la plaignante n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u toutes les lettres envoy\u00e9es, ainsi que des motifs pour lesquels le Tribunal avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises de fixer de nouvelles dates de divulgation.\n[50] Apr\u00e8s cela, la communication avec la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 coup\u00e9e lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique; le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 que l\u2019on fasse une pause pour essayer de joindre la plaignante et de d\u00e9terminer si cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait en mesure de se joindre de nouveau \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence. L\u2019agent du greffe l\u2019a appel\u00e9e au moyen d\u2019une ligne distincte. Les deux se sont parl\u00e9s bri\u00e8vement et la plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019allait plus participer \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique. J\u2019ai donc repris la CTGI avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e et j\u2019ai d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019agent du greffe du Tribunal \u00e9tait parvenu \u00e0 joindre la plaignante et que cette derni\u00e8re avait mis fin volontairement \u00e0 sa participation \u00e0 la CTGI.\n[51] Conscient du fait que la plaignante ne participait plus \u00e0 la CTGI, j\u2019ai orient\u00e9 la discussion vers la requ\u00eate en rejet de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Celle-ci a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle voulait compl\u00e9ter les documents transmis ant\u00e9rieurement et pr\u00e9senter le tout en un seul document. Nous avons ensuite discut\u00e9 d\u2019un \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier pour la production des documents relatifs \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, et les d\u00e9lais suivants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9s :\ni. la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e : le 15 septembre 2011\nii. la r\u00e9ponse de la plaignante : le 6 octobre 2011\niii. la r\u00e9plique de l\u2019intim\u00e9e : le 27 octobre 2011\n[52] Un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la CTGI, y compris une note en gras au sujet des dates relatives \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e par courriel le lendemain, soit le 26 ao\u00fbt 2011, ainsi que par le courrier ordinaire et par courriel \u00e0 la plaignante.\nC. La correspondance et les communications additionnelles [53] Compte tenu des d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s pour la requ\u00eate, j\u2019ai donn\u00e9 instruction \u00e0 l\u2019agent du greffe du Tribunal de tenter de joindre la plaignante par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone afin de v\u00e9rifier si elle avait re\u00e7u la lettre de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la CTGI dat\u00e9e du 26 ao\u00fbt 2011. Un message lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9 le 7 septembre 2011. Au 14 septembre 2011, l\u2019agent du greffe n\u2019avait re\u00e7u aucun appel de la plaignante. J\u2019ai donc demand\u00e9 que l\u2019on recoure \u00e0 un huissier pour garantir que la plaignante recevrait une copie de la lettre de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du 26 ao\u00fbt 2011. Une copie de la lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise \u00e0 un huissier le 15 septembre 2011, et elle comprenait l\u2019adresse de la plaignante ainsi qu\u2019une demande d\u2019affidavit de signification apr\u00e8s l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la signification ou une tentative de signification. L\u2019affidavit de signification produit sous serment indique que la lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 personne, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 la plaignante Mme Deborah Labelle, le 21 septembre 2011, \u00e0 son lieu de r\u00e9sidence.\n[54] Le 16 septembre 2011, la plaignante a laiss\u00e9 un message vocal \u00e0 l\u2019agent du greffe du Tribunal. Elle lui a fait part de sa col\u00e8re face \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7ue. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle \u00e9tait en col\u00e8re contre le Tribunal pour avoir cens\u00e9ment transmis tous ses documents \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Voici en partie le contenu de son message : [traduction] \u00ab Je viens tout juste de recevoir une lettre des avocats de Rogers au sujet de leur requ\u00eate en rejet, et ce que je vois me pr\u00e9occupe beaucoup. Il semble que vous ayez remis \u00e0 la partie adverse la totalit\u00e9 des documents que j\u2019ai transmis \u00e0 l\u2019avocat des droits de la personne, et j\u2019en suis profond\u00e9ment d\u00e9go\u00fbt\u00e9e. Je croyais qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019informations exclusives entre moi-m\u00eame et l\u2019avocat \u00bb. La plaignante a ensuite d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019une violation de son droit \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e, elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 parler au superviseur de l\u2019agent du greffe et elle a demand\u00e9, pour la forme, s\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 d\u2019un [traduction] \u00ab autre plan pour s\u2019assurer qu\u2019elle [l\u2019intim\u00e9e] aurait gain de cause? \u00bb.\n[55] Le m\u00eame jour, le Tribunal a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la plaignante, avec copie \u00e0 toutes les parties, pour expliquer qu\u2019il n\u2019avait transmis aucun des renseignements ou des documents qu\u2019elle avait fournis \u00e0 l\u2019avocat \u00e0 la Commission. Le seul document que le Tribunal avait transmis \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait la t\u00e9l\u00e9copie du 27 juillet 2011 de la plaignante, qui \u00e9tait cens\u00e9e \u00eatre son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions (voir le paragraphe 30). La lettre indiquait que le Tribunal n\u2019avait en main aucun des documents que la plaignante avait fournis \u00e0 la Commission. De plus, elle r\u00e9it\u00e9rait que le Tribunal et la Commission sont des entit\u00e9s distinctes. Enfin, le Tribunal informait la plaignante que si elle avait des doutes quelconques au sujet de la divulgation des documents qu\u2019elle avait fournis \u00e0 la Commission, elle devait communiquer avec l\u2019avocat de la Commission qui \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son dossier.\n[56] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa requ\u00eate en rejet et sa r\u00e9plique dans le d\u00e9lai qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement fix\u00e9. La plaignante a elle aussi envoy\u00e9 sa r\u00e9ponse dans le d\u00e9lai ant\u00e9rieurement fix\u00e9.\nII. Les positions des parties A. Les arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en faveur de la requ\u00eate [57] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations sur les conclusions de l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission ainsi que sur le rapport que l\u2019enqu\u00eateur de la Commission a produit. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l\u2019enqu\u00eateur a recommand\u00e9 que la Commission rejette la plainte parce que, selon lui, la plaignante ne semblait pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable et le cong\u00e9diement de cette derni\u00e8re ne semblait pas \u00eatre li\u00e9 \u00e0 un motif vis\u00e9 par la Loi.\n[58] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait valoir de plus que la plaignante n\u2019avait pas respect\u00e9 la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal et qu\u2019elle l\u2019avait contrecarr\u00e9e. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure et sur la Note de pratique no 3 du Tribunal, lesquelles fixent les exigences qui sont impos\u00e9es \u00e0 chaque partie en vue de faire valoir leur cas respectif. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait valoir que le fait de ne pas se conformer aux R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure, et pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019obligation qu\u2019a la partie plaignante de produire un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, rend une plainte injustifi\u00e9e. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de cet argument, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a dress\u00e9 la liste des lettres et des dates de d\u00e9p\u00f4t que le Tribunal avait fix\u00e9es et que la plaignante n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9es.\n[59] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait valoir de plus que [traduction] \u00ab le Tribunal a le pouvoir inh\u00e9rent d\u2019\u00eatre ma\u00eetre de sa proc\u00e9dure, ce qui inclut le pouvoir de rejeter une plainte \u00bb.\n[60] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient \u00e9galement qu\u2019il y a eu pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de Rogers, de m\u00eame qu\u2019un pr\u00e9judice potentiel \u00e0 la r\u00e9putation du r\u00e9gime canadien des droits de la personne. Le pr\u00e9judice que Rogers a subi est le fait d\u2019avoir support\u00e9 des frais juridiques consid\u00e9rables qui ne peuvent pas \u00eatre recouvr\u00e9s et le fait qu\u2019il serait injuste de permettre \u00e0 la plaignante de faire fi des r\u00e8gles et de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal tout en obligeant Rogers \u00e0 s\u2019y conformer.\n[61] En ce qui concerne la r\u00e9putation du r\u00e9gime canadien des droits de la personne, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plaignante [traduction] \u00ab abuse des ressources publiques restreintes dont dispose le r\u00e9gime canadien des droits de la personne pour poursuivre sa vengeance personnelle contre Rogers, ce qui n\u2019est pas le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019un acte de discrimination fond\u00e9 sur un motif prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par la Loi. Mme Labelle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir fourni \u00e0 la Commission la totalit\u00e9 des informations qu\u2019elle poss\u00e8de \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa plainte. Comme Mme Labelle n\u2019a pas d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour justifier sa plainte, le fait d\u2019entendre cette derni\u00e8re serait un usage inefficace des ressources restreintes du Tribunal \u00bb.\nB. Les contre-arguments de la plaignante [62] La plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019a jamais re\u00e7u les quatre premi\u00e8res lettres du Tribunal et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a donc jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 mise au courant des d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s pour se conformer aux obligations de divulgation ainsi qu\u2019aux obligations de pr\u00e9paration et de production de documents que lui imposent les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure.\n[63] La plaignante soutient \u00e9galement qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir finalement re\u00e7u une lettre du Tribunal lui faisant part de ses obligations elle s\u2019y est conform\u00e9e, mais qu\u2019elle a plus tard appris que ses documents \u00e9taient incomplets. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle tenait pour acquis que tous ses documents ant\u00e9rieurs[4] se trouvaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 entre les mains du Tribunal. Elle soutient que ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en ao\u00fbt 2011 qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e que le Tribunal n\u2019avait aucun des documents qu\u2019elle avait fournis ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la Commission.\n[64] La plaignante soutient de plus qu\u2019on l\u2019a inform\u00e9e qu\u2019elle pouvait communiquer avec la Commission pour obtenir de l\u2019aide, mais qu\u2019elle ne rentre pas chez elle avant 16 h 30 ou 17 h et que son exp\u00e9rience lui a montr\u00e9 que le personnel de la Commission quitte le bureau entre 16 h et 16 h 30.\n[65] La plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle vit avec deux adolescentes, qui v\u00e9rifient \u00e0 plusieurs reprises les messages re\u00e7us avant que la plaignante rentre chez elle, et qu\u2019elle n\u2019est donc jamais mise au courant des messages qu\u2019on lui laisse. Elle ajoute que si elle ne re\u00e7oit pas les lettres ou les messages, cela veut dire qu\u2019elle ne peut pas savoir que l\u2019on exige quelque chose d\u2019elle.\n[66] En ce qui concerne la CTGI du 25 ao\u00fbt 2011, la plaignante soutient que [traduction] \u00ab mon cellulaire a coup\u00e9 l\u2019appel. Compte tenu de la fa\u00e7on dont M. Nixon [l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e] se comportait lors de la conf\u00e9rence, j\u2019ai refus\u00e9 de me joindre de nouveau \u00e0 l\u2019appel pour l\u2019entendre poursuivre le m\u00eame harc\u00e8lement qu\u2019il nous faisait subir \u00bb.\n[67] La plaignante soutient avoir fourni des preuves irr\u00e9futables \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa demande. En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait des d\u00e9clarations trompeuses.\n[68] La plaignante all\u00e8gue que la derni\u00e8re communication qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7ue du Tribunal avait trait \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucune autre demande du Tribunal au sujet de la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019autres observations.\n[69] La plaignante soutient ce qui suit au sujet de sa connaissance de la proc\u00e9dure : [traduction] \u00ab [e]t j\u2019aimerais aussi souligner qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de profane, l\u2019expression \u201cexpos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions\u201d ne me dit pas grand-chose. Nous, les profanes, faisons du mieux que nous pouvons lorsqu\u2019une demande est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. S\u2019il fallait encore produire d\u2019autres renseignements, j\u2019aurais d\u00fb en \u00eatre inform\u00e9e par le Tribunal, au lieu de l\u2019apprendre de Rogers \u00bb.\n[70] Enfin, la plaignante fait valoir et conclut ce qui suit au sujet de sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate : [traduction] \u00ab [e]t, comme je l\u2019ai dit plus t\u00f4t, ce document ne va qu\u2019\u00e0 la Commission. Je n\u2019enverrai aucun renseignement \u00e0 Rogers \u00bb.\nIII. Analyse [71] Le r\u00f4le de la Commission consiste \u00e0 faire enqu\u00eate sur une plainte et \u00e0 d\u00e9cider, \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion, s\u2019il y a lieu de la renvoyer au Tribunal afin qu\u2019il l\u2019instruise. Une partie ne peut soumettre une d\u00e9cision de la Commission \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le judiciaire qu\u2019aupr\u00e8s de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait une occasion de solliciter le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission, mais elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas le faire. Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas un organe d\u2019appel aupr\u00e8s duquel une partie peut interjeter appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Commission, pas plus que le Tribunal n\u2019a comp\u00e9tence pour examiner une d\u00e9cision de la Commission (Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada (Section locale 70396) c. Mus\u00e9e canadien des civilisations, 2006 TCDP 1, au paragraphe 27; International Longshore & Warehouse Union (Section maritime), Local 400 c. Oster, [2001] ACF no 1533, 2001 CFPI 1115, au paragraphe 29; Tweten c. RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd., [2004] DCDP no 14, 2004 TCDP 8, au paragraphe 17) (paragraphe 27).\n[72] Cela \u00e9tant, je n\u2019accorde aucun poids \u00e0 cet aspect des arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[73] Le paragraphe 1(5) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure indique ce qui suit : \u00ab [\u00e0] moins que le membre instructeur n\u2019accorde une prorogation ou un ajournement, tous les d\u00e9lais \u00e9tablis pour l\u2019observation des pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles et toutes les dates fix\u00e9es relativement \u00e0 des audiences, \u00e0 des requ\u00eates ou \u00e0 des conf\u00e9rences pr\u00e9paratoires sont imp\u00e9ratifs \u00bb.\n[74] \u00c0 aucun moment au cours de l\u2019instance la plaignante a-t-elle demand\u00e9 un ajournement ou une prorogation de d\u00e9lai pour pouvoir s\u2019acquitter de ses obligations en mati\u00e8re de production et de divulgation. Tout en reconnaissant qu\u2019il y avait eu quelques lettres envoy\u00e9es par la poste qui fixaient les [traduction] \u00ab dates d\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance \u00bb avant lesquelles la plaignante \u00e9tait tenue de fournir ses documents, et que cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7ues, il existe aussi une preuve que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise au courant de ses responsabilit\u00e9s par des messages vocaux laiss\u00e9s \u00e0 son attention ainsi que par des conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques tenues avec le greffe du Tribunal les 7 juillet et 5 ao\u00fbt 2011. De plus, la plaignante a dit avoir re\u00e7u la lettre no 5 du Tribunal, laquelle comportait aussi des dates \u00e0 respecter pour la production de ses documents. Elle a omis de respecter ces dates et n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 une prorogation de d\u00e9lai.\n[75] La plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise au courant, par la Commission et par le Tribunal, que son dossier avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis au Tribunal. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise au courant que des lettres lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9es, par service de messagerie, et qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait jamais all\u00e9e les chercher. La plaignante a dit qu\u2019elle travaillait \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de chez elle durant la journ\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle ne pouvait donc pas se trouver chez elle pour accuser r\u00e9ception de lettres recommand\u00e9es; elle avait pu toutefois le faire le 2 juin 2011. La d\u00e9cision qu\u2019a prise la plaignante de ne pas aller chercher les autres lettres recommand\u00e9es qu\u2019on lui avait envoy\u00e9es a contrecarr\u00e9 les efforts faits par le Tribunal pour faire avancer sa plainte et constitue une r\u00e9pudiation des proc\u00e9dures du Tribunal.\n[76] Les faits dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce s\u2019apparentent \u00e0 ceux dont il est question dans l\u2019affaire Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2009 TCDP 31 (CanLII), o\u00f9 il est mentionn\u00e9, au paragraphe 20 :\nUne partie qui demande l\u2019autorisation du Tribunal de pr\u00e9senter des documents apr\u00e8s que le d\u00e9lai prescrit est \u00e9coul\u00e9 doit au moins \u00eatre en mesure de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il y avait une justification valide pour ce d\u00e9p\u00f4t tardif.La raison invoqu\u00e9e par la plaignante pour ne pas avoir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses documents dans le d\u00e9lai prescrit est qu\u2019elle n\u2019a jamais re\u00e7u la correspondance du Tribunal. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 de plus qu\u2019elle avait transmis des documents \u00e0 la Commission et qu\u2019elle estimait que c\u2019\u00e9tait suffisant. Il ne s\u2019agit pas l\u00e0 d\u2019une justification valide, compte tenu surtout de la preuve que repr\u00e9sentent les appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques qu\u2019elle a eus avec le greffe du Tribunal et dans lesquels il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question des d\u00e9lais de production qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas respect\u00e9s et d\u2019une clarification des distinctions entre la Commission et le Tribunal. Par ailleurs, la d\u00e9cision d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de la plaignante de ne pas aller chercher le courrier recommand\u00e9 n\u2019est pas une justification valide.\n[77] Dans la d\u00e9cision Johnston c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2007 TCDP 42 (CanLII), le Tribunal a reconnu les deux approches qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies en ce qui concerne les rejets pour cause de retard et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9es plus t\u00f4t dans la d\u00e9cision Seitz c. Canada, 2002 CFPI 456.\n[78] La premi\u00e8re approche, \u00e0 laquelle on donne parfois le nom de crit\u00e8re \u00ab classique \u00bb, a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Nichols c. Canada, [1990] A.C.F. no 567 (C.F. 1re inst.)(Q.L.). Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un crit\u00e8re \u00e0 trois volets qui consiste, premi\u00e8rement, \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a eu un retard excessif, deuxi\u00e8mement, si le retard est inexcusable et, troisi\u00e8mement, si les d\u00e9fendeurs sont susceptibles de subir un pr\u00e9judice grave en raison de ce retard (Seitz, au paragraphe 10).\n[79] La seconde approche est celle qui s\u2019applique dans les circonstances o\u00f9 les plaideurs \u00ab ne tien[nent] absolument aucun compte \u00bb des d\u00e9lais pr\u00e9vus dans les r\u00e8gles de la Cour (Seitz, aux paragraphes 16 \u00e0 18). C\u2019est de cette fa\u00e7on que la plaignante, selon moi, s\u2019est comport\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[80] Comme il est r\u00e9sum\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Johnston :\nIl est soulign\u00e9 dans Seitz que ce d\u00e9faut doit \u00eatre jug\u00e9 non seulement \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 une partie, mais aussi du pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la justice. Lorsqu\u2019une action est laiss\u00e9e trop longtemps dormante, cela constitue un abus de la justice, ce qui est distinct du pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par un retard excessif et inexcusable, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui doivent \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration dans le cadre du crit\u00e8re \u00ab classique \u00bb. Il est not\u00e9 dans Seitz que ce d\u00e9faut donne lieu \u00e0 un abus de proc\u00e9dure et constitue un motif de rejeter la demande.Voir \u00e9galement les d\u00e9cisions Grovit and Others c. Doctor and Others, [1997] 1 W.L.R. 640 et Trusthouse Forte California Inc. c. Gateway Soap and Chemical Co., 1998 CanLII 8897 (CF), 1998 CanLII 8897.\n[81] Je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019on peut prendre en consid\u00e9ration la seconde approche expos\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Seitz au vu des faits qui m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Il m\u2019appara\u00eet clairement que la plaignante ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9e aux d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s par le Tribunal en vue de faire avancer sa plainte. Le Tribunal a fait de nombreux efforts pour faire part des d\u00e9lais \u00e0 la plaignante, et il lui a accord\u00e9 de nombreuses prorogations. La CTGI du 25 ao\u00fbt 2011 est une autre occasion que le Tribunal a accord\u00e9e pour permettre \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019expliquer si le Tribunal avait une adresse postale inexacte ou si la plaignante avait une adresse courriel ou un num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible d\u2019utiliser pour lui envoyer du courrier, et elle a \u00e9galement eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019expliquer au Tribunal les faits qu\u2019elle consid\u00e9rait comme pertinents quant \u00e0 la raison pour laquelle elle n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u les lettres du Tribunal ni communiqu\u00e9 avec ce dernier en vue de faire avancer son dossier.\n[82] En fin de compte, il incombe au Tribunal de veiller \u00e0 ce que toutes les parties b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient des principes de justice naturelle et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal a pris les mesures suivantes pour s\u2019assurer que l\u2019on traitait \u00e9quitablement la plaignante :\n\u2022 il lui a accord\u00e9 plusieurs prorogations de d\u00e9lai pour qu\u2019elle puisse se conformer \u00e0 ses obligations en mati\u00e8re de divulgation et de production;\n\u2022 il a communiqu\u00e9 avec elle \u00e0 plusieurs occasions par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et lui a fait part de ses obligations;\n\u2022 il a communiqu\u00e9 avec elle et lui a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle pouvait obtenir de l\u2019aide de la Commission pour pouvoir s\u2019acquitter de ses obligations en mati\u00e8re de production et de divulgation;\n\u2022 il lui a donn\u00e9 une occasion d\u2019expliquer pourquoi elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas all\u00e9e chercher ou n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u les lettres qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9es par la poste;\n\u2022 il lui a donn\u00e9 une occasion d\u2019expliquer pourquoi elle n\u2019avait pas fait avancer son dossier et comment elle entendait le faire.\n[83] Il est loisible au Tribunal de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de sa proc\u00e9dure contre tout abus caus\u00e9 par le fait qu\u2019une partie ne respecte pas les d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s et ne se conforme pas aux R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure. Il incombe \u00e0 la plaignante de faire valoir sa plainte et de se conformer aux d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s. Les mesures suivantes que la plaignante a prises en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce montrent que cette derni\u00e8re a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas faire avancer son dossier, et il s\u2019agit donc de manquements selon le second crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Seitz :\n\u2022 le fait qu\u2019elle ne se soit conform\u00e9e \u00e0 aucun des d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s par le Tribunal, m\u00eame quand ce dernier les avait prorog\u00e9s;\n\u2022 le fait et sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas \u00eatre all\u00e9 chercher le courrier que le Tribunal lui avait envoy\u00e9 par service de messagerie;\n\u2022 le fait et sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas avoir demand\u00e9 l\u2019aide de la Commission pour pr\u00e9parer et pr\u00e9senter les documents qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait tenue de produire aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal et de divulguer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e;\n\u2022 le fait de ne pas avoir demand\u00e9 au Tribunal des prorogations de d\u00e9lai en apprenant que des d\u00e9lais \u00e9taient expir\u00e9s;\n\u2022 le fait de ne pas avoir particip\u00e9 pleinement \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance le 25 ao\u00fbt 2011;\n\u2022 le fait de ne pas s\u2019\u00eatre conform\u00e9e aux R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure ni s\u2019\u00eatre assur\u00e9e que les documents qu\u2019elle d\u00e9posait seraient \u00e9galement signifi\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, car elle a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne le ferait pas dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate.\n[84] Lors de la CTGI du 25 ao\u00fbt 2011, la plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle savait que le Tribunal avait tent\u00e9 de lui renvoyer ses lettres par service de messagerie, mais elle n\u2019a pu donner aucune raison raisonnable ou excusable pour ne pas avoir fait l\u2019effort d\u2019aller les chercher. La plaignante admet \u00e9galement dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre fin \u00e0 sa participation \u00e0 la CTGI. Je conclus que ces mesures, y compris celles qui sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es ci-dessus, constituent une r\u00e9pudiation, de la part de la plaignante, de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal.\n[85] Je dois mentionner que si le Tribunal devait fixer une date d\u2019audience pour la tenue d\u2019une audience sur la plainte dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019intim\u00e9e se trouverait dans une situation dans laquelle la plaignante n\u2019a pas divulgu\u00e9 un seul document, n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des documents suffisants et satisfaisants aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal, et n\u2019a pas divulgu\u00e9 la liste de ses t\u00e9moins ou l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions exposant sa plainte. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ne saurait pas quels arguments ou quels faits elle aurait \u00e0 r\u00e9futer, quels t\u00e9moins elle aurait \u00e0 appeler pour r\u00e9futer les faits de la plaignante et quels autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve elle aurait \u00e0 avancer en vue de pr\u00e9parer sa cause de mani\u00e8re efficace.\n[86] Dans la d\u00e9cision Kuhlmann c. Westcan Bulk Transport Ltd., 2007 TCDP 50 (CanLII), la plaignante s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience sans s\u2019\u00eatre conform\u00e9e aux obligations de divulgation que lui imposaient les r\u00e8gles du Tribunal. L\u2019extrait suivant d\u00e9crit la situation dans laquelle se trouverait l\u2019intim\u00e9e, selon moi, si elle \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9e de compara\u00eetre \u00e0 une telle audience :\n[18] Mme Kuhlmann arrive aujourd\u2019hui \u00e0 l\u2019audience sans avoir divulgu\u00e9 le moindre document et sans s\u2019\u00eatre conform\u00e9e \u00e0 aucune de ses obligations de divulgation. Existe-t-il des \u00ab circonstances exceptionnelles \u00bb en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qui justifieraient de lui permettre de pr\u00e9senter sa cause sans s\u2019\u00eatre acquitt\u00e9e de ses obligations de divulgation? Je n\u2019en vois aucune. Au contraire, comme le souligne l\u2019intim\u00e9, ce dernier se trouve dans [traduction] \u00ab une situation tout \u00e0 fait ind\u00e9fendable \u00bb. Il doit retenir les services d\u2019experts et d\u00e9penser du temps et de l\u2019argent pour bien se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l\u2019audience, sans savoir ce qu\u2019il doit r\u00e9futer. En fait, il n\u2019a pas pu se pr\u00e9parer pour l\u2019audience d\u00e9butant aujourd\u2019hui. En outre, rien ne prouve que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a omis de s\u2019acquitter de ses obligations dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. Par exemple, compte tenu de l\u2019omission de la plaignante de divulguer sa preuve, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal l\u2019autorisation d\u2019\u00eatre exempt\u00e9 de divulguer sa preuve \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu qu\u2019il le fasse.\n[19] La seule explication que Mme Kuhlmann semble apporter pour justifier son omission de s\u2019acquitter de ses obligations de divulgation est son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir une r\u00e9ponse satisfaisante de la Commission relativement aux questions qu\u2019elle lui a pos\u00e9es. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un facteur pertinent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Mme Kuhlmann sait au moins depuis avril 2007 que la Commission ne compara\u00eetra pas. Si elle voulait quand m\u00eame faire entendre sa plainte, il lui incombait de concentrer ses efforts sur la proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal. Elle ne l\u2019a pas fait. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne vois aucune raison de la d\u00e9charger se ses obligations de divulgation. En vertu du paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles, et compte tenu de son omission totale de divulguer sa preuve, il est interdit \u00e0 Mme Kuhlmann de produire des preuves \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa plainte, de soulever des questions de droit qui en d\u00e9coule, d\u2019assigner des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre ou de demander tout redressement.\n[20] Je ne vois pas non plus de raison d\u2019ajourner la pr\u00e9sente affaire pour permettre \u00e0 Mme Kuhlmann de se conformer \u00e0 ses obligations de divulgation. Elle a eu amplement l\u2019occasion de s\u2019y conformer au cours des deux derniers mois. Il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises qu\u2019elle devait satisfaire \u00e0 ces exigences et elle a choisi de ne pas le faire. Les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en place pour assurer une ex\u00e9cution juste et diligente de la proc\u00e9dure applicable aux audiences devant le Tribunal. On ne peut les n\u00e9gliger ni les mettre cavali\u00e8rement de c\u00f4t\u00e9 simplement parce qu\u2019une partie a choisi de ne pas s\u2019y conformer. Toutes les parties sont tenues de respecter les R\u00e8gles et les directives du Tribunal, qu\u2019elles soient la partie intim\u00e9e ou plaignante.\n[87] Je suis d\u2019avis que cet ensemble de circonstances serait in\u00e9quitable pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e et que le fait d\u2019\u00eatre oblig\u00e9e de se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 une telle audience lui causerait pr\u00e9judice.\n[88] Pour tous les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je fais donc droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e; la plainte est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSusheel Gupta\nVice-pr\u00e9sident du tribunal\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 29 f\u00e9vrier 2012\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal: T1655\/01011\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause: Deborah P.

Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement international et Sant\u00e9 Canada, 2011 TCDP 13 [Cruden].\n[2] Le 24 novembre 2011, l\u2019avocate de Mme Bronwyn Cruden (la plaignante) a demand\u00e9 des \u00e9claircissements au sujet de la mise en \u0153uvre de la mesure de redressement ordonn\u00e9e par le Tribunal au paragraphe 176 de la d\u00e9cision Cruden, \u00e0 savoir :\n[C]onform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la LCDP, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI de d\u00e9ployer la plaignante \u00e0 la DGPG au niveau PM\u201106 et de prendre avec elle les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour l\u2019affecter dans un pays ami, faisant partie de ses trois premiers choix o\u00f9 il y a des installations m\u00e9dicales appropri\u00e9es et o\u00f9 elle ne sera soumise \u00e0 aucune restriction m\u00e9dicale.\n(Cruden, paragraphe 176)\n[3] Dans le cas d\u2019une ordonnance rendue en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H-6 [la Loi], la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire \u2013 en l\u2019occurrence l\u2019Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement international (l\u2019ACDI ou l\u2019intim\u00e9e) \u2013 est tenue d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la victime, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les chances dont l\u2019acte l\u2019a priv\u00e9e. La question qui requiert pr\u00e9sentement des \u00e9claircissements est le moment o\u00f9 l\u2019on doit appliquer l\u2019obligation de d\u00e9ployer la plaignante \u00e0 un pays ami, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire celui o\u00f9 il y a lieu d\u2019accorder \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les chances dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e.\n[4] Le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2011, le Tribunal a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas functus officio et qu\u2019il demeurait saisi de l\u2019affaire pour ce qui est de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019ordonnance en litige (Bronwyn Cruden c. Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement international et Sant\u00e9 Canada, 2011 TCDP 21). Il a toutefois demand\u00e9 aux parties de lui fournir des observations additionnelles afin de pouvoir trancher l\u2019affaire.\n[5] Apr\u00e8s avoir pris en consid\u00e9ration les observations additionnelles des parties, le Tribunal a eu besoin de plus amples explications sur les informations qu\u2019elles contenaient. Vu la nature technique et factuelle du litige opposant les parties, le Tribunal a convoqu\u00e9 une audience en vue d\u2019entendre les parties. Cette audience a eu lieu le 16 janvier 2012.\nLe droit applicable et l\u2019analyse\n[6] La Loi est de nature r\u00e9paratrice et \u00ab [\u2026] ne vise pas \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la faute ni \u00e0 punir une conduite \u00bb (Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 RCS 84, au paragraphe 13 [Robichaud]). Son objet principal est plut\u00f4t de \u00ab [\u2026] d\u00e9celer les actes discriminatoires et [\u2026] les supprimer \u00bb (Robichaud, au paragraphe 13). Pour supprimer ces actes discriminatoires, \u00ab il faut que les redressements soient efficaces et compatibles avec la nature \u201cquasi constitutionnelle\u201d des droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s \u00bb (Robichaud, au paragraphe 13). Pour que ces redressements soient \u00ab efficaces \u00bb, la Loi prescrit qu\u2019une mesure de redressement ordonn\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) doit \u00eatre mise en \u0153uvre \u00ab [\u2026] d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent \u00bb. Cela d\u00e9pend des circonstances de chaque affaire particuli\u00e8re; toutefois, l\u2019emploi du mot \u00ab d\u00e8s \u00bb dans cet alin\u00e9a d\u00e9note que la mise en \u0153uvre de la mesure de redressement ne doit pas \u00eatre retard\u00e9e, sauf s\u2019il serait d\u00e9raisonnable de le faire.\n[7] La plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour deux affectations au Vietnam en pr\u00e9vision du cycle d\u2019affectations de 2012, soit un poste de niveau PM\u201106 : chef de la coop\u00e9ration (ASI\u20111257), et un poste de niveau PM\u20115 : agent principal de d\u00e9veloppement international (ASI\u201117678). Sa candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e dans les deux cas parce qu\u2019elle ne poss\u00e9dait pas l\u2019exp\u00e9rience essentielle requise.\n[8] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la plaignante ne d\u00e9tient qu\u2019une des quatre qualifications essentielles que requiert l\u2019affectation ASI\u20111257. Elle manque d\u2019exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re de gestion de programmes ou d\u2019enjeux cl\u00e9s dans le domaine du d\u00e9veloppement international, elle manque d\u2019exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re de liaison avec les intervenants et elle manque d\u2019exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re de formulation et de prestation de conseils et de recommandations strat\u00e9giques \u00e0 l\u2019intention des gestionnaires sup\u00e9rieurs. Pour ce qui est de l\u2019affectation ASI\u201117978, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plaignante n\u2019a pas d\u2019exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re de collaboration avec des repr\u00e9sentants de gouvernements \u00e9trangers ou des organisations internationales. Elle ajoute que la candidature de la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces affectations a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par un jury, qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9e pour passer \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du processus. Pour ce qui est de l\u2019argument selon lequel la plaignante serait en mesure d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir l\u2019exp\u00e9rience voulue avant d\u2019obtenir une affectation en 2012, l\u2019ACDI soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas assez de temps pour avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une combinaison de formation structur\u00e9e et d\u2019exp\u00e9rience concr\u00e8te. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9clare que le Tribunal doit tenir compte du fait que l\u2019ACDI est la mieux plac\u00e9e pour \u00e9valuer les exigences de l\u2019affectation et les qualifications de la plaignante. Se fondant sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Dunsmuir c. Nouveau-Brunswick, 2008 CSC 9 [Dunsmuir], elle affirme que le Tribunal se doit d\u2019appliquer une norme d\u00e9f\u00e9rente \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019ACDI selon laquelle la plaignante ne devrait pas recevoir une affectation au cours du cycle de 2012.\n[9] La plaignante est d\u2019avis qu\u2019elle poss\u00e8de les qualifications essentielles que requi\u00e8rent les affectations de 2012, car elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9e pour faire partie du basin de candidats \u00e0 une affectation en 2010 pour laquelle les exigences essentielles \u00e9taient les m\u00eames. Subsidiairement, la candidature et le curriculum vitae de la plaignante \u00e9tablissent qu\u2019elle poss\u00e8de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience essentielle que les deux postes exigent. Le domaine dans lequel elle a moins d\u2019exp\u00e9rience est li\u00e9 aux qualifications qu\u2019il n\u2019est possible d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir que sur le terrain; toutefois, ce manque d\u2019exp\u00e9rience sur le terrain est le \u00ab pr\u00e9judice \u00bb que l\u2019ordonnance vise \u00e0 corriger et on ne peut donc pas s\u2019en servir comme motif pour repousser \u00e0 2013 la d\u00e9cision de lui accorder une affectation. La plaignante ajoute que rien ne prouve qu\u2019il est impossible d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir les comp\u00e9tences ou les connaissances qu\u2019exige une affectation fructueuse au cours des six mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le d\u00e9but des affectations.\n[10] Selon moi, l\u2019arr\u00eat Dunsmuir est inutile pour ce qui est de trancher la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Cet arr\u00eat examine la \u00ab raisonnabilit\u00e9 \u00bb en tant que norme de contr\u00f4le applicable aux d\u00e9cisions administratives qui sont soumises \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, nous ne contr\u00f4lons pas une d\u00e9cision de l\u2019ACDI; nous tentons plut\u00f4t de trouver un moyen juste et appropri\u00e9 de mettre en \u0153uvre la mesure de redressement que le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9e et de supprimer l\u2019acte discriminatoire dont la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime.\n[11] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la totalit\u00e9 des observations des parties au sujet de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, y compris les arguments oraux et les t\u00e9moignages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019audience, j\u2019accepte qu\u2019il serait d\u00e9raisonnable, vu les circonstances actuelles, d\u2019affecter la plaignante au Vietnam pour le cycle de 2012. Le t\u00e9moin de l\u2019ACDI \u00e0 l\u2019audience, Lise Filliatrault, qui exerce les fonctions de directrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale r\u00e9gionale pour les Am\u00e9riques \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI, a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des informations dignes de foi sur le genre d\u2019exp\u00e9rience qu\u2019il faut pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment poss\u00e9der pour pouvoir ex\u00e9cuter avec succ\u00e8s les deux affectations au Vietnam et sur les raisons pour lesquelles la plaignante ne poss\u00e9dait pas l\u2019exp\u00e9rience n\u00e9cessaire. Le chef de la coop\u00e9ration est la personne la plus haut plac\u00e9e dans le pays; cette personne supervise une \u00e9quipe et donne des directives aux agents principaux de d\u00e9veloppement, et elle remplace au besoin le chef des missions ou un ambassadeur. La plaignante ne poss\u00e8de pas la vaste exp\u00e9rience de trois ans qui est exig\u00e9e en ce qui concerne la gestion des finances, du mat\u00e9riel et des ressources humaines dans le cadre d\u2019un projet men\u00e9 sur le terrain. Pour le poste d\u2019agent principal de d\u00e9veloppement, la plaignante n\u2019a pas l\u2019exp\u00e9rience d\u2019une ann\u00e9e qu\u2019il faut avoir acquise en mati\u00e8re de collaboration avec des repr\u00e9sentants de gouvernements \u00e9trangers ou des organisations internationales.\n[12] La plaignante a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9e pour faire partie d\u2019un basin de candidats \u00e0 des affectations \u00e0 un poste de niveau PM\u201105 en 2010, mais Lise Filliatrault a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019ACDI n\u2019utilise plus cette banque de candidats disponibles. L\u2019organisation applique actuellement un plan de d\u00e9centralisation triennal. Selon Mme Filliatrault, cette d\u00e9centralisation signifie que l\u2019on transf\u00e8re davantage de responsabilit\u00e9s aux personnes sur le terrain dans le but d\u2019am\u00e9liorer les chances de succ\u00e8s d\u2019un projet, en ce sens que les repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019ACDI entretiennent des rapports plus \u00e9troits avec leurs partenaires sur le terrain. J\u2019accepte la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 propos de la d\u00e9centralisation, qui explique pourquoi les postes de PM\u201105 et de PM\u201106, en 2012, sont classifi\u00e9s diff\u00e9remment de ceux qui existaient en 2010, et cela inclut l\u2019exp\u00e9rience plus vaste qu\u2019il est obligatoire de poss\u00e9der pour \u00eatre admissible \u00e0 une affectation.\n[13] Accorder pr\u00e9matur\u00e9ment une affectation \u00e0 la plaignante, sans que celle-ci ait acquis l\u2019exp\u00e9rience requise, pourrait mettre en p\u00e9ril le projet que m\u00e8ne l\u2019ACDI au Vietnam et ne procurerait pas \u00e0 la plaignante les outils qui lui permettraient d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter son affectation avec succ\u00e8s. La formation obligatoire qu\u2019offre l\u2019ACDI et dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question \u00e0 l\u2019audience est celle que l\u2019on offre aux candidats retenus qui poss\u00e8dent d\u00e9j\u00e0 les qualifications requises pour avoir droit \u00e0 une affectation, et cette formation ne compense pas les lacunes li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience qu\u2019un candidat doit poss\u00e9der. Cela dit, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle est en mesure d\u2019offrir \u00e0 la plaignante un plan d\u2019apprentissage personnalis\u00e9 qui lui permettrait de suivre la formation et d\u2019obtenir l\u2019exp\u00e9rience qu\u2019il lui faut pour ex\u00e9cuter avec succ\u00e8s une affectation sur le terrain. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ce plan d\u2019apprentissage pourrait consister \u00e0 affecter la plaignante \u00e0 un poste de niveau PM\u201105 tout en occupant un poste de niveau PM\u201106, \u00e0 lui permettre d\u2019observer une personne dot\u00e9e de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience n\u00e9cessaire, \u00e0 faire des visites sur le terrain et \u00e0 lui offrir des cours, des activit\u00e9s de formation et de l\u2019encadrement. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9clare, dans ses observations du 30 novembre 2011 :\n[traduction] [L\u2019]ACDI a l\u2019intention de trouver pour Mme Cruden, d\u00e8s que celle-ci reviendra de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 en f\u00e9vrier 2012, un poste (op\u00e9rationnel) appropri\u00e9 au sein de sa DGPG. Cette mesure servira de pr\u00e9curseur \u00e0 une affectation sur le terrain dans un pays ami, \u00e0 compter de 2013, affectation dans le cadre de laquelle l\u2019ACDI travaillera avec Mme Cruden en 2012 afin de veiller \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle acqui\u00e8re les comp\u00e9tences et les connaissances dont elle aura besoin pour accomplir avec succ\u00e8s son affectation sur le terrain. \u00c0 cette fin, un plan d\u2019apprentissage d\u00e9fini sera \u00e9labor\u00e9 avec Mme Cruden et mis en place, et ce plan sera ax\u00e9 sur des aspects tels que la gestion de programmes ou de projets internationaux, le travail ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 dans le cadre de diverses modalit\u00e9s de programmes bilat\u00e9rales (comme les approches ax\u00e9es sur les programmes et le soutien budg\u00e9taire).\n[14] Cependant, hormis cette d\u00e9claration, rien n\u2019indique qu\u2019un plan d\u2019apprentissage d\u00e9fini a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli. Rien n\u2019indique que l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est efforc\u00e9e avec la plaignante de trouver des affectations satisfaisantes, quelle formation ou quelle exp\u00e9rience additionnelles sont n\u00e9cessaires pour que cette derni\u00e8re ait du succ\u00e8s dans une affectation, comment l\u2019intim\u00e9e propose que la plaignante acqui\u00e8re la formation ou l\u2019exp\u00e9rience requise pour avoir du succ\u00e8s dans une affectation et \u00e0 quel moment se pr\u00e9sentera, en cons\u00e9quence, la chance de l\u2019affecter \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettront.\n[15] M\u00eame si la plaignante a fait part \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI des choix d\u2019affectation qu\u2019elle privil\u00e9giait au d\u00e9but du processus d\u2019affectation, un plan d\u2019apprentissage d\u00e9fini n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli \u00e0 ce stade-l\u00e0. Au moment o\u00f9 le Tribunal a tenu son audience dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, soit le 16 janvier 2012, un tel plan n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 non plus \u00e9tabli. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le t\u00e9moin de l\u2019ACDI a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de mentionner des mesures concr\u00e8tes que l\u2019ACDI avait prises pour voir comment cette derni\u00e8re ex\u00e9cuterait l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal parce qu\u2019elle ne participait pas \u00e0 ce processus. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 son avocate pour l\u2019inviter \u00e0 communiquer avec elle \u00e0 propos de la fa\u00e7on d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter l\u2019ordonnance et que la plaignante n\u2019y avait pas r\u00e9pondu. Elle soutient que les communications ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rompues entre les parties quand la plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande d\u2019\u00e9claircissements au Tribunal en novembre 2011. Je conclus que cette explication n\u2019est pas cr\u00e9dible. Au d\u00e9but du mois de novembre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante que l\u2019ACDI n\u2019allait pas l\u2019affecter en 2012, mais qu\u2019elle pouvait quand m\u00eame pr\u00e9senter sa candidature pour le processus d\u2019affectation. La plaignante a ensuite pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour deux affectations au Vietnam, et sa candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e dans les deux cas. Une fois que la plaignante avait fait part de ses choix d\u2019affectation, l\u2019ACDI aurait pu, \u00e0 n\u2019importe quel moment, planifier une r\u00e9union avec elle pour commencer \u00e0 discuter de la fa\u00e7on d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal. La plaignante \u00e9tait disponible pour ces discussions.\n[16] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la Loi, il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la plaignante les chances dont l\u2019acte discriminatoire l\u2019a priv\u00e9e. Pour d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 quel moment il convient d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la plaignante cette chance, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit tout d\u2019abord examiner de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9rieuse de quelle fa\u00e7on elle ex\u00e9cutera l\u2019ordonnance. L\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal \u00e9tait con\u00e7ue comme une directive visant \u00e0 permettre aux parties de r\u00e9gler entre elles les d\u00e9tails relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019ordonnance, mais il est possible qu\u2019\u00e0 cause de cela la plaignante ait perdu la chance d\u2019\u00eatre affect\u00e9e aux postes disponibles au Vietnam. Le Tribunal conclut donc qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de clarifier son ordonnance afin d\u2019en faciliter l\u2019ex\u00e9cution et de veiller \u00e0 ce que la plaignante puisse b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la mesure de redressement qu\u2019il a ordonn\u00e9e. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le Tribunal ordonne :\n(1) que, dans les sept jours suivant le prononc\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, l'ACDI affecte Mme Cruden \u00e0 un poste de niveau PM\u201106 \u00e0 la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes g\u00e9ographiques;\n(2) que l\u2019ACDI, dans les 15 jours suivant le prononc\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 Mme Cruden des affectations disponibles en 2013 dans des pays \u00e9trangers qui sont ou seront disponibles, \u00e0 des endroits o\u00f9 il y a des installations m\u00e9dicales appropri\u00e9es et o\u00f9 elle ne sera soumise \u00e0 aucune restriction m\u00e9dicale;\n(3) que l\u2019ACDI, dans les 21 jours suivant la date o\u00f9 Mme Cruden lui fait part, par \u00e9crit, de ces trois principaux choix d\u2019affectation parmi ceux que l\u2019ACDI lui aura pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s (qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de trois choix relatifs \u00e0 une affectation dans des pays diff\u00e9rents ou dans un m\u00eame pays, ou de deux choix dans un m\u00eame pays et d\u2019un choix dans un autre), \u00e9tablisse en consultation avec Mme Cruden un plan d\u2019apprentissage personnalis\u00e9 qui indiquera la formation que cette derni\u00e8re devra suivre ou l\u2019exp\u00e9rience qu\u2019elle devra acqu\u00e9rir en vue d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter avec succ\u00e8s l\u2019une des affectations sur le terrain qui sera retenue pour 2013;\n(4) le plan d\u2019apprentissage personnalis\u00e9 devra pr\u00e9ciser de quelle fa\u00e7on l\u2019ACDI permettra \u00e0 Mme Cruden de suivre la formation ou d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir l\u2019exp\u00e9rience qui sera n\u00e9cessaire, et ce plan devra \u00e9galement inclure un calendrier, assorti de dates pr\u00e9cises, quant au moment o\u00f9 Mme Cruden pourra suivre cette formation ou acqu\u00e9rir cette exp\u00e9rience avant la date d\u2019affectation;\n(5) une fois que Mme Cruden aura suivi la formation ou acquis l\u2019exp\u00e9rience qui sera indiqu\u00e9e dans le plan d\u2019apprentissage, que l\u2019ACDI accorde \u00e0 Mme Cruden l\u2019affectation sur le terrain pour laquelle le plan d\u2019apprentissage aura \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli.\n[17] Le Tribunal continuera d\u2019\u00eatre saisi de l\u2019affaire afin d\u2019\u00eatre disponible au cas o\u00f9 d\u2019autres \u00e9claircissements s\u2019av\u00e9reraient n\u00e9cessaires, et ce, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que les parties confirment que les modalit\u00e9s de son ordonnance ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en \u0153uvre.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nJuge administrative\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 1 mars 2012\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1466\/1210\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Bronwyn Cruden c.

Introduction [1] Le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2012, j\u2019ai fait droit \u00e0 une requ\u00eate de l\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada (l\u2019APAC) en vue de faire ajourner la pr\u00e9sente instance. Voici les motifs de ma d\u00e9cision.\nII. L\u2019historique de la pr\u00e9sente instance et des instances connexes Les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es dans l\u2019affaire Bailie et al.\n[2] Il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce des plaintes de plusieurs pilotes d\u2019Air Canada \u00e0 la retraite (Bailie et al.) qui soutiennent qu\u2019Air Canada a commis (et continue de commettre) un acte discriminatoire et appliqu\u00e9 une politique discriminatoire en les obligeant \u00e0 prendre leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans. Cette obligation \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 la fois \u00e0 la convention collective n\u00e9goci\u00e9e entre Air Canada et l\u2019agent n\u00e9gociateur, l\u2019APAC, et au r\u00e9gime de pension des pilotes. De ce fait, ces pilotes retrait\u00e9s ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes conjointes contre l\u2019APAC elle aussi, et ces plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 regroup\u00e9es en une seule audience devant le Tribunal. Ils soutiennent que l\u2019obligation de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans contrevient aux articles 7, 9 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H\u20116, dans sa version modifi\u00e9e (la LCDP).\n[3] \u00c0 la date des pr\u00e9sents motifs, d\u2019autres plaintes de pilotes d\u2019Air Canada \u00e0 la retraite, portant sur les m\u00eames questions, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) au Tribunal, et la pr\u00e9sidente de ce dernier me les a assign\u00e9es. Il y a maintenant un total de 178 plaintes (89 plaignants) dans le groupe de plaintes portant l\u2019intitul\u00e9\u00ab Bailie et al. \u00bb, et tous les plaignants sont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Me Raymond D.

Les motifs de la requ\u00eate \u2013 l\u2019APAC [5] La partie requ\u00e9rante, l\u2019APAC, [traduction] \u00ab sollicite une ordonnance portant que les plaintes dont le Tribunal est actuellement saisi soient ajourn\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en attendant que l\u2019on r\u00e8gle les questions qui sont actuellement en suspens devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb.\n[6] L\u2019argument de la partie requ\u00e9rante repose sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\n[traduction] [...] Le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 toutes les questions qui peuvent se poser dans les plaintes en suspens et, dans chaque cas, ces d\u00e9cisions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Tant que les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales ne se seront pas prononc\u00e9es sur ces questions, il est inutile que le Tribunal tienne une autre audience et rende d\u2019autres motifs qui feront in\u00e9vitablement l\u2019objet de demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n\u00c0 ce stade, il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu une utilisation consid\u00e9rable de temps, de ressources et d\u2019argent. Entreprendre un processus r\u00e9p\u00e9titif qui ne m\u00e8nera \u00e0 aucun r\u00e9sultat d\u00e9finitif n\u2019est ni dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public ni dans celui des parties au litige.\n[7] L\u2019APAC cite la jurisprudence du Tribunal selon lesquels ce dernier jouit d\u2019un vaste pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour ce qui est de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il convient ou non d\u2019accorder un ajournement (par opposition \u00e0 une suspension, qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 ordonner) : Baltruweit c. SCRS, 2004 TCDP 14; Abrams c. Topham, 2010 TCDP 14.\n[8] La d\u00e9cision Abrams et la d\u00e9cision connexe rendue dans l\u2019affaire Congr\u00e8s juif canadien c. Makow, 2010 TCDP 13 avaient trait \u00e0 la disposition de la LCDP qui porte sur la propagande haineuse, soit l\u2019article 13. Cela faisait suite \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Warman c. Lemire, 2009 TCDP 26, dans laquelle celui-ci a conclu que l\u2019article 13 de la LCDP contrevenait \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 2b) de la Charte et a refus\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer l\u2019article 13 et les dispositions connexes. Dans Abrams et Makow, le membre instructeur Lustig a accord\u00e9 un ajournement sine die (sans date de reprise fixe) en mentionnant : \u00ab [i]l revient maintenant \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de d\u00e9terminer la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019article 13 de la LCDP.\nCela permettra d\u2019obtenir les clarifications demand\u00e9es par la Commission et dont, \u00e0 mon avis, le Tribunal a besoin pour rendre une d\u00e9cision sur la pr\u00e9sente affaire et sur d\u2019autres affaires portant sur l\u2019article 13 de la LCDP \u00bb. L\u2019APAC est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il convient d\u2019appliquer le m\u00eame raisonnement et le m\u00eame ajournement \u00e0 la situation analogue dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce :\n[traduction] [\u2026] Vu le grand nombre d\u2019affaires dont le Tribunal est saisi qui d\u00e9coulent de la m\u00eame politique de retraite obligatoire, il convient d\u2019accorder l\u2019ajournement demand\u00e9. L\u2019objectif d\u2019assurer une certaine uniformit\u00e9 dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et l\u2019application appropri\u00e9es de la Loi rev\u00eat un int\u00e9r\u00eat particulier dans les cas o\u00f9 le Tribunal est saisi de multiples affaires.\nIV. Les positions des autres parties Air Canada\n[9] Air Canada appuie la requ\u00eate et les arguments de l\u2019APAC. Elle traite \u00e9galement des \u00ab \u00e9claircissements \u00bb dont il est question dans Makow et qui [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9couleraient \u00bb des motifs de jugement ultimes des cours de contr\u00f4le et d\u2019appel. [traduction] \u00ab Il y aurait lieu de demander les m\u00eames \u00e9claircissements dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire avant de continuer [...] Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ces \u00e9claircissements, l\u2019affaire se poursuivra en fin de compte de mani\u00e8re plus efficace, m\u00eame si elle ne d\u00e9bute pas imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb.\n[10] Air Canada soutient \u00e9galement ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab [...] une le\u00e7on importante que l\u2019on peut tirer des affaires mettant en cause d\u2019autres anciens pilotes d\u2019Air Canada est l\u2019utilit\u00e9 qu\u2019il y a d\u2019essayer de r\u00e9gler l\u2019une des affaires en premier et de se servir des le\u00e7ons acquises gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 cette exp\u00e9rience pour aider \u00e0 r\u00e9gler les affaires qui suivent [...] Le fait d\u2019imposer un fardeau additionnel au Tribunal et aux parties en d\u00e9butant une autre audience sans avoir en main les d\u00e9cisions des cours ne favorisera pas le r\u00e8glement exp\u00e9ditif, efficace ou d\u00e9finitif de ces questions \u00bb.\nLa Commission canadienne des droits de la personne\n[11] En l\u2019absence d\u2019un engagement de la part de l\u2019APAC et d\u2019Air Canada selon lequel elles seraient li\u00e9es par l\u2019issue des demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans les affaires Vilven\/Kelly et Thwaites, la Commission ne peut pas donner son accord et se doit de s\u2019opposer \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. Elle signale que, contrairement \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Lemire, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) contrevient \u00e0 la Charte et autorise donc les plaignants, dans Bailie et al., \u00e0 poursuivre. La Commission fait \u00e9galement valoir que la LCDP exige qu\u2019une instruction se d\u00e9roule de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. [traduction] \u00ab Ce n\u2019est donc que dans les circonstances les plus exceptionnelles qu\u2019il y a lieu de suspendre l\u2019instruction des plaintes \u00bb.\n[12] Par ailleurs, la Commission est d\u2019avis que rien n\u2019indique que les d\u00e9cisions des cours de contr\u00f4le ou d\u2019appel [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9pondraient de mani\u00e8re compl\u00e8te et d\u00e9finitive aux plaintes dont le Tribunal est actuellement saisi \u00bb.\nLa \u00ab coalition de plaignants \u00bb\n[13] Les 86 plaignants invoquent l\u2019adage juridique classique selon lequel \u00ab justice diff\u00e9r\u00e9e est d\u00e9ni de justice \u00bb. Ils soutiennent par ailleurs que les sujets dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont [traduction] \u00ab tout particuli\u00e8rement sensibles au temps \u00bb vu l\u2019\u00e2ge des anciens pilotes plaignants et leur demande de r\u00e9tablissement \u00e0 titre de pilotes commandants de bord (commandants de bord). [traduction] \u00ab Aucune indemnisation p\u00e9cuniaire ne saurait tout \u00e0 fait compenser le d\u00e9ni des droits de ces plaignants [...] \u00bb. Leur avocat mentionne de plus : [traduction] \u00ab Tout retard dans l\u2019audition de ces plaintes profite enti\u00e8rement aux intim\u00e9s et porte enti\u00e8rement pr\u00e9judice aux plaignants \u00bb.\n[14] La coalition de plaignants soutient \u00e9galement que, contrairement aux dires de l\u2019APAC et d\u2019Air Canada, on ne manque pas d\u2019\u00e9claircissements \u00e0 ce stade\u2011ci. Le jugement par lequel la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP est inconstitutionnel lie le Tribunal, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019une cour d\u2019instance sup\u00e9rieure l\u2019infirme. Cette \u00e9ventualit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas une raison pour ajourner les plaintes dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Il ne reste \u00e0 Air Canada et \u00e0 l\u2019APAC qu\u2019une seule d\u00e9fense possible : la d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019EPJ vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a). Le Tribunal se doit de trancher cette question.\n[15] Pour ce qui est de la d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019EPJ, la coalition de plaignants affirme que cette d\u00e9fense est [traduction] \u00ab subordonn\u00e9e aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve relatifs \u00e0 chaque plaignant \u00bb, ind\u00e9pendamment des d\u00e9cisions contradictoires que le Tribunal a pu rendre sur la question dans les affaires Vilven\/Kelley, 2011 TCDP 10, et Thwaites, 2011 TCDP11, respectivement.\n[16] La coalition de plaignants fait \u00e9galement valoir que la partie requ\u00e9rante ou Air Canada peuvent pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience en se fondant sur les principes de la chose jug\u00e9e (pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e) et de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure [traduction] \u00ab afin d\u2019emp\u00eacher que l\u2019on remette en cause des questions juridiques d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9es \u00bb.\n[17] Dans sa conclusion, la coalition de plaignants soutient que : [traduction] \u00ab [t]oute requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire ajourner l\u2019audition doit soupeser les avantages qui d\u00e9couleront cens\u00e9ment de l\u2019ajournement propos\u00e9 et le pr\u00e9judice que ce dernier causera vraisemblablement au plaignant [...] Par ailleurs, les arguments qu\u2019invoquent l\u2019APAC et Air Canada \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate reposent sur la simple supposition que la proposition de reporter l\u2019audition des plaintes pourrait donner lieu \u00e0 une forme quelconque d\u2019\u00e9conomie de ressources judiciaires ou quasi judiciaires \u00bb.\nV. L\u2019analyse [18] Selon le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la LCDP : \u00ab [l\u2019]instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique \u00bb. L\u2019article 3 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal \u00e9nonce la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour la pr\u00e9sentation des requ\u00eates, et cela inclut les requ\u00eates d\u2019ajournement. Le paragraphe 50(1) de la LCDP porte sur l\u2019instruction de la plainte et accorde \u00e0 toutes les parties qui en ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9es \u00ab la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter [...] des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations \u00bb.\n[19] Le Tribunal a conclu qu\u2019il ne pouvait obtenir de lui-m\u00eame une suspension. Pour ce type d\u2019ordonnance, c\u2019est la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui est le tribunal qui convient : Baltruweit, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9 l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat RJR\u2011Macdonald, [1994] 1 R.C.S. 311, lequel \u00e9nonce les conditions dans lesquelles une suspension peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e.\n[20] Dans la d\u00e9cision Baltruweit, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, le Tribunal fait \u00e9tat du principe \u00e9tabli depuis longtemps selon lequel les tribunaux administratifs sont ma\u00eetres de leur proc\u00e9dure. \u00ab Par cons\u00e9quent, ils disposent d\u2019importants pouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de se prononcer sur des demandes d\u2019ajournement \u00bb : au paragraphe 15. Je suis d\u2019accord. Dans le cas d\u2019un ajournement, le Tribunal, \u00e0 la requ\u00eate d\u2019une partie ou de son propre chef, peut reprendre l\u2019instance. Un ajournement peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9 sine die (sans date de reprise fixe), avec une date fixe, et avec ou sans condition. Comme nous le verrons plus loin, j\u2019ai accord\u00e9 l\u2019ajournement sous certaines conditions, en utilisant la souplesse que cet outil comporte en soi.\n[21] Toujours dans la d\u00e9cision Baltruweit, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 17, le Tribunal \u00e9crit : \u00ab [p]ar cons\u00e9quent, il est \u00e9vident que ce Tribunal doit, dans l\u2019exercice de ses pouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires, tenir compte des r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle. Ainsi, le Tribunal pourrait devoir tenir compte des r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle dans le cas de la non-disponibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019ajourner une instance pour obtenir les services d\u2019un avocat ou d\u2019une divulgation tardive par la partie adverse \u00bb. Je suis d\u2019accord avec cette liste non exhaustive. Enfin, au paragraphe 19, le Tribunal ajoute : \u00ab Enfin, dans ces observations, on n\u2019a soulev\u00e9 aucune pr\u00e9occupation en mati\u00e8re de justice naturelle qui pourrait att\u00e9nuer le d\u00e9sir exprim\u00e9 au paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi selon lequel le processus de r\u00e8glement de la plainte, par le Tribunal, devrait \u00eatre le plus exp\u00e9ditif possible \u00bb. Je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019un ajournement peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9 en l\u2019absence d\u2019une telle \u00ab pr\u00e9occupation en mati\u00e8re de justice naturelle \u00bb.\n[22] Dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, la \u00ab directive \u00bb de proc\u00e9der de la mani\u00e8re la plus exp\u00e9ditive possible doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e dans un contexte plus vaste. Dans les affaires telles que celles concernant la propagande haineuse vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 13 (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d., Abrams et Makow) et les affaires concernant les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada (Vilven\/Kelly, Thwaites et al. et Bailie et al.), un ajournement de courte dur\u00e9e permettrait peut-\u00eatre d\u2019obtenir un gain \u00e0 long terme, ainsi qu\u2019un meilleur r\u00e9sultat final. Autrement dit, il est plus \u00e9quitable et plus juste et \u00ab exp\u00e9ditif \u00bb \u00e0 long terme pour les parties en cause et les parties futures de laisser une affaire qui comporte des questions litigieuses identiques ou essentiellement semblables suivre son cours au sein du syst\u00e8me judiciaire ou du syst\u00e8me de justice administrative que de tenir dans chaque cas une audience, suivie de demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire et d\u2019appels. Cette option est \u00e9galement plus juste sur le plan de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, compte tenu des ressources restreintes dont disposent le Tribunal et les Cours et que financent les contribuables. Je suis bien d\u2019accord avec l\u2019observation de la Commission selon laquelle [traduction] \u00ab [c]e n\u2019est donc que dans les circonstances les plus exceptionnelles qu\u2019il y a lieu de suspendre l\u2019instruction des plaintes \u00bb. C\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce : nous avons affaire ici \u00e0 des \u00ab circonstances exceptionnelles \u00bb.\n[23] J\u2019ajouterais aussi que le mot \u00ab exp\u00e9ditif \u00bb signifie davantage que \u00ab fait rapidement \u00bb. En anglais, le Canadian Oxford Dictionary d\u00e9finit le mot \u00ab expeditious \u00bb ainsi : \u00ab [...] acting or done with speed and efficiency\u2026 \u00bb. En fran\u00e7ais, en tant qu\u2019expression juridique, les mots \u00ab proc\u00e9dure exp\u00e9ditive \u00bb signifient \u00ab rapide et efficace \u00bb (Le Petit Robert 2012).\n[24] Les actions syst\u00e9miques, du type \u00ab recours collectif \u00bb, comme c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, qui comportent la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie de plaignants (des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada ayant atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans), les m\u00eames intim\u00e9s, la m\u00eame Commission, les m\u00eames dispositions de la LCDP et des questions de fait et de droit identiques ou essentiellement semblables, requi\u00e8rent une approche diff\u00e9rente de celle qu\u2019on applique dans le cas de l\u2019affaire caract\u00e9ristique, comportant un seul plaignant et un seul intim\u00e9, qui tombe sous le coup de la LCDP. Ces types d\u2019affaires soul\u00e8vent des questions particuli\u00e8res au sujet de l\u2019attribution des ressources quasi judiciaires et des d\u00e9pens que les parties ont \u00e0 supporter. A posteriori, le souhait d\u2019Air Canada que l\u2019affaire Vilven\/Kelly se poursuive jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin - en incluant les deux \u00e9tapes de la responsabilit\u00e9 et de la r\u00e9paration - et soit suivie de directives des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales dans le cadre de n\u2019importe quel contr\u00f4le judiciaire ou appel (y compris devant la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada), aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 la meilleure fa\u00e7on d\u2019utiliser les ressources, le temps et l\u2019argent de chacun. Au lieu de cela, il y a eu disjonction (y compris ma propre ordonnance dans l\u2019affaire Bailie, avec l\u2019assentiment des parties, quant au fait de scinder l\u2019instance en une \u00e9tape de responsabilit\u00e9 et en une \u00e9tape de r\u00e9paration) et r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, car le litige ou le diff\u00e9rend de base dans ces affaires (c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire, la politique d\u2019Air Canada concernant la mise \u00e0 la retraite obligatoire de ses pilotes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans et la disposition correspondante qui figure dans la convention collective) a \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivi dans trois groupes d\u2019affaires \u2013 Vilven\/Kelly, Thwaites et al. et Bailie et al. Deux de ces groupes sont pass\u00e9s par le Tribunal et se sont rendus devant les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, \u00e0 la suite de demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par une ou plusieurs parties contre chaque d\u00e9cision du Tribunal. Le sommaire de l\u2019historique des instances qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t illustre le labyrinthe des voies qu\u2019ont suivies les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal et des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales dans ces deux groupes. Bailie et al. repr\u00e9sente le troisi\u00e8me groupe, o\u00f9 une troisi\u00e8me formation est maintenant appel\u00e9e \u00e0 traiter de questions de fait et de droit identiques ou essentiellement semblables. Le pass\u00e9 est immuable, mais l\u2019avenir est certes ind\u00e9termin\u00e9. Le Tribunal doit\u2011il simplement r\u00e9p\u00e9ter l\u2019exercice? Je ne le crois pas.\n[25] Je dis cela en \u00e9tant conscient des r\u00e9percussions importantes que cela peut avoir pour les plaignants dans Bailie et al. Tous sont \u00e2g\u00e9s de plus de 60 ans et un grand nombre d\u2019entre eux ont pr\u00e8s de 65 ans. C\u2019est donc dire que, pour nombre d\u2019entre eux, un ajournement les emp\u00eacherait ainsi d\u2019obtenir le r\u00e9tablissement qu\u2019ils souhaitent \u2013 pouvoir piloter de nouveau \u00e0 titre de commandant de bord ou de capitaine au sein d\u2019Air Canada \u2013 en supposant que la d\u00e9cision finale soit en leur faveur. Cependant, l\u2019octroi \u2013 ou non \u2013 d\u2019un ajournement dans le contexte de cette instance syst\u00e9mique, du type \u00ab recours collectif \u00bb, doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9 sur une pond\u00e9ration de tous les int\u00e9r\u00eats divergents applicables, dont l\u2019utilisation juste et \u00e9quitable de ressources restreintes, dans le but d\u2019arriver en fin de compte au traitement le plus \u00ab exp\u00e9ditif \u00bb possible de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Je tiens \u00e0 ajouter que rien n\u2019emp\u00eache les plaignants de solliciter un redressement provisoire (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d., leur r\u00e9tablissement) devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale : Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canadian Liberty Net, [1998] 1 R.C.S. 626.\n[26] \u00c0 cette fin, j\u2019ai pris en consid\u00e9ration les facteurs qui suivent dans le cadre de cette \u00ab pond\u00e9ration \u00bb :\n1. Dans les affaires Vilven\/Kelly, Thwaites et al. et Bailie et al., les questions de droit sont essentiellement les m\u00eames : p. ex., la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP (la d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00ab \u00e2ge normal de la retraite \u00bb), le bien-fond\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9fense et le bien-fond\u00e9 de la d\u00e9fense portant sur l\u2019EPJ vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a). M\u00eame les redressements sont fort semblables dans les trois groupes de d\u00e9cisions. Et il existe un aspect \u00ab pr\u00e9vention d\u2019actes futurs \u00bb semblable. En fait, dans l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate ant\u00e9rieur de la coalition de plaignants en vue d\u2019obtenir des pr\u00e9cisions et de faire radier des actes de proc\u00e9dure (requ\u00eate rejet\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision 2011 TCDP 17), le paragraphe 11 indique en partie ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nLes questions en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont tr\u00e8s semblables, sinon identiques, aux questions que le Tribunal a tranch\u00e9es dans l\u2019affaire Vilven\u2011Kelly et dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites. Si ce n\u2019\u00e9tait du fait que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Thwaites n\u2019a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par le Tribunal [elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue depuis : 2011 TCDP 11], sauf pour une question en suspens, il serait juste de dire que toutes les questions en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 entendues et tranch\u00e9es par le Tribunal et que la pr\u00e9sente audience pourrait ne pas \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire.\n2. Il ressort de l\u2019historique des affaires Vilven\/Kelly et Thwaites que chacune des d\u00e9cisions importantes du Tribunal a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la part d\u2019une partie ou plus. Et l\u2019une des d\u00e9cisions de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale attend l\u2019issue d\u2019un appel interjet\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Cela donne \u00e0 penser que toute d\u00e9cision de ma part ne trancherait pas l\u2019affaire de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9finitive;\n3. Deux formations distinctes (l\u2019ancien pr\u00e9sident Sinclair et le membre instructeur Craig) sont arriv\u00e9es \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion finale (le rejet des plaintes), sous r\u00e9serve de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019ancien pr\u00e9sident Sinclair au sujet de l\u2019affaire rouverte dans Thwaites, mais avec une conclusion et une analyse diff\u00e9rentes \u00e0 propos des principales questions de droit, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire, la d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019EPJ. Ces d\u00e9cisions ne lient ni moi ni une formation future, car le principe du stare decisis ne s\u2019applique pas aux d\u00e9cisions que rend le Tribunal. Ce sont des \u00ab \u00e9claircissements \u00bb judiciaires que requiert cet \u00e9tat de choses conflictuel, et non la d\u00e9cision d\u2019une troisi\u00e8me formation du Tribunal;\n4. Un ajournement assorti de conditions permet aux parties et \u00e0 moi-m\u00eame de suivre chaque prise de position judiciaire, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 r\u00e9\u00e9valuer si les conditions ont chang\u00e9 au point de justifier la lev\u00e9e de l\u2019ajournement et de donner suite \u00e0 l\u2019affaire Bailie et al.;\n5. L\u2019octroi d\u2019un ajournement assorti de conditions est une option pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable et moins intrusive et elle touche moins aux droits que le fait de rejeter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019une plainte pour cause de chose jug\u00e9e, de pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e ou d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure. Dans une requ\u00eate ant\u00e9rieure en pr\u00e9cisions et en radiation, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 aux parties si elles entendaient pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en rejet pour cause d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure. La coalition de plaignants a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019avant de se prononcer elle allait attendre la d\u00e9cision concernant la requ\u00eate en pr\u00e9cisions et en radiation. La Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019allait pas d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate distincte [pour abus de proc\u00e9dure] mais qu\u2019elle s\u2019opposerait plut\u00f4t \u00e0 toute tentative visant \u00e0 produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve destin\u00e9s \u00e0 contredire les d\u00e9cisions de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale [dans l\u2019affaire Vilven\/Kelly];\n6. Les plaintes dont il est question dans l\u2019affaire Bailie et al. demeurent intactes aux fins de d\u00e9cision, une fois que l\u2019on aura obtenu les \u00ab \u00e9claircissements \u00bb judiciaires.\n[27] J\u2019ai suivi le raisonnement et la d\u00e9marche que le membre instructeur Lustig a suivis dans les affaires Abrams et Makow, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es, relativement aux affaires de propagande haineuse li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 13 dont le Tribunal avait \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi, lesquels raisonnement et d\u00e9marche sont expos\u00e9s aux paragraphes 9 et 8 de ces deux affaires, respectivement. Je signale que dans les affaires de propagande haineuse, il y avait aussi des d\u00e9cisions contradictoires du Tribunal \u00e0 propos de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019article 13 : voir la d\u00e9cision Lemire, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, et Schnell c. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc., 2002 CanLII 1887. Cependant, contrairement \u00e0 Bailie et al., dans le cas des affaires li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 13 il existait au moins un arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada datant de 1990 : Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, 1990 3 R.C.S. 892, qui portait sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019article 13. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le Tribunal, dans les d\u00e9cisions Makow et Abrams, a conclu que les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice faisaient manifestement pencher la balance en faveur d\u2019un ajournement (en d\u00e9pit de l\u2019existence d\u2019un arr\u00eat hautement instructif de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada), il s\u2019ensuit que l\u2019argument en faveur de l\u2019ajournement de la pr\u00e9sente affaire a encore plus de poids, vu l\u2019absence d\u2019une directive judiciaire semblable.\n[28] Apr\u00e8s avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la pond\u00e9ration des divers int\u00e9r\u00eats et besoins des parties et l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, j\u2019ai fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate d\u2019ajournement, et mon ordonnance est \u00e9nonc\u00e9e ci\u2011apr\u00e8s.\nVI. L\u2019Ordonnance [29] Le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2012, j\u2019ai fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate d\u2019ajournement de l\u2019APAC et rendu l\u2019ordonnance suivante :\nLa requ\u00eate de l\u2019APAC en vue de faire ajourner l\u2019instance en attendant que soient r\u00e9gl\u00e9es les questions dont les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales sont saisies dans les plaintes Vilven\/Kelly et Thwaites est accord\u00e9e, avec les conditions suivantes :\n(1) L\u2019APAC tiendra le Tribunal au courant de la situation des demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire ou des appels pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans les affaires Vilven\/Kelly et Thwaites, et cela inclut les motifs de jugement, s\u2019il y a lieu;\n(2) Toute partie ou le Tribunal peut exiger la tenue d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance apr\u00e8s la publication de motifs de jugement dans l\u2019un quelconque des contr\u00f4les judiciaires ou appels mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe (1), de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 r\u00e9\u00e9valuer l\u2019ajournement accord\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nLa conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance pr\u00e9vue pour les 1er et 2 mars 2012, ainsi que les dates d\u2019audience ult\u00e9rieures, sont annul\u00e9es.

La plainte [1] Le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2003, Stephen Leung (le plaignant) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte no 20030099 (la plainte B) aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission), dans laquelle il all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada, du fait de sa race et de son origine nationale ou ethnique, ce qui est contraire aux articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP), ainsi que de repr\u00e9sailles, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP.\n[2] Le 23 d\u00e9cembre 2010, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte B au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal).\nII. La requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e [3] Le 22 septembre 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal un avis de requ\u00eate sollicitant :\n1. une ordonnance radiant, en tout ou en partie, l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant;\n2. subsidiairement, une ordonnance limitant l\u2019instruction du Tribunal uniquement aux repr\u00e9sailles exerc\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du concours pour le poste FI\u201104 en 2002;\n3. une ordonnance obligeant le plaignant \u00e0 fournir les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages de t\u00e9moins pr\u00e9vus, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)f) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal.\n[4] Les moyens invoqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate sont les suivants :\n1. Le 4 juillet 2011, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions li\u00e9 \u00e0 sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne (dossier no 20030099 de la Commission) que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal.\n2. La Commission a enqu\u00eat\u00e9 sur un grand nombre des points soulev\u00e9s dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions dans le cadre des plaintes que le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieurement, et elle les a rejet\u00e9es. Le plaignant n\u2019a pas sollicit\u00e9 le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de ces d\u00e9cisions, et la d\u00e9cision prise par la Commission de rejeter les plaintes doit \u00eatre maintenue.\n3. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire en vue de la tenue d\u2019un examen suppl\u00e9mentaire portant uniquement sur la classification concernant le poste FI\u201104 en 2002.\n[5] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de sa requ\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9e se fonde sur l\u2019affidavit de Mme Lisa Minarovich, souscrit le 21 septembre 2011.\n[6] Au premier paragraphe de son affidavit, Mme Minarovich, une employ\u00e9e du minist\u00e8re de la Justice, d\u00e9clare avoir [traduction] \u00ab [...] examin\u00e9 les dossiers de la Commission qui sont associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la plainte et, cela \u00e9tant, [\u00eatre] au courant des questions mentionn\u00e9es ci\u2011apr\u00e8s \u00bb. Cet affidavit r\u00e9sume l\u2019enqu\u00eate que la Commission a men\u00e9e ainsi que la d\u00e9cision que celle-ci a rendue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des plaintes du plaignant, et de nombreux documents, vraisemblablement obtenus lors de l\u2019examen que Mme Minarovich a fait des dossiers, y sont joints en tant que pi\u00e8ces. Je suis toutefois persuad\u00e9 que cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019a aucune connaissance personnelle des circonstances entourant la plainte dont le Tribunal est actuellement saisi, pas plus qu\u2019elle n\u2019a l\u2019expertise voulue pour \u00e9tayer les opinions exprim\u00e9es dans son affidavit.\n[7] L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant vise \u00e0 tort \u00e0 soulever des questions dont la Commission a d\u00e9j\u00e0 trait\u00e9; elle soutient que ces questions ont force de chose jug\u00e9e ou qu\u2019il convient de les exclure par application du principe de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e.\nIII. La r\u00e9ponse du plaignant \u00e0 la requ\u00eate [8] L\u2019avocat du plaignant soutient que la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e :\n[traduction] Les observations de cette nature sont \u00e0 faire dans le cadre d\u2019une audience, et non avant. Nous nous trouvons pr\u00e9sentement au stade de la divulgation, et il n\u2019est pas encore temps de d\u00e9battre de la preuve. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, les deux parties ont le droit de s\u2019opposer \u00e0 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Au stade actuel, le d\u00e9cideur ne peut pas \u00e9valuer si la preuve est pertinente ou non. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, il peut accueillir des preuves ou non, suivant le poids qu\u2019elles m\u00e9ritent.\nIl demande au d\u00e9cideur d\u2019aller au\u2011del\u00e0 de la plainte renvoy\u00e9e par la Commission et de la reformuler. Il souhaite que le d\u00e9cideur, sans avoir entendu la moindre preuve, passe en revue les documents pour, essentiellement, se prononcer sur la nature de l\u2019affaire. La requ\u00eate est une tentative de l\u2019employeur pour plaider sa cause avant que qui que ce soit ait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve quelconque.\n[9] Le plaignant soutient \u00e9galement que les affirmations faites aux paragraphes 4, 13, 19, 22, 29 et 30 de l\u2019affidavit de Mme Minarovich sont trompeuses ou mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es, ou qu\u2019elles omettent des faits pertinents.\nIV. Le contexte [10] Pendant toute la p\u00e9riode en cause, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 au service de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[11] Les circonstances de la plainte B ont eu lieu entre les mois de mars 2001 et d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2002. La Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte B au Tribunal le 23 d\u00e9cembre 2010.\n[12] Le 26 mai 2000, avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte B, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte no 20000565 (la plainte A), dans laquelle il all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination entre les mois d\u2019octobre 1997 et de mai 2000, p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle il aurait pu avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 deux postes de cadre. Il a tent\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir chacun de ces deux postes, mais sans succ\u00e8s, d\u2019o\u00f9 son all\u00e9gation de discrimination du fait de sa race, de son origine nationale ou ethnique et de son \u00e2ge, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP. Apr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate sur la plainte A, la Commission a rejet\u00e9 cette derni\u00e8re.\n[13] Le 10 f\u00e9vrier 2006, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte B, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte no 2006307 (la plainte C), dans laquelle il all\u00e8gue \u00eatre victime de repr\u00e9sailles continues de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, notamment d\u2019un employ\u00e9 de cette derni\u00e8re, M. Steven Hertzberg, relativement aux directives donn\u00e9es au plaignant par la Commission de recourir aux processus d\u2019examen interne de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour essayer de r\u00e9gler la plainte B. Le paragraphe 6 de la plainte C est important :\n[traduction] Conform\u00e9ment aux directives de la Commission, j\u2019ai rencontr\u00e9 M. Hertzberg le 14 f\u00e9vrier 2005 en vue de mettre en marche les processus d\u2019examen interne. \u00c0 la r\u00e9union, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019entreprendre une discussion constructive sur ces processus, M. Hertzberg a unilat\u00e9ralement suspendu mon emploi, il a confisqu\u00e9 ma carte d\u2019identit\u00e9 et ma carte d\u2019acc\u00e8s au b\u00e2timent et au terrain de stationnement et il m\u2019a interdit de me pr\u00e9senter au travail. Il a dit que j\u2019\u00e9tais trop malade pour travailler et il m\u2019a contraint \u00e0 prendre un cong\u00e9 de maladie d\u2019une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. [\u2026]\n[14] La plainte C a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par la Commission en l\u2019absence du rapport d\u2019un enqu\u00eateur.\nV. Les circonstances de la plainte B [15] En ao\u00fbt 2002 ou aux environs de cette date, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a rejet\u00e9 la demande de promotion du plaignant \u00e0 un poste de cadre nouvellement cr\u00e9\u00e9, celui de directeur adjoint des Finances (niveau FI\u201104). Par la suite, le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2003, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte B.\n[16] La Commission a examin\u00e9 la plainte B et l\u2019a rejet\u00e9e au motif qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui de l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de repr\u00e9sailles pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte A le 26 mai 2000. Au d\u00e9part, la Commission a refus\u00e9 de renvoyer la plainte B au Tribunal et elle l\u2019a rejet\u00e9e.\nA. Les repr\u00e9sailles [17] Selon l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la Partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\n[18] L\u2019avocat du plaignant a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 la relation qui existe sur le plan de la preuve entre les plaintes A, B et C, ainsi que la synergie commune :\n[traduction] Il ressort clairement d\u2019un examen d\u00e9taill\u00e9 de l\u2019ordre dans lequel les trois plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es que ces derni\u00e8res se suivent logiquement l\u2019une apr\u00e8s l\u2019autre. La plainte B est fond\u00e9e sur la race et, maintenant, des repr\u00e9sailles li\u00e9es \u00e0 la race. La plainte C est fond\u00e9e sur des repr\u00e9sailles suppl\u00e9mentaires. Les trois plaintes mettent en cause le m\u00eame lieu de travail et les m\u00eames personnes, mais elles portent sur des manifestations diff\u00e9rentes du probl\u00e8me qu\u2019il mentionne.\nLa requ\u00eate de l\u2019employeur sous-entend que M. Leung est un plaignant \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, qui ne cesse de remettre sur le tapis les m\u00eames questions que l\u2019on a rejet\u00e9es. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une description inappropri\u00e9e de la situation et d\u2019une description que d\u00e9ment un examen d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des dates de d\u00e9p\u00f4t ainsi que des all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans les trois plaintes.\nEn fait, le moment des interventions de l\u2019employeur est douteux, et les plaintes de repr\u00e9sailles dans les deux cas font suite aux mesures qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises au lieu de travail, et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 encourag\u00e9es par le fait que l\u2019enqu\u00eateuse a rejet\u00e9 les plaintes de M. Leung ou en a fait abstraction.\nPour faire valoir sa cause devant le Tribunal, M. Leung doit avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de pouvoir pr\u00e9senter ce qu\u2019il consid\u00e8re \u00eatre une preuve de l\u2019acte fautif. L\u2019employeur est bien au fait des difficult\u00e9s qu\u2019aura le plaignant s\u2019il n\u2019est pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant les trois plaintes. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 du but r\u00e9el de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019employeur : priver M. Leung de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9 de ses all\u00e9gations.\n[19] L\u2019avocat du plaignant a soulign\u00e9 la pertinence des circonstances mentionn\u00e9es dans la plainte C, o\u00f9 son client all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019autres repr\u00e9sailles :\n[traduction] [...] par suite des directives par lesquelles la Commission l\u2019a renvoy\u00e9 pour recours interne aupr\u00e8s de la m\u00eame personne dont il s\u2019\u00e9tait plaint dans les plaintes A et B. Le gestionnaire, M. Hertzberg, est la m\u00eame personne que celle dont il est question dans les trois plaintes. C\u2019est lui qui est le lien essentiel.\nB. Le contr\u00f4le judiciaire [20] Le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire concernant le rejet, par la Commission, de la plainte B et, le 4 juin 2008, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 sa demande.\n[21] Le plaignant a port\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision en appel devant la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, qui, le 11 f\u00e9vrier 2009, a infirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Ainsi que l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le juge d\u2019appel Nadon :\n[19] [\u2026] j\u2019accueillerais donc l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens, j\u2019annulerais la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et, rendant la d\u00e9cision qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e, j\u2019accueillerais la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de l\u2019appelant avec d\u00e9pens et je renverrais l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la Commission pour qu\u2019elle r\u00e9examine la plainte de l\u2019appelant en conformit\u00e9 avec les pr\u00e9sents motifs.\n[22] Les paragraphes 15 et 16 de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sont pertinents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce :\n[15] J\u2019estime donc que l\u2019enqu\u00eateuse n\u2019a pas examin\u00e9 correctement une question qui portait sur un point essentiel de la plainte en ne se renseignant pas suffisamment au sujet de la proc\u00e9dure de classification qui s\u2019est sold\u00e9e par l\u2019obligation pour l\u2019appelant de participer \u00e0 un concours pour le nouveau poste cr\u00e9\u00e9. On comprend mal pourquoi le dossier demeure aussi obscur sur cette question, compte tenu du fait qu\u2019il devrait \u00eatre facile d\u2019obtenir de l\u2019employeur les renseignements requis pour \u00e9claircir la question.\n[16] Ainsi, quelles d\u00e9cisions ont effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 prises \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2001 par un ou plusieurs comit\u00e9s de classification? Qui faisait partie de ces comit\u00e9s? \u00c9taient-ce les m\u00eames personnes ou d\u2019autres personnes? \u00c0 mon avis, ces renseignements sont essentiels pour pouvoir r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question de savoir si l\u2019employeur a pris ou non des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles contre l\u2019appelant.\n[23] Le 23 d\u00e9cembre 2010, pr\u00e8s de deux ans apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, M. David Langtry, le pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim de la Commission, a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte B \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal.\n[24] L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission soit soumise \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\nVI. Le droit applicable [25] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Halifax (Regional Municipality) c. Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (Human Rights Commission), 2012 CSC 10, publi\u00e9 le 16 mars 2012, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, dans une d\u00e9cision unanime, a \u00e9clairci la nature des d\u00e9cisions que prend une commission des droits de la personne de rejeter ou de renvoyer une plainte.\n[26] Le juge Cromwell :\n[19] J\u2019abonde pour ma part dans le sens de la Cour d\u2019appel. Lorsqu\u2019elle d\u00e9cide de confier l\u2019examen d\u2019une plainte \u00e0 une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate, la Commission ne conclut pas que la plainte tombe sous le coup de la Loi. Suivant le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif, la Commission est plut\u00f4t appel\u00e9e \u00e0 exercer des fonctions d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable et d\u2019administration. Elle peut notamment renvoyer la plainte \u00e0 une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate pour que cette derni\u00e8re tranche une question de comp\u00e9tence.\n[20] La Loi \u00e9tablit, pour le r\u00e8glement des plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne, un r\u00e9gime complet dans le cadre duquel la Commission accomplit un certain nombre de fonctions dans le but de faire respecter et de promouvoir les droits de la personne. Pour ce qui est des plaintes, elle joue en quelque sorte un r\u00f4le de gardien et d\u2019administrateur. [\u2026]\n[21] Lorsque la plainte ne fait l\u2019objet d\u2019aucune d\u00e9cision, y compris un r\u00e8glement, la Commission peut nommer une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate pour l\u2019examiner (par. 32A(1)). Elle jouit d\u2019un grand pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de prendre ou non cette mesure. Elle peut opter pour cette avenue lorsqu\u2019elle est [traduction] \u00ab convaincue, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 la plainte, que l\u2019examen de celle\u2011ci est justifi\u00e9 \u00bb (Boards of Inquiry Regulations, r\u00e8gl. 221\/91 N.\u2011\u00c9., art. 1). Elle n\u2019est pas l\u00e9galement tenue de conclure que l\u2019affaire rel\u00e8ve de sa comp\u00e9tence ou que la plainte a un minimum de fondement avant de nommer une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate; il lui suffit d\u2019\u00eatre \u00ab convaincue \u00bb, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 la plainte, que l\u2019examen de celle\u2011ci est justifi\u00e9.\n[22] Une fois nomm\u00e9e, la commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate tient une audience publique \u00e0 l\u2019issue de laquelle elle statue sur la plainte. Elle a le pouvoir de trancher toute question de fait ou de droit lorsque cela est n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a eu contravention \u00e0 la Loi; elle poss\u00e8de aussi le pouvoir d\u2019ordonner r\u00e9paration lorsqu\u2019il y a eu contravention [\u2026].\n[23] Il importe de souligner en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce que m\u00eame si la Commission d\u00e9cide du renvoi \u00e0 une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate, elle ne conclut pas pour autant que la plainte est fond\u00e9e ni m\u00eame qu\u2019elle tombe sous le coup de la Loi, des conclusions qui ressortissent plut\u00f4t \u00e0 la commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate. Lorsqu\u2019elle confie l\u2019examen d\u2019une plainte \u00e0 une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate, la Commission exerce une fonction d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable et d\u2019administration; elle ne statue pas au fond.\n[\u2026]\n[50] [\u2026] Certes, la Commission soup\u00e8se quelque peu la plainte pour d\u00e9cider si les all\u00e9gations justifient la tenue d\u2019une enqu\u00eate, mais il ne lui appartient pas de statuer sur les points qui sous\u2011tendent sa d\u00e9cision de passer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape suivante; cette t\u00e2che incombe \u00e0 la commission nomm\u00e9e [\u2026]\nVII. L\u2019\u00e9valuation du bien fond\u00e9 de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e [27] L\u2019intim\u00e9e cherche \u00e0 restreindre la port\u00e9e de l\u2019instruction du Tribunal au sujet de la plainte B.\n[28] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant est une tentative qui vise \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab ressusciter des all\u00e9gations que la Commission a examin\u00e9es et rejet\u00e9es dans le cadre de plaintes ant\u00e9rieures. Les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions ont le m\u00eame objet et la m\u00eame port\u00e9e que les all\u00e9gations figurant dans une ou plusieurs des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne que le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es \u00bb (non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original).\n[29] La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e refl\u00e8te une m\u00e9connaissance des r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, ainsi que de l\u2019objet de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Je souscris \u00e0 la description que fait l\u2019avocat du plaignant de cet expos\u00e9 :\n[traduction] L\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03\u201105\u201104) expose la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de faire une divulgation et pr\u00e9cise ce que doit contenir un \u00ab expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions \u00bb. L\u2019objet de ce dernier n\u2019est pas explicitement mentionn\u00e9, mais il est quand m\u00eame possible de le d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 partir des paragraphes 1(1) et (2). Cet objet consiste \u00e0 communiquer les arguments que M. Leung a l\u2019intention de faire valoir. L\u2019intim\u00e9e saura ainsi ce contre quoi elle aura \u00e0 se d\u00e9fendre.\nL\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions n\u2019est pas un \u00ab expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits \u00bb. Les parties n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 souscrire aux pr\u00e9cisions, aux perceptions que ces derni\u00e8res contiennent, ou \u00e0 l\u2019argument qui en d\u00e9coulera \u00e0 leur avis.\nEn fait, l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de M. Leung satisfait aux exigences \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure car celui-ci a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 les faits importants sur lesquels il entend se fonder. L\u2019employeur sait quels sont les arguments que M. Leung entend invoquer.\n[30] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant et j\u2019ai conclu que cet expos\u00e9 correspond aux attentes que repr\u00e9sentent les exigences proc\u00e9durales du Tribunal.\n[31] Plus important encore, la tentative pr\u00e9ventive que fait l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour limiter la port\u00e9e de l\u2019instruction refl\u00e8te une m\u00e9connaissance des r\u00f4les administratifs et d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission ainsi que du fait, comme l\u2019a r\u00e9cemment clarifi\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat Halifax, que la d\u00e9cision que rend la Commission de rejeter une plainte, ou de la renvoyer au Tribunal pour instruction, n\u2019est pas une d\u00e9cision par laquelle elle statue sur le fond de l\u2019affaire; il ne s\u2019agit donc pas d\u2019un litige soumis aux principes de la chose jug\u00e9e ou de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e.\n[32] Les proc\u00e9dures que comporte l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission et le r\u00e8glement de celle\u2011ci, ainsi que la d\u00e9cision que rend la Commission de rejeter cette plainte ou de la renvoyer au Tribunal, sont toutes de nature administrative. Le rapport qu\u2019un enqu\u00eateur d\u00e9sign\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 la Commission sur ses constatations, comme l\u2019exige l\u2019article 44, de m\u00eame que les motifs du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire qu\u2019exerce la Commission pour rejeter une plainte ou la renvoyer au Tribunal pour instruction, demeurent une affaire priv\u00e9e au sein de la Commission jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties sollicite un contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[33] La plainte \u00e9crite que la Commission renvoie au Tribunal, ainsi que la demande qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9sente en m\u00eame temps pour qu\u2019il proc\u00e8de \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de cette plainte, consiste seulement \u00e0 transmettre la plainte proprement dite et les informations qui identifient les parties. Par la suite, comme le pr\u00e9voit l\u2019article 51 de la LCDP, la Commission peut devenir partie \u00e0 l\u2019instruction, en adoptant la position la plus proche, \u00e0 son avis, de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, compte tenu de la nature de la plainte.\n[34] La d\u00e9cision que prend la Commission de renvoyer une plainte au Tribunal n\u2019a aucun effet sur les proc\u00e9dures de ce dernier, pas plus que sur l\u2019exercice de son r\u00f4le d\u00e9cisionnel, ni sur l\u2019important degr\u00e9 d\u2019ind\u00e9pendance qu\u2019exercent les membres du Tribunal proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 une instruction publique.\n[35] Le membre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 m\u00e8nera l\u2019instruction en public et, en temps utile par la suite, il fournira aux parties une d\u00e9cision \u00e9crite. Un aspect essentiel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision est la d\u00e9termination de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de chaque t\u00e9moin, et cela implique un examen de la coh\u00e9rence de la preuve principale et de la fa\u00e7on dont chaque t\u00e9moin a r\u00e9pondu au contre-interrogatoire. Le d\u00e9cideur peut juger n\u00e9cessaire de prendre en consid\u00e9ration la preuve d\u2019un t\u00e9moin par rapport aux probabilit\u00e9s d\u00e9coulant des circonstances qui entourent l\u2019acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9.\nVIII. La d\u00e9cision [36] L\u2019avocat du plaignant m\u2019a persuad\u00e9 que les circonstances entourant les plaintes A et C sont pertinentes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des all\u00e9gations de discrimination et de repr\u00e9sailles dont il est question dans la plainte B. Je souscris \u00e0 son argument suivant :\n[traduction] Le rejet de la plainte A ne veut pas dire que les faits survenus durant le d\u00e9lai vis\u00e9 par la plainte rejet\u00e9e ne sont pas factuels et utilisables dans un examen de la plainte B. Il peut y avoir des faits communs. Les all\u00e9gations propres \u00e0 la plainte A peuvent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es, mais pas les faits. Le Tribunal n\u2019examinera que les all\u00e9gations d\u00e9coulant de la plainte B, mais cela ne veut pas dire qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu de prendre en consid\u00e9ration les faits qui sont \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la plainte B. Ce serait particuli\u00e8rement le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, car la plainte de repr\u00e9sailles dont il est question dans la plainte B r\u00e9sulte des mesures que l\u2019employeur a prises par suite de la plainte A.\n[37] Par ailleurs, m\u00eame si l\u2019arr\u00eat Halifax peut \u00eatre d\u00e9terminant pour la requ\u00eate, j\u2019ai \u00e9galement pris en compte chacune des objections que le plaignant a formul\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des diverses affirmations figurant dans l\u2019affidavit de Mme Minarovich et qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019avocat du plaignant, sont trompeuses ou mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es ou omettent des renseignements pertinents. Je suis d\u2019accord avec lui, et je conclus que l\u2019affidavit de Mme Minarovich est peu fiable et peu convaincant.\n[38] Compte tenu des motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nWallace G.

Conclusion. 15\n[1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une demande d\u2019ajournement dans l\u2019attente d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. La demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la d\u00e9cision de la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne de m\u2019assigner le pr\u00e9sent dossier en tant que membre instructeur.\nI. Les faits A. La d\u00e9cision d\u2019origine [2] Le 27 janvier 2010, en tant que membre instructeur, je rendais une d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire Malec et autres c. Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan, 2010 TCDP 2 [Malec]. Dans cette affaire, les plaignantes, toutes des employ\u00e9es de l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun, de Nutashkuan, all\u00e9guaient \u00eatre victimes de discrimination aux termes des politiques relatives aux primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement offertes \u00e0 certains employ\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00e9cole et mises en \u0153uvre par le Conseil des Montagnais de Nutashkuan, l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[3] De 1990 \u00e0 2007, la politique relative aux primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement s\u2019appliquait au \u00ab personnel enseignant d\u00e9tenteurs au minimum d\u2019un Bac et au personnel professionnel ayant la m\u00eame scolarit\u00e9 \u00bb. En 2007, la politique relative aux primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e et s\u2019applique depuis aux employ\u00e9s qui ne sont pas r\u00e9sidents de Nutashkuan. Toutes les plaignantes sont autochtones, r\u00e9sidentes de Nutashkuan. Elles n\u2019ont jamais re\u00e7u de primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement, tant sous la politique en vigueur de 1990 \u00e0 2007 que sous la politique en vigueur depuis 2007.\n[4] Ultimement, dans ma d\u00e9cision, je d\u00e9clarais que les plaignantes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es par la politique en vigueur avant 2007 puisque cette politique ne faisait aucune distinction entre un employ\u00e9 r\u00e9sident et un employ\u00e9 non r\u00e9sident. Pour arriver \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision, j\u2019ai appliqu\u00e9 le\ntest \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 RCS 3 [ Meiorin ] qui commande une analyse en deux temps :\n(1) Y a-t-il preuve prima facie de discrimination?\n(2) Dans l\u2019affirmative, le motif de distinction illicite est-il justifi\u00e9?\n[5] La premi\u00e8re question \u00e0 savoir s\u2019il existait une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9pondue dans l\u2019affirmative puisque les enseignantes autochtones de l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun ne recevaient pas la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement que recevaient pourtant les enseignants non-autochtones r\u00e9sidents de Nutashkuan. En ce qui concerne le deuxi\u00e8me volet, j\u2019ai conclu que : \u00ab aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal par l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour justifier la raison pour laquelle cette prime n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vers\u00e9e aux enseignantes innues de l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun \u00bb [Malec au para. 41].\nB. La d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale [6] Le 23 d\u00e9cembre 2010, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale rendait sa d\u00e9cision en contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision dans Malec (Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan c. Malec et autres, 2010 CF 1325 [Conseil des Montagnais]). La juge Tremblay-Lamer accueille alors la demande, casse la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal et renvoie le dossier \u00e0 \u00ab un membre instructeur du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne pour d\u00e9cider de l\u2019affaire en conformit\u00e9 avec \u00bb les motifs de sa d\u00e9cision [Conseil des Montagnais \u00e0 la p. 15].\n[7] Les motifs de la d\u00e9cision du juge Tremblay-Lamer concernent le deuxi\u00e8me volet du test Meiorin, soit le traitement de la preuve avanc\u00e9e afin de d\u00e9montrer que le motif de distinction illicite \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la juge affirme aux para. 32 \u00e0 36 :\n[I]l est faux d\u2019affirmer que l\u2019employeur n\u2019a fourni aucune preuve justifiant la politique de la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas tenu compte du t\u00e9moignage de M. Andr\u00e9 Leclerc, ancien directeur de l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun. [\u2026] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage afin d\u2019expliquer le but de la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement, M. Leclerc a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n[\u2026] c\u2019est d\u2019amener des ressources et d\u2019esp\u00e9rer qu\u2019elles restent en place [\u2026]\nLe Tribunal a aussi omis, sans motif valable, d\u2019accorder une quelconque force probante \u00e0 l\u2019admission de Mme Malec, en contre-interrogatoire, selon laquelle son conjoint, non-autochtone, mais r\u00e9sident dans la communaut\u00e9, avait re\u00e7u une prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement parce qu\u2019il se trouvait \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la communaut\u00e9 au moment de l\u2019embauche [\u2026].\nIl n\u2019a pas non plus examin\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations de Mme Genevi\u00e8ve T. N\u00e9ashit, une autochtone ayant acquis son statut par mariage qui a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle recevait la prime en raison du fait qu\u2019elle vivait \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la communaut\u00e9 [\u2026].\nLe Tribunal aurait d\u00fb prendre en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019ensemble des t\u00e9moignages [\u2026].\nIl est une chose de dire qu\u2019une preuve est insuffisante pour renverser une preuve prima facie de discrimination, mais il en est une autre de compl\u00e8tement ignorer, comme c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la preuve de justification qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Le Tribunal aurait d\u00fb prendre en consid\u00e9ration les explications apport\u00e9es par le demandeur et d\u00e9cider si, en vertu de la jurisprudence applicable et de la totalit\u00e9 de la preuve, ces explications \u00e9taient suffisantes pour renverser la preuve prima facie de discrimination.\n[8] Finalement, puisque la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, le greffe du Tribunal a sollicit\u00e9, le 7 mars 2011, les observations \u00e9crites des plaignantes, de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour la suite du dossier.\nC. Les proc\u00e9dures suite au contr\u00f4le judiciaire [9] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate du Tribunal, les plaignantes ainsi que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne ont fait valoir qu\u2019aucune nouvelle preuve n\u2019\u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire et que le dossier devrait \u00eatre entendu par le m\u00eame membre instructeur. En revanche, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 qu\u2019un nouveau membre instructeur soit assign\u00e9 au dossier et qu\u2019il soit permis aux parties de pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 nouveau leur preuve.\n[10] Le 29 septembre 2011, la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal rend sa d\u00e9cision quant aux proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 suivre. Celle-ci m\u2019assigne le dossier et me \u00ab laisse la discr\u00e9tion de d\u00e9terminer [ma] propre proc\u00e9dure \u00bb [Malec et autres c. Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan, D\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, Dossier T1318\/4808, 29 septembre 2011, au para. 13].\n[11] Le 26 octobre 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de cette d\u00e9cision de la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal (dossier de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale portant le num\u00e9ro T-1740-11). Le 16 f\u00e9vrier 2012, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un avis de requ\u00eate aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal demandant l\u2019ajournement de la proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal en attendant que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale rende sa d\u00e9cision sur sa requ\u00eate en contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\nII. Les pr\u00e9tentions des parties A. L\u2019intim\u00e9 [12] Dans ses arguments, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a invoqu\u00e9 aucune jurisprudence appuyant sa requ\u00eate pour un ajournement, mais il semble s\u2019appuyer sur le test \u00e0 trois volets \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans les affaires RJR- MacDonald Inc. c. Canada (P.G.), [1994] 1 RCS 311 [MacDonald] et Manitoba (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Metropolitan Stores Ltd., [1987] 1 RCS 110 [Metropolitan Stores].\n[13] En ce qui concerne le premier crit\u00e8re pour l\u2019obtention d\u2019un ajournement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il existe une \u00ab apparence de droit \u00bb, puisque la nomination du membre instructeur pr\u00e9sente, \u00e0 son avis, une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9. Il pr\u00e9cise que \u00ab les propos tenus \u00bb par le membre instructeur dans sa d\u00e9cision justifient en soi cette crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9. Il en conclut donc que l\u2019instruction de l\u2019affaire par le m\u00eame membre instructeur risque ainsi d\u2019\u00eatre contraire aux principes de justice naturelle et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[14] Il soutient \u00e9galement que le maintien de l\u2019instance en attendant la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale lui causerait un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable. Entre autres, il fait valoir qu\u2019il pourrait \u00eatre men\u00e9 \u00e0 divulguer des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui lui seraient nuisibles advenant une seconde audience. Il affirme que la tenue d\u2019une audience devant le Tribunal lui occasionnerait des frais juridiques additionnels et, finalement, qu\u2019il pourrait \u00eatre contraint par le Tribunal \u00e0 verser des sommes d\u2019argent aux plaignantes, lesquelles sommes seraient difficiles \u00e0 recouvrer dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale serait en sa faveur.\n[15] Finalement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients penche en sa faveur, mais ne fournit aucun motif pr\u00e9cis pour justifier cette all\u00e9gation.\nB. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne [16] Pour sa part, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne [la \u00ab Commission \u00bb] s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[17] Selon elle, le Tribunal doit appliquer un test diff\u00e9rent que celui \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans MacDonald et Metropolitan Stores. \u00c0 son avis, puisque la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, LRC 1985, ch H-6 [Loi] n\u2019accorde pas express\u00e9ment le pouvoir au Tribunal d\u2019ajourner une instance, celui-ci ne saurait le faire que si l\u2019absence d\u2019ajournement constituait un d\u00e9ni de justice naturelle en vertu de l\u2019article 48.9 de la Loi.\n[18] Selon la Commission, la tenue d\u2019une nouvelle audience devant le m\u00eame membre instructeur ne soul\u00e8ve aucune crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9. La Commission souligne qu\u2019il existe une pr\u00e9somption voulant que le d\u00e9cideur des faits soit impartial. Selon la Commission, cette pr\u00e9somption ne peut \u00eatre renvers\u00e9e que par des faits concrets et non des soup\u00e7ons.\n[19] Ainsi, selon la Commission, puisqu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune crainte raisonnable d\u2019impartialit\u00e9, l\u2019ajournement demand\u00e9 n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9 par quelque principe de justice naturelle.\nC. Les plaignantes [20] Les plaignantes souscrivent aux motifs de la Commission. Elles mettent en outre l\u2019accent sur les d\u00e9lais d\u00e9j\u00e0 encourus et r\u00e9clament le r\u00e8glement exp\u00e9ditif de l\u2019affaire.\nD. La r\u00e9plique de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [21] L\u2019intim\u00e9, en r\u00e9plique aux arguments de la Commission, soutient que le Tribunal a la comp\u00e9tence pour statuer sur une demande d\u2019ajournement en vertu des paragraphes 3(1) et 1(6) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne adopt\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi. L\u2019ajournement d\u2019instance devant le Tribunal ne se limite donc pas, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, aux cas o\u00f9 il y aurait d\u00e9ni de justice naturelle.\n[22] L\u2019intim\u00e9 confirme que les propos tenu par le membre instructeur dans Malec et cit\u00e9 par la juge Tremblay-Lamer dans Conseil des Montagnais sont les seuls faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s et qu\u2019ils sont suffisants pour fonder une crainte raisonnable d\u2019impartialit\u00e9.\n[23] Finalement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que la Commission ne devrait pas intervenir dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. Selon lui, si la Commission souhaite intervenir, elle devrait prendre \u00ab fait et cause \u00bb pour les plaignantes. Autrement, elle ne devrait pas intervenir parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas intervenue lors de l\u2019audience devant le Tribunal. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019invoque aucune autorit\u00e9 pour appuyer cette conclusion.\nIII. Analyse A. Demande d\u2019ajournement : le test pertinent [24] Afin de d\u00e9cider la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, il me faut d\u2019abord d\u00e9terminer le test pertinent \u00e0 appliquer dans le cas d\u2019une demande d\u2019ajournement. Comme indiqu\u00e9 par la Commission, deux courants traversent la jurisprudence du Tribunal sur cette question.\n[25] D\u2019une part, certaines d\u00e9cisions appliquent les crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans MacDonald et Metropolitan Stores. Ainsi, dans Laurendeau c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada, 2004 TCDP 11 [Laurendeau], une demande d\u2019ajournement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans l\u2019attente d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire portant sur une question pr\u00e9liminaire concernant la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal. Le Tribunal explique l\u2019approche \u00e0 privil\u00e9gier dans cette d\u00e9cision :\nPour obtenir un tel ajournement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit d\u00e9montrer que sa demande rencontre les trois crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis dans les affaires [\u2026] Metropolitan Stores et dans [\u2026] MacDonald [\u2026] soit :\na) \u00c0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape, l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une question s\u00e9rieuse \u00e0 juger.\nb) \u00c0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit convaincre le Tribunal qu\u2019elle subira un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable en cas de refus du redressement. Le terme \u00ab irr\u00e9parable \u00bb a trait \u00e0 la nature du pr\u00e9judice subi plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 son \u00e9tendue.\nc) La troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, celle de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients, consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer laquelle des deux parties subira le plus grand pr\u00e9judice selon que l\u2019on accorde ou refuse l\u2019ajournement. ( Au para. 14).\n[26] Cette approche avait aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie dans Association canadienne des employ\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et autres c. Bell Canada, 2002, No. T503\/2098. Dans cette affaire, une demande d\u2019ajournement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019une d\u00e9cision aff\u00e9rente portant sur l\u2019autonomie institutionnelle et l\u2019impartialit\u00e9 du Tribunal attendait une d\u00e9cision sur une demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019en appeler devant la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada. La demande d\u2019ajournement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e, le Tribunal appliquant pour rendre sa d\u00e9cision le test \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans les affaires MacDonald et Metropolitan Stores.\n[27] D\u2019autre part, un second courant de d\u00e9cisions fait valoir que le Tribunal ne poss\u00e8de le pouvoir d\u2019accorder un ajournement que dans la mesure o\u00f9 il y aurait autrement un d\u00e9ni de justice naturelle. Dans L\u00e9ger c. CN, 1999, No. T527\/2299 [L\u00e9ger], la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer une plainte au Tribunal avait \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e en contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Dans cette affaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019ajourner l\u2019instance jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale rende sa d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate en contr\u00f4le judiciaire. En rejetant la requ\u00eate, le Tribunal a refus\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer les crit\u00e8res des arr\u00eats MacDonald et Metropolitan Stores en \u00e9tablissant une distinction entre les pouvoirs d\u2019un tribunal administratif de celui d\u2019un tribunal de contr\u00f4le :\nLes crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans R.J.R. MacDonald s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 une situation diff\u00e9rente; celle o\u00f9 l\u2019on demande \u00e0 un tribunal ayant le pouvoir de surveillance d\u2019accorder une injonction interlocutoire en vertu de sa comp\u00e9tence inh\u00e9rente ou des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives habilitantes qui le r\u00e9gissent. \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal est assujetti aux r\u00e8gles d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et de justice naturelle, ainsi qu\u2019au r\u00e9gime de la Loi. [\u2026]\nEu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019article 2 [de la Loi], de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions judiciaires ont permis d\u2019\u00e9tablir que les all\u00e9gations de discrimination doivent \u00eatre jug\u00e9es rapidement et de fa\u00e7on opportune. C\u2019est au regard de cette toile de fond qu\u2019il faut examiner la demande d\u2019ajournement [\u2026] (Au para. 5).\n[28] En d\u2019autres mots, puisqu\u2019aucun pouvoir d\u2019ajournement n\u2019est sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 dans la Loi et puisque l\u2019objet de la Loi vise le traitement exp\u00e9ditif des plaintes de discrimination, seuls l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et les principes de justice naturelle permettraient au Tribunal d\u2019exercer sa discr\u00e9tion en accordant un ajournement d\u2019instance.\n[29] Dans Baltruweit c. Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, 2004 TCDP 14 [Baltruweit], la Commission avait r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 un conciliateur dans l\u2019espoir d\u2019arriver \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement; faute de quoi, apr\u00e8s 60 jours, le Tribunal serait saisi du dossier. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a port\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision en contr\u00f4le judiciaire et, entre temps, le processus de conciliation s\u2019est sold\u00e9 par un \u00e9chec. La plainte a ainsi \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise au Tribunal. Cons\u00e9quemment, l\u2019intim\u00e9 demandait au Tribunal d\u2019ajourner l\u2019instance en attendant le d\u00e9nouement du contr\u00f4le judiciaire port\u00e9 devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Ultimement, le Tribunal rejette la demande d\u2019ajournement en refusant toujours d\u2019appliquer le test dans MacDonald et Metropolitan Stores. Le Tribunal \u00e9labore de fa\u00e7on exhaustive les motifs de cette d\u00e9cision qui refl\u00e8te l\u2019approche privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e dans L\u00e9ger :\n[Dans MacDonald et Metropolitan Stores], la cour de r\u00e9vision, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e par la loi \u00e0 suspendre une proc\u00e9dure. En vertu de l\u2019article 18.2 de la Loi sur la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, cette derni\u00e8re peut surseoir \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure d\u2019un tribunal f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en attendant l\u2019issue d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\nAucune disposition de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne conf\u00e8re au Tribunal [\u2026] le pouvoir de surseoir \u00e0 une instance en attendant le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. (Aux para. 11 et 12).\n[30] Le Tribunal poursuit ensuite en expliquant le test pertinent :\nLa Loi exige que l\u2019instruction des plaintes par le Tribunal se fasse sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive et que ce mandat du Tribunal soit exerc\u00e9 dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle (par. 48.9(1)). [\u2026]\nIl est bien \u00e9tabli que les tribunaux administratifs sont ma\u00eetres de leur proc\u00e9dure. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils disposent d\u2019importants pouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de se prononcer sur des demandes d\u2019ajournement. [\u2026]\nIl est \u00e9vident que ce Tribunal doit, dans l\u2019exercice de ses pouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires, tenir compte des r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle. Ainsi, le Tribunal pourrait devoir tenir compte des r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle dans le cas de la non-disponibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019ajourner une instance pour obtenir les services d\u2019un avocat ou d\u2019une divulgation tardive par la partie adverse. (Aux para 14, 15 et 17).\n[31] Finalement, tel que cit\u00e9 par la Commission, un raisonnement similaire \u00e0 celui retrouv\u00e9 dans L\u00e9ger et Bultruweit est adopt\u00e9 dans plusieurs d\u00e9cisions r\u00e9centes : Marshall c. Cerescorp, 2011 CHRT 5, Marshall v. Cerescorp, 2011 TCDP 9 et Emmett v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2012 CHRT 3.\n[32] Le second courant de jurisprudence soul\u00e8ve un point important en indiquant que les tribunaux administratifs sont ma\u00eetres de leur propre proc\u00e9dure. Comme le souligne l\u2019intim\u00e9, la R\u00e8gle 1(6) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, adopt\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi, accorde un large pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire aux membres instructeurs en mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dure :\n1(6) Le membre instructeur conserve le pouvoir de se prononcer sur toute question de proc\u00e9dure non pr\u00e9vue par les pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles.\n[33] Ainsi, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas tenu d\u2019appliquer le test \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans les arr\u00eats MacDonald et Metropolitan Stores, bien qu\u2019il puisse s\u2019en inspirer ou s\u2019y reporter selon les circonstances et la plaidoirie des parties. La proc\u00e9dure privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e par le Tribunal doit cependant respecter les dispositions et l\u2019objet de la Loi. La Loi vise l\u2019enrayement de la discrimination, ce qui implique un traitement rapide des plaintes de discrimination. D\u2019ailleurs, le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi confirme cette volont\u00e9 d\u2019apporter des correctifs rapides aux pratiques discriminatoires :\n48.9 (1) L\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique.\n[34] Ainsi, pour obtenir un ajournement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce devra convaincre le Tribunal que la poursuite de la pr\u00e9sente instance, sans d\u00e9lai additionnel, lui causerait un d\u00e9ni de justice naturelle et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. Cette approche semble d\u2019autant plus suffisante que l\u2019intim\u00e9 peut, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, demander \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de surseoir \u00e0 l\u2019instance devant le Tribunal. En effet, l\u2019article 18.2 de la Loi sur les cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, RSC, 1985, c F-7 stipule ce qui suit :\n18.2 La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale peut, lorsqu\u2019elle est saisie d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, prendre les mesures provisoires qu\u2019elle estime indiqu\u00e9es avant de rendre sa d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive\n[35] Entre temps, le Tribunal doit donner effet \u00e0 l\u2019objet et aux dispositions de la Loi qui commandent un traitement exp\u00e9ditif des plaintes de discrimination tout en respectant les principes de justice naturelle.\nB. Crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 [36] Au soutient de sa demande pour un ajournement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir qu\u2019il existe une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 suite \u00e0 la nomination du membre instructeur. \u00c0 cet effet, les seuls faits soulev\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son all\u00e9gation de crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 sont ces parties de la d\u00e9cision dans Malec reprises par la juge Tremblay-Lamer dans Conseil des Montagnais aux paragraphes 31 et 32. Aux paragraphes 8 et 9 de sa r\u00e9plique, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9cise :\n8. Quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de la Commission et des plaignantes \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019Intim\u00e9 plaide sans faits pr\u00e9cis, d\u00e9montrant que le membre Doucet ne peut statuer de nouveau sur la plainte, nous r\u00e9f\u00e9rons le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal au m\u00e9moire de l\u2019Intim\u00e9, dont copie est jointe \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente, d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au dossier du contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale;\n9. Dans ledit m\u00e9moire, l\u2019Intim\u00e9 fait une description des faits et des propos tenus par le membre-instructeur Doucet dans sa d\u00e9cision du 27 janvier 2010 et soulign\u00e9s par la juge Tremblay-Lamer dans son jugement pr\u00e9alablement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sent dossier [\u2026]\n[37] Les faits et propos auxquels r\u00e9f\u00e8re l\u2019intim\u00e9 sont r\u00e9sum\u00e9s comme suit par la juge Tremblay-Lamer dans Conseil des Montagnais :\n\u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le Tribunal a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune preuve n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le demandeur afin de justifier pourquoi cette prime n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e aux d\u00e9fenderesses :\nLe fardeau incombe donc maintenant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que son refus de verser aux plaignantes la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement comporte un motif justifiable. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a fourni aucune preuve pour justifier l\u2019existence de ce traitement in\u00e9gal. En plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir que le traitement s\u2019expliquait en raison de la r\u00e9sidence permanente des r\u00e9cipiendaires plut\u00f4t que de leur race\/origine ethnique ou nationales. Lesdites \u00ab admissions \u00bb des plaignantes ne poss\u00e8dent pas une valeur probante permettant une telle conclusion ou pratique \u00bb. (d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, au par. 45). [mon soulignement]\nOr, il est faux d\u2019affirmer que l\u2019employeur n\u2019a fourni aucune preuve justifiant la politique de la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement. (Aux para. 31 et 32).\n[38] \u00c0 mon avis, ces faits et propos ne suffisent pas, dans les circonstances, \u00e0 fonder une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9.\n[39] Une all\u00e9gation de crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre prise au s\u00e9rieux, car elle implique des cons\u00e9quences importantes pour la r\u00e9putation du syst\u00e8me judiciaire et quasi judiciaire. Une telle all\u00e9gation ne peut \u00eatre faite \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re. C\u2019est pourquoi il existe une pr\u00e9somption voulant que le d\u00e9cideur des faits, en l\u2019occurrence le membre instructeur, soit impartial. Cette pr\u00e9somption ne peut \u00eatre renvers\u00e9e que par des faits concrets et une preuve probante.\n[40] Dans Arthur c. Canada (procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2001 CAF 223, la cour faisait face \u00e0 une all\u00e9gation de crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9. En refusant de donner raison au demandeur, la cour souligne le caract\u00e8re s\u00e9rieux de l\u2019all\u00e9gation en cause ainsi que le degr\u00e9 et la nature de la preuve requise :\nUne all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9, surtout la partialit\u00e9 actuelle et non simplement appr\u00e9hend\u00e9e, port\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un tribunal, est une all\u00e9gation s\u00e9rieuse. Elle met en doute l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du tribunal et des membres qui ont particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision attaqu\u00e9e. Elle ne peut \u00eatre faite \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re. Elle ne peut reposer sur de simples soup\u00e7ons, de pures conjectures, des insinuations ou encore de simples impressions d\u2019un demandeur ou de son procureur. Elle doit \u00eatre \u00e9tay\u00e9e par des preuves concr\u00e8tes qui font ressortir un comportement d\u00e9rogatoire \u00e0 la norme. Pour ce faire, il est souvent utile et m\u00eame n\u00e9cessaire de recourir \u00e0 des preuves extrins\u00e8ques au dossier. (Au para. 8).\n[41] Dans Committee for Justice and Liberty c. Canada (Office national de l\u2019\u00e9nergie), [1978] 1 RCS 369, la Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9tabli le test pertinent afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 :\n[L]a crainte de partialit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre raisonnable et le fait d\u2019une personne sens\u00e9e et raisonnable qui se poserait elle-m\u00eame la question et prendrait les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 ce sujet. [\u2026] [C]e crit\u00e8re consiste \u00e0 se demander [\u2026] \u00e0 quelle conclusion en arriverait une personne bien renseign\u00e9e qui \u00e9tudierait la question en profondeur, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9aliste et pratique. [\u2026] (Aux para. 40 et 41).\n[42] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve avanc\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9, une personne bien renseign\u00e9e et ayant bien \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la question ne serait pas port\u00e9e \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019il existe une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9. Le fait qu\u2019un juge ou que le membre d\u2019un tribunal aurait commis une erreur de droit ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le pas un pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 ou quelque degr\u00e9 de partialit\u00e9; il r\u00e9v\u00e8le tout au plus une erreur dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation du droit et des faits. D\u00e9pourvue de preuves additionnelles d\u00e9montrant la partialit\u00e9 du membre instructeur au-del\u00e0 d\u2019une erreur de droit, une personne bien renseign\u00e9e ne saurait arriver \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il existe une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9.\n[43] Par exemple, dans Irvine c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2004 TCDP 9 [Irvine], le Tribunal avait conclu dans une d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente (Irvine c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), [2001] DCDP No 39) que les Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes avaient agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire lorsqu\u2019elles avaient lib\u00e9r\u00e9 le plaignant pour cause m\u00e9dicale. En contr\u00f4le judiciaire (Irvine c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), 2003 CFPI 660), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le Tribunal avait commis une erreur en omettant d\u2019appliquer le test Meiorin en fonction du principe de l\u2019\u00ab universalit\u00e9 du service \u00bb, un principe reconnu par la jurisprudence et voulant que chaque employ\u00e9 des Forces arm\u00e9es soit apte \u00e0 \u00eatre un soldat. Le dossier a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 au Tribunal pour une analyse ajust\u00e9e et davantage motiv\u00e9 en fonction du principe de l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service.\n[44] Or, dans Irvine, le dossier renvoy\u00e9 au Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 au m\u00eame membre instructeur. Comme dans plusieurs cas, les erreurs du membre d\u2019un tribunal administratif ou d\u2019un juge ne constituent pas, en soi, une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9.\n[45] Puisque l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne soul\u00e8ve aucun autre fait que ceux indiqu\u00e9s par la juge Tremblay-Lamer dans Conseil des Montagnais, la preuve est insuffisante et ne d\u00e9montre pas une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9. Il s\u2019ensuit que le maintien de l\u2019instance devant le m\u00eame membre instructeur du Tribunal n\u2019est pas contraire aux principes de justice naturelle. Ainsi, l\u2019ajournement demand\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9 en droit.\nC. Pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable et pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients [46] Puisque l\u2019intim\u00e9 a plaid\u00e9 sa demande en vertu du test \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans MacDonald et Metropolitan Stores, il est utile de noter que la requ\u00eate d\u2019ajournement serait \u00e9galement refus\u00e9e au terme du test \u00e0 trois volets.\n[47] En supposant qu\u2019il existe une question s\u00e9rieuse, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas, \u00e0 mon avis, fait la preuve d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019intim\u00e9 all\u00e8gue que les co\u00fbts juridiques encourus ainsi que les sommes d\u2019argent dont le Tribunal pourrait ordonner le paiement constituent un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable. Toutefois, il est bien \u00e9tabli que ce type de d\u00e9penses ne constitue pas un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable, mais plut\u00f4t un d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ment (Laurendeau au para. 19).\n[48] L\u2019intim\u00e9 all\u00e8gue par ailleurs qu\u2019il subirait un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable en risquant de d\u00e9voiler des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui pourraient lui porter pr\u00e9judice lors d\u2019une nouvelle audience. Cette crainte ne semble pas fond\u00e9e dans les circonstances. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire au Tribunal pour que celui-ci consid\u00e8re et analyse une preuve d\u00e9j\u00e0 existante (Conseil des Montagnais au para 32. \u00e0 38). En outre, les faits soulign\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne fournissent aucune raison de croire que la pr\u00e9sentation de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve soit n\u00e9cessaire.\n[49] Quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients, \u00e0 mon avis, l\u2019inconv\u00e9nient pour les plaignantes de ne pas avoir droit au r\u00e8glement exp\u00e9ditif de leur plainte, apr\u00e8s d\u00e9j\u00e0 plusieurs ann\u00e9es de litige, est sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 l\u2019inconv\u00e9nient pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019avoir \u00e0 se soumettre \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance.\nD. L\u2019intervention de la Commission [50] En ce qui concerne l\u2019objection de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intervention de la Commission, celle-ci n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e en droit. La R\u00e8gle 1(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne pr\u00e9cise l\u2019objet des r\u00e8gles, notamment :\na) que toutes les parties \u00e0 une instruction aient la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de se faire entendre;\n[51] Or, la R\u00e8gle 1(3) d\u00e9finit \u00ab partie \u00bb comme suit :\n\u00ab partie \u00bb, dans le cas d\u2019une instruction, d\u00e9signe la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, le plaignant et la personne faisant l\u2019objet de la plainte;\n[52] \u00c0 mon avis, la R\u00e8gle 1(3) implique que la Commission est une partie \u00e0 toute instance devant le Tribunal et peut choisir d\u2019intervenir \u00e0 tout moment en vertu de la R\u00e8gle 1 et en d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 la R\u00e8gle 8 sur l\u2019adjonction de parties et de parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es. En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019invoque aucune autorit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019effet contraire. La Commission \u00e9tait et demeure en droit d\u2019intervenir dans la pr\u00e9sente instance.\nIV. Conclusion [53] Pour les raisons qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la requ\u00eate d\u2019ajournement de l\u2019intim\u00e9 est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nMichel Doucet\nMembre du tribunal\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 11 avril 2012\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal: T1318\/4808\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause: \u00c9velyne Malec et autres v.

Le contexte [1] La pr\u00e9sente affaire (\u00ab Thwaites \u00bb) concerne 69 pilotes d\u2019Air Canada (les plaignants) dont on a mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi juste parce qu\u2019ils avaient atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite obligatoire de 60 ans. Ils ont port\u00e9 plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission), disant \u00eatre victimes de discrimination de la part d\u2019Air Canada et de l\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada (l\u2019APAC) du fait de leur \u00e2ge.\n[2] Le Tribunal a entendu les plaintes au cours des mois d\u2019octobre 2009 et de janvier 2010. L\u2019une des questions en litige que les plaignants ont soulev\u00e9es \u00e9tait la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP). Comme cela est exig\u00e9, ils ont signifi\u00e9 un avis de question constitutionnelle.\n[3] \u00c0 la demande des plaignants, le Tribunal a statu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019examinerait pas pour le moment la question de la constitutionnalit\u00e9. Au terme de la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve concernant les alin\u00e9as 15(1)c) et 15(1)a) ainsi que le paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP, les parties, si elles le jugeaient opportun, pouvaient pr\u00e9senter des observations \u00e0 propos de la question de savoir s\u2019il y avait lieu que le Tribunal entende des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des arguments sur la question constitutionnelle et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, le Tribunal fixerait des dates en vue de l\u2019instruction de cette question.\n[4] Le Tribunal a rendu sa d\u00e9cision 2011 TCDP 11 le 10 ao\u00fbt 2011. Dans cette derni\u00e8re, il a conclu que les intim\u00e9es pouvaient invoquer l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP comme d\u00e9fense pour faire valoir que la politique de retraite obligatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans n\u2019\u00e9quivalait pas \u00e0 un acte discriminatoire. Il a donc rejet\u00e9 les plaintes.\n[5] Peu apr\u00e8s la publication de la d\u00e9cision, la Commission a fait part au Tribunal du caract\u00e8re contradictoire du rejet des plaintes ainsi que de sa directive ant\u00e9rieure de remettre \u00e0 plus tard l\u2019audition d\u2019observations sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP.\n[6] Le 9 septembre 2011, la Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire examiner et modifier sa d\u00e9cision (2011 TCDP 11) et \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir que l\u2019audition soit reprise en vue de trancher la question de la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle, de l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 et de l\u2019effet de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP. Le Tribunal a fait droit \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate le 20 f\u00e9vrier 2012, et a ordonn\u00e9 aux parties de fournir des observations \u00e9crites sur la question.\n[7] Les plaignants et la Commission soutiennent que la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale publi\u00e9e sous la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence 2011 CF 120 (Vilven no 2) est d\u00e9terminante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette question et qu\u2019il convient donc de juger les plaintes fond\u00e9es. Les intim\u00e9es sont d\u2019avis que cette d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne lie pas le Tribunal. De plus, ils font valoir qu\u2019il y aurait lieu de reporter l\u2019examen, par le Tribunal, de la question constitutionnelle et de l\u2019\u00e9tat des plaintes jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale se soit prononc\u00e9e sur la question.\nII. La d\u00e9cision 2011 CF 120 (Vilven no 2) de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale [8] La gen\u00e8se de Vilven no 2 est la d\u00e9cision que le Tribunal a rendue dans l\u2019affaire Vilven et Kelly c. Air Canada et ACPA, 2007 TCDP 36. Dans cette derni\u00e8re, qui porte sur la retraite obligatoire des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada, le Tribunal (le Tribunal Vilven) a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP ne contrevenait pas au paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte. MM. Vilven et Kelly ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire concernant cette d\u00e9cision. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP contrevenait bel et bien \u00e0 la Charte et elle a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire au Tribunal Vilven pour qu\u2019il soit d\u00e9cid\u00e9 si l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) pouvait se justifier au regard de l\u2019article premier de la Charte.\n[9] \u00c0 la suite d\u2019une audition sur la question, le Tribunal Vilven a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) n\u2019\u00e9tait pas sauvegard\u00e9 par l\u2019article premier de la Charte. Les intim\u00e9es, Air Canada et l\u2019APAC, ont demand\u00e9 que cette d\u00e9cision soit soumise \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[10] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire des intim\u00e9es sur cette question. Pour ce faire, elle a tout d\u2019abord fait remarquer que la conclusion du Tribunal \u00e0 propos de l\u2019article premier de la Charte \u00e9tait susceptible de contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte. Elle a examin\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail le raisonnement suivi dans la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal sur l\u2019article premier, a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la jurisprudence de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada en mati\u00e8re de retraite obligatoire, a analys\u00e9 pourquoi la d\u00e9cision rendue dans l\u2019arr\u00eat McKinney de la Cour supr\u00eame ne dictait pas les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019affaire et, enfin, s\u2019est lanc\u00e9e dans une analyse exhaustive de la question de savoir si l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP se justifiait au regard de l\u2019article premier de la Charte.\n[11] Pour ce qui est de cette derni\u00e8re question, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a examin\u00e9 si l\u2019affaire satisfaisait aux quatre \u00e9l\u00e9ments exig\u00e9s selon le cadre analytique expos\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Oakes relativement \u00e0 l\u2019article premier. Elle a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 cet examen en se fondant sur la jurisprudence entourant l\u2019arr\u00eat Oakes ainsi que sur le dossier de preuve, qui comprenait les preuves d\u2019expert qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal Vilven. Dans ses motifs, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a clairement mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle souscrivait \u00e0 certaines des conclusions du Tribunal, mais non \u00e0 toutes, relativement aux quatre \u00e9l\u00e9ments du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Oakes.\n[12] En particulier, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas souscrit \u00e0 la conclusion du Tribunal Vilven selon laquelle les d\u00e9fendeurs (les intim\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce) ne satisfaisaient \u00e0 aucun des quatre \u00e9l\u00e9ments du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat Oakes. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a plut\u00f4t conclu que les d\u00e9fendeurs satisfaisaient \u00e0 deux de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments, soit le fait que les objectifs de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) \u00e9taient urgents et r\u00e9els et qu\u2019il y avait un lien rationnel entre l\u2019objectif l\u00e9gislatif en question et la disposition l\u00e9gislative contest\u00e9e. Cependant, elle a conclu que le Tribunal avait raison dans son \u00e9valuation du crit\u00e8re de la proportionnalit\u00e9 et du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019atteinte minimale.\n[13] Apr\u00e8s avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 sa propre analyse des questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article premier de la Charte, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu :\nPour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je conclus que le Tribunal a conclu avec raison qu\u2019Air Canada et l\u2019APAC ne se sont pas acquitt\u00e9es du fardeau qui leur incombe de montrer que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP est sauvegard\u00e9 par l\u2019article premier de la Charte. Air Canada et l\u2019APAC n\u2019ont pas montr\u00e9 que l\u2019exception libell\u00e9e en termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux \u00e0 la pratique par ailleurs discriminatoire qu\u2019est la retraite obligatoire, \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP, constitue une limite raisonnable, justifiable dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique. (Paragraphe 351, Vilven no 2)\n[14] Peu apr\u00e8s l\u2019audition des demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, MM. Vilven et Kelly ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire modifier leur m\u00e9moire des faits et du droit en vue d\u2019inclure une demande de d\u00e9claration portant que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP \u00e9tait incompatible avec la Charte et, du fait du paragraphe 52(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, inop\u00e9rant.\n[15] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a refus\u00e9 de faire droit \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate. Elle a signal\u00e9 que, m\u00eame si elle \u00e9tait habilit\u00e9e \u00e0 entendre les contestations de nature constitutionnelle qui pouvaient \u00eatre soulev\u00e9es dans une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire et \u00e0 rendre un jugement d\u00e9claratoire, il fallait que ce soit le demandeur qui sollicite ce jugement, et non le d\u00e9fendeur. De plus, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne pouvait accorder un tel jugement que si elle concluait que le Tribunal avait commis une erreur dans sa conclusion, ce qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le cas en l\u2019occurrence.\n[16] De plus, m\u00eame en pr\u00e9sumant que l\u2019on pouvait accorder un jugement d\u00e9claratoire \u00e0 un d\u00e9fendeur, ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, et ce, pour deux raisons. Premi\u00e8rement, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate \u00e9tait une contestation indirecte de la d\u00e9cision relative aux redressements qu\u2019avait rendue le Tribunal Vilven, 2010 TCDP 27, et elle n\u2019en \u00e9tait pas saisie.\n[17] Deuxi\u00e8mement, c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019APAC qui avait signifi\u00e9 l\u2019avis de question constitutionnelle li\u00e9 \u00e0 sa demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire et les procureurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux n\u2019auraient pas pu pr\u00e9voir que MM. Vilven et Kelly solliciteraient une d\u00e9claration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019invalidit\u00e9.\n[18] L\u2019APAC, soutenue par Air Canada, a interjet\u00e9 appel de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Vilven no 2 aupr\u00e8s de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, demandant que cette d\u00e9cision soit infirm\u00e9e, que sa demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire soit accueillie et que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal Vilven sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP soit annul\u00e9e.\n[19] MM. Vilven et Kelly ont interjet\u00e9 un appel incident contre la d\u00e9cision Vilven no 2, soutenant que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale aurait d\u00fb rendre une d\u00e9claration d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP \u00e9tait incompatible avec la Charte. Ils ont demand\u00e9 que la Cour d\u2019appel rejette l\u2019appel de l\u2019APAC et rende un jugement d\u00e9claratoire portant que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) \u00e9tait invalide et inop\u00e9rant.\n[20] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a entendu l\u2019appel et l\u2019appel incident les 22 et 23 novembre 2011, et elle a pris l\u2019affaire en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\nIII. Les observations des parties [21] Les plaignants sont d\u2019avis que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans la d\u00e9cision Vilven no 2, a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP est inconstitutionnel. Cette d\u00e9cision lie le Tribunal dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, et les plaintes doivent \u00eatre confirm\u00e9es. Une conclusion contraire, soutiennent-ils, irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des principes du stare decisis, de la chose jug\u00e9e (pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e) et de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[22] Les intim\u00e9es soutiennent le contraire. L\u2019essentiel de leurs arguments est que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans la d\u00e9cision Vilven no 2, n\u2019a pas conclu que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP contrevenait \u00e0 la Charte; elle n\u2019a fait que confirmer que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal Vilven \u00e9tait correcte. Par ailleurs, les plaignants cherchent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e0 faire infirmer, d\u2019une part, la d\u00e9cision par laquelle la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 leur requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 obtenir une d\u00e9claration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 et, d\u2019autre part, le refus du Tribunal Vilven de rendre une ordonnance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de cessation et d\u2019abstention.\n[23] Je ne souscris pas aux arguments des intim\u00e9es. Il est \u00e9vident que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019est livr\u00e9e \u00e0 une analyse exhaustive, d\u00e9taill\u00e9e et ind\u00e9pendante des questions soulev\u00e9es dans les demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire (dans la version anglaise de la d\u00e9cision, les motifs de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur cette question s\u2019\u00e9tendent sur 300 paragraphes du jugement, qui en compte 493). Sur ce fondement, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que les d\u00e9fendeurs (les intim\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce) ne s\u2019\u00e9taient pas acquitt\u00e9s du fardeau que leur imposait le crit\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat Oakes. Elle a donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le Tribunal avait raison et a rejet\u00e9 les demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[24] Je ne souscris pas non plus \u00e0 l\u2019affirmation des intim\u00e9es selon laquelle les plaignants obtiendraient une d\u00e9claration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 ou une ordonnance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de cessation et d\u2019abstention si le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal concluait que la d\u00e9cision Vilven no 2 le lie. Dans un tel cas, tout ce que le Tribunal peut faire est de refuser d\u2019appliquer l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) aux faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ce qu\u2019il a le pouvoir de faire.\n[25] Apr\u00e8s avoir conclu qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans Vilven no 2 que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP n\u2019\u00e9tait pas sauvegard\u00e9 par l\u2019article premier de la Charte, il reste \u00e0 savoir si cette d\u00e9cision lie le Tribunal. Les plaignants disent que oui et, \u00e0 l\u2019appui de leur position, ils invoquent les principes du stare decisis, de la chose jug\u00e9e et de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[26] Selon le principe du stare decisis, les tribunaux judiciaires et administratifs d\u2019instance inf\u00e9rieure sont tenus de se conformer aux d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux d\u2019instance sup\u00e9rieure. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que les tribunaux judiciaires et administratifs qui se situent \u00e0 un palier inf\u00e9rieur dans la hi\u00e9rarchie judiciaire sont li\u00e9s par les d\u00e9cisions de nature juridique que rendent les tribunaux qui se situent \u00e0 un palier sup\u00e9rieur au sein du m\u00eame ressort. Mais ce n\u2019est que dans les cas o\u00f9 une question soumise \u00e0 un tribunal d\u2019instance inf\u00e9rieure tombe sous le coup du ratio decidendi d\u2019une d\u00e9cision d\u2019un tribunal d\u2019instance sup\u00e9rieure que ce tribunal d\u2019instance inf\u00e9rieure est tenu d\u2019appliquer ce ratio \u00e0 l\u2019affaire dont il est saisi.\n[27] Bien que le fait de savoir comment d\u00e9terminer le ratio decidendi d\u2019une d\u00e9cision particuli\u00e8re suscite bien des d\u00e9bats, il est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement admis que ce ratio d\u00e9coule des faits que le tribunal consid\u00e8re comme importants ainsi que de la d\u00e9cision qui repose sur ces faits.\n[28] \u00c0 mon avis, les faits importants sur lesquels la Cour s\u2019est fond\u00e9e \u00e9taient ceux qui avaient trait \u00e0 l\u2019application du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Oakes, et la d\u00e9cision qui en r\u00e9sulte, laquelle repose sur ces faits importants, constitue le ratio decidendi de la d\u00e9cision Vilven no 2.\n[29] La question soumise au pr\u00e9sent Tribunal rel\u00e8ve nettement du ratio decidendi de la d\u00e9cision rendue dans Vilven no 2. Rien dans les faits importants qui sont pr\u00e9sents dans le dossier relatif \u00e0 l\u2019instance devant le Tribunal ne permet de les distinguer notablement des faits importants qui sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 la question constitutionnelle invoqu\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire dont la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9tait saisie. La d\u00e9cision de cette derni\u00e8re sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 du paragraphe 15(1) avait trait \u00e0 une situation juridique et factuelle identique \u00e0 celle dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. J\u2019ai donc conclu que la d\u00e9cision rendue dans Vilven no 2 lie le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP.\nIV. L\u2019ordonnance [30] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je modifie par la pr\u00e9sente la d\u00e9cision 2011 TCDP 11 du Tribunal, ainsi :\n(a) Le paragraphe 182 de la d\u00e9cision 2011 TCDP 11 du Tribunal est supprim\u00e9.\n(b) Le paragraphe 430 de la d\u00e9cision 2011 TCDP 11 du Tribunal est supprim\u00e9 et remplac\u00e9 par celui-ci :\n[traduction] [430] J\u2019ai conclu que les intim\u00e9es ne peuvent se fonder sur la d\u00e9fense portant sur l\u2019EPJ au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la LCDP. J\u2019ai \u00e9galement conclu au vu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve produits qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi des plaignants \u00e0 l\u2019\u00ab \u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur \u00bb au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c). Cependant, comme il reste \u00e0 trancher la contestation de nature constitutionnelle des plaignants concernant l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c), je ne puis tirer aucune conclusion d\u00e9terminante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019application de cette disposition. Je ne suis pas non plus en mesure de d\u00e9cider de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9finitive si les plaintes sont fond\u00e9es ou non. Il faudra que les parties pr\u00e9sentent des observations additionnelles sur les prochaines mesures \u00e0 prendre dans la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[31] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les observations des parties sur l\u2019effet juridique de la d\u00e9cision que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendue dans l\u2019affaire Vilven no 2 et conclu que cette d\u00e9cision lie le Tribunal, je refuse d\u2019appliquer l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) \u00e0 l\u2019affaire dont le Tribunal est pr\u00e9sentement saisi, au motif qu\u2019elle est inconstitutionnelle, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle contrevient \u00e0 l\u2019article 15 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, laquelle contravention ne peut \u00eatre sauvegard\u00e9e par l\u2019article premier.\n[32] Les intim\u00e9es n\u2019ayant pu d\u00e9montrer l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 des d\u00e9fenses justificatives qu\u2019ils ont invoqu\u00e9es (alin\u00e9a 15(1)a), paragraphe 15(2) et alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP), je conclus que les plaintes sont fond\u00e9es.\n[33] Je me r\u00e9serve par la pr\u00e9sente le droit de r\u00e9gler toute question en suspens.\n\u00ab Sign\u00e9e par \u00bb\nJ.
