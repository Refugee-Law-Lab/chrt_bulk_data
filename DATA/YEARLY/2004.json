INQUIRY\nII. JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL TO HEAR THE RESPONDENT'S APPLICATION\nIII. EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE ARBITRATOR\nIV. CONCLUSION\nI. INQUIRY [1] There are two preliminary objections under inquiry by the Tribunal, one raised by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) and the other by Purolator Courier Limited (the Respondent), in respect of a complaint filed September 13, 2000, by Robert Coulter (the Complainant).\n[2] In his complaint, the Complainant alleges that the Respondent discriminated against him by failing to [translation] treat him differently, by refusing to accommodate [him] and by dismissing [him], because of [his] disability, Steinert myopathy, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act ).\n[3] In its preliminary objection, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear the complaint since the issue raised in it is the subject matter of grievances and that the grievance arbitrator is therefore the competent forum to hear and dispose of any alleged contravention.\n[4] The Commission, for its part, argues that the Tribunal is not the appropriate body to consider the Respondent's preliminary objection and that it falls to the Trial Division of the Federal Court of Canada to conduct the judicial review of the Commission's decision to refer the matter to the Tribunal.\n[5] I will deal first with the objection raised by the Commission.\nII. JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL TO HEAR THE RESPONDENT'S APPLICATION [6] To dispute the Tribunal's jurisdiction to hear the Respondent's application, the Commission relies notably on the ruling of Mr. Justice Gibson in International Longshore & Warehouse Union (Marine Section), Local 400 v. Oster.1\n[7] While it has been clearly established in Oster that the Tribunal does not have the power to oversee measures and decisions of the Commission, as only the Trial Division of the Federal Court has this power, I do not believe that Oster supports the Commission's position in the case at bar.\n[8] According to the Commission, the application submitted by the Respondent is an ex post facto challenge of the Commission's decision to investigate and refer the complaint to the Tribunal. By means of this application, the Respondent is in point of fact challenging the Commission's exercise of its discretionary power conferred by section 41 of the Act, specifically, in this case, by paragraph (1)(a)2 of that section. If this were the case, such a challenge should in fact have been submitted to the Trial Division of the Federal Court as provided for in the Oster ruling.\n[9] However, the Respondent's application does not constitute an application for judicial review by the Tribunal of the Commission's decision to refer the Complainant's case to the Tribunal. On the contrary, the Respondent is disputing the Tribunal's jurisdiction to hear the complaint, arguing that the issue raised in it is the subject matter of grievances and that the grievance arbitrator is therefore the only forum competent to hear and dispose of it.\n[10] As Chairperson Mactavish (as she was at the time) pointed out:\nWhile the Tribunal may not purport to review Commission decisions, it does not follow from Oster that once a discretionary decision is made by the Commission pursuant to sections 41 or 44 of the Act, the Tribunal is absolutely without jurisdiction to deal with the underlying facts giving rise to that decision.\nIt is instructive to keep in mind the powers of the Commission at the investigatory stage. The Commission is a screening body rather than an adjudicative one, and, unlike the Tribunal, is not empowered to decide general questions of law.3\n[11] Pursuant to subsection 50(2) of the Act, in the course of hearing and determining any matter under inquiry, the Tribunal may decide all questions of law or fact necessary to determining the matter. The matter raised by the Respondent in the case in point is a question of law, which the Tribunal may hear and determine. It clearly falls to the Tribunal to determine the limits of its own jurisdiction. Accordingly, I am satisfied that I have jurisdiction to hear the Respondent's application.\nIII. EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE ARBITRATOR [12] According to the facts submitted by the Respondent in its application, at the time of the events giving rise to this dispute, the Complainant was a unionized employee, subject to a collective agreement between the Canada Council of Teamsters and the Respondent. It appears that the Complainant has filed at least three grievances disputing the action taken by the Respondent against him. These grievances concern, notably, the alleged refusals of the Respondent to accommodate the Complainant. At the present time, these grievances are still pending.\n[13] The Respondent maintains that it is aware of the existence of a line of authorities that tend to confer on the Tribunal the jurisdiction necessary to decide on the merits of this dispute. It adds, however, that this line of authorities ought to be revisited in light of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Parry Sound (District) Social Services Administration Board v. O.P.S.E.U., Local 324 (Parry Sound).4\n[14] In Parry Sound, the Supreme Court of Canada had to rule on the application of human rights and other employment-related statutes within the ambit of a collective agreement. Specifically, it had to determine whether grievance arbitrators have the power to enforce the rights and obligations of these statutes.\n[15] In that case, Ms. O'Brien, a probationary employee, was dismissed by her employer soon after her return from maternity leave. Convinced that she had been discharged without justification in an arbitrary, discriminatory and unfair manner, she immediately reacted by filing a grievance against her former employer. Before the Board of Arbitration established pursuant to the Labour Relations Act,5 the employer claimed that the Board did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the grievance since Article 8.06(a) of the collective agreement stated that a probationary employee may be discharged at the sole discretion of and for any reason satisfactory to the Employer and such action by the Employer is not subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures and does not constitute a difference between the parties.\n[16] Despite the wording of the collective agreement, the Board found that the grievance was arbitrable on the ground that the substantive rights recognized by the Human Rights Code6 were imported into the collective agreement over which the grievance arbitrator had jurisdiction. It was this ruling that was taken to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n[17] The Supreme Court, in a majority decision, recognized that a grievance arbitrator has the power and responsibility to enforce the substantive rights and obligations of human rights and other employment-related statutes as if they were part of the collective agreement. Thus, the grievance filed by Ms. O'Brien was arbitrable, regardless of the contrary intention expressed by the parties in Article 8.06(a) of the collective agreement.\n[18] In its written argument, the Respondent essentially goes on at length about the Supreme Court's analysis of section 48 of the Labour Relations Act, 1995,7 notably paragraph 48(12)(j), and its similarities with paragraph 60(1)(a.1) of the Canada Labour Code.8 According to the Respondent, these provisions confer on the grievance arbitrator or the arbitration board, as the case may be, the power to interpret, apply and give relief in accordance with a statute relating to employment matters.\n[19] It therefore concludes that the ruling in Parry Sound confirms the power given to grievance arbitrators and arbitration boards to interpret and apply human rights statutes such as the Canadian Human Rights Act. In light of this, it then wonders whether it is the grievance arbitrator or the Tribunal that has jurisdiction to resolve the dispute between the Complainant and the Respondent in the case in point.\n[20] In my opinion, Mr. Justice Iacobucci, writing for the majority of the Court, clearly answers this question in Parry Sound:\nI also note that the Ontario Human Rights Commission has intervened in this appeal for the purpose of ensuring that its jurisdiction is not ousted because the aggrieved employee is a party to a collective agreement over which the Board has jurisdiction. The Commission submits that if the Court finds that the grievance is arbitrable, the Board and the Commission have concurrent jurisdiction. In my view, it is unnecessary to determine this matter at the present time. Consequently, in concluding that a grievance arbitrator has the power and responsibility to enforce the substantive rights and obligations of the Human Rights Code in this case, I make no holding on whether the jurisdiction of the Human Rights Commission is ousted by that of the Board.9 (My emphasis.)\n[21] It is therefore my opinion that the decision of the Supreme Court in Parry Sound has in no way altered the line of authorities that has governed this issue until today. I will therefore deal with the Respondent's application by relying on this jurisprudence.\n[22] In Weber v. Ontario Hydro10 (Weber), the Supreme Court of Canada was asked to determine in what instances a labour statute that makes provision for binding arbitration clauses prevents employers and employees from instituting legal proceedings against each other. Mr. Weber, an Ontario Hydro employee suffering from back problems, had initially filed a grievance against his employer, who he blamed for violating the collective agreement by hiring private investigators to investigate the seriousness of his illness. He had then commenced a court action based on tort and breach of his rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n[23] In Weber, the Supreme Court determined that when a dispute arises essentially out of a collective agreement, the plaintiff must submit it to the arbitration process. The courts have no power to hear a civil remedy in respect of such a dispute.\n[24] The application of Weber to proceedings instituted pursuant to the Act has been taken up in a number of subsequent rulings. In Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v. Paul,11 the Trial Division of the Federal Court dealt with a situation in which an employee chose to file a human rights complaint with the Commission rather than file a grievance with her union. The Court ruled that it was appropriate to distinguish from the Weber case since that decision did not address the situation of concurrent jurisdiction given by the legislator to another forum. The Court also analysed the relation between the Canada Labour Code and the Act and determined that giving exclusive jurisdiction to the arbitrator would in effect suspend the discretionary power to deal with a complaint that section 41 of the Act expressly confers on the Commission. The Court therefore ruled that the Commission retains its jurisdiction to deal with discriminatory practices in unionized workplaces.\n[25] In Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v. Syndicat des Communications de Radio-Canada (FCN-CSN), the Trial Division of the Federal Court of Canada ruled that the amendments to the Canada Labour Code, adopted since the Paul decision, including, notably, the amendment to section 60 of the Code, did not have the effect of depriving the Commission of concurrent jurisdiction.\nUnfortunately, I cannot concur in the view of the plaintiff, as I feel that if Parliament had intended to exclude the Commission's jurisdiction it would have done so expressly and would have indicated this in its amendment to s. 60 of the Code. In the case at bar, I cannot draw this conclusion as the amendment to s. 60 of the Code makes absolutely no reference to withdrawing the jurisdiction from the Commission. 12\n[26] The Federal Court therefore subscribes, in this case, to the conclusion formulated in Paul to the effect that there must be a clear and unequivocal legal provision in order to deprive the Commission of its concurrent jurisdiction under the terms of paragraph 41(1)(a) of the Act.\n[27] The Trial Division of the Federal Court, in Canada Post Corporation v. Barrette, a case concerning an application for judicial review of the decision of the Canadian Human Rights Commission to investigate complaints of discrimination on the ground of the disability of the complainant, a unionized employee, stated:\nI do not find these cases [the Weber decision, among others] compelling on the issue before me. While they certainly indicate a judicial concern with avoiding the dangers of overlapping jurisdictions and duplicative litigation, they deal with a possible overlap between the jurisdiction of a court and an administrative agency, whereas this case concerns two administrative agencies. The effect of Weber is not, of course, to preclude a court from determining the Charter issue, but merely to route access to the court through the arbitrator, where the arbitrator's ruling would be reviewed on a standard of correctness. But to apply Weber by analogy to the cases at bar would have the effect of excluding the Commission from ever investigating a complaint that had been decided by an arbitrator, and referring it to a Tribunal for adjudication. Such a result would seem contrary to the statutory scheme, not least because the Commission has investigative powers and an experience in the area of human rights that arbitrators do not possess, as well as a quasi-constitutional statutory mandate to advance the public interest in combatting discrimination.13\n[28] The Tribunal has also had occasion to tackle this issue. In Eyerley,14 the complainant was employed in a unionized workplace. He had decided to file a human rights complaint, even though his union had already filed a grievance on his behalf. The Tribunal's finding was the same as in Paul, namely, that it was necessary to distinguish from Weber with regard to human rights complaints filed under the Act. The Tribunal therefore retained its concurrent jurisdiction to hear the complaint. Similar conclusions have been drawn in subsequent rulings of the Tribunal in Quigley, Parisien, Desormeaux, Leonardis and Thompson.15\n[29] The Respondent also relies on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Regina Police Association Inc. v. Regina (City) Board of Police Commissioners16 (Regina Police) to argue that the criterion expressed in Weber applies when, in cases where a statute makes provision for two competing regimes, it must be determined which one should govern a dispute.\n[30] The Regina Police decision concerns the refusal of a chief of police to accept an officer's withdrawal of his resignation. The officer had resigned to avoid being charged with discreditable conduct pursuant to the Municipal Police Discipline Regulations, 1991 and possibly being dismissed under the Police Act, 1990.17 When the chief of police refused to allow the officer to withdraw his resignation, the union filed a grievance. The arbitrator noted that the collective agreement stated that the grievance provisions were not intended to be used in any circumstances where the provisions of the Police Act and its regulations apply. The Police Act and its regulations provide a procedural scheme for both disciplinary action and dismissal for breach of discipline. The arbitrator concluded that the legislature intended that discipline (including dismissal) of a police officer for cause would be governed in accordance with the procedures set out in the Police Act and its regulations, and that the grievance provisions of the collective agreement did not apply.\n[31] In Regina Police, the Supreme Court of Canada pointed out that the rationale for adopting the exclusive jurisdiction model in Weber was to ensure that the legislative scheme in issue was not frustrated by the conferral of jurisdiction upon an adjudicative body, in a dispute, that was not intended by the legislature. Having decided that the essential character of the dispute between the officer and his employer was disciplinary, the court concluded that the legislature intended that discipline (including dismissal) of a police officer for cause would be dealt with in accordance with the procedures set out in the Police Act and its regulations. Consequently, the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to hear and decide the matter.\n[32] In my opinion, it is easy to distinguish the situation in Regina Police from the present situation. The competing legislative regimes in issue in that case had to do, it seems, with matters that were arbitrable or liable to be dealt with in accordance with the disciplinary procedures set out in the statute. It seems that the legislator's intention was to ensure that the two regimes were mutually exclusive: in fact, the contentious collective agreement expressly excluded matters of discipline from its ambit. In the present case, a study of the Act clearly shows that Parliament intended to give the Commission and the Tribunal the power to settle complaints of discrimination in the workplace, the existence of a collective agreement notwithstanding. This intention is revealed in two provisions of the Act. Paragraphs 41(1)(a) and 44(2)(a) of the Act reflect the legislator's intention to ensure that procedures for settling human rights complaints coexist with grievance procedures.18\n[33] For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal therefore finds that the Respondent's arguments relating to its preliminary objection are unfounded.\nIV. CONCLUSION [34] The Respondent's preliminary objection having been dismissed, the hearing of the complaint will therefore proceed as scheduled from January 12 to 15 and from January 19 to 22, 2004, in Laval, Quebec.\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nJanuary 6, 2004\n1[2001] F.C.J.

BACKGROUND\nII. POSITION OF THE PARTIES\nIII. THE LAW\nIV. ANALYSIS\nV. RULING\nI. BACKGROUND [1] On April 11, 2002, Mr. Roger Virk filed a human rights complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission against Bell Canada. In his complaint, Mr. Virk alleges that Bell Canada discriminated against him in the course of his employment on the ground of national or ethnic origin by demoting him, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] The Commission referred Mr. Virk's complaint to the Tribunal for an inquiry and decision on September 17, 2003. Mr. Virk now seeks to amend his original complaint to add allegations of retaliation against him by the respondent, pursuant to section 14.1 of the Act. In a letter dated January 13, 2004, the Commission made it known to the Tribunal that it would take no position with respect to Mr. Virk's preliminary issue of retaliation and would not be filing submissions.\nII. POSITION OF THE PARTIES [3] In his original complaint, Mr. Virk states that he is of South Asian descent, that in or around October of 2001, he was assigned as Acting Manager for a new project, that on November 30, 2001, he was told that he would be demoted from this position and placed in a position of Resource Associate on the same project. Mr. Virk also states that he was told at the time that there would be no more acting managers or new manager assignments in the department and that he would be replaced by someone from another section who was already a manager. Mr. Virk's demotion was to be effective January 1, 2002. According to Mr. Virk, on January 2, 2002, two new acting manager assignments took effect in his department.\n[4] In his amendment request, Mr. Virk alleges that subsequent to the filing of his complaint, Bell Canada aggressively retaliated against him by advising him that his employment with Bell was being terminated because the latter was putting an end to the Globe and Mail project to which Mr. Virk had been assigned. Mr. Virk alleges that Bell exploited that situation, i.e. the end of the Globe and Mail project, to camouflage its retaliation against him for filing his human rights complaint. Mr. Virk contends that the project was merely suspended and would most likely resume in 2004.\n[5] For its part, Bell submits that at no time did it retaliate against Mr. Virk for filing a human rights complaint. According to Bell, Mr. Virk's termination of employment, which took effect on January 11, 2004, happened in the context of a reorganization of the department where the group Mr. Virk was working in was eliminated. Bell further alleges that Mr. Virk was well informed of his displacement right but chose not to exercise it. Had he done so, he would have at least extended his employment period, thus allowing him more time to seek alternate employment with the company.\n[6] In reply to Bell's arguments, Mr. Virk asserts that Bell failed to inform him of the change in status of the job of Resource Associate, thus preventing him from exercising his displacement rights in November 2003. Mr. Virk views the failure by Bell to inform him about this crucial change as another retaliatory measure.\nIII. THE LAW [7] It is now undisputed that this Tribunal has the authority to amend a complaint to add an allegation of retaliation1. As a rule, an amendment should be granted unless it is plain and obvious that the allegations in the amendment sought could not possibly succeed2. In any case, the Tribunal should not embark on a substantive review of the merits of an amendment. That should be done only in the fullness of the evidence after a full hearing3. Thus the test to be applied is whether the allegations of retaliation are by their nature linked, at least by the complainant, to the allegations giving rise to the original complaint and disclose a tenable claim for retaliation4.\n[8] That said, there is discretion in the Tribunal to amend a complaint to deal with additional allegations. The Tribunal must at all times ensure that sufficient notice is given to the respondent so that it is not prejudiced and can properly defend itself.\nIV. ANALYSIS [9] After having carefully reviewed the content of the documents filed by Mr. Virk with the Tribunal in support of his amendment request, the Tribunal finds that the allegations made with respect to the issue of retaliation are, on the whole, linked to the original complaint and disclose a tenable claim for retaliation. By this finding, the Tribunal is in no way adjudicating on the merits of the amendment. The veracity of the allegations as to the existence or non existence of retaliation will only be determined at the hearing of the complaint. The respondent will then have full opportunity to make its case against these allegations.\n[10] Furthermore, the Tribunal is of the view that the respondent is in no way prejudiced by the granting of the amendment request. In the documents filed with the Tribunal, the complainant has clearly identified the facts upon which he relies to assert that the respondent retaliated against him. The Tribunal is thus of the view that the respondent has proper knowledge and adequate notice of the case to be met with respect to the allegations of retaliation and that it can properly defend itself against these allegations.\nV. RULING [11] For the foregoing reasons, the complainant's request to amend his original complaint to add allegations of retaliation pursuant to section 14.1 of the Act is granted. The Tribunal directs the Commission to help the complainant draft and file his amended complaint.\nSigned by\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA, Ontario February 27, 2004\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT858\/10803\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nRoger Virk v.

Facts [1] On January 21, 2004, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the respondent, requested an adjournment of these proceedings until the Federal Court of Canada could render a decision addressing the application for judicial review that the respondent had made opposing a decision on a preliminary objection rendered by the Tribunal on December 9, 2003.\n[2] The facts in this inquiry are as follows. Francine Laurendeau (the complainant) was employed at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (the respondent) starting in 1973, first as a producer and from 1989 as a producer and host of the respondent's Cha\u00eene culturelle.\n[3] On July 12, 2001, the respondent retired the complainant. This decision was made under a policy in effect with the respondent since 1978 and entitled Human Resource Policy No.10.0, which states: Retirement is based on age and is set as the last working day of the month in which the employee turns 65 years old.\n[4] In anticipation of being retired, the complainant filed a complaint on June 6, 2001, with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) to contest the respondent's decision. In her complaint, she alleged that the respondent acted in a discriminatory manner towards [her] by maintaining a mandatory retirement policy, because of [her] age (65), contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[5] On February 27, 2003, the Commission asked the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to appoint a member to inquire into the complaint because it was satisfied that, under the circumstances, an inquiry was warranted.\n[6] On April 1, 2003, the Tribunal Registrar informed the parties of their right under section 50(1) of the Act to present evidence and legal representations to the Tribunal to support their position in this case. In accordance with the Tribunal's Interim Rules of Procedure, the Registrar also asked the parties to submit short written statements listing the issues and the evidence that would be submitted to the Tribunal.\n[7] In her disclosure of evidence filed on August 20, 2003, the complainant stated the issues as follows:\nDid the CBC commit an age-related discriminatory practice in violation of section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act by terminating Ms. Laurendeau's employment solely on the basis that she had reached 65 years of age? Alternatively, and if the Tribunal finds that the CBC's discriminatory practice falls within the exception of paragraph 15(1)(c), is this paragraph of the Canadian Human Rights Act unconstitutional by being contrary to section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms?\n[8] On August 27, 2003, the respondent informed the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) that it intended to raise a preliminary objection and argue that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to answer the complainant's question on the constitutionality of paragraph 15(1)(c) of the Act.\n[9] On December 9, 2003, after hearing the parties, the Tribunal issued the decision to dismiss the respondent's preliminary objection. In its decision, the Tribunal indicated that it believes it has the jurisdiction to proceed with the inquiry into all aspects of the case, including the constitutional validity of paragraph 15(1)(c) of the Canadian Human Rights Act with respect to section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n[10] On January 7, 2004, the respondent received from the Federal Court of Canada a notice of application for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision.\n[11] During a teleconference held on January 21, 2004, the Tribunal, among other things, set the following schedule for the remaining proceedings:\ncomplainant's disclosure: no later than February 6, 2004.\nrespondent's disclosure: no later than February 23, 2004.\n[12] At the respondent's request, the Tribunal agreed to extend the respondent's disclosure deadline to March 26, 2004.\n[13] Taking the parties' and the Tribunal's availability into account, the hearing dates were set for September 14 to17 and 21 and 22, 2004.\nII. Request for adjournment [14] The respondent's request sought the adjournment of proceedings in this matter until the Federal Court could deal with the application for judicial review. To be granted an adjournment, the respondent had to demonstrate that its application met the three criteria affirmed in Manitoba (Attorney General) v. Metropolitan Stores Ltd.1 and in RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (A.G.)2, as follows:\nFirst, the respondent must establish that there is a serious question to be tried. Second, the respondent must convince the Tribunal that it would suffer irreparable harm if the remedy were refused. The term irreparable refers to the nature of the harm rather than the extent. Third, which is the balance of convenience, involves determining which party would suffer greater harm from the granting or refusal of the adjournment.\n[15] In this case, the respondent undeniably met the first criteria regarding the existence of a serious question.\n[16] However, I am not satisfied that the respondent has met the second criteria regarding irreparable harm. The harm is irreparable if it cannot be remedied or monetarily quantified.3\n[17] As the Federal Court of Appeal indicated in Nature Co. v. Sci-Tech Educational4, evidence of irreparable harm must be clear and not speculative. At this juncture, we do not know if the Federal Court will uphold the Tribunal's decision or overturn it. In my view, the evidence before me does not satisfy me that the respondent has met the burden on it of establishing that it would suffer irreparable harm if the adjournment were refused.\n[18] The respondent's evidence regarding the issue of irreparable harm deals essentially with the costs and efforts that the parties would incur if the adjournment were refused. As such, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation argued that, in the event that the Federal Court accepts its application for judicial review, all the time and money that it would have spent preparing this case would have been for nothing. To continue, the repondent submitting that it would be contrary to the interests of justice to make the parties incur such expenses before a definitive response is received from the Federal Court.\n[19] The Tribunal wants to state that even if time and money were wasted if the proceedings went ahead and it were subsequently decided that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction, it is more a question of inconvenience than irreparable harm.5 The respondent did not refer to any jurisprudence to support its claims that time and money spent preparing a hearing before the Tribunal constitutes irreparable harm. In fact, there is settled jurisprudence indicating the opposite.6\n[20] Finally, regarding the balance of convenience, the Tribunal can at this point consider the time and money that the parties would waste preparing the hearing if the adjournment were refused and if the application for judicial review were accepted. The Tribunal must also take the public interest into account, which is best served by the speedy resolution of human rights complaints.7 In this case, the Tribunal is of the view that the public interest takes precedence over the monetary considerations raised by the parties.\n[21] The request for adjournment is therefore dismissed since the respondent was unable to satisfy the Tribunal that it has met the criteria for irreparable harm and the balance of convenience. The parties are therefore instructed to comply with the schedule established during the teleconference on January 21, 2004.\n[22] The Tribunal is aware that this request may be premature due to the long delay before the start of the hearing. The Federal Court could very well issue its decision on the application for judicial review by September 2004. However, due to the already long delays in this matter and the parties' difficulty of finding available dates for the hearing, the Tribunal considers it preferable to decide on the adjournment issue right away so that the parties know what is expected and can therefore proceed with preparing their cases.\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario March 3, 2004\n1 [1987] 1 S.R.C. 110\n2 [1994] 1 S.R.C. 312\n3Northwest Territories v.

Mombourquette, the new counsel of the complainant. Unfortunately, for some unexplained reason, this letter was not received by the Tribunal. Following a conference call held on March 2, 2004, a copy of this letter was e-mailed to the Tribunal.\n[2] The dates for the hearing in this matter were scheduled for March 8 to 12, 2004, in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The parties were informed of these dates on September 29, 2003. On February 19, 2004, the Tribunal appointed a new member to hear this case, and informed the parties that the hearing would now start on March 10, 2004 and that further dates would be agreed upon at that time.\n[3] In his letter of February 27, 2004, Mr. Mombourquette informed the Tribunal that he had been retained by the complainant with respect to this matter. He indicated that he had been contacted earlier in that week by the complainant's previous counsel, Rebecca Saturley, of Steward McKelvey Stirling Scales, to determine whether he would be in a position to represent the complainant. He added that he was able to speak to the complainant on Thursday, February 26, 2004, and that the complainant then agreed to retain his services. The decision to change counsel at this very late stage in the proceeding was not initiated by the complainant but by his former counsel Ms. Saturley.\n[4] With respect to the reason for this decision, it would seem that after the respondent's disclosure on February 12, 2004, Ms. Saturley concluded that there was a potential conflict between her representation of the complainant and her firm's longstanding relationship with the Halifax Employers Association. No further details were given as to why this only became apparent at this very late date in the process.\n[5] Need I repeat that a conflicting interest is one that would be likely to affect the lawyer's judgment or advice on behalf of, or loyalty to a client or prospective client. If a dispute develops in a matter and it cannot be resolved, then obviously the lawyer cannot continue to act for any of the clients and has a duty to withdraw from the matter. A lawyer has a duty not to act for more than one client where it is reasonably obvious that an issue contentious between them may arise or that their interests, rights or obligations will diverge as the matter progresses.\n[6] It would seem that this is the conclusion to which Ms. Saturley arrived after consulting the respondent's disclosure of February 12, 2004, although the Tribunal fails to see what new information was disclosed which had not been available previously to counsel. The Tribunal also takes serious issue with the lateness of Ms. Saturley's action. According to Mr. Mombourquette's letter he was only contacted in the week of February 23, 2004, to determine whether he would be in a position to represent the complainant, ten days after the reception of the respondent's disclosure. It is clear that this would be a proper case to award costs against the former counsel of the complainant, if such power had been granted to the Tribunal by the Canadian Human Rights Act but unfortunately that power is not mine.\n[7] I would refer the parties to the Legal Ethics and Professional Conduct Handbook of the Nova Scotia Barristers' Society, which indicates that a lawyer has a duty to a client not to withdraw services except for good cause and upon notice appropriate in the circumstances. Although the client has a right to terminate the lawyer-client relationship at will, the lawyer does not enjoy the same freedom of action. Having accepted a professional employment, the lawyer has a duty to complete the task as ably as possible unless there is justifiable cause for terminating the relationship. The lawyer who withdraws from employment has a duty to minimize expenses and avoid prejudice to the client, doing everything reasonably possible to facilitate the expeditious and orderly transfer of the matter to the successor lawyer.\n[8] Returning to the matter at hand, Mr. Mombourquette has requested this adjournment in order to better familiarize himself with the matter prior to the hearing. He also says that he is unavailable on the dates set because of a previous engagement before the Nova Scotia Labour Relations Board. During the conference call held on March 2, 2004, to discuss this request, he indicated that there were no other lawyers available in his law firm who could handle this file on the dates set for the hearing.\n[9] Counsel for the respondent has vigorously opposed this request. In a letter dated March 1, 2004, addressed to the Tribunal, Mr. Ronald A. Pink, raises the issue of the potential conflict of interest of Ms. Saturley and indicates that this conflict of interest is no different now than it was when she started acting for the complainant or when she represented the complainant in mediation before the Tribunal in October of 2003. Although the Tribunal might be inclined to agree with counsel's conclusions on this matter, it remains that the complainant has now retained new counsel and that is the issue that I have to address when considering this request for adjournment.\n[10] In his letter, Mr. Pink argues that an adjournment this late in the process would be costly to his client; that it would require a complete re-preparation of the file at some later date. He adds that the reason for this is due to the fact that Ms. Saturley has referred her former client to a counsel who does not have the scheduled hearing dates available.\n[11] While I sympathise with the frustration of the respondent's counsel who are ready to move forward with this matter, I must also take into consideration that the reasons for this unfortunate situation has nothing to do with the complainant. From my understanding of Mr. Mombourquette's letter, the complainant was only made aware of this new development on February 26, 2004. Up until that time, he was under the impression that he was represented by Ms. Saturley and that everything was moving ahead.\n[12] In these circumstances, I feel that to refuse the adjournment would punish unfairly the complainant who cannot be held responsible for this situation.\n[13] Though I do so reluctantly, I will grant the request for an adjournment with the following conditions:\nA. Should the complainant be successful in his claim against the respondent at the hearing, his right to damages, if he is entitled to such damages, will be limited to those incurred up to March 10, 2004, at the most; B. Counsel for the complainant will forthwith provide the Tribunal with dates on which he is available for a 5-day hearing in the month of March, April, May or June 2004. C. On reception of these dates, the Tribunal will consult respondent counsel and set dates for the commencement of the hearing; D. If the complainant's counsel is unable to provide dates when he is available for those months, then the Tribunal, in consultation with respondent's counsel, will set dates and the complainant's counsel will be informed and he or somebody from his firm will make themselves available for those dates; E. Counsel for the complainant will provide before March 12, 2004, a final list of witnesses and a summary of the evidence that these witnesses will be giving at the hearing; F. A copy of this order shall be forwarded to the complainant's previous counsel.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nMarch 5, 2004\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT845\/9503\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nJohn Charlton v.

Grant Sinclair\n2004 CHRT 13 2004\/04\/27\n[1] The complainant, Tiina Baumbach, filed a complaint against the respondent Deer Lake Education Authority on September 15, 2000. Ms. Baumbach worked as a grade school teacher with the respondent. In her complaint, she alleged that the respondent has discriminated against her by treating her differently and refused to continue to employ her, contrary to s.7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] The Tribunal has scheduled hearing dates but the parties are not able to agree upon a venue for the hearing. The complainant has requested that the hearing be held in Ottawa. The respondent has asked that the hearing be held in Deer Lake, where the respondent is located and where the alleged discrimination occurred.\n[3] The complainant suffers from a severe and prolonged disability which causes serious medical problems, the occurrence of which are unpredictable and which can last for very long periods of time. She has great difficulty traveling and the medical specialist who has treated her has recommended that she not travel at all.\n[4] The complainant has pointed out that Deer Lake does not have the hearing, food, or accommodation facilities necessary to support a tribunal hearing. The respondent does not disagree with this and has suggested that the hearing could be accommodated by flying the parties in and out of Deer Lake every day to Red Lake, a short flight away. As a compromise, the respondent has suggested that the hearing be held either in Winnipeg or in Thunder Bay, two locations with which the members of the respondent are familiar and comfortable.\n[5] In its submissions, the respondent points out that there will be five members of the respondent board and the education director involved in the hearing. The respondent will incur significant costs to attend a two week hearing in Ottawa. Further, English is not the first language of the respondents and although some members of the respondent are fluent in English and Oji-Cree, others are not. It is likely that an interpreter from the area, who can speak the same dialect as the board members, will be required. The respondent also notes that to require the board members to travel to Ottawa from their remote northern Ontario Community, will impose a hardship on the board members, and particularly those who do not speak English.\n[6] It is the usual practice of the Tribunal to hold hearings in the place where the discrimination has occurred. However, this is not a hard and fast rule and the Tribunal strives to accommodate the parties where it is appropriate to do so. In this case both parties require accommodation. The accommodation sought by the complainant, holding the hearing in Ottawa does not serve the needs of the respondent. Similarly, the accommodation sought by the respondent to have the hearing either in Thunder Bay or Winnipeg does not accommodate the needs of the complainant.\n[7] The Tribunal has considered the submissions of both parties. Because in these circumstances it is not possible to accommodate the parties as they have requested, some other solution must be reached.\n[8] Accordingly, the Tribunal has decided as follows:\nThe evidence of the complainant and any witnesses called on her behalf is to be given at a hearing held at the Tribunal offices in Ottawa. The witnesses will be subject to cross-examination by respondent counsel who will attend in person at the hearing. The proceedings will be transmitted to members of the respondent by way of video conference facilities to be made available in Thunder Bay. Telephones will be available in the videoconferencing rooms in Ottawa and in Thunder Bay so that respondent counsel and members of the respondent can communicate as necessary. The evidence of the respondent and any respondent witnesses will be given at a hearing to be held in Thunder Bay. These witnesses will be subject to cross-examination by complainant counsel who will attend in person at the hearing in Thunder Bay. The complainant will have access to these hearings by way of videoconferencing facilities at the Tribunal offices in Ottawa. Telephones will be provided in both the Tribunal offices in Ottawa and at the videoconferencing facilities in Thunder Bay to provide for communications between the complainant and complainant counsel. Final argument including legal submissions will be done either in writing or by videoconferencing. If by videoconferencing, complainant counsel will attend at the Tribunal offices in Ottawa and respondent counsel at videoconferencing facilities in Thunder Bay. The method for final submissions will be determined by the member hearing the complaint, on submissions from counsel. The costs of the videoconferencing will be borne by the Tribunal.\nSigned by J.

BALTRUWEIT\nComplainant\n- and -\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION\nCommission\n- and -\nCANADIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE\nRespondent\nREASONS FOR RULING\nMEMBER: J. Grant Sinclair 2004 CHRT 14 2004\/04\/29\n[1] The complainant in this matter, William Baltruweit, filed a number of complaints in the 1990's with the Canadian Human Rights Commission against the respondent, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. The relevant complaint for the purposes of this motion is dated November 4, 1998 in which the complainant alleges that CSIS discriminated against him, contrary to s.7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] The Commission dismissed the complaint. On application for judicial review by the complainant, the Federal Court, Trial Division, allowed the application and referred the matter back to the Commission for redetermination. Both the Commission and the Attorney General have appealed this decision to the Federal Court of Appeal.\n[3] After reconsideration, the Commission advised CSIS on October 1, 2003, that it had decided to appoint a conciliator to attempt a settlement and failing a settlement within 60 days, the Commission would refer the complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal.\n[4] In response, the Attorney General filed a judicial review application, on behalf of CSIS, with the Federal Court on October 30, 2003, challenging the decision of the Commission. The Attorney General did not, in its application, request that the Federal Court stay the Tribunal proceedings pending resolution of the judicial review. The complaint was not settled and on January 6, 2004, the Commission referred the complaint for hearing to the Tribunal.\n[5] The Attorney General now brings a motion dated February 9, 2004, asking this Tribunal to stay its proceedings until the final determination of its October 30, 2003 judicial review application.\n[6] The Attorney General argues that the Tribunal should decide the motion using the three-stage test set out in RJR-Macdonald Inc. v. Canada, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311, 334. It submits that this test has been satisfied in favour of the Attorney General.\n[7] I do not agree that the RJR- Macdonald test should be applied by the Tribunal in a matter such as this. Rather, in my opinion, this Tribunal should follow the approach in its ruling in Leger v. Canadian National Railways Company, [1999] Ruling No. 1, CHRT File T527\/2299, (Nov. 26, 1999) and as elaborated more fully in the present ruling.\n[8] This conclusion is based on the following analysis. RJR-Macdonald involved an application to the Supreme Court of Canada to stay the implementation of regulations under the Tobacco Products Control Act, pending an appeal from the Quebec Court of Appeal on the constitutionality of that legislation. On the preliminary question of its jurisdiction to deal with the application, the Supreme Court found that it had such jurisdiction under the Supreme Court Act and the Supreme Court Rules. Having so decided, the Supreme Court then posited that, in order to obtain the relief sought, the applicants must satisfy the three-stage test enunciated in Manitoba (Attorney General) v. Metropolitan Stores (MTS) Ltd., [1987] 1 S.C.R. 110. In the result, the Court dismissed the applications.\n[9] In Metropolitan Stores, the Manitoba Food and Commercial Workers Union applied to the Manitoba Labour Board for an order under the Manitoba Labour Relations Act, imposing a first collective agreement on the employer, Metropolitan Stores and the union. Metropolitan Stores brought an originating notice of motion, to the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench to have the relevant provisions of the Labour Relations Act declared unconstitutional and for an order to stay the Labour Board proceedings until the constitutional question was determined. The motion was denied by the trial court. The decision was appealed to the Manitoba Court of Appeal which granted the stay. The Supreme Court of Canada on appeal, reversed this decision. In doing so, the Supreme Court set out the principles, i.e. the three-stage test, that governs the exercise of discretion by a Superior Court Judge to grant a stay of proceedings.\n[10] I have referred in some detail to the RJR-Macdonald and Metropolitan Stores cases because, in my view, it is important to appreciate that the three-stage test was used in a situation different than exists here, namely, where a supervisory court is asked to stay the proceedings of a lower court pending an appeal or judicial review application.\n[11] In both of these cases, the reviewing courts had the statutory authority to stay proceedings. As does the Federal Court, Trial Division. Under s.18.2 of the Federal Court Act, the Federal Court may stay the proceedings of a federal tribunal pending judicial review.\n[12] There is nothing in the Canadian Human Rights Act that confers the statutory power on the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to stay its proceedings pending an application for judicial review. Nor, in my opinion, does the statutory regime of the Act suggest that such a power can be inferred.\n[13] A review of the relevant provisions of the Act suggests the contrary. Equality of opportunity and freedom from discrimination is the declared public policy goal of the Act. (s.2). This is to be achieved through the operations of the Commission which first receives and investigates complaints and may decide to refer the complaint to the Tribunal if it concludes that a hearing is warranted. If the Tribunal makes a finding of discrimination after a full hearing, it has the power to grant a remedy that is remedial not punitive, a remedy fashioned to eliminate the discrimination.\n[14] The Act requires that proceedings before the Tribunal be conducted informally and expeditiously and also provides that this mandate of the Tribunal is subject to the rules of natural justice (s.48.9 (1)). This last requirement is underscored by s.50(1) of the Act, which requires that all parties to the hearing be given a full and ample opportunity in person or by counsel to present evidence and make representations.\n[15] It is well established that administrative tribunals are the masters of their own proceedings. As such, they possess significant discretion in deciding requests for adjournments. This principle was discussed in some detail by the Supreme Court of Canada in Prassad v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1989] 1. S.C.R. 560. In this case, the appellant sought an adjournment of her immigration inquiry pending a decision on her application to the Minister to permit her to remain in Canada. The adjudicator refused the adjournment.\n[16] In dealing with her appeal, the Supreme Court stated that administrative tribunals, in the absence of specific statutory rules or regulations, are masters of and control their own proceedings. But when tribunals exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions, they must comply with the rules of natural justice. [See also Re Cedarvale Tree Services Ltd. and Labourers' International Union of North America, (1971), 22 D.L.R. (3d) 40, 50 (Ont. C.A.), Pierre v. Manpower and Immigration, [1978] 2 F.C. 849, 851 (FC.T.D.)]\n[17] It is clear then that this Tribunal, when exercising its discretion, must do so having regard to principles of natural justice.Some examples of natural justice concerns to which the Tribunal could respond to, would be unavailability of evidence, the need to adjourn to obtain counsel, or late disclosure by an opposite party.\n[18] In essence, it appears from its submissions on this motion, that the Attorney General is arguing that:\nthe referral by the Commission to the Tribunal is a nullity and thus the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to proceed; if the Tribunal proceeds and the referral is later quashed, any relief granted in the pending court actions will be futile and moot; if the Tribunal proceeds and the referral is later quashed, security risks will have been needlessly taken. This assertion is not based on any proved evidence and in any case, can be dealt by the Tribunal within the hearing under s.52 of the Act; there is an interest in preserving the status quo while court issues are decided; the balance of convenience favours not proceeding so as not to waste judicial resources; the proper administration of the Act by the Commission is a question of public interest which presumably overrides the value of an expeditious Tribunal hearing.\n[19] I do not see anything in these arguments that speaks to the respondent CSIS's ability to defend itself before the Tribunal. There are no issues raised about its ability to marshall evidence, retain counsel, or otherwise respond to the complainant's allegation. Nor are there any concerns raised about the impartiality of the pending Tribunal process. Ultimately, in these submissions there are no expressed natural justice concerns that would temper the admonition in s.48.9 (1) of the Act for the Tribunal to proceed as expeditiously as possible.\n[20] In my opinion, the appropriate forum to seek a stay of the Tribunal proceedings is the Federal Court. It is the forum that has carriage of the judicial review application. It has the express statutory authority to grant or deny a stay.

Hadjis\n2004 CHRT 15 2004\/05\/04\n[1] The Complainant alleges in his complaints that the Respondents discriminated against him due to his disability (multiple sclerosis and epilepsy). He wishes to call his physician as an expert witness at the hearing. He submits that it is in the public interest, as well as his own, to have the physician testify. The physician has requested a fee for the preparation of his expert's report ($600) and for his testimony ($200\/hour). The Complainant is currently unemployed and is in receipt of social assistance under the Ontario Disability Support Program. He claims, therefore, that he cannot afford to pay the physician the fees requested, and that, as a result, he is unable to have his expert testify.\n[2] The complaints were referred to the Tribunal by the Canadian Human Rights Commission on January 6, 2004. The Commission noted at that time that pursuant to s. 49 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, it was satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaints, an inquiry is warranted. However, in a letter dated February 5, 2004, the Canadian Human Rights Commission informed the parties and the Tribunal that it would not be participating in the hearing involving these complaints, leaving the Complainant to lead his case on his own, without the assistance of any legal counsel. The Commission has made it known that it will not pay the costs relating to the physician's expert testimony.\n[3] The Complainant has consequently made a motion in which he seeks an order from the Tribunal calling the physician to testify as its expert witness. Presumably, the Tribunal would pay his fees. Commission Counsel suggested during a recent case conference that the Tribunal may possess the authority to call an expert as a witness of its own accord. The Commission provided the Tribunal with copies of several judgments relating to this issue. The Respondents, in turn, argued that the Tribunal cannot call a witness whom the parties themselves do not intend to call, nor can it retain an expert whose evidence will assuredly assist the case of only one of the parties.\n[4] I have reviewed the authorities submitted and have concluded that the Respondents' position is well-founded. As is noted in Sopinka's The Law of Evidence in Canada, [J. Sopinka, S.N. Lederman, A.W. Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1999) at 901] in civil cases, a trial judge does not have the power to call a witness who has not been previously examined. In criminal trials, there is a limited discretion to call a witness not called by the parties and without their consent. This is justified because the liberty of the accused is at stake and the object of the proceedings is to see that justice be done. This discretion must, however, be exercised infrequently and with great care so as not to prejudice the accused or usurp the role of counsel.\n[5] Commission counsel remarked that owing to the quasi-constitutional nature of human rights law, it could be argued that the principles relating to criminal law could be extended by analogy to the Tribunal process. However, even if this were the case, the facts surrounding the present complaints do not warrant the exercise of such discretion by the Tribunal. Without minimizing in any way the importance of the allegations made by the Complainant in his complaints, I cannot agree that one's physical liberty is at stake in the present case, in a manner akin to a criminal proceeding.\n[6] Furthermore, one finds that in most of the cases in which such a discretion has been exercised by a court, the judge has called witnesses whom none of the parties intended to call themselves. In the present case, the Complainant actually wants his physician to testify, but is faced with the obstacle of having to pay the witness's expenses. Undoubtedly, for a person of the Complainant's modest financial means, the fees requested are very significant. However, the Complainant has the option of seeking reimbursement of these costs from the Respondents, as expenses arising from the discriminatory practice (s. 53(2) d) of the Act). This compensation would, of course, be conditional on the Tribunal's finding that the complaints are substantiated and that the Complainant is entitled to this remedy. The Complainant informed the Tribunal during the case conference that he was not prepared to assume the risk of not being eventually reimbursed.\n[7] In addition, even if one were to conclude that a human rights tribunal, as master of its own procedure, has the power to appoint its own witnesses, to in fact do so in the manner being proposed would serve to assist the case of only one of the parties, the Complainant. This would result in an unacceptable level of unfairness for the other parties. Although it is evident that the Complainant, as a disabled person of modest financial means, is facing serious difficulties in attempting to lead his own case without legal counsel, the fact remains that the Tribunal process must remain neutral and essentially adversarial. The Tribunal cannot allow itself to be drawn into the legal dispute and assist but one of the parties in making his case, merely because the Commission has decided to no longer participate. Unfortunately, this may result in important evidence failing to be introduced, thereby rendering the inquiry into the human rights complaint incomplete. So be it. The Tribunal will not under any circumstances permit its process to be rendered unfair.\n[8] During the case conference, there was some discussion surrounding s. 48.8 (2) of the Act, which states that the Chairperson of the Tribunal may engage persons having technical or special knowledge to assist or advise Tribunal members in any matter. It is my understanding that the Chairperson of the Tribunal has not exercised the power set out in this section of the Act to this date. I imagine that this provision could find some application in cases where highly technical and perhaps confusing evidence is introduced by the parties' expert witnesses. In such cases, s. 48.8 (2) provides the Tribunal with the option to engage other experts and seek further elucidation. This is not, however, the situation in which the Tribunal finds itself in this instance.\n[9] For all the above reasons, I will not be issuing an order calling the Complainant's physician to testify as the Tribunal's expert witness. The Complainant is always free to call his physician as his own witness. If the witness is to testify as an expert, the Complainant must comply with the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure regarding the testimony of experts. A subpoena will be issued by the Tribunal to summon the attendance of this witness at the hearing, if so requested by the Complainant.\nSigned by Athanasios D.

INTRODUCTION [1] On October 10, 2000, Pierre Bergeron filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) against his employer, T\u00e9l\u00e9bec Limit\u00e9e (T\u00e9l\u00e9bec). He alleged that his employer discriminated against him by treating him in an adverse manner in the course of employment and by refusing to provide him with a harassment-free work environment because of his disability (depression), contrary to sections 7 and 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act).\n[2] Pierre Bergeron also filed a complaint on October 10, 2000 with the Commission, in which he alleged that Alain Rivard, a T\u00e9l\u00e9bec employee, discriminated against him by harassing him in the course of his employment due to his disability (depression), contrary to section 14 of the Act.\n[3] At the start of the hearing, the Commission announced that the facts giving rise to the complaints warranted an inquiry by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. It stated that its role at the hearing was limited to an opening statement in which it recalled the principles that must guide the Tribunal in all human rights matters, particularly regarding discrimination.\nII. EVIDENCE A. Complainant's evidence (i) Pierre Bergeron [4] Pierre Bergeron was hired by T\u00e9l\u00e9bec as an installer\/repairman on May 7, 1987. He had a college diploma in social science and a college diploma in electronics. It was a temporary position in the Rouyn-Noranda area. After three (3) months of working with a more experienced employee as his mentor, he was transferred to Ville-Marie where he performed his duties alone. In April 1988, he obtained a permanent installer\/repairman position in La Sarre.\n[5] In 1990, the Complainant applied for a splicer position in La Sarre and obtained the position on April 23, 1990. On November 20, 1995, he was informed that he would be laid off as of December 6, 1995 with recall rights for a period of 24 months.\n[6] A collective agreement governs the labour relations of T\u00e9l\u00e9bec employees. The witness acknowledged that his seniority did not allow him to keep his job in his splicer job category, but did permit him to bump another employee in the installer\/repairman job category because he met the requirements of the position that he had previously held for three years. The Respondent did not allow him to exercise his bumping right. He filed a grievance on December 6, 1995, which was referred for arbitration on April 25, 1996 and the Teamsters Union withdrew the grievance on April 30, 1997.\n[7] Pierre Bergeron claimed that, had he been able to exercise his bumping right, he would have continued to have stable employment, but that the refusal left him feeling insecure, which was the cause of his depression in August 1996.\n[8] During a meeting with the grievance committee in March 1996, he learned, without knowing the specific source of the information, that employees on the callback list were never hired back. However, he was called back to work as of March 26, 1996 as a lineman in Sainte-Rose on the Lac Abitibi project for a period of approximately two and one half months. His working conditions were not those provided for in the collective agreement in force at the time of his layoff in December 1995. For example, travel time was no longer paid and the meal allowance had been eliminated.\n[9] On May 15, 1996, the Complainant was informed of his layoff effective May 31, 1996 with recall rights for 24 months. However, on May 27, 1996, Pierre Bergeron was informed that his layoff was postponed to a later date. From June 3 to 21, 1996, the Complainant obtained a temporary promotion as a splicer. On June 12, 1996, the Complainant was again informed of his layoff effective July 12, 1996, which was postponed to August 2, 1996.\n[10] The witness stated that, around July 19, 1996, Claude Mayrand offered him a permanent installer\/repairman position in Val d'Or starting August 6, 1996. Pierre Bergeron had submitted a transfer request on May 15, 1996 as an installer\/repairman in Val-d'Or when two installer\/repairman positions (Exhibit I-14) in Val-d'Or were posted; he accepted the position. His acceptance ended his temporary promotion. It was a demotion that suited him because of the permanent nature of the position. At the end of the posting period, the Complainant learned that the Respondent had not selected any of the applications it received. As a result, when he was offered this installer\/repairman position, it was not, in his view, the position he had applied for. He understood instead that the offer was the employer's acknowledging his bumping right he had asserted through the grievance he filed after he his layoff on December 6, 1995. However, he had not withdrawn this grievance because he suspected his employer of setting a trap for him. In his view, T\u00e9l\u00e9bec believed that he would not be able to perform the duties of an installer\/repairman and that he would quit his job. He claimed that subsequent events showed that his concerns were valid.\n[11] On Tuesday, August 6, 1996, he reported in to Claude Mayrand, his immediate supervisor in Val-d'Or. The latter appeared not to have been informed of his arrival and he had no vehicle or tools to provide him with for performing his work. The Complainant went to the depot to collect his tools.\n[12] The next day, a vehicle was made available to him and he put his tools in it to work with a colleague. At the end of the day, since he did not have enough tools to do the job satisfactorily, he suggested to his immediate supervisor that he take Thursday and Friday off and return to work the following Monday with a vehicle having the right equipment and that was used by a student whose job would be over at the end of the week. His immediate supervisor accepted his suggestion. The Complainant stated that, over the weekend, specifically August 10, 1996, he became depressed and attempted suicide.\n[13] He consulted his attending physician, Dr. Guy Perrier, on August 12, 1996, who diagnosed him with major depression; the physician recommended hospitalization, but he refused. His physician referred him to a psychologist and scheduled a return to full-time work on September 16, 1996. He saw his physician again on October 1, 1996, and he extended his absence from work until November 4, 1996; he met with his physician again on October 30, 1996 and the latter scheduled a return to part-time work, with no restrictions, on December 2, 1996.\n[14] During the week of August 12, 1996, Claude Mayrand went to his residence to give him medical form BC1935, which he was to have his attending physician fill out and return to his employer. Pierre Bergeron claimed that the visit was only an excuse to ensure that he was indeed sick. In addition, during his convalescence, which ended on December 2, 1996, he noticed that Claude Mayrand drove slowly by his residence in his vehicle several times. Pierre Bergeron believed that his immediate supervisor was checking up on him to see if he was at home, and he felt harassed.\n[15] During the same convalescence period, since he had obtained a permanent installer\/repairman position in Val-d'Or, the Complainant, who was living in La Sarre, took steps to find a place to live closer to his place of work. He signed a purchase offer for a house in Val Senneville on November 4, 1996.\n[16] On November 26, 1996, the Complainant met with Dr. Jean-Joseph Cond\u00e9, a T\u00e9l\u00e9bec physician, with whom he arranged a gradual return to work, with no restrictions, at a rate of two consecutive days for the week of December 2, 1996, three days a week as of December 9, 1996 and full time as of January 3, 1997. He went into work on December 2, 1996. He stated that he felt exhausted after those two days of work. He had the chance to meet with Claude Mayrand and Alain Rivard. In the Complainant's view, that meeting was intended to put a great deal of pressure on him to get him to quit his job. Alain Rivard reportedly said to him, You would be better off quitting than staying here.\n[17] On December 9, 1996, in Dr. Cond\u00e9's absence, he met with the nurse in the physician's office to explain that he had had difficulty doing two consecutive days of work the previous week. He arranged with the nurse to work two consecutive days that week instead of the three previously arranged.\n[18] During that work period, Claude Mayrand and Alain Rivard, his immediate supervisors, took him to a room to criticize him for his work performance and unwarranted absences. He stated that he started to cry because of the criticism directed at him.\n[19] During the week of December 16, 1996, Pierre Bergeron worked on December 16, 18 and 20. On Monday, December 16, 1996, Alain Rivard informed him that, in the next few days, he was planning to install a business telephone system that had three telephone lines with the potential of eight telephones. The Complainant asked Alain Rivard for training prior to installing the telephone system, particularly for programming it. Alain Rivard denied his training request and told him that he was given the installer\/repairman position because he supposedly knew what to do. Throughout that day, he did wiring work at Val-d'Or Performance. He stated that he does not recall submitting a request to Claude Mayrand, during the week of December 16, 1996, for taking December 23, and 24, 1996 off.\n[20] On December 18, 1996 when he arrived at work, the business telephone system was to be installed, and the Complainant went to the customer site, the Brasserie la P\u00e9pie in Val-d'Or. He first had to remove the existing telephone system and then install the new one. While he was working, the Complainant noticed a central office assignment error such that the telephone numbers were not routed to the right place. He managed to correct the problem with the help of a colleague who was performing an installation at a nearby business.\n[21] The witness stated that his installation and programming work went fine except for preventing long-distance calls from the telephone set in the kitchen. He informed the customer that a colleague would come to complete the work.\n[22] At the customer's request, the witness moved a public telephone. Since the work was not originally planned, he borrowed the required tools from a colleague and moved the public telephone. Pierre Bergeron was very satisfied with his day's work and believed that the customer was very satisfied too.\n[23] Since he was on sick leave on Thursday, he went to work Friday morning, December 20, 1996. He was again greeted by Claude Mayrand and Alain Rivard. Alain Rivard criticized the quality of his work at Val-d'Or Performance the previous Monday. He told him that he did not need someone who could not keep up with the group. He even advised him to quit before it cost him his life.\n[24] The Complainant revealed that he felt crushed and humiliated and that he burst into tears, but nevertheless began his day's work at a customer site to do pre-wiring. During the week of December 23, 1996, staff was reduced for the holiday period and he had to work on December 23 and 24, 1996 to respond to emergencies and he was then on leave until January 6, 1997. Around 3:30 p.m., he felt on the verge of tears. He returned to the office and cleaned his truck. The witness informed his dispatcher that he was leaving work and that he would notify the secretary. When he arrived at the secretary's office, he started to cry and was not able to talk to her; he indicated that he was leaving even though it was 4:30 p.m. and was supposed to finish at 5:00 p.m. When he left the secretary's office, he encountered Claude Mayrand. He was too upset to talk to him and he waved his hand at him. In spite of the depression symptoms he was experiencing, it was not until January 13, 1997 that he decided to see his doctor.\n[25] He returned to his home in La Sarre and, at the end of the week, he thought he had partied too much or ate too much because on the morning of Monday, December 23, 1996, he was still at home sick, with gastro-enteritis.\n[26] Before the start of his shift, he contacted the secretary to say that he would be away because he was sick and that, if he did not call the next day, he would be away that day too. He requested pay for the days he was away by using vacation days instead of sick leave.\n[27] On January 6, 1997, the Complainant went to work. He claimed that, despite the arrangement with Dr. Cond\u00e9 for returning to work full time with no restrictions starting January 6, 1997, he decided that his work week would be four days. He said that he had spoken with his attending physician but there is no document confirming this.\n[28] The Complainant stated that when he arrived at work on Monday, January 6, 1997, Alain Rivard and Claude Mayrand were waiting for him. They criticized him for leaving work on December 20 without informing his immediate supervisor. Alain Rivard also criticized him for his unwarranted absence on December 23, 1996, which showed that he could not be trusted. He again criticized him for the quality of his work, including at the Brasserie la P\u00e9pie. Alain Rivard reportedly added that a letter of reprimand would be placed in his file and he claimed that this was done. Pierre Bergeron tried to provide an explanation but they refused to listen to him and he again started to cry. In cross-examination, when asked to provide details about the letter of reprimand that was to be placed in his file, the witness referred to a memo dated December 23, 1996 from Claude Mayrand to Alain Rivard.\n[29] After that meeting, he was assigned some pre-wiring work at a car dealership. He agreed to work with two colleagues from 4:00 p.m. to midnight for the next three days. He did pre-wiring in a government building.\n[30] Even though he still believed that his work week was four days and that they were over, he went into work on Friday, January 10, 1997. At the end of his work day, he was summoned for a meeting with Claude Mayrand in the presence of Jean Levert, the union steward. Alain Rivard took part in the meeting via video-conference. He explained that, during the time he had been an installer\/repairman, Pierre Bergeron had failed to demonstrate that he was capable of performing the new duties in accordance with the standards required for that position.\n[31] As a result, he was returned to his original position as a cable splicer in La Sarre. However, since the position had been eliminated in December 1995, he was to be laid off as of January 24, 1997 with recall rights for a period of 24 months. Claude Mayrand issued him a written layoff notice dated January 10, 1997 (Exhibit P-21).\n[32] After being laid off, Pierre Bergeron filed a grievance on January 26, 1997, which was withdrawn by the union on April 30, 1997. Despite his layoff scheduled for January 24, 1997, T\u00e9l\u00e9bec offered him, and he accepted, some splicing work for a project in Parc de la V\u00e9rendrye from January 27, 1997 to February 21, 1997, pursuant to an agreement with the Teamsters Union. He worked with Serge Chayer, another splicer. However, the usual working conditions provided for in the collective agreement were not respected. As such, the travel, accommodation and meal allowances had been eliminated. In addition, travel time from his home base to the place of work was not paid. He did not file a grievance, however.\n[33] The Complainant claimed that, when he was laid off on February 21, 1997, Serge Chayer stayed on the job although he had less seniority than he did. However, the Complainant did not file a grievance.\n[34] In July 1997, Pierre Bergeron received a telephone call from the Human Resources Department offering him work as a splicer for repairing the cable feeding the Chibougamau airport. This was for a 52-hour period of work during the week of August 4, 1997, which the Complainant accepted. The conditions of employment were confirmed in a letter to him from Claude Mayrand dated August 4, 1997. The working conditions, arranged through a letter of understanding with the Teamsters Union, did not comply with the collective agreement, according to the Complainant's claims, but he agreed to come back to work anyway, particularly since at the end of that employment period, he would have another 24 months of recall rights, and he did not file a grievance.\n[35] Given that the first Monday of August was a statutory holiday, his immediate supervisor, Claude Mayrand, gave him permission to go from La Sarre to Chibougamau during the day on August 4, 1997 and start work on the Tuesday, specifically August 5, 1997. His immediate supervisor, Claude Mayrand, informed Lyne Doroftei in writing on September 16, 1997 that the Complainant's work was satisfactory.\n[36] In October 1997, he was offered temporary work as a cable splicer for a period of approximately six weeks starting October 20, 1997, and he accepted. This was a project in Chibougamau of approximately six months. The work for the project was subcontracted out except for the splicing, which was assigned to the Respondent's employees. Once again, the conditions of employment for this project did not comply with the collective agreement by reason of a letter of agreement between the employer and the Teamsters Union.\n[37] Pierre Bergeron believed that the agreements between T\u00e9l\u00e9bec and the Teamsters Union, which deviate from the provisions of the collective agreement, did not apply to him as a splicer because they referred only to technicians and linemen. When giving him the temporary assignments that he accepted, T\u00e9l\u00e9bec should have given him all the benefits provided for in the collective agreement. As a result, he believes that he was treated differently by the Respondent compared to other employees who were given the benefits provided for in the collective agreement.\n[38] Although he disagreed with the specific conditions set out in that letter of understanding, he accepted the work and did not file a grievance. His immediate supervisor was Richard Leblanc. At the end of November 1997, his immediate supervisor informed him that the contract would be extended for an indefinite period. He understood from Richard Leblanc's words that he would have work until the end of the project. However, he did not recall Richard Leblanc's telling him that his temporary assignment would end on December 24, 1997.\n[39] Pierre Bergeron stated that he had health problems at the beginning of December 1997. He maintained that he was expecting a relapse of his depression. On December 8, 1997, he went to the Radissonie-Chibougamau CLSC, where he saw a physician who prescribed Paxil for him. The witness revealed that he had a bad reaction to the Paxil and had to be hospitalized on December 9, 10 and 11, 1997 in Chibougamau.\n[40] On December 10, 1997, Pierre Bergeron had a visit from Alain Rivard, who gave him written notice from his immediate supervisor, Richard Leblanc, that he would be laid off as of December 24, 1997 with recall rights for a period of 24 months.\n[41] On December 11, 1997, a physician from the Radissonnie CLSC issued a medical certificate with a diagnosis of depression and sick leave starting December 9, 1997.\n[42] The Complainant left the Chibougamau hospital on December 11, 1997. He travelled from Chibougamau to Val-d'Or using his employer's vehicle and then his own vehicle to his residence in La Sarre.\n[43] He saw his attending physician, Dr. Guy Perrier, on December 15, 1997, who recommended sick leave from December 15 to 29, 1997. He saw the Complainant again on January 6, 1998. In his report, he described his patient's depression and recommended a return to full-time work on January 6, 1998.\n[44] Following his layoff, the Complainant was never called back to work. Between May 21, 1998 and September 10, 1998, he filed 10 grievances. After reviewing them, the Teamsters Union concluded that all the grievances, except one involving payment of a lump sum, were unwarranted. The Complainant filed a complaint with the Canadian Industrial Relations Board on October 2, 1998 against the Teamsters Union for failing to respect its representation duty, but the complaint was dismissed.\n[45] The Complainant produced an appraisal report for 1995 prepared by Jean Mercier, Director of Network Maintenance and Works. Jean Mercier said that the Complainant met the quality and productivity standards as an overhead, underground and building cable splicer. He contributed to the team's success on the projects they were assigned to. Moreover, the quality and administrative management of his work had improved and the employee handled his equipment and his occupational health and safety well. His effectiveness was equal to that of his colleagues.\n[46] The witness also produced an appraisal report for 1996 prepared by Claude Mayrand dated March 3, 1997. The report described the Complainant's problems adjusting to changes in the company, which forced him to switch from a splicer position to an installer\/repairman position. Productivity and quality of work were not being met. He could not handle the pressure brought on by a new position.\n[47] Pierre Bergeron was asked to describe the duties of an installer\/repairman during the three years after T\u00e9l\u00e9bec hired him, specifically 1987 to 1990. He was assigned to installation and repair of telephone lines in the residential sector. Work would be assigned to him by means of a work order. Installation consisted of running a wire from the junction box on the pole to the residence and then wiring the interior of the residence based on the number of telephone jacks that the customer had requested. The installer\/repairman would also deliver telephone sets to the customer. At that time, telephone sets did not need to be programmed. Repair work required the installer\/repairman to go to the customer's home to identify the source of the fault. If it was the telephone set, it would be replaced. If it was the wiring or connections, the installer\/repairman would do the repairs. Residential work occupied about 80% of the Complainant's time.\n[48] He was also occasionally called upon to do the same work in the business sector, but for about 20% of the time. He would install Panther telephone systems, equipped with programming that gave customers some features such as ring tones and the hold function. In the Complainant's view, programming a telephone system was much harder in 1987 than it is today. He would install public telephones, but the programming was not his responsibility.\n[49] In March 1988, the Complainant received eight hours of training on the Trillium telephone system and, in March 1989, eight hours of training on the Tie telephone system. These were business systems. He acknowledged, however, that, despite the training his employer provided, he did not have to install and program these telephone systems. His work was limited to repairing the systems.\n[50] On May 7, 1996, T\u00e9l\u00e9bec posted two installer\/repairman positions (96-19NO and 96-20NO), one of which Pierre Bergeron applied for. To obtain the position, the candidate had to meet the minimum requirements. In cross-examination, he was asked to demonstrate whether he met all the requirements, namely:\nCollege diploma in electronics or the equivalent and a driver's licence. The Complainant stated that he met these requirements.\nBilingual (French and English): an asset. The Complainant stated that he could write in French and English and could speak French fluently, but not much English.\nKnowledge of various products and maintenance services (Norstar series and others): an asset. The Complainant acknowledged that, compared to 1990 when he was an installer\/repairman, many more services were offered in 1995 and many products had been added, especially with the arrival of computers. More powerful and more sophisticated telephone sets he was not familiar with had flooded the market.\nAbility to transact and communicate with customers. The Complainant admitted that in 1990 his work consisted of completing a work order, not selling telephone systems. Occasionally he would offer the customer an additional telephone set.\nKnowledge of programming principles. Since he had only installed one programmable telephone system, the witness acknowledged that he had little knowledge of programming principles.\nBasic data transmission knowledge. The Complainant admitted that he had no basic knowledge for meeting this requirement.\n[51] The job posting also included a summary of the position, including:\nContact customers in advance. The witness acknowledged that he did not have to do this in 1990, and that in 1996, the installer\/repairmen had become salespeople because they would recommend products to customers based on their needs.\nOccasionally provide work estimates for business installations. The witness acknowledged that this was not included in an installer\/repairman's duties in 1990.\nPerform a basic inspection of one's vehicle, be responsible for it, drive it safely in the course of one's work and identify mechanical problems. The witness stated that these duties were the same in 1990.\nPromote and sell the company's products\/services and equipment. The Complainant stated that this was not part of an installer\/repairman's duty in 1990 and stated that he was unaware that it existed in 1996.\nAdequately represent the company to customers. The Complainant stated that he did not know whether this was part of an installer\/repairman's duty in 1990.\nPerform the work safely, accurately, promptly and courteously; be available to travel. These requirements were also part of an installer\/repairman's duties in 1990.\n[52] Pierre Bergeron also described a splicer's work. It involves joining wires. A central cable contains many smaller cables that are routed underground in different sectors. The splicer connects the wires. In 1992, fibre optics appeared on the market. The joining work was then done by laser. In addition to connecting wires, the splicer would also repair cut cables and replace worn cables.\n[53] On July 2003, the Complainant prepared an information document about the current hearing, in which he wrote that it was the result of T\u00e9l\u00e9bec's discrimination and harassment towards him. The document was entitled [translation] Welcome to the Proceedings (Exhibit I-2). The Complainant placed this document on the windshields of vehicles belonging to the Respondent's employees in Val d'Or and Rouyn-Noranda. He had about 40 copies of the document. He also arranged for the document to be placed in the mailslots of Rouyn-Noranda employees and executives. He explained that he did this to obtain encouragement from his former colleagues.\nB. Respondents' evidence (i) Serge Faubert [54] Until 1997, when he retired after 30 years of service, Serge Faubert was General Manager of T\u00e9l\u00e9bec's telephone network for Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue, which had about 125 employees under 10 immediate supervisors, including Claude Mayrand and Alain Rivard.\n[55] Serge Faubert stated that in 1987 when he started in his position, the Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue telephone network was obsolete. T\u00e9l\u00e9bec had to invest heavily to provide the region with a cutting-edge network comparable to those in large urban centres. Massive hiring was required for that. Serge Faubert indicated, however, that as the work progressed, he identified that layoffs would be necessary, and they occurred at the end of 1995.\n[56] The cuts were made among executives and employees, particularly those assigned to installing poles and cables and to splicing. The witness explained that the possibility of layoffs hugely affected the workers' morale, and they became worried and anxious.\n[57] Before proceeding with the staff reductions, the witness took part in meetings with human resource managers and union representatives to ensure that the layoffs would be done in accordance with the collective agreement.\n[58] Lists of employees likely to be called back to work for specific projects were prepared, and the employees who were laid off had recall rights for 24 months, as per the collective agreement. To reduce operating costs, T\u00e9l\u00e9bec intended to subcontract out work. However, to give preference to recalling employees on the callback list, T\u00e9l\u00e9bec and the Teamsters Union agreed, through letters of understanding, to amend some of the working conditions set out in the collective agreement.\n[59] Pierre Bergeron was then notified on November 20, 1995 that he would be laid off as of December 6, 1995 due to a reduction in work following a company reorganization.\n[60] Serge Faubert stated that, at the end of 1996 or the beginning of January 1997, he met with Claude Mayrand and Alain Rivard, the Complainant's immediate supervisors, to discuss the fact that the Complainant took days off when he was needed at work. The witness stated that, in his view, Pierre Bergeron's conduct warranted a written disciplinary measure placed in his file.\n[61] The meeting also dealt with the issue of the Complainant's skills and ability to perform the installer\/repairman duties. His immediate supervisors believed he did not have the technical qualifications for the position.\n[62] Serge Faubert revealed that he understood their assessment. He explained his claim by the fact that the installer\/repairman duties had changed a great deal over the years. In fact, when the Complainant was working as an installer\/repairman from 1987 to 1990, his duties generally consisted of residential installations and repairs. In 1996, the duties became much more complex since the work was done in the business sector and required the installer\/repairman, in addition to doing installations, to program more sophisticated systems. It was therefore much more specialized work and required working with customers; the installer\/repairman had to promote and sell equipment.\n[63] Serge Faubert also stated that he had met with some of the Complainant's colleagues, including Jean Levert, the union steward, who informed him that the Complainant was not capable of fulfilling the installer\/repairman duties. He wanted to know what T\u00e9l\u00e9bec's intentions were with respect to keeping that employee on staff.\n(ii) Claude Mayrand [64] Claude Mayrand has been employed at T\u00e9l\u00e9bec for 20 years. When he was hired, he had a college diploma in electrotechnology. He started out as an installer\/repairman for three years. He then worked for a year and half on a team of workers who installed poles, cables and strands. He was then assigned to maintenance work, such as cable repairs, for about two years. Claude Mayrand was then assigned as an installer\/repairman in James Bay for two and half years. When he returned from James Bay, he was promoted to Manager of Line Planning and Estimating. Two years later, he became Manager of I&R (installation and repairs) from 1995 to 1998. In 1998 he was promoted to Manager of Network Management until he went back to school in 2000.\n[65] The witness was asked to describe the tasks specific to the position of installer\/repairman for the residential and business sectors between 1987 and 1990.\n[66] In the residential sector there were two parts to the installer\/repairman work. First there was exterior cabling, which involved running service wires from the pole to a box at the customer's residence. Then there was interior cabling, where the installer\/repairman would install wires in the house to provide access to the telephone set connections. Performing these tasks required knowledge of the colour coding of cables in order to do the connecting.\n[67] The second part was repair work. It involved disconnecting the customer's telephone line to check the line's resistance and the condition of the ground.\n[68] The witness submitted that, overall, the installer\/repairman at that time would spend about 95% of his time in the residential sector.\n[69] Claude Mayrand stated that the installer\/repairman would occasionally perform his duties in the business sector. This involved installing small telephone systems called Trillium and Panther by doing cabling. He would also do programming using predetermined fixed registers. As an example, the witness mentioned assigning lines to telephone sets and the type of ringing. The witness felt that 1% of the installer\/repairman's work involved programming.\n[70] The witness explained that, in 1992, microprocessors came to the business sector, which led to the appearance of numerous telephone systems. Because of microprocessors, the volume of data sent to telephone sets increased. Programming languages could therefore be integrated into the telephone systems. With the disappearance of fixed registers, customers could now have systems that were more tailored to their needs.\n[71] Claude Mayrand believed that, because of the new technology, the installer\/repairman had to add analysis work to his regular duties. The witness illustrated that statement with the arrival of the Norstar telephone system, which had three lines and eight telephone sets. According to him, this system was not very complex. Then came the 032 and SL1 systems, and programming them required knowledge of register management.\n[72] The witness stated that video-conferencing then appeared on the market. The installer\/repairman had to deal with a new technology, which was also true with the arrival of the Internet.\n[73] As for the residential sector in 1996, the installer\/repairman duties changed, partly because the obsolete network had been updated and partly because new installations were less frequent, and so was the need for repairs.\n[74] He maintained that, in 1996, 90% of the installer\/repairman's work was devoted to technical aspects, programming and customer relations, and 10% to the install\/repair work as it was in 1990.\n[75] The witness was asked to describe how the knowledge of someone with a college diploma in electronics was necessary for the duties of an installer\/repairman. He explained that this diploma gave the installer\/repairman sound basic knowledge of electronic concepts such as capacitors, the phenomena associated with inductors, and aspects of resistance and programming.\n[76] The witness stated that, confronted with the new technology, T\u00e9l\u00e9bec put telephone systems in service centres, such as those in Val d'Or and Rouyn-Noranda, to enable installer\/repairmen to become familiar with the new equipment and upgrade their skills. Information sessions were also given by the manufacturers of these systems.\n[77] Claude Mayrand was Pierre Bergeron's immediate supervisor when he came into work in Val d'Or on August 6, 1996. He acknowledged that there might not have been a vehicle available for him to do his work. However, he added that the Complainant was then teamed up with another installer\/repairman for doing cabling at Forage Beno\u00eet. Claude Mayrand went to the site to ensure that the work was up to standard. He recalled that the Complainant's colleague told him that the Complainant was rusty and not very productive.\n[78] Claude Mayrand recalled that Pierre Bergeron was then away sick and returned to work on December 2, 1996. At that point, he was no longer the Complainant's immediate supervisor; Alain Rivard had taken over that responsibility. He himself was Pierre Bergeron's immediate supervisor only in Alain Rivard's absence.\n[79] Claude Mayrand recalled that, during the week of December 16, 1996, when Alain Rivard was away, the Complainant asked for permission to have December 20 and 23, 1996 off. Claude Mayrand contacted the Network Operations Centre to find out the workloads for those dates. After receiving a response from the Network Operations Centre, the witness denied the Complainant's request, given that the workload required all staff to be on duty.\n[80] The witness stated that, on December 20, 1996, he went to the work centre in Val d'Or. At around 3:30 p.m., he met Pierre Bergeron in the hallway. He greeted him and exchanged a few words with him, and the Complainant told him that things were going fine. Claude Mayrand stated that, when he got back to his office, the Network Operations Centre called to notify him that the Complainant had left work around 3:30 p.m. because he was sick, whereas his shift was to end at 5:00 p.m. Claude Mayrand realized that the Complainant had neglected to inform him before leaving work, even though he should have done so.\n[81] In addition, on December 23, 1996, Claude Mayrand was filling in while Alain Rivard was away. He received a call around 8:00 a.m. from Chantal B\u00e9dard, the secretary, informing him that the Complainant had contacted her to notify her that he could not come in to work because he was sick and to record his absence as vacation days.\n[82] Since Claude Mayrand knew that an employee could not take vacation without prior authorization, he contacted industrial relations to determine what procedure he should follow. They informed him that a disciplinary measure could be placed in Pierre Bergeron's file for unwarranted absence. He then designated the absence as sick days. Claude Mayrand decided to put off making a decision until after the holidays, when the Complainant's immediate supervisor, Alain Rivard, would be back at work. However, he did write a letter to Alain Rivard that same day describing the events and suggesting a meeting with the Complainant on January 6, 1997.\n[83] Claude Mayrand did meet with Alain Rivard on January 6, 1997, and they decided that they would meet with the Complainant on January 7, 1997. Alain Rivard asked Claude Mayrand to accompany him since he was there during the events. The witness recalled that the meeting was held in a meeting room at the Val d'Or Work Centre around mid-afternoon on January 7, 1997. It lasted 20 or 30 minutes.\n[84] Claude Mayrand recalled starting the meeting by telling Pierre Bergeron that he had not followed the procedure for leaving or being away from work and that his absence had disrupted operations and obliged colleagues to work overtime. The witness recalled that the Complainant accepted these comments stoically. Alain Rivard then spoke and pointed out to the Complainant that there were problems with his productivity and to inform him if there were specific things he needed for performing his work, because he wanted him to be comfortable in his job. Claude Mayrand stated that the Complainant said that everything was going well in his job and that he was just as capable as all the other installer\/repairmen. Claude Mayrand also recalled that he was polite during the meeting and that at no point did the Complainant cry.\n[85] When the meeting ended, Claude Mayrand continued speaking with Alain Rivard. They discussed the Complainant's skills and ability to perform the duties of an installer\/repairman. Claude Mayrand expressed his concerns to Alain Rivard regarding the Complainant's technical skills and his ability to develop communication skills for promoting and selling equipment. Alain Rivard had also received comments from the union steward Jean Levert, the Complainant's workmate, on the quality of Pierre Bergeron's work at the La P\u00e9pie bar, specifically that he was slow and that he himself had to do the Complainant's work.\n[86] A meeting was also held with Serge Faubert, Alain Rivard and the witness on January 8, 1997. Serge Faubert was not satisfied with the measures taken following the Complainant's unwarranted absences. The meeting also dealt with Pierre Bergeron's ability to perform his duties. The witness expressed his opinion but was not involved in the decision-making. Claude Mayrand informed Serge Faubert and Alain Rivard that, in his experience, Pierre Bergeron's skills and knowledge did not match the profile expected of an installer\/repairman in 1996.\n[87] Claude Mayrand also recalled that, on the morning of January 8, 1997, Pierre Bergeron went to the office of his immediate supervisor, Alain Rivard. The witness was in the office next to Alain Rivard's and overheard the conversation. Pierre Bergeron reportedly told Alain Rivard that he had doubts about his ability to do the work of an installer\/repairman and that he was wondering whether he would be able to keep his job. This meeting was a few minutes long and Pierre Bergeron then returned to work.\n[88] Claude Mayrand recalled that on January 10, 1997, in Alain Rivard's absence, the Industrial Relations Department asked him to sign a letter and give it to Bergeron informing him of his layoff from his installer\/repairman position. He summoned the Complainant to the same meeting room where the previous meeting had been held and, in the presence of the union steward, Jean Levert, he issued him the letter (Exhibit P-21) after it was read to him. Pierre Bergeron made the comment that there would be a follow-up to that layoff. He did not think that Alain Rivard attended the meeting via video-conference.\n[89] In his complaint, Pierre Bergeron claimed that, during his sick leave from August 11 to December 2, 1996, Claude Mayrand frequently came to his house to make sure that he was indeed sick. In response to this claim, the witness said that he went only once to the Complainant's residence in La Sarre to deliver a medical form (1935) to be filled out by his attending physician. The witness recalled the Complainant greeting him politely. Claude Mayrand stated that it was the only time he went to the Complainant's residence. However, he acknowledged that he may have driven by the Complainant's residence in his vehicle two or three times because he had to do so in order to get to his father's house or the restaurant where his sister was working.\n[90] Claude Mayrand said that immediate supervisors must prepare employee evaluations every year called Annual Employee Profiles. Even though Pierre Bergeron's immediate supervisor was Alain Rivard, the witness prepared the Complainant's annual profile for 1996 because during the period from August 1996 to the end of December 1996, he was the immediate supervisor of the Complainant as an installer\/repairman and because of Alain Rivard's absences. The witness explained that an employee's annual profile evaluated performance and the skills and abilities acquired over the year.\n[91] The witness stated that, to prepare the Complainant's annual profile, he obtained comments from Alain Rivard, Brigitte C\u00f4t\u00e9 from the Network Operations Centre, and Yvan Deault, the Depot Manager. He also considered comments from the Complainant's colleagues, including Jean Levert, the Union Steward.\n[92] When preparing an employee's annual profile, they meet with the employee to let him\/her know their impressions. In Pierre Bergeron's case, the meeting did not take place because he was on a layoff in March 1997 when his evaluation was being prepared. The witness explained that when the employee's annual profile is completed (Exhibit P-43), a copy is placed in the employee's personal file. This was true in Pierre Bergeron's case.\n[93] Claude Mayrand recalled that on July 16, 1998, Pierre Bergeron filed a formal notice with T\u00e9l\u00e9bec (Exhibit P-45) claiming that his evaluation for 1996 was incorrect and contained false statements that were damaging to his reputation and likely to jeopardize his future as an employee with T\u00e9l\u00e9bec.\n[94] Claude Mayrand consulted with the Industrial Relations Department to determine what stance to take. It was agreed that Pierre Bergeron's annual profile for 1996 would be removed from his personal file, partly because no one had met with him during the preparation of his evaluation and partly because it was very likely that he would not be called back to work as an installer\/repairman following his layoff on January 10, 1997. Consequently, on July 27, 1998, Claude Mayrand send a letter to the Complainant informing him that his annual profile for 1996 and all copies of it would be destroyed (Exhibit-46).\n[95] The witness stated that, in August 1997, T\u00e9l\u00e9bec had to repair a copper cable feeding the Chibougamau airport. The project would require 52 hours of temporary splicing work. He put in a staffing request with the Human Resources Department (Exhibit I-16), and they identified Pierre Bergeron as being available.\n[96] Claude Mayrand contacted the Complainant to offer him the work and inform him of the duration and conditions involved. He accepted the work, and everything was confirmed in writing (Exhibit P-26).\n[97] When the work was finished, Alain Rivard inspected it. Claude Mayrand issued a memo on September 16, 1997 (Exhibit P-27) pointing out that [translation] the repairs to the cable feeding the Chibougamau airport complied with established standards and that Pierre Bergeron's work was satisfactory.\n[98] Claude Mayrand was asked to give his version about the Complainant's health condition. He stated that he was never aware of Pierre Bergeron's health condition because information about an employee's health condition is confidential. Claude Mayrand was also asked to respond to Pierre Bergeron's claims that he (Mayrand), between August and December 1996, had told him off several times in an unwarranted manner because of his health condition.\n[99] The witness stated that he never had a row with Pierre Bergeron, either when he came to work on August 6, 1996 nor when he visited him at his home in August 1996. He acknowledged that, during the employment period of December 1996 and January 1997, he had some conversation with the Complainant the morning before he left for work. The conversation was simply to obtain information and ensure that everything was going fine, nothing more. He added that, during the meetings on January 7 and 10, 1997, there were no rows then either.\n[100] Claude Mayrand stated that, in August 2003, he went to the Rouyn-Noranda Service Centre. Because he had travelled the previous day in T\u00e9l\u00e9bec's vehicle, his own car was at the service centre. When he arrived, he saw a document on the windshield of his car. It was entitled, [translation] Welcome to the Proceedings' (Exhibit I-2). When he went into the service centre, he saw several copies of the document in employee mail slots. The document dealt with the hearing in the case of Pierre Bergeron versus T\u00e9l\u00e9bec and Alain Rivard in Montreal on September 10 to 19, 2003. It also said [translation] For information, contact Mr. Pierre Bergeron at 819-847-3479.\n[101] In cross-examination, the Complainant asked Claude Mayrand to acknowledge that, when he arrived for work in Val d'Or on August 6, 1996, he told him [translation] Pierre, this is your last chance, which the witness categorically denied. The witness also denied telling the Complainant that he was not a team player, that he did not need someone like him on his team and that he worked too slowly.\n(iii) Alain Rivard [102] Alain Rivard was hired by T\u00e9l\u00e9bec in 1977 for the position of installer\/repairman and, in 1979, for the position of central office and transmission equipment technician. In 1981, he again held the position of installer\/repairman until 1984, when he was promoted to Dispatcher. In 1986, he became an Inspector\/Analyst, then in 1988, Manager of Repair Service Quality, and in 1992, Manager of Property.\n[103] In 1995, he became Technical Services Manager for the Val-d'Or sector, which includes the entire Eastern Abitibi region. He was also made Technical Services Manager for the James Bay sector. These two sectors form a territory with an area of 350,000 km2. Supervising them required him to be away from his Val d'Or office frequently.\n[104] To help him in his work, the witness had assistance from Claude Mayrand, who had the same responsibilities for Val-d'Or and Rouyn-Noranda or when he was taken away from his office.\n[105] Alain Rivard said that, by 1995, the installer\/repairman profile had changed a great deal compared to 1990, especially in the business sector. In fact, rapid technology improvements and the advent of new telephone systems along with the addition of promotion and sales made the work of an installer\/repairman much more specialized.\n[106] He recalled that, on December 2, 1996, Pierre Bergeron appeared for work in Val-d'Or. It was part of a gradual return to work with no medical restrictions. Because he was away when the Complainant came into work, Claude Mayrand assigned him some line transfer work in Senneterre. When he arrived, Alain Rivard called Pierre Bergeron back to Val-d'Or to do some more urgent work in the business sector.\n[107] Claude Mayrand introduced Pierre Bergeron to him upon his return to Val-d'Or at the start of the afternoon. The witness knew that Pierre Bergeron was returning to work as an installer\/repairman after being a splicer for several years. As result, the witness said\n[translation]\n\"He was a bit rusty.\"\n[108] Therefore, he assigned Pierre Bergeron to T\u00e9l\u00e9bec Mobilit\u00e9 to help an installer\/repairman with the installation of a 032 telephone system. At the start of the week of December 9, 1996, he also informed the Complainant that he would assign him the installation of a Norstar 3\/8 system (3 lines - 8 phones) at the Brasserie La P\u00e9pie during the week. It was relatively simple work that allowed the Complainant to become familiar with his new position. The witness stated that he told Pierre Bergeron that if he had any problems, he should feel comfortable communicating with him at any time.\n[109] During that week, the Complainant was indeed tasked with installing the Norstar 3\/8 system at the Brasserie La P\u00e9pie. The installer had to run two telephone lines to the customer premises from the central office, install the system in the location that the customer specified and join the two lines. He then had to take care of the distribution by doing the interior wiring to the required telephone sets. Programming was also required, specifically opening the input ports for the lines and assigning them to the various telephones.\n[110] The time usually allotted for installing such a system was about eight to ten hours. However, since the Complainant was back to work as an installer\/repairman, Alain Rivard had allowed 16 hours for the work to be done.\n[111] The witness stated that, while the work was being carried out, he went to the Brasserie La P\u00e9pie to check the progress. Pierre Bergeron informed him that he was having problems with putting the lines through. He also met with the owner of the Brasserie, who informed him of her concerns. She claimed that the installer\/repairman was having problems with the programming because he had told her that it was not his area since he was a splicer. She was concerned that the deadline scheduled for the work would not be met.\n[112] Alain Rivard told the Complainant about the customer's comments. Pierre Bergeron answered that it was not installer\/repairman work that he wanted to do, but splicing work instead. He said that he did not like having contacts with customers. Alain Rivard told him that he had no choice.\n[113] The witness stated that, at that meeting, he did not tell Pierre Bergeron that he was dragging his heels and was not a team player. In fact, Alain Rivard noticed that the Complainant took 22 to 24 hours to install the Norstar 3\/8 system, which was six to eight hours more than he had allotted.\n[114] Pierre Bergeron's work was not at all what was expected of him. Specifically, his contact with the customer and his programming left much to be desired. Therefore, to minimize his contact with customers, Alain Rivard decided to assign Pierre Bergeron to work with two installer\/repairmen, Jean Levert and Richard Duquette, on a job at Aub\u00e9 Pontiac Buick in Val-d'Or. Richard Duquette was responsible for dealing with the customer. The work involved completely recabling the telephone system and network cabling.\n[115] Alain Rivard stated that he told Pierre Bergeron that he would have pre-wiring to do. He had told him that, if he had any problems, to rely on his colleagues. Alain Rivard had the opportunity to go to the work site. Jean Levert and Richard Duquette informed him that Pierre Bergeron was dragging his heels a bit and was not relying on them very much. He went to see the Complainant and he stated: (pages 1850-1851)\n[translation]\n... then I asked Pierre how it was going. It's going alright. I said, Your colleagues tell me that you're dragging your heels a bit. Is something not going right? Well, it's not what I want to do. I don't like doing that, you know; I'm a splicer. Yes, I said. But that's what needs to done. I talked for a bit and then said, It's important for you to talk to them. Anyway, it went something like that. Then he told me a bit about his health condition.\nQ. What did he say to you?\nA. Well, according to him, he was depressed, and I am not a doctor, but what I said to Pierre was, As far as I understand, you are gradually returning to work, with no restrictions. So I expect the same work from you as from the others. Then he said, Yes, but you yourself experienced depression. I said, Yes, I did. That's why I'm talking to you about this. I expect the same work from you as from the others, but if you are not well, take the rights steps before it costs you your life. It's important; I went through it myself. But it's up to you to do something about it. If you're not well, go see a doctor. As far as I'm concerned, you have work to do. End of story.\"\n[116] Alain Rivard added that he had had major depression with infarction in 1992 and that he was sensitive to someone who may be experiencing depression.\n[117] T\u00e9l\u00e9bec had secured a contract at Val-d'Or Performance, a subsidiary of Aub\u00e9 Pontiac Buick, for refitting some wiring with wire covers, in other words placing mouldings to hide wires on the outside of walls. Richard Duquette was in charge of the project. Alain Rivard decided to move Pierre Bergeron to this project to help him with the work.\n[118] Richard Duquette informed Alain Rivard that the quality of the Complainant's work at Val-d'Or Performance was good but that there was a problem with his productivity.\n[119] Alain Rivard secured a contract with Lands and Forests, a government building, with the specification that it had to be done between the hours of 3:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. The project was assigned to the installer Yoland Audet, who needed an installer\/repairman with him. He had to install a telephone system and the networking.\n[120] Alain Rivard thought that Pierre Bergeron might be interested in the wiring work on this project and proposed it to him. He felt that Pierre Bergeron would be much more comfortable in this work setting. He did accept the offer and seemed content with it.\n[121] Alain Rivard stated that the quality of Pierre Bergeron's work was again good. The problem was his productivity. He had to call in an extra installer\/repairman, Alain Brouillette, to ensure that the work would be completed in the time frame stated to the customer.\n[122] Alain Rivard recalled that he was probably on vacation during the week of December 16, 1996. However, since he lived in Val-d'Or, he was in the habit of briefly stopping by the work sites to see how everything was going.\n[123] When he came back to work in January 1997 after the holidays, Alain Rivard read the document that Claude Mayrand had sent him regarding the Complainant's leaving work on December 20, 1996 and his absence from work on December 23, 1996 (Exhibit I-15). He stated that he was disappointed to hear about Pierre Bergeron's conduct. Alain Rivard explained that if his absence was due to illness, he could understand. However, if the Complainant was away for no valid reason and in spite of the fact that Claude Mayrand had not allowed him to take vacation during that time, it was a much more serious issue. If that was the case, Alain Rivard was disappointed that Pierre Bergeron had acted that way after he had tried to accommodate him as much as possible in the performance of his work.\n[124] After Claude Mayrand brought him up to date on the facts surrounding the events, he decided to meet with Pierre Bergeron to hear his version of the facts, in the presence of Claude Mayrand, who was more aware of the events and could answer any questions that may be asked.\n[125] That meeting was held in the afternoon of January 7, 1997 in the meeting room. Claude Mayrand spoke first and described the events on December 20 and 23, 1996. He informed Pierre Bergeron that he had not followed the proper procedure when he left work on December 20, 1996 and during his absence on December 23, 1996, which was to notify his immediate supervisor. He added that his absence had resulted in productivity problems because the work had to be done with reduced staff during the holidays and that they had to put in overtime. Then Alain Rivard took over and asked Pierre Bergeron if he felt capable of doing the installer\/repairman work. The Complainant said that he was capable of doing the work and that his productivity was fine. Alain Rivard reminded him, however, that his productivity had not been satisfactory in the duties he was assigned before the holidays. He maintained that the issue of his health never came up in that meeting and stated that the Complainant did not cry. The Complainant's only comment was that it was more difficult for him to do the work when he felt pressured. The witness answered that if he felt he was having problems with pressure, all he had to do was tell him so that he could help him.\n[126] Following that meeting, Claude Mayrand and Alain Rivard discussed the situation and shared their points of view on the Complainant's work evaluation, and they decided to meet with the manager, Serge Faubert, the next day.\n[127] At that meeting, Claude Mayrand informed Serge Faubert about the events on December 20 and 23, 1996. Serge Faubert asked whether the Complainant had been issued a reprimand because of his behaviour. Alain Rivard clearly recalled that Serge Faubert soundly criticized them for not having done so.\n[128] Alain Rivard then informed Serge Faubert that Pierre Bergeron's situation was worrying him. He told him about all Pierre Bergeron's difficulties since returning to work and that he was planning on ending the Complainant's employment as an installer\/repairman. Serge Faubert told him to contact industrial relations. The witness contacted industrial relations to inform them about the issue he was dealing with and his decision to end the Complainant's employment.\n[129] The Industrial Relations Department prepared a layoff notice (Exhibit P-21). Because the witness was away when the document was received, Claude Mayrand signed it and issued it to Pierre Bergeron during a meeting on January 10, 1997. The witness stated that he did not take part in that meeting, not even via video-conference.\n[130] Alain Rivard stated that he saw the Complainant again on December 12, 1997 under relatively special circumstances. He was in Val-d'Or getting ready to leave for Chibougamau, when Richard Leblanc asked him, since he would be in Chibougamau, to issue a layoff notice to Pierre Bergeron, who was hospitalized there. He did not feel comfortable with this request, so he contacted the Industrial Relations Department, which gave its approval.\n[131] He went to the hospital and the Complainant greeted him politely. He said that he was not surprised by his visit because he was expecting a layoff notice. Alain Rivard asked him about the reason for his hospitalization. The Complainant told him about his depression. Alain Rivard said to him, (page 1904)\n[translation]\n\"You know, it's important to be healthy in life. At one point I said, You need to take the right steps to take care of yourself before it costs you your life. There is no other way to get through this than to take care of yourself, change your pace of life and your way of doing things. I'm telling you this from experience. I went through it myself; it's important. You have the chance here. It's odd to say it, but you have the opportunity while you're here in the hospital to get some help. Take advantage of that.\"\n[132] Alain Rivard believed that the Complainant was receptive to his comments. The conversation continued for a few more minutes and then he left.\n[133] The witness was asked to comment on the Complainant's claim that he had been laid off because of his health condition. He explained that he was never aware of the Complainant's health condition, except for what he had told him regarding the pressure he felt when performing his work.\n[134] The witness was also asked to comment on the Complainant's allegation that he was not given the same opportunities as other employees, such as training during his probationary period. The witness denied the allegation. He maintained that the opposite was true, that he gave the Complainant every opportunity by assigning him tasks that would enable him to adjust to installer\/repairman work. As for training, Alain Rivard stated that T\u00e9l\u00e9bec does not provide training to installer\/repairmen with a college degree in electronics. It was up to the employee to train himself by studying the documentation that comes with the equipment made available to him.\n[135] Regarding the Complainant's allegation that T\u00e9l\u00e9bec refused to provide him with a harassment-free workplace, Alain Rivard responded that, during meetings he had with the Complainant, he asked if everything was going well. He told him what he expected of him. Pierre Bergeron was receptive but said he could not take the pressure. He stated that he had never had a row with the Complainant. In fact, Alain Rivard was convinced that he had done everything he could to help the Complainant meet the requirements of his work.\n[136] Alain Rivard recalled that, around July 25, 2003 when he came to work, there was a document on his desk entitled [translation] Welcome to the Proceedings (Exhibit I-2). He found out that copies of the document were circulating among the employees. He stated that he had been very concerned about this because it caused unrest among the employees. He reported to the Industrial Relations Department.\n(iv) Lyne Doroftei [137] She started working at T\u00e9l\u00e9bec in 1984. Starting in 1990, she held the position of Human Resources Manager and, in 1995, became Labour Relations Manager. Her work involved advising managers in the application of the collective agreement and representing the company at union\/management meetings for discussing the application of the collective agreement, the grievance process, negotiations and the preparation of letters of understanding between parties.\n[138] In 1995, she was actively involved in the administrative reorganization that led to the elimination of many lineman and splicer positions in a variety of locations.\n[139] A seniority list by position was prepared. To identify employees to be laid off, seniority and bumping rights were applied, as provided for in the collective agreement. The individuals affected by the layoffs were placed on a callback list and had recall rights, if the employees were needed, for 24 months, after which time they would lose their seniority and their jobs.\n[140] Whenever a callback was required for a position, the Human Resources Department would call an employee back based on seniority, availability and the ability to meet the normal requirements of the position.\n[141] To reduce operating costs and increase productivity on specific projects, the Respondent was planning on subcontracting out work, to the disadvantage of laid-off employees. The Teamsters Union instead wanted laid-off employees to be called back to work. As such, on May 25, 1996, the parties signed a letter of understanding (Exhibit I-4) that would expire at the end of May 1996 providing for the recall of employees on the callback list for the R\u00e9migny and Macamic projects. This agreement provided for fewer benefits than those in the collective agreement, specifically regarding overtime pay, bonuses and accommodation and meal allowances.\n[142] On May 27, 1996, this letter of understanding was extended for an indefinite period. It also applied to all projects other than those originally planned.\n[143] On November 12, 1996, the parties signed a letter of understanding in effect until December 20, 1996 for the Parc La V\u00e9rendrye project. This letter of understanding again involved calling back employees on the callback list with working conditions that were different than those in the collective agreement, specifically regarding overtime pay, bonuses and accommodation and meal allowances.\n[144] That letter of understanding was extended on January 17 and February 22, 1997. The latter extension was for an indefinite period and applied to all projects that the company planned to carry out.\n[145] According to the witness, the hiring conditions were then enhanced after consultation with the Teamsters Union without involving written letters of understanding. As an example, the witness pointed out that, for the Chibougamau project, a per diem allowance of $62 was negotiated to cover meals and accommodation. Also, on July 7, 1998 (Exhibit I-8), the parties signed a letter of understanding that reflected the conditions verbally agreed to since the letter of understanding of February 22, 1997. This letter of understanding maintained the principle previously established verbally that an employee could turn down proposed work.\n[146] Lyne Doroftei explained the layoff procedure under article 13.17 of the collective agreement (Exhibit I-9) in force in 1995. According to the procedure, employees with less seniority in a job category in the seniority unit can be laid off as long as employees with more seniority are capable of performing the work.\n[147] An employee affected by the layoffs had the choice of being laid off or assigned to another position or job classification in the seniority unit as long as he\/she was capable of performing the required duties in a reasonable time frame not exceeding 10 working days and as long as the assignment did not displace a more senior employee or employee in the same classification in a different seniority unit, provided that the employee in question was capable of performing the required duties and that the transfer did not displace a more senior employee.\n[148] The employer had to proceed with all employee reassignments in accordance with the order below. The Complainant was not granted bumping rights because the employer believed that he was unable to perform the required duties in the 10-working-day period.\n[149] This provision in the collective agreement does not appear to create the obligation for the employer to call employees back to work because clause 13.18 of the collective agreement deals only with the rules that apply during a recall. Through letters of understanding, the employer agreed to call back laid-off employees with fewer working conditions than those set out in the collective agreement.\n[150] For the staff reductions, Pierre Bergeron had the least seniority in the splicer job category and in the La Sarre seniority unit. As a result, he was classified as a redundant employee with bumping rights. If he could not exercise his bumping rights, he would be laid off and placed on a callback list with recall rights for 24 months.\n[151] A list of employees with bumping rights was prepared on November 17, 1995. Because it was permitted to do so pursuant to article 13.17 (2) of the collective agreement, T\u00e9l\u00e9bec decided not to give the Complainant a new assignment.\n[152] The witness stated that, after the employees to be laid off were identified, on December 15 and 31, 1995, a callback list was prepared. Employees on that list could be called back to work. Under the provisions of clause 13.18 of the collective agreement, the callbacks were to be done in reverse order of the layoffs as long as the employee concerned was capable of performing the work.\n[153] Article 13.19 of the collective agreement also specifies that [translation] an employee called back to work and assigned to a location other than his\/her normal workplace during the layoff may refuse the proposed assignment and wait to be offered a position at his\/her former workplace as long as the proposed position can be filled by a laid-off employee with less seniority who is capable of carrying out the work.\n[154] The witness explained the application of this clause in the Complainant's case. Pierre Bergeron was a splicer and his usual workplace was La Sarre. If he had been called back for an assignment in a location other than La Sarre, he could have refused the assignment and remained on the callback list. As such, when the Complainant was called back to work on March 26, 1996 for the R\u00e9migny and Macamic project, he could have refused it because it was in a different location than his usual workplace, on the condition that a more junior employee was capable of performing the work. This was the case because, on March 26, 1995, another employee, Yves H\u00e9roux, who was also a splicer and had less seniority than Pierre Bergeron was available (Exhibit I 3). The witness explained that it would have been different if the Complainant had been called back to work after May 26, 1995, when Yves H\u00e9roux was no longer available because of a callback. As a result, the Complainant could not refuse the assignment since there was no other splicer with less seniority on the callback list.\n[155] The witness also explained that the collective agreement was silent on the consequences of an employee refusing an assignment despite his obligation to accept it. The witness stated that, in such circumstances, the employee would still remain on the callback list until the 24-month recall rights expired.\n[156] The witness stated that an employee who is on a layoff may also come back to work if a permanent position becomes vacant or if a new permanent position is created.\n[157] Lyne Doroftei was also asked to comment on the provisions in article 22 of the collective agreement, which deals with temporary transfers. This provision is applied when a very high volume of work requires an employee to be temporarily moved to a workplace different than his\/her usual one. At that point, the employee is entitled to certain benefits such as travel expenses, reasonable accommodation expenses and meal allowances. However, the witness pointed out that the provisions in article 22 of the collective agreement did not apply when employees on the callback list were called back to work, because the employment conditions were governed by the letters of understanding.\n[158] Lyne Doroftei provided explanations about the application of article 21 of the collective agreement, which deals with permanent transfers. This provision covers the situation where the employer requires an employee to be transferred from his\/her usual workplace to different one. The witness pointed out that this article is not applicable in the case of job postings. In fact, when a position is posted, an employee who decides to apply accepts the results of that decision, whereas for a permanent transfer, the employer requires the employee to move to a different workplace.\n[159] Lyne Doroftei described her involvement with Pierre Bergeron's layoff on January 10, 1997. On January 9, 1997, the manager of the Labour Relations Department, Reynald Wilson, asked her to prepare a letter (Exhibit P-21) to the Complainant informing him that his installer\/repairman position would end on January 24, 1997 and that he would return to the callback list for 24 months from the date of his layoff. She was informed that Pierre Bergeron had obtained a posted installer\/repairman position and that he had not demonstrated the ability to perform his new duties in accordance with the standards required for the position.\n[160] The witness explained that clause 13.12 of the collective agreement provided that [translation] if an employee does not demonstrate the ability to perform the new duties in accordance with company standards within 120 days following the promotion or transfer, the employee shall return to his\/her prior position and location ...\n[161] The witness also stated that on December 9, 1997, she received a telephone call from Richard Leblanc, Pierre Bergeron's immediate supervisor, notifying her that the Complainant's job was to end on December 24, 1997 but that he was away from work in the hospital. He enquired about the need, given his absence, to inform the Complainant in writing about his layoff effective December 24, 1997. Richard Leblanc told her that Pierre Bergeron had been temporarily called back to work on October 20, 1997 for approximately six weeks and that his assignment had been verbally extended until December 24, 1997. On December 10, 1997, Richard Leblanc confirmed with the witness by email the information that he had given her the previous day (Exhibit I-12).\n[162] The witness prepared a layoff notice regarding the Complainant effective December 24, 1997 with recall rights for a 24-month period from the date of his layoff (Exhibit P-30).\n[163] Following his layoff on January 10, 1997 (Exhibit P-21) the Complainant submitted a grievance (Exhibit P-23) in which he challenged his layoff and demanded his installer\/repairman position back as well as all the benefits he lost.\n[164] After the grievance was filed, the grievance committee met to discuss it. Attending that meeting were the Complainant, his union steward Jean Levert, his immediate supervisor Alain Rivard, and the witness Lyne Doroftei from the Labour Relations Department. She was responsible for taking the minutes of the meeting (Exhibit P-65).\n[165] Lyne Doroftei stated that the company wanted to call back the Complainant on August 27, 1998 for some temporary work as a pole installer, but that they could not reach him (Exhibit I-3). The witness acknowledged that the collective agreement did not stipulate the procedure to follow for calling back an employee. She explained that the usual practice was to do the callback by telephone.\n[166] The inability to reach the Complainant did not constitute a refusal of the callback, and he remained on the callback list until his recall rights expired on December 24, 1999.\n[167] The witness explained that, to announce a layoff to an employee, they would meet with the individual in person to inform him\/her. If the employee was away, they would arrange for a company representative to meet with the employee and issue a written layoff notice.\n[168] Lyne Doroftei was asked to comment on the Complainant's claim that Serge Chayer, with less seniority than he had, remained employed whereas he was laid off. Using Serge Chayer's employment history (Exhibit I-19) Lyne Doroftei showed that Serge Chayer had been placed on the callback list on December 7, 1995 when he had previously held the positions of lineman and splicer.\n[169] Because he had more seniority than Serge Chayer, Pierre Bergeron was temporarily called back as a splicer for the period of January 27 to February 21, 1997. Serge Chayer was temporarily called back as a splicer from February 3 to March 17, 1997. Therefore, the Complainant could not claim the work given to Serge Chayer because he was already working when Serge Chayer was called back to work.\n[170] The witness stated that, according to the employment history, Serge Chayer then obtained a temporary job as an installer\/repairman from March 17 to November 23, 1997. In the meantime, Serge Chayer applied for an installer\/repairman position and was selected. Since November 24, 1997, he has held a permanent installer\/repairman position. The witness explained that the Complainant's previous attempt to obtain an installer\/repairman position had failed, which explained why Serge Chayer remained employed instead of the Complainant.\n[171] Lyne Doroftei also commented on Pierre Bergeron's claim that Yves Th\u00e9roux, a splicer on the callback list at that time with less seniority, had been temporarily called back from May 27, 1996 to January 1, 1999. The witness explained that when Yves Th\u00e9roux was called back to work, Pierre Bergeron had already been working since March 26, 1996 and remained there until he went on sick leave in August 1996. Therefore, he could not claim the work given to Yves Th\u00e9roux.\n[172] Lyne Doroftei, when cross-examined by Pierre Bergeron, had to explain how it was that, after he was laid off on December 24, 1997, he was never called back to work before his recall rights expired on December 24, 1999. With reference to the callback list (Exhibit I-3), Lyne Doroftei answered that only one employee had been temporarily called back on December 14, 1998 and that that employee had more seniority than the Complainant did. In 1999, Paul Villeneuve, Roger Morissette, Marc Mercier and Andr\u00e9 Boisvert were called back but they all had more seniority than the Complainant did.\n[173] The witness was asked to review the letters of understanding (Exhibits I-4, I-5, I-6 and I-7) that deal with the temporary rehire of technicians and linemen and explain why they were applied to other jobs, including splicers. Lyne Doroftei answered that these letters of understanding, with the agreement of the Teamsters Union, were applied to all employees on the callback list and that everything had been confirmed in the signing of the letter of understanding on July 7, 1998 (Exhibit I-8) covering the rehire of employees on the callback list.\n[174] Lyne Doroftei stated in cross-examination that the attending physician's report used by the Medical Department was required when an employee's absence due to illness or injury may exceed eight days. She confirmed Dr. Cond\u00e9's testimony that the employer's representatives are never informed about the nature of an employee's illness. The information sent by the employer's physician is limited to the disability period, the date of return to full-time or part-time work, with or without restrictions.\n(v) Dr. Jean-Joseph Cond\u00e9 [175] At the beginning of Dr. Cond\u00e9's testimony, the Complainant relieved him from his patient\/physician confidentiality and consented to his disclosing the contents of his medical file and personal notes. From 1992 to 1997, he was the staff physician at T\u00e9l\u00e9bec. Since 1997, he has been the Respondent's medical consultant from his private office for medico-administrative issues among its employees. Dr. Cond\u00e9 explained the company's procedure when an employee is on leave due to illness or a work-related injury.\n[176] The employee must provide a report from his\/her attending physician (form 1935) used by the Medical Department, in other words, directly to Dr. Cond\u00e9's office. Upon receipt of the duly completed form 1935, he reads it and prepares an administrative report (form 1936) reproducing the information in the attending physician's report without disclosing the diagnosis, which is confidential. The administrative report is forwarded to the director and the employee's immediate supervisor. One part of that report is sent to the Benefits Department to notify them of the appropriateness of the leave. A copy is also sent to the employee.\n[177] The medical consultant meets with the employee when it is necessary to determine whether the employee, who is declared fit to return to work, is ready to resume his\/her duties, when the leave is extended, or when the treatment appears to be insufficient or inadequate, in order to reassess the appropriateness of the leave. A report (form 5483) is then prepared by the medical consultant and sent to the same employer stakeholders, including the employee involved.\n[178] The witness met with the Complainant on August 27, 1996 when he was on leave with a September 2, 1996 return to duty scheduled by his attending physician. The Complainant informed the physician that he had had major depression 11 years earlier.\n[179] The progress notes in Dr Cond\u00e9's file (Exhibit P-54) stated that the Complainant had been on leave since August 19, 1996 for major depression with the triggers he identified as change in employment level, loss of a loved one he was attached to, namely his dog, and moving. He concluded that the leave was warranted and that the return to duty scheduled for September 16, 1996 by the attending physician should probably be extended. He recommended that the Complainant continue the psychotherapy he had been receiving once a week since August 16, 1996 and to see his attending physician again in two weeks.\n[180] On October 1, 1996, the Complainant's attending physician, Dr. Guy Perrier, sent a medical report (1935) to the Medical Department containing a diagnosis of major depression with a return to regular full-time work on November 4, 1996.\n[181] On October 30, 1996, the patient saw his attending physician again, who filled out another medical certificate (1935) scheduling a return to part-time work for his patient, with no restrictions, as of December 2, 1996.\n[182] Pierre Bergeron met with Dr. Cond\u00e9 on October 31, 1996. He noted that the Complainant told him he had been feeling better for a month; he was playing sports once a week; his appetite had increased and he was gaining weight; he felt less tired and his physical abilities were increasing; his memory and concentration were fine. Dr. Cond\u00e9 also noted that the patient no longer cried or had suicidal thoughts or sadness.\n[183] Dr. Cond\u00e9 expressed the opinion that the patient's condition had improved. He recommended that he continue psychotherapy, increase his daily activities to continue getting in shape and take the medication prescribed by Dr. Perrier.\n[184] Since the return to work that Dr. Perrier scheduled was December 2, 1996, he made an appointment with the Complainant for November 26, 1996 for a back-to-work examination. At that appointment, Dr. Cond\u00e9 noted that the patient was doing much better. He told him that he had increased his physical activity, that his morale was good and that he was in good spirits.\n[185] He also informed him that he felt less tired and that his energy had increased. He felt better because of the massage therapy and psychotherapy.\n[186] Dr. Cond\u00e9 concluded that the depression had definitely improved and he approved the attending physician's recommendation for a return to part-time work with no restrictions starting December 2, 1996. However, with the Complainant's agreement, he recommended a gradual return to duty, namely two consecutive days during the week of December 2, 1996, three days a week from December 9, 1996 to January 3, 1997 and five days a week starting January 6, 1997.\n[187] On December 9, 1996, in Dr. Cond\u00e9's absence, the Complainant met with the nurse, Linda Doyter, in Dr. Cond\u00e9's office. She recorded in the file that Pierre Bergeron worked December 2 and 3, 1996. His concentration was good but he felt physically exhausted. She noted that the patient informed her that morale-wise he was fine; he had a new job in which he felt pressure due to his closely monitored performance. He was to see his physician again on December 12, 1996. The nurse decided that, during the week of December 9, the employee would not return to part-time work with no restrictions at a rate of three days a week as planned, but two non-consecutive days a week instead.\n[188] An appointment was made with Dr. Cond\u00e9 for December 17, 1996 for a follow-up back-to-work examination. Pierre Bergeron did see Dr. Cond\u00e9 on December 17, 1996. The Complainant told the physician that he had worked two days the previous week and felt that his performance at work was good. The Complainant also told him that he felt physically capable of working and that he was ready to increase his performance and time at work. He claimed to have good morale, no symptoms of depression and no crying or sadness. In addition, his appetite was good and he was sleeping well with his medication.\n[189] In light of these facts, Dr. Cond\u00e9 concluded that the Complainant's condition had improved even more, that he felt fit and that he had no depression symptoms. With Pierre Bergeron's consent, Dr. Cond\u00e9 recommended a return to part-time work with no restrictions at a rate of four days a week for the current week and full time with no restrictions as of December 23, 1996. Since he felt that the patient's progress was satisfactory, Dr. Cond\u00e9 did not plan to see him again.\n[190] On December 11, 1996, Pierre Bergeron consulted his attending physician for a follow-up examination. The physician noted that his patient had no mood disorders. Dr. Cond\u00e9 felt that on that date, the Complainant's attending physician considered him recovered from depression and fit for duty.\n[191] On January 14, 1997, Dr. Cond\u00e9 met with the Complainant, who told him that he had not worked on December 23 and 24, 1996. He had taken vacation over the holidays. He started back to work full time on January 6, 1997 and felt that his performance was good.\n[192] The patient also told him that he had been laid off due to his lack of experience and inability to do the job. Dr. Cond\u00e9 observed that the Complainant accepted the situation calmly; he cried a bit; he exhibited good judgement and good appreciation of the situation. He was hoping to be called back to work. He explained that his diagnostic, based on his impression, was that the patient's calm, controlled reaction to his layoff and the absence of depression symptoms demonstrated that he had recovered from the depression.\n[193] He also noted that, on January 13, 1997, the Complainant saw his attending physician, who observed that he had no depressive disorder. He had reduced the Paxil intake from 40 to 20 milligrams.\n(vi) Jos\u00e9e Ferron [194] Jos\u00e9e Ferron was hired at T\u00e9l\u00e9bec in April 1992 and has held the position of Human Resources Manager, since January 1996. She was involved in selecting, hiring and moving staff, whereas Lyne Doroftei was assigned to everything relating to labour relations. It has only been since 1999 that she has been responsible for labour relations.\n[195] At the beginning of May 1996, a request was submitted for filling two installer\/repairman positions in Val-d'Or. On May 7, 1996, she posted the two positions on the bulletin boards in the work centres (Exhibit I-14). The document identified the position, location, duration, minimum requirements, job summary and the expected date of employment. The witness explained that the jobs were posted for five business days, in accordance with the collective agreement, and were taken down on May 13, 1996.\n[196] During that time, employees had to apply using a transfer request, as Pierre Bergeron did (Exhibit P-13) on May 13, 1996. The witness stated that five candidates applied, namely Guy Desgagn\u00e9, Normand Rouleau, Pierre Bergeron, Daniel Lemieux and Serge Chayer.\n[197] Jos\u00e9e Ferron stated that, once the posting process was over, she interviewed the candidates who had applied to determine their skills and qualifications for the position. Interviews are sometimes conducted over the telephone, as was the case with the Complainant, who was in La Sarre, whereas the human resources office was in Val-d'Or. The witness conducted the telephone interview with the Complainant on May 22, 1996, and the interview was 30 to 45 minutes long.\n[198] The witness asked the Complainant some questions to determine whether he had the minimum requirements for the position, to evaluate his ability to work on a team, his sense of cooperation, technical knowledge, independence, sense of responsibility, and his perspective on dealing with customers.\n[199] The witness stated that she also evaluated the candidate's team spirit, ability to deal with ambiguity, leadership, decision-making skills and knowledge of English, which was considered an asset.\n[200] The witness stated that, after the interview, she prepared a written evaluation (Exhibit I-23). She wrote in it that the Complainant would have to improve his leadership and that his career motivation was low since he seemed unmotivated after the layoffs and appeared to not understand the current business context; his level of technical knowledge was low.\n[201] Following the candidate interviews, the witness stated that she met with the Service Manager Serge Faubert, and Alain Rivard or Claude Mayrand to select the candidates. After discussion, one candidate was selected, namely Daniel Lemieux, for one installer\/repairman position, while for the second position, they hired someone externally, Alain Brouillette, on June 17, 1997.\n[202] The witness stated that Daniel Lemieux was notified that he had obtained the position. However, he withdrew, with the result that one installer\/repairman position was still not filled. Therefore, a second review of the candidates was conducted along with Serge Faubert and the witness. She stated that she stressed to Serge Faubert that the Complainant had basic knowledge, that he should be given a chance and that it would, at any rate, be a probationary period for the position and that he could always be put back on the callback list as a splicer if he were unable to meet the requirements of the installer\/repairman position.\n[203] The witness stated that it was eventually decided to award the installer\/repairman position to the Complainant, which he accepted on July 22, 1996, with a start date of August 6, 1996.\n(vii) Richard Leblanc [204] Richard Leblanc has been an employee at T\u00e9l\u00e9bec in Val-d'Or since 1990 as Manager of Access Network Management. His responsibilities include analyzing the sectors that T\u00e9l\u00e9bec serves in order to ensure that network capacity meets customer needs and to ensure network security. His responsibilities also include designing plans for new projects.\n[205] He stated that, in the fall of 1997, he was the project leader for a six-month project in Chibougamau involving the replacement of an obsolete, congested network. The work was assigned to a subcontractor. There was approximately four to six weeks of cable-splicing work that had to be done by a splicer. A request for this was sent to the Human Resources Department (Exhibit I-18) and the Complainant was temporarily called back to work for the scheduled period (Exhibit P-28).\n[206] Richard Leblanc recalled that, around the end of November 1997, Pierre Bergeron contacted him to find out whether his temporary position would indeed be over at the end of the six-week period. The witness contacted his immediate supervisor, Yvon Hall\u00e9, to suggest keeping the Complainant at work to help the subcontractor. Yvon Hall\u00e9 decided to keep Pierre Bergeron on the job until December 24, 1997. The witness informed the Complainant of this decision, which he was apparently satisfied with. This employment extension was not confirmed in writing with the Complainant.\n[207] Richard Leblanc recalled that Pierre Bergeron's employment conditions stipulated that, after 10 consecutive days of work, he had to take four consecutive days off. Pierre Bergeron told him that he would be in Chibougamau from December 1 to 24, 1997. Richard Leblanc told him that if he intended to stay in Chibougamau, he would have to respect the days-off condition.\n[208] The witness stated, contrary to the Complainant's claims, that he had not told him that his employment extension was for an indefinite period because he did not have the authority to make such a decision and that he was complying with instructions from his immediate supervisor, Yvon Hall\u00e9.\n[209] Richard Leblanc recalled that, on December 9, 1997, he received a telephone call from Pierre Bergeron informing him of his hospitalization in Chibougamau; he asked why he was hospitalized. The Complainant told him that he was not injured, but did not provide further details.\n[210] The witness contacted Lyne Doroftei in the Industrial Relations Department to find out the procedure to follow in those circumstances, particularly since the Complainant's employment was to end on December 24, 1997. She asked him to send her, by email, the information regarding the agreements with the Complainant and the date his employment would end, which the witness did on December 10, 1997 (Exhibit I-12). She also told him that he would be issued a layoff notice so that he could forward it to the Complainant right away (Exhibit P-30).\n[211] After receiving and signing the document, the witness learned that Alain Rivard was going to Chibougamau and asked him to go see the Complainant in the hospital to issue him the layoff notice. The witness specified that the quality of the Complainant's work as a splicer, while under his responsibility, was very good and that he did not end his employment because of his health conditions.\nIII. THE ACT [212] Section 7 of the Act stipulates that directly or indirectly to refuse to employ or continue to employ an individual or differentiate adversely in relation to that individual in the course of employment is a discriminatory practice if it is based on a prohibited ground. Section 3 of the Act specifies that disability is a prohibited ground.\n[213] Section 14 (1) of the Act provides that harassing an individual in the course of employment is a discriminatory practice if it is based on a prohibited ground.\nIV. BURDEN OF PROOF [214] The Supreme Court's decision in O'Malley1 established that it is first the Complainant's responsibility to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the Complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the Respondent.\nV. ANALYSIS A. Was the Complainant adversely differentiated against in the course of employment because of a disability (depression)? (i) Layoff on December 6, 1995 [215] The evidence shows that the Complainant had held a position as a splicer with the Respondent since 1990. On November 20, 1995, he was notified of his layoff effective December 6, 1995. His name was placed on a callback list. The collective agreement gave him recall rights for 24 months following his layoff.\n[216] The Complainant maintained that the Respondent did not allow him to exercise his bumping rights and stay employed. The evidence shows that the Complainant's claim was unwarranted. In fact, the Complainant's seniority did not allow him to exercise his bumping rights. It should be pointed out that, due to not being able to exercise his bumping rights, the Complainant filed a grievance to assert that right, but the Teamsters Union later withdrew the grievance.\n[217] The Complainant suggested that his layoff in December 1995 and his inability to exercise his bumping rights made him feel insecure and fearful of losing his job for good, which were the cause of his depression in August 1996. The evidence shows that at the end of 1995 the Respondent undertook a major administrative reorganization of the company, which resulted in many layoffs. Indications are that the Complainant, who had had steady employment with the Respondent for over nine years, was affected by a shortage of work and that he feared for the future of his employment with the Respondent. However, the Complainant did not submit any evidence demonstrating that he had any disability at all during his layoff starting December 6, 1995, except that he had experienced depression 11 years earlier.\n[218] Without dismissing the Complainant's claim that the events he experienced caused his depression in August 1996, it remains that there is no evidence leading to a conclusion that the Complainant was laid off because of a disability.\n(ii) Layoff on January 24, 1997 [219] The Complainant started back to work on December 2, 1996 following a sick leave for depression that arose in August 1996. He believed that the Respondent laid him off because of his health condition.\n[220] The evidence shows that, after he was laid off, the Complainant was temporarily called back to work successively, to his splicer or lineman position, as of March 26, 1996. The evidence also shows that on May 7, 1996, the Respondent posted two installer\/repairman positions in Val-d'Or and that the Complainant and four other employees applied.\n[221] Recall that the Complainant performed the duties of an installer\/repairman when he was first hired on May 7, 1987 until April 23, 1990, when he obtained a splicer position.\n[222] The evidence shows that, at that time, most of the work of an installer\/repairman was done in the residential sector. It involved running service wires from poles to residences and installing wires in the residence to give access to the telephone set connections. The installer\/repairman would deliver the telephone sets to customers. Repairs involved checking the resistance on the telephone line and the condition of the ground. Installer\/repairmen were used only occasionally in the business sector. The work was limited to cabling to allow the installation of small telephone systems and doing programming using predetermined fixed registers.\n[223] The evidence reveals that, in the business sector starting in 1992, the advent of the microprocessor led to numerous telephone systems with a greatly expanded programming language enabling phones to provide customers with enhanced services. Video-conferencing and the Internet then came on the scene. As a result, programming required installer\/repairmen to be analysts. They also had to be in constant contact with customers to determine their needs and sell them equipment geared to those needs. The work of installer\/repairmen was becoming less required in the residential sector because the network had been upgraded. Repairs and new system installations were therefore less frequent.\n[224] The evidence shows that the posting for the installer\/repairman positions included a description of the minimum requirements. The Complainant acknowledged that he did not meet some of the requirements, such as basic data transmission knowledge. Regarding the requirement for knowledge of various products and maintenance services (Norstar series and others) that was an asset, he admitted that he was not familiar with the company's products on the market at that time because he had installed only one Norstar system when he was an installer\/repairman. As to the requirement for knowledge of programming principles, the Complainant stated that he did not know much about programming principles. Regarding the requirement for being able to transact and communicate with customers, the Complainant acknowledged that in his work as an installer\/repairman, he rarely had had to transact and communicate with customers.\n[225] The evidence revealed that, after receiving the applications from employees interested in the installer\/repairman positions, Jos\u00e9e Ferron, Human Resources Manager at that time, interviewed each candidate to evaluate their qualifications and skills for the positions. Jos\u00e9e Ferron conducted a telephone interview with the Complainant and afterwards came to the conclusion that the Complainant lacked leadership and motivation and that his level of technical knowledge was not very high. She prepared an evaluation of each candidate and sent them to Manager Serge Faubert and supervisor, either Alain Rivard or Claude Mayrand. One employee application was selected and, for the second position, a new employee was hired. However, the selected applicant withdrew. After a second review, it was agreed that the Complainant would be awarded the position, which he accepted.\n[226] The evidence shows that the Complainant started his new job on August 2, 1996 but that he had to be away from work on August 10, 1996 due to major depression.\n[227] The evidence shows that Dr. Cond\u00e9, the Respondent's medical consultant, met with the Complainant several times. At the first meeting with the Complainant, Dr. Cond\u00e9 noted that, according to his attending physician's diagnosis, he was suffering from major depression brought on by a change in his level of employment, a move, and the loss of a loved one, namely his dog. He recommended that the patient continue psychotherapy. He saw the patient again on October 31, 1996, who informed him that he was feeling better and less tired. The Complainant felt physically more capable. Dr. Cond\u00e9 learned from the patient that he no longer cried or had sadness or suicidal thoughts. He concluded that the patient's condition had improved. Dr. Cond\u00e9 saw the Complainant again on November 26, 1996 to review the possibility of him returning to work. After learning from the Complainant that he was doing fine, that his morale was good, that he was in good spirits, and that his energy had increased, Dr. Cond\u00e9 believed that the patient's condition had sufficiently improved that he could approve his physician's recommendation for the patient to return to work gradually with no restrictions as of December 2, 1996.\n[228] The evidence shows that the Complainant started work as an installer\/repairman in Val-d'Or on December 2, 1996. His immediate supervisor was Alain Rivard and, in his absence, Claude Mayrand. He returned to work gradually, starting with two consecutive days that week. He was assigned to transferring lines in Senneterre and was then assigned to T\u00e9l\u00e9bec Mobilit\u00e9 to help an installer\/repairman with the installation of a 032 telephone system.\n[229] The evidence reveals that, during the week of December 9, 1996, the Complainant was to work three non-consecutive days, but that he worked only two. His immediate supervisor, Alain Rivard, tasked him with installing a Norstar telephone system at the Brasserie La P\u00e9pie. While the Complainant was installing this system, Alain Rivard went to the work site and learned from the customer that the Complainant was having problems with programming, that he had told her it was not his area. She was concerned that the deadline for the work would not be met.\n[230] The evidence unquestionably shows that Alain Rivard met with the Complainant to discuss the situation and that the Complainant told him he did not want to work as an installer\/repairman because he preferred being a splicer. In light of these facts, Alain Rivard decided to assign the Complainant some less demanding work. He assigned him to work with two other installer\/repairmen, including a union representative, at Aub\u00e9 Pontiac Buick.\n[231] The evidence shows that, at that meeting, the Complainant told Alain Rivard about his health condition. Alain Rivard pointed out to the Complainant that there was nothing indicating to him that there were any restrictions on his ability to do the work required and that he had to comply.\n[232] The evidence reveals that, to make the task easier for the Complainant, Alain Rivard assigned him some work with two other installer\/repairmen for refitting some wiring with wire covers at Val-d'Or Performance. Once again, Alain Rivard was informed that the quality of the Complainant's work left something to be desired.\n[233] The evidence shows that the Complainant worked on December 16, 18 and 20, 1996. During the week of December 16, 1996, the Complainant asked permission to be away from work on December 23 and 24, 1996, which he was not granted because the need for staff did not allow for it prior to the holidays.\n[234] The evidence shows that on December 20, 1996, at the end of the day, the Complainant felt exhausted and on the verge of tears. He told the secretary that he was leaving work. He partied over the weekend and was unable to come into work on December 23 and 24, 1996 due to gastro-enteritis.\n[235] The evidence shows that the Complainant went to work on January 6, 1997. Alain Rivard, again trying to help the Complainant, assigned him some pre-wiring work in a government building for a 4:00 p.m.-to-midnight shift.\n[236] The evidence shows that, on January 7, 1997, the Complainant was called to a meeting with his immediate supervisors Claude Mayrand and Alain Rivard. He was criticized for leaving work on December 20, 1996 without informing his immediate supervisor. He was also criticized for being away from work on December 23, 1996 by taking unauthorized vacation while being away due to illness. He was also told that, even though he had been given relatively easy tasks, his productivity still left something to be desired.\n[237] The evidence reveals that, during the week of January 6, 1997, the quality of the pre-wiring work was good but that his productivity was still poor.\n[238] The evidence shows that, on January 8, 1997, Alain Rivard and Claude Mayrand met with the Director Serge Faubert to inform him of their concerns about the Complainant. After thoroughly reviewing the situation, Alain Rivard concluded that the Complainant was unable to perform the installer\/repairman duties.\n[239] The evidence shows that, after obtaining a posted installer\/repairman position, the Complainant was on a probationary period pursuant to clause 13.10 of the collective agreement, which provides that [translation] if the employee does not demonstrate the ability to perform the new duties in accordance with company standards within 120 days following the promotion or transfer, the employee shall return to his\/her prior position and location .... During that period, the employer can terminate the probationary period if it concludes that the employee cannot meet the normal requirements of the work.\n[240] The evidence shows that on January 10, 1997, the Respondent informed the Complainant that he would be laid off as of January 24, 1997 on the grounds that, during his time as an installer\/repairman, he failed to demonstrate the ability to perform his new duties in accordance with the required standards. The Complainant was returned to the callback list as a splicer with recall rights for 24 months.\n[241] The evidence shows that the Complainant challenged his layoff by filing a grievance that was subsequently withdrawn by the Teamsters Union. After the grievance was filed, the grievance committee met and the minutes for the discussion were prepared (Exhibit P-65). The Complainant stated that he had applied for the installer\/repairman position not because he was interested in the job, but solely to obtain work.\n[242] The evidence shows that the Complainant met with Dr. Cond\u00e9 on December 17, 1996 for a follow-up examination. He informed the physician that he felt physically ready to increase his time at work and his performance. He stated that his morale was good and that he had no depression symptoms, crying or sadness. Dr. Cond\u00e9 was of the view that the Complainant's condition had further improved and that he had no symptoms of depression. At his request, Dr. Cond\u00e9 saw the Complainant on January 14, 1997, and the Complainant told him that he had been laid off due to lack of experience and inability to do the work. Dr. Cond\u00e9 noted that the Complainant accepted the situation calmly and barely cried. He issued a diagnosis that the Complainant had recovered from his depression.\n[243] When he returned to work on December 2, 1996, the Complainant already had previous experience as an installer\/repairman. To help the Complainant become familiar with his new position, the Respondent assigned him some simple work installing a telephone system in the business sector. The work was not completed within the time frame normally allotted for that type of work. The Complainant was unable to do the programming and his customer interaction was weak. The Respondent assigned the Complainant some basic installer\/repairman tasks, specifically cable pre-wiring, and the productivity standards were not met. Even though the work was simple, the Complainant's productivity did not improve.\n[244] The Complainant's first obligation was to perform his work, even part time, to the satisfaction of the Respondent. I believe that, despite the fact that the Respondent gave him work involving basic tasks for an installer\/repairman, the Complainant, who had applied for the position in order to have steady work and who, by his own admission, did not like that type of work, failed to demonstrate the ability to perform the duties of an installer\/repairman. The Respondent was justified in terminating the Complainant's probationary period for the installer\/repairman position and placing him on the callback list as a splicer.\n[245] Moreover, I believe that the disability, namely the Complainant's depression, was not a determinant in the Respondent's decision-making. As such, I accept Dr. Cond\u00e9's unchallenged testimony that the Complainant was fit to return to work gradually with no restrictions. In addition, when the Respondent decided to terminate the Complainant's probationary period for the installer\/repairman position, he was not experiencing any depression symptoms and was completely recovered. I therefore conclude, based on the evidence on this aspect of the case, that the Complainant has failed to demonstrate that his layoff on January 24, 1997 was due to disability, namely depression.\n(iii) Layoffs in 1997 [246] The Complainant maintained that in 1997 he was temporarily called back and laid off several times. According to him, the Respondent wanted him to quit his job and acted knowing full well that he could not refuse a callback without risking his job. In addition, the Complainant claimed that, during the times he was called back, he was under specific working conditions that were not in accordance with those in the collective agreement that apply to permanent employees. As such, he believes that he was treated differently than permanent employees.\n[247] The evidence shows that, at the end of 1995, the Respondent had to lay off many people. Some employees were placed on a callback list for 24 months from the date of their layoff. To reduce operating costs, the Respondent decided to resort to subcontracting. In light of this situation, the Teamsters Union and the Respondent, through letters of understanding, arranged specific working conditions for laid-off employees to enable it to call these employees back to work temporarily for various projects instead of subcontracting out the work.\n[248] The evidence shows that the Complainant and all employees on the callback list were affected by the specific working conditions in the letters of understanding.\n[249] The preponderance of the evidence indicates that employees on the callback list who would state that they were not available for being called back to work would not lose their jobs and would remain on the callback list.\n[250] The evidence shows, by the Complainant's own admission, that each time he was called back, he accepted the specific employment conditions involved and did not file any grievances.\n[251] The evidence shows that, when the Complainant was called back for the splicer position, the Respondent was only complying with the provisions of the collective agreement with respect to calling back laid-off employees on the basis of their seniority and ability to carry out the work required.\n[252] Based on the evidence submitted, I am not satisfied that the Complainant's layoffs and callbacks for temporary jobs by the Respondent was to encourage him to quit his job. On the contrary: the Respondent called the Complainant back to work in accordance with the provisions of the collective agreement with respect to calling back laid-off employees. If it had acted otherwise, it would have interfered with the Complainant's rights. Moreover, since the specific working conditions affected all employees on the callback list, he was not treated differently, because he was one of the employees on that callback list.\n(iv) Layoff on December 24, 1997 [253] The Complainant argued that the Respondent decided to lay him off on December 24, 1997 because of his health condition, namely depression.\n[254] The evidence shows that the Complainant accepted a temporary callback as a splicer in Chibougamau starting October 20, 1997 for a period of four to six weeks.\n[255] The Complainant maintained that, at the end of November 1997, his immediate supervisor informed him that his job would be extended for an indefinite period of time. However, the Complainant's immediate supervisor stated instead that he had informed the Complainant that his job would end on December 24, 1997.\n[256] The evidence reveals that, at the beginning of December 1997, the Complainant started feeling depression symptoms again. He consulted a physician in Chibougamau, who prescribed Paxil for him. He had to be hospitalized in Chibougamau on December 9, 10 and 11, 1997 due to a bad reaction to the medication, and on December 11, 1997, he again met with the physician in Chibougamau, who issued a medical certificate with a diagnosis of depression. While in the hospital, the Complainant notified his immediate supervisor but did not specify the reason for his hospitalization.\n[257] The Complainant's immediate supervisor contacted the Industrial Relations Department to determine the procedure to follow, given that the Complainant's job was to end on December 24, 1997. He sent a memo to that department indicating that he had informed the Complainant of his layoff effective December 24, 1997. A layoff notice for the Complainant was prepared on December 10, 1997, and Alain Rivard issued it to him that same day at the Chibougamau hospital.\n[258] The evidence on this leads me to conclude that the Complainant's health condition was not a determinant in the Respondent's decision to end the Complainant's job on December 24, 1997. I accept the version from the Complainant's immediate supervisor, rather than the Complainant's version, that his layoff was effective December 24, 1997. Moreover, it is clear that, at the time that the Respondent notified the Complainant of his layoff, in other words December 10, 1997, it was unaware of the Complainant's depressed condition.\nB. Was the Complainant harassed by the Respondents in the course of employment because of his disability (depression)? [259] Under section 14 (1) (c) of the Act, harassing an individual in the course of employment is a discriminatory practice when based on a prohibited ground. According to the provisions in section 3 (1) of the Act, disability is a prohibited ground.\n[260] The Quebec Human Rights Commission defines harassment in the workplace as follows:\n[translation]\n\"Conduct manifested through repeated words, actions, gestures, etc. that are vexatious or demeaning and directed at another person or group of people for any of the grounds listed in section 10 of the Charter. The harassment of an individual may involve race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, handicap, etc. 2\n[261] The Tribunal must determine the seriousness of the inappropriate behaviour. In Dhanjal, the Tribunal specified that:\n...the seriousness of allegedly harassing conduct must be assessed not according to the criterion and perspective of the `'reasonable person'', who would necessarily be a person belonging to the racial majority, but rather according to the criterion and perspective of the `'reasonable victim''.\n[262] The Tribunal added:\nMoreover, while the subjective test of the complainant's perception, according to his or her own personality and sensitivity, is relevant and necessary, this is so only at the stage of assessing the actual harm caused to the victim and the damages that result... (3)\n[263] The Tribunal must also determine the repetitiveness of the inappropriate behaviour. In Commission Scolaire des Deux-Montagnes, the Tribunal said the following in that regard:\n[translation]\n\"The durability that the vexatious conduct must also have, to constitute harassment, can therefore be established based on the repetitiveness or seriousness of certain actions, to the extent that their effect has a lasting impact.\"4\n[264] The Complainant was absent from work on August 10, 1996 due to illness. During the following week, Claude Mayrand, a representative of the Respondent, visited him at his residence to give him the medical form that he was to have his attending physician fill out. The Complainant's position is that the Respondent's real purpose for that visit was to ensure that he was indeed sick, which he considered harassment.\n[265] I cannot accept the Complainant's position. In fact, any employee who expects to be absent from work due to illness for eight days or more must use a medical form, duly filled out by his\/her attending physician, to inform the employer of the nature of his\/her illness and how long he\/she will be away from work. I do not believe that a reasonable victim would consider the action by the Respondent's representative as harassment.\n[266] The Complainant suggested that the Respondent's representative's driving by his residence repeatedly between August 10, 1996 and December 2, 1996, to visit his father and sister constituted harassment. I do not believe that the Respondent's representative's actions, although repetitive, can be considered vexatious and demeaning and sufficient to cause a reasonable victim to conclude that he\/she was harassed.\n[267] Specifically regarding Alain Rivard, the Complainant maintained that the latter discriminated against him by writing phoney letters of reprimand and placing them in his file unbeknownst to him. The only document produced in support of that allegation was a memo from Claude Mayrand to Alain Rivard describing the circumstances of the Complainant's leaving work on December 20, 1996 and his absence on December 23, 1996. However, he admitted that he never officially received any written reprimands from the Respondents. I conclude from this that this allegation of harassment is completely groundless.\n[268] The Complainant also maintained that, during his part-time employment between December 2, 1996 and January 24, 1997, he was the victim of harassment because of his health condition from Claude Mayrand and Alain Rivard. The alleged harassment occurred during frequent meetings with the Respondent's two representatives in the form of unwarranted rows intended to crush and humiliate him. The preponderance of evidence shows that, during those meetings, the Respondent's two representatives did indeed inform the Complainant, as required, that they were not satisfied with his conduct on December 20 and 23, 1996. Moreover, during that period, according to Dr. Cond\u00e9's unchallenged testimony, which I believe is completely credible, the Complainant had virtually recovered from his depression and no longer had a disability.\n[269] The preponderance of evidence is also such that the meetings in question did not end with the Complainant crying, as he stated. If that had been the case, he would surely have brought it up during his appointments with Dr. Cond\u00e9 on December 17, 1996 and January 14, 1997. The opposite was true, however, because the Complainant stated to him on December 17, 1996 that his morale was excellent, he was not crying or sad, and during the January 14, 1997 visit, he told Dr. Cond\u00e9 that he accepted the notification of his layoff calmly and cried only a bit.\n[270] I conclude from this that the words that Claude Mayrand and Alain Rivard exchanged with the Complainant from December 2, 1996 to January 24, 1997 do not constitute harassment of the Complainant because of a disability.\nVI. CONCLUSION [271] I believe that the Complainant has failed to discharge his burden of establishing a prima facie case that:\nT\u00e9l\u00e9bec Limit\u00e9e discriminated against him by treating him in an adversely differential manner in the course of his employment because of his disability, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[272] T\u00e9l\u00e9bec Limit\u00e9e discriminated against him by refusing to provide him with a harassment-free workplace because of his disability, contrary to section 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[273] Alain Rivard discriminated against him by harassing him in the course of his employment because of his disability, contrary to section 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nTHEREFORE:\nThe complaints are dismissed.\nRoger Doyon\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nMay 21, 2004\n1Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v.

Grant Sinclair, Chair Pierre Deschamps, Member 2004 CHRT 18 2004\/06\/01\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] CEP asserts the existence of a litigation privilege with respect to two documents.\n[2] Document 1 is a seven page document containing pages 1 to 6 and page 8. This document bears the heading Discussion Elizabeth Millar, May 25 and 28th. Pages 5 and 6 have been produced and entered as Exhibit R-269. Exhibit R-270 is probably page 7 of Document 1. This is not certain. CEP has not produced pages 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 of Document 1 claiming litigation privilege.\n[3] Document 2 (Document 382 of CEP disclosure) is an agenda for an August 27th meeting. On the front side of page 1, there are handwritten notes presumed to be written by Fred Pomeroy. The handwritten notes are cont'd over on to the flip side of page 1. Document 2 has been produced to Bell except for the flip side of page 1. CEP claims litigation privilege on the cont'd over notes.\nII. LAW [4] For CEP to succeed in its claim for litigation privilege, CEP must satisfy the following tests:\nthe communication must have been produced with litigation in mind; the communication must have been produced for the dominant purpose of receiving legal advice or as an aid to the conduct of litigation; prospect of litigation must be reasonable.\nIII. RULING A. Document 1 [5] Pages 5, 6 and 7 have been produced and tendered in evidence. Ms. Blackstaffe has been cross-examined on those exhibits. The transcript shows that she links these pages to Mr. Ranger's assessment of the Manitoba Pay Equity Study. The evidence now shows that pages 5, 6 and 7, are in fact related to a discussion that Ms. Elizabeth Millar and Ms. Blackstaffe had on May 25 and May 28 and have nothing to do with Mr. Ranger's assessment of the Manitoba study.\n[6] The question is whether CEP by disclosing part of the document has waived any privilege claim to the remainder. In our opinion and supported by law, whether intended or not, waiver may also occur if fairness requires it. CEP has disclosed part of Document 1. Bell has conducted its cross-examination on the understanding that this was the whole of the document. This is not the case and the context is incomplete. Having received part of the document, fairness requires that Bell receive the whole of the document.\n[7] Further, Document 1 reflects Ms. Millar's views as to pay equity, job evaluation, points, the use of the Manitoba study, the filing of complaints. It does not appear that the document was created for the dominant purpose of receiving legal advice or as an aide to the conduct of litigation. Nor does the evidence or arguments of CEP convince us that the document was produced with litigation in mind.\nB. Document 2 [8] As for Document 2, the Tribunal also finds that CEP's assertion of privilege is ill-founded. It does not satisfy the tests for litigation privilege.\n[9] The handwritten notes are personal notes or observations written down by, it is assumed, Fred Pomeroy. We are not satisfied that these notes are a communication by Mr. Pomeroy or are the result of any communication received by Mr. Pomeroy for the purpose of receiving legal advice or as an aid to litigation.\n[10] Accordingly, CEP must produce to Bell the disputed pages relating to Document 1 and Document 2.\nSigned by J.

THE LAW\nIV. ANALYSIS\nV. CONCLUSION\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Marc Genest was an employee of Bell Mobility in June 1995 when a new group insurance plan for employees came into effect. The Complainant, who is homosexual, claimed that the Respondent denied him the right to purchase life insurance for his same-sex spouse. Marc Genest believes that, in doing so, Bell Mobility discriminated against him by treating him in an adverse fashion in the course of employment because of his sexual orientation (homosexual) and marital status (same-sex relationship) contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act).\nII. EVIDENCE A. Complainant's evidence (i) Marc Genest [2] Marc Genest was hired by Bell Mobility in March 1994 as a full-time temporary employee. He held a position at 1425 Trans-Canada Highway, Dorval. He achieved permanent part-time status on June 28, 1995.\n[3] He was part of a group of about 30 employees assigned as customer service representatives under the supervision of Karine Mariasine. The customer service department occupied one part of a floor in the building and was divided into workstations in small cubicles. Another part of the floor was occupied by about 12 employees in the collections department. Executives occupied the offices near the employee work areas. The ground floor was occupied by the human resources department and administration department. Approximately 80 people working for Bell Mobility were in this building. About 30 of them had disclosed their sexual orientation, but it was not a subject that was discussed. He therefore did not reveal his orientation except for one instance under very specific circumstances. In April 1994, he was in training for a month under an instructor. He had been very upset after his partner was involved in a car accident, and he confided in his instructor.\n[4] Marc Genest related that in 1995 he had been in a relationship with a spouse of the same gender for almost eight years.\n[5] After becoming a permanent employee in June 1995, his employer gave him a brochure with information on the group insurance plan for Bell Mobility employees and instructed him to indicate his insurance selections by filling out the insurance options form attached to the brochure and send it to the human resources department via internal mail. He stated that he did not recall whether information sessions were given to employees for explaining the group insurance plan to them.\n[6] After reviewing the brochure, Marc Genest believed that it provided no information on purchasing life insurance for same-sex spouses.\n[7] He therefore made an appointment with Lucie Laroche in the human resources department to obtain more information and complete the insurance options form (Exhibit P-4) to make sure he was making well-informed selections. That meeting was held in Lucie Laroche's office around 11:00 a.m. on August 28, 1995.\n[8] The witness stated that he informed Lucie Laroche that he had a spouse of the same sex and that he did not understand why the group insurance plan allowed an employee to insure his\/her same-sex spouse for accidental death and dismemberment but not for life insurance. At the witness's request, Lucie Laroche told him that she had been living with her husband for four years. He retorted that it was unthinkable that after only four years of living together she could purchase life insurance for him when he himself, despite living with his partner for over seven years, could not do so. Lucie Laroche listened carefully to his arguments, but told him that he could not obtain life insurance for his spouse because he was living with a same-sex spouse.\n[9] He recalled that Lucie Laroche told him that he could inform his supervisor, Karine Mariasine, about his complaints. She told him that nothing could be done to rectify the situation and to talk about it to Sylvie Sauv\u00e9, who was also a supervisor. The latter told him that she did not have the same problem as he had because in her case her female partner was also a Bell Mobility employee, which allowed her to be a beneficiary of her partner's life insurance and vice versa. Marc Genest realized that he could not enjoy the same prerogatives as his supervisor because his partner was not a Bell Mobility employee. Even though he believed he was being adversely differentiated against, he did not pursue the matter for fear of losing his job, which had only just recently become permanent.\n[10] Marc Genest explained the selections he made when filling out his insurance options form (Exhibit P-4). Some of the options he selected were paid by the employer and the rest by him. He decided to become a member of the health insurance plan for himself alone because he did not see the need to register his spouse as well, who did not have the privilege of group insurance.\n[11] The Complainant decided to take dental insurance for both himself and his partner. He selected the life insurance option for himself that represented twice his annual salary. He acknowledged that he designated his mother as the beneficiary of that insurance. The Complainant selected accidental death and dismemberment insurance (AD&D) for himself at the rate of five times his annual salary. Since his partner had been in a serious car accident in 1994 without being injured and that his work as real estate broker required the constant use of his vehicle, the Complainant selected AD&D for his spouse in the amount of $200,000. He felt that, in the event of the accidental death of his spouse, this amount would allow him to deal with the financial consequences with no problem. Finally, the Complainant purchased long-term disability insurance. This option was not available to his partner.\n[12] Marc Genest also indicated his partner as a dependant on the form. When he finished filling out the options form, he sent it via internal mail to the human resources department, which sent the Complainant a confirmation sheet (Exhibit P-6) showing that his insurance plan matched the options he had selected for the period of June 29, 1995 to May 31, 1996. The witness stated that he did not recall renewing these insurance benefits in 1996 and 1997 because his insurance options stayed the same.\n[13] The witness stated that, at that time, his spouse had $50,000 in life insurance, for which he was the beneficiary. He wanted to purchase life insurance for his spouse for the maximum amount provided for by the group insurance plan to ensure his financial security in the event of his spouse's death.\n[14] Marc Genest related that in 1997 his spouse, employed by Royal Lepage as a real estate broker, lost his employee status when he became self-employed. On the due date for paying his $800 life insurance premium, his spouse could not meet this obligation. His spouse's father agreed to pay the premium, provided that he would be made the beneficiary of the policy. His spouse's father became the beneficiary of the policy.\n[15] The witness mentioned that his spouse's father, an Egyptian, never accepted his son's homosexuality.\n[16] The witness stated that between August 28, 1995, when he met with Lucie Laroche, and June 15, 1998, the employer did not provide its employees with any information on the group insurance plan or information sessions to explain changes to the group insurance plan. The Complainant, for his part, acknowledged that he had no discussions during that time with Lucie Laroche dealing with the situation.\n[17] Marc Genest recalled that on June 15, 1998 Lucie Laroche held an information session to explain to employees the changes to the group insurance plan. She stated that same-sex spouses were now eligible for all insurance options in the group insurance plan. The Complainant publicly stated [translation] What happens to me now that my spouse is dead? (Volume 1, page 127). Lucie Laroche replied that he could find consolation in the fact his struggles would benefit other employees in the same situation.\n[18] After his spouse died on February 16, 1998, he told Lucie Laroche about it. He was very surprised that she told him on the spot that his spouse had no life insurance coverage. She then informed him that he would have three days of bereavement leave.\n[19] Marc Genest was asked to review the group insurance contract with Aetna Canada (1995) for Bell Mobility employees (Exhibit P-2) and an excerpt from that contract (Exhibit P- 3). He stated that he had never seen them before.\n[20] The witness was affected by the death of his partner and had great difficulty doing his work; he felt a pressing need for psychological help. He asked the human resources department to provide him with the services of a psychologist through the employee assistance program (EAP) set up by the company and to which employees financially contributed. It was not until a year later that he was able to meet with a psychologist, who was of no help.\n[21] Marc Genest stated that starting in March or April 1998, after his spouse's death, he increased his requests to Angello Santullo of the human resources department for a copy of the group insurance contract. He told him that he did not have a copy of the contract. Then in September 2000, he contacted Julie Walbrecq, also in human resources, but his efforts were again unsuccessful. The document in question was obtained through the inquiry in connection with this complaint.\n[22] Marc Genest was renting a house in \u00cele Perrot with his spouse. They were joint owners of a sailboat. The Complainant owned his vehicle while his spouse used a rental vehicle. Through his work as a real estate broker, his spouse had a net annual income of approximately $70,000. However, the witness recalled that, as of July 1997, his spouse slowed his pace of work due to fatigue and a drop in the real estate market. The Complainant stated that his spouse previously had excellent health. Although not a serious athlete, he sailed and went dancing three times a week. He expended a great deal of energy at work. In September 1997, after his spouse returned from a trip to Florida, he noticed that his spouse was again affected by fatigue. He advised him to see the doctor, but he did not go. He was no longer working and his health was deteriorating; his weakened state required him to be hospitalized on October 27, 1997 at the Montreal General Hospital. After numerous examinations, his spouse was diagnosed HIV-positive. He was able to leave the hospital for the Christmas holidays and was then admitted to a home-care centre and passed away on February 16, 1998.\n[23] Marc Genest disclosed that during his spouse's illness he himself had to cover all the expenses that they had formerly shared, including the housing expenses, and be away from work for six weeks. In addition, even though it was not recommended, he obtained some marijuana to stimulate his spouse's appetite. At the time of his spouse's death, his financial situation was shaky and everything worsened after his death. He had to use the $5,000 line of credit he had obtained. He put $20,000 on credit cards. He had to pay $4,000 to clear his spouse's debt. His mother advanced him $8,000, which he has not repaid. He had an annual income of approximately $23,500. In addition to the trauma of losing his spouse, Marc Genest stated that the weight of his financial obligations caused him a great deal of stress and anxiety. The Complainant stayed in the residence he had shared with his spouse in Plateau Mont-Royal until July 1999 because he could not bring himself to deal with it any sooner. He rented an apartment for $700 a month plus heat. In August 2001, he rented a less expensive apartment and in 2002 his financial situation forced him to rent a room in a friend's home for three months. When he returned to work in October 2002, he rented an apartment for $550 a month.\n[24] In October 1998, he suffered hyperventilation, which required him to be hospitalized for a day and be away from work for several weeks. In October 1999, he suffered severe depression resulting from incomplete mourning. This required him to be away from work for several weeks.\n[25] Marc Genest quit his job with Bell Mobility in February 2001 and was unemployed for one year. He had to liquidate all his assets to provide for his needs. He started working again in the fall of 2002 as a representative with a trust company with yearly earnings of $28,000. The Complainant had gone to school for tourism, specifically as a travel agent and tour guide. He also had training as a real estate agent and broker.\n[26] The witness stated that he was unaware that a life insurance beneficiary must claim the benefit within six months after the death of the insured.\n[27] In an email to Julie Walbrecq (Exhibit I-1, Tab 7) on September 11, 2000, the witness wrote that the information meeting in 1998 attended by about 20 people was led by Genevi\u00e8ve Britt from the human resources department. The purpose of that meeting was to inform employees of changes made to the group insurance plan.\n[28] The Complainant acknowledged that on September 26, 2000 he sent a letter to the Canadian Human Rights Commission. He wrote that his not being able to purchase life insurance for his spouse in 1995 was overt discrimination. In his testimony, he maintained that he had complained to Lucie Laroche, Karine Mariasine and Sylvie Sauv\u00e9, but conceded that he did not use the term overt discrimination. He stated that he had indicated that the situation he was faced with made no sense at all and was unfair.\n[29] Marc Genest sent Aetna Canada a formal notice on February 15, 2001 (Exhibit I-1, Tab 9) in which he claimed payment of $20,000 due to the death of his spouse on February 16, 1998. He claimed that the $20,000 he was claiming was the basic life insurance amount. He sent this formal notice because, despite repeated requests, he was unable to obtain a copy of the group insurance contract.\n[30] On April 29, 2002, the witness communicated his version of the facts in writing to the Canadian Human Rights Commission. He said that, during his meeting with Lucie Laroche in August 1995, she had put an X on the page dealing with life insurance in the brochure explaining the group insurance plan.\n[31] He added that Lucie Laroche had told him that basic life insurance coverage for a spouse of the opposite sex was $20,000, which could be increased by paying additional premiums. However, this was not available to him under the circumstances.\n[32] In that same document, the Complainant revealed that in the fall of 1999, during a meeting with Genevi\u00e8ve Britt, Director of Human Resources, she indicated to him that in 1995 it would have possible to insure his spouse's life. It simply involved identifying him with his last name and the feminine version of his spouse's first name.\n[33] At that same meeting, he informed Genevi\u00e8ve Britt that he needed help because he was depressed and felt discouraged by life. Genevi\u00e8ve Britt referred him to a psychologist who told him he should go directly to emergency at the hospital. He refused to go because he did not believe that the psychologist's recommendation was valid. He did not consider it appropriate to keep going back to someone in the human resources department to use the employee assistance program.\n[34] In that document, Marc Genest stated that his partner was a member of a health insurance plan through his employer. He conceded in cross-examination that that was not the case. The witness stated that the explanatory brochure about the group insurance plan defined the word spouse without distinction as to same-sex spouses.\n[35] The witness stated that in 1995 Bell Mobility employees generally did not publicly acknowledge their sexual orientation for fear of offending people or jeopardizing their chances for promotion. He claimed that, at that time, only three out of the 30 customer service representatives were homosexual. He denied that homosexual people joked about homosexuals, even during small theatre performances at social evenings.\n[36] In cross-examination, the Complainant acknowledged that his partner's annual income, which he had confirmed as being around $70,000 net, had instead been approximately $40,000 gross for each of 1995 and 1996 and lower in 1997. He believed that, during those years, his and his partner's financial situations were good. In cross-examination, he conceded that his partner had filed an assignment in December 1996 and that he was informed about it in May 1997. He said that he had been very surprised because his partner had never told him about his financial difficulties and was frustrated that his partner had acted on his father's advice, without discussing it with him first.\n[37] Marc Genest stated that, when his partner returned from a trip to Florida in September 1997 to visit his mother, he noticed that his partner had lost a great deal of weight and was having difficulty getting around. He then suspected him of having AIDS. He was unable to specify when he contracted the disease and he had never discussed it with him.\n[38] Marc Genest revealed that in December 1996 his spouse told him that he had been around. The Complainant stated that he had understood what he meant and did not want to know any more about it.\n[39] Marc Genest claimed that, as far as he knew, before his hospitalization in November 1997 his spouse saw the doctor about twice a year. He did not know if it was his own doctor.\n[40] The witness was asked to verify the summary of his partner's medical consultations for the period of January 30, 1996 to January 18, 1998 (Exhibit I-2). This summary came from the R\u00e9gie de l'assurance-maladie du Qu\u00e9bec and showed that between February 28, 1997 and November 5, 1997 the Complainant's partner underwent 21 medical procedures. Marc Genest stated that his partner had not kept him up to date about his visits to the doctor.\n(ii) Angello Galletto [41] Angello Galletto worked at Bell Mobility for three years starting on August 11, 1997. After completing a three-month probation period, he achieved permanent employee status, which entitled him to the benefits that the Respondent grants its employees, including the group insurance plan.\n[42] The witness said that he had attended an information session with about 12 other colleagues given by Katherine Daoust, a human resources advisor, to explain to them such things as the types of coverage provided for by the group insurance plan. Once given this information, employees had to indicate the insurance coverage options they wanted to purchase.\n[43] The witness, who is homosexual, was living with a same-sex spouse in February 1996 after three months of dating. He maintained that, during the information session, insurance coverage for same-sex spouses was not brought up. Angello Galletto recalled contacting Katherine Daoust to find out whether he could designate his partner as a life insurance beneficiary. She replied that it was not possible but that what he could do was state the beneficiary's last name and just the first letter of the beneficiary's first name. He decided not to take that approach, particularly since his partner had life insurance through his employer's group insurance plan.\n[44] The witness stated that, during the training session, he did not raise the issue of his partner's insurability because in his view it was a private matter. In addition, he believed that at that time sexual orientation was not recognized at Bell Mobility. According to him, it was a topic that was not brought up with management. Discussions may have been held among employees who were friends. It was nevertheless recognized that a number of people employed at Bell Mobility were homosexual.\n(iii) Martin Pelletier [45] Martin Pelletier was Marc Genest's partner from September 1999 to April 2000. When they first met, the Complainant told him that his partner had died on February 16, 1998 and that his employer had previously not let him purchase life insurance for his partner. The witness later learned that the Complainant had had many financial difficulties following the death of his partner and that he had had no money. He had not been able to pay for his partner's funeral expenses and had to give up the luxury apartment they had shared together. Marc Genest attributed his financial difficulties to the fact that his employer denied him the chance to purchase life insurance for his spouse, for which he would have been the beneficiary.\n[46] Marc Genest also informed him that, in the months following his partner's death, Bell Mobility modified the group insurance plan to allow employees to purchase life insurance for same-sex spouses. He also told him that he had tried to obtain a copy of the group insurance contract from both the insurer and his employer but that they never addressed his request.\n[47] The witness stated that he took the first steps that led to the filing of the complaint because he realized that Marc Genest was not emotionally capable of doing so.\n(iv) Gis\u00e8le T\u00e9trault [48] Gis\u00e8le T\u00e9trault is Marc Genest's mother. She said that during the six months preceding the death of her son's partner, he started having financial problems due to his partner's lack of income since his partner was sick and unable to work. She had to assist her son financially by lending him $2,500. After her son's partner died, his financial problems increased and she lent him $5,500. These loans have not been repaid.\n(v) Karine Mariasine [49] Karine Mariasine was an employee at Bell Mobility in 1995 and 1996 as a supervisor in the customer service department. She recalled that in the spring of 1995 Marc Genest came to see her to inform her of the problems he was having in getting insurance coverage for his spouse. She told him that she could not help him. The witness stated that at that time there were at least 12 employees in the customer service department who had publicly acknowledged their homosexuality.\n(vi) Lorenzo Casanova [50] The witness started with Bell Mobility at the same time as Marc Genest. He specifically worked with the Complainant in 1997 and 1998. The witness said that he was aware that, after his partner died, Marc Genest was having problems with the group insurance plan.\n[51] The witness said that, during the time he was employed with the Respondent, several employees were homosexual and that some homosexual employees had partners who worked at Bell Mobility.\n[52] The witness recalled that information sessions on the group insurance plan had been given in 1998 by human resource representatives and that he had attended.\nB. Respondent's evidence (i) Sophie Boucher [53] Sophie Boucher was hired by Bell Mobility in 1986. She started as a clerk and was promoted to the customer service department, then the collections department, and finally the telecommunications department.\n[54] After she came to Bell Mobility, she always acknowledged her homosexuality. In 1995, her partner had also been working at Bell Mobility since 1990. She had been hired as a customer service representative and then became a supervisor and finally a director.\n[55] She maintained that in 1995 management did not have a problem with employees' homosexuality. She recalled an example where she had told her boss about her desire to have a child and about the steps she had taken. She also recalled that several employees publicly acknowledged their homosexuality.\n[56] Sophie Boucher stated that before 1995 there was a group insurance plan at Bell Mobility that controlled employee membership in the various insurance categories. As of 1995, the new group insurance plan allowed employees to select different types of insurance coverage. That was why human resource representatives held information sessions to explain to employees the types of insurance coverage available and the costs involved for both the employer and employees.\n[57] The witness stated that she had no interest in insurance coverage for same-sex spouses because her partner, also a Bell Mobility employee, could purchase life insurance.\n(ii) Sylvie Sauv\u00e9 [58] Sylvie Sauv\u00e9 was hired by Bell Mobility in March 1990 as an online representative. In 1994, she was promoted to supervisor and then in 1997 became Director of Customer Service.\n[59] In May 1990, the witness met her partner, who was also a Bell Mobility employee. They always publicly acknowledged that they were gay. She stated that her sexual orientation never hindered her career. She said that several employees publicly acknowledged their homosexuality, including one of her gay colleagues, who was a director. Homosexual employees sometimes joked about her sexual orientation.\n[60] The witness said that, with the arrival of the new group insurance plan in 1995, she was not concerned about life insurance for her partner since she too was a Bell Mobility employee.\n[61] She stated that the Complainant had talked to her about the situation he was experiencing regarding life insurance coverage for his partner and that she had replied that she was not in the same situation because her partner was working for Bell Mobility.\n(iii) Genevi\u00e8ve Britt [62] Genevi\u00e8ve Britt was hired by Bell Mobility in 1995 for the position of Director of Organizational Training and Development. In 1996, she held the position of Director of Employee Relations and, at the end of 1997, Director of Human Resources at Bell Mobility Cellular. In 1999, she quit that job to become Director of Human Resources at Bell Express Vu.\n[63] She met the Complainant in the spring of 1998 when he came to see her because of the difficulties he was having following the death of his partner. The Complainant had told her that his partner was Egyptian and that his family did not accept their relationship very well, which was stressful for him. In addition to being in mourning, he informed her that he had financial problems.\n[64] Genevi\u00e8ve Britt asked the Complainant if he had purchased life insurance for his partner. He responded that he was unaware that he had that possibility and seemed very surprised to hear it.\n[65] The witness stated that she suggested he use the employee assistance program. Because he appeared exhausted, she advised him to see a doctor. Genevi\u00e8ve Britt said that she could not have met with the Complainant in 1999 because she was working for Bell Express Vu.\n[66] The witness revealed that, contrary to the Complainant's statements in his letter to the Commission dated April 29, 2002, she had not given him any information on the group insurance plan because her duties were never in that area. She categorically denied telling the Complainant that he could indicate his partner's first name in the feminine to allow him to purchase life insurance for him. She claimed that she would never have encouraged the Complainant to commit insurance fraud.\n[67] The witness maintained that people were very open-minded at Bell Mobility and that no differentiation was made between homosexual and heterosexual employees. She stated that several employees in 1995 publicly acknowledged their homosexuality at work.\n[68] The witness did not recall holding an information meeting on the group insurance plan in 1998 that the Complainant cried at.\n[69] The witness stated that after she was hired in 1995, she was informed that the group insurance plan was offered to same-sex spouses. She reported that in 1998 staff meetings were held to explain the changes to the group insurance plan.\n(iv) Katherine Daoust [70] Katherine Daoust has been an employee at Bell Mobility since April 1, 1985. She was an executive assistant. Since September 1995, she has held the position of Executive Director of Benefits.\n[71] She was asked to meet with employees in small groups to provide them with information about the benefits that Bell Mobility offered, such as the group insurance plan. She stated that she indicated that the group insurance plan was available to same-sex and opposite-sex spouses, provided that it was publicly known that the couple had been living together for at least 12 months.\n[72] In this regard, she conceded having told Angello Galletto that he could not insure his partner because he had not been living with him for at least 12 months. The witness revealed that there were many employees, both male and female, who acknowledged their homosexuality without any problems.\n[73] She stated that, at each meeting she held with groups of employees, she made it her duty to inform them because she was concerned that new employees would not raise the issue of insurability of same-sex spouses.\n(v) Michel C\u00f4t\u00e9 [74] Michel C\u00f4t\u00e9 started working at Bell Mobility in 1988 on a special telemarketing project. He was promoted to telecommunications coordinator and then administration coordinator. In 1996, he held that position in Toronto. In 2002, he had the same responsibility with Bell Express Vu.\n[75] The witness stated that he is gay. He believed that Bell Mobility management did not discuss employees' sexual orientation. He stated that he was able to conduct his life as a homosexual in peace. For example, the witness recalled that, during the holiday period, performances were organized that often dealt with homosexuality, particularly since the two hosts were gay. These performances were recorded and a video was sent to Bell Mobility managers who wanted to see the performances. The performances that the witness had participated in for six or seven years were approved in advance by the management committee.\n[76] The witness said that a committee consisting of a manager and about 12 employees was established. The committee's mandate was to educate management about problems that employees were having at work and to develop solutions. The witness stated that during one of the committee's meetings he suggested that insurance benefits should be the same for both heterosexual and homosexual couples. He claimed that his suggestion was adopted for the June 1995 deployment of the group insurance plan.\n[77] When the new group insurance plan came into effect, the witness was living alone but was seeing someone of the male gender who was working at Police Credit Union in Ottawa. In 1996, that person became his partner. He purchased life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance for his spouse.\n(vi) Lucie Laroche [78] Lucie Laroche has been a Bell Mobility employee since September 29, 1986. From January 1992 to November 1998 she held the position of human resources administrator and was then assigned to the payroll department.\n[79] She was in charge of managing the various benefits programs such as the insurance plan, retirement plan, employee assistance program and share purchase plan.\n[80] Lucie Laroche said that when an employee achieved permanent employee status he\/she was eligible for the benefits programs. The human resources department had a kit specially prepared for permanent employees. It contained a brochure explaining the group insurance plan called >[translation >] Flex Benefits, along with an insurance options form. It also contained information on the other benefits programs. Employees were then invited to attend an information session in small groups given by a human resources representative who was very familiar with the benefits programs. During the session, the kits were issued to employees and the information was conveyed. Employees than had to decide which insurance coverage they wished to purchase. If they needed clarification on the insurance options, they could obtain information from a human resources administrator. Employees then had to fill out the insurance options form and forward it to the human resources department via internal mail. Finally, an insurance coverage confirmation sheet from the insurer would be sent to employees through the human resources department.\n[81] The witness revealed that the [translation] Flex Benefits brochure listed the insurance plans available, the content and the rates. It explained each of the plans. For example, the brochure contained information on the employee life insurance plan. It specified that the basic employee life insurance was $10,000. An employee could increase the insurance benefit twice up to seven times his\/her salary. The witness explained the accidental death and dismemberment insurance plan (AD&D). This insurance coverage applied only to the accidental death of employees. In practice, in the event of accidental death, AD&D coverage and life insurance coverage would apply, but not in the case of natural death. In the event of dismemberment, a percentage of the insurance coverage would apply. The percentage varied according to the seriousness of the dismemberment. The brochure also contained information on the dental insurance, health insurance, and long-term disability.\n[82] The brochure also offered life insurance for spouses in increments of $25,000, and the premium was to be paid entirely by the employee. The witness explained the requirements for a person to be considered a spouse: married through a civil or religious marriage or common-law spouse. To be a common-law spouse, the person must have been living with another person for at least 12 months and publicly acknowledging that they were a couple. She maintained that same-sex spouses were recognized in the same capacity as heterosexual spouses.\n[83] According to the witness, the brochure also indicated the possibility of AD&D coverage for spouses and children as well as life insurance coverage for children.\n[84] The witness said that, before the advent of the Flex Benefits program, the insurance options of the group insurance plan in effect at the time were not as diversified as the new program and that the plan did not give employees the opportunity to select insurance options that fit their particular needs.\n[85] The witness pointed out that in 1994 she was part of a working group consisting of consultants and Bell Mobility representatives who were involved in developing the Flex I program with the insurance company Aetna Canada and implementing it on June 1, 1995. With reference to the group insurance contract in effect in 1995 (Exhibit P-2), the witness indicated that all applications for life insurance coverage for employees or their spouses did not require proof of insurability if they were made within 31 days of the date that an employee became eligible for the group insurance program. Eligibility was conferred on the date an employee achieved permanent status. If the insurance application was made after that time period had expired, the insurer required proof of insurability.\n[86] According to Exhibit P-2, page 7 ELIB, the witness explained the various life insurance options available to employees. The first option was the mandatory $10,000 of basic life insurance; the second option was insurance representing one times an employee's annual salary up to seven times the annual salary. As for spousal life insurance (Exhibit P-2, page 7, 2-DLIB2), we see that an employee can select life insurance coverage for his\/her spouse ranging from $25,000 to $250,000. However, an employee could not purchase life insurance for his\/her spouse for an amount higher than the life insurance he\/she had purchased for him\/herself.\n[87] Moreover, if the spouse's life insurance coverage was higher than $25,000, proof of insurability was required. In addition, when renewing the life insurance each year, any increase in spousal life insurance coverage required proof of insurability.\n[88] Finally, on page 9 of Exhibit P-2, Lucie Laroche indicated that all life insurance benefit claims had to be submitted to the insurer within six months of the death of the insured.\n[89] Lucie Laroche explained that employees' insurance option selections were valid until the renewal date of June 1, 1996. In the spring, employees would receive a new kit containing items such as the brochure explaining the group insurance program and the options form. Information meetings were held, and employees wanting to make changes to their insurance selections could do so by filling out the options form. The employee was to send the form to the human resources department, which would forward it to the insurer. Once the changes were approved, the insurer would issue a confirmation sheet to the employee via the human resources department. The same procedure was followed each year.\n[90] The witness was asked to comment on the insurance options form filled out by Marc Genest on August 28, 1995 (Exhibit P-4). The document shows that Bell Mobility made $411.12 available to the Complainant to pay the costs of some insurance plans. It also shows that Marc Genest chose to purchase health insurance for himself and dental insurance for himself and his partner. As for life insurance, Marc Genest selected life insurance coverage representing twice his annual salary. He did not purchase spousal or child life insurance. He selected AD&D for himself with coverage of five times his annual salary and AD&D for his partner with coverage of $200,000. He also purchased long-term disability insurance for himself.\n[91] The form also shows that the Complainant designated his mother as the beneficiary of his life insurance and AD&D, and his partner as a dependant.\n[92] Lucie Laroche revealed that when Marc Genest became a member of the group insurance plan his annual salary was $24,226.80 in August 1995. Therefore, since he had purchased life insurance representing twice his annual salary, he had $49,000 of life insurance. If Marc Genest had selected life insurance for his partner, it would have been for $25,000, according to the witness's version. She explained that spousal life insurance was offered in increments of $25,000 and that $50,000 of life insurance for his partner would have exceeded the amount of his own life insurance, which the insurer did not allow.\n[93] Lucie Laroche stated that in 1995 she had been married for nine years and was the mother of two children.\n[94] The witness said that in 1998 the Flex I program was replaced by the Flex II program. The new program did not involve major insurance coverage changes. The program was modified to enhance the flexibility of insurance selections.\n[95] When this program came along, Lucie Laroche helped prepare the document called [translation] Flex Benefits 2 that was issued to employees at the information sessions. She also trained the human resource representatives who were called upon to hold the information sessions. She also held some herself.\n[96] The witness recalled that all types of insurance coverage including health insurance, dental insurance, life insurance and AD&D were offered to same-sex spouses as well as opposite-sex spouses.\n[97] The witness was asked to comment on a letter that the Complainant sent to the Commission on September 26, 2000 (Exhibit I-1, Tab 8). Paragraph a) reads as follows:\n[translation]\n\"The group insurance program in effect does not provide life insurance coverage for same-sex spouses, despite the fact that this same policy accepts same-sex spouses for all the other types of coverage, which I signed my spouse up for.\"\n[98] In paragraph b), the Complainant maintained that:\n[translation]\n\"The policy in effect requires that payment be made through direct deductions from the pay of all employees for a basic premium that covers things such as basic life insurance protection of $20,000 for employees' opposite-sex spouses.\"\n[99] Lucie Laroche stated that the insurance contract did not require payment by direct deductions from employee pay for a basic insurance premium. She also maintained that there had never been basic life insurance coverage for same-sex or opposite-sex spouses. Moreover, the group insurance plan contained no mention of $20,000 in basic life insurance for spouses.\n[100] Lucie Laroche stated that Bell Mobility had established an employee assistance program (EAP) to provide timely support services to employees experiencing personal problems or requiring psychological, financial or legal assistance. The EAP had a call centre that an employee would contact. Once the problem was submitted, arrangements were made to refer the employee to a consultant who would be able to assist him\/her.\n[101] The witness was asked to comment on the Complainant's claim that during a meeting she had put an X on the page of the brochure explaining the life insurance and stating that he was not entitled to it for his spouse. Lucie Laroche denied the claim and was certain that all types of insurance coverage applied to same-sex spouses.\n[102] Lucie Laroche recalled a conversation the Complainant had had with her, not to inform her of the death of his partner, but several months later. The Complainant had informed her that he was having financial problems and that he was saddened by the death of his partner.\n[103] The witness stated that she had no recollection of an information session with employees in June 1998 during which she would have stated that Flex Benefits 2 now allowed complete insurance coverage for same-sex spouses. She is also certain that she would not have said such a thing because the Flex Benefits program had already been allowing insurance coverage for same-sex spouses since 1995 and that the Flex Benefits 2 program had not changed in that regard.\n[104] Lucie Laroche stated, with reference to the document showing Marc Genest's annual salary progression (Exhibit I-1, Tab 2), that he had achieved permanent part-time status on June 28, 1995 and permanent full-time status on April 27, 1998.\n[105] In cross-examination, the witness was asked to comment on the fact that in 1995 insurance coverage for same-sex spouses did exist but was not advertised. The witness stated that in 1995, after receiving training on the group insurance program, she developed her own method after training the other employees who were to hold the information sessions. Therefore, she claimed that, at the training sessions and the information sessions for employees, she gave all the information regarding insurance for same-sex spouses. She stated that the information was given during the training sessions in small groups of employees.\n[106] The witness stated that she recalled a meeting with two employees in an office. She was unable to state whether one of them was Marc Genest. However, she recalled that one of them asked questions about the insurability of same-sex spouses. She had been surprised by this type of question because she had not often heard it during the information sessions with the small groups of employees.\n[107] With reference to the document called [translation] Marc Genest's attendance record between November 1997 and December 2000, Lucie Laroche pointed out that the Complainant was away from work on short-term disability from November 6 to December 19, 1997, from September 22 to October 19, 1998, from October 12, 1999 to February 8, 2000 and finally from November 9 to December 4, 2000. During these absences, the Complainant received 90% of his salary in accordance with the short-term disability plan, which was borne entirely by the employer. Long-term disability insurance applied after 26 weeks of absence due to disability.\n[108] Lucie Laroche submitted the brochure explaining the Flex I group insurance program that was issued to employees in the spring of 1995. The document is called [translation] Flex Benefits (Exhibit I-6). This program came into effect on June 29, 1995.\n[109] The witness referred to page 2 of the document, which reads:\n[translation]\n\"Bell Mobility wants to ensure that all employees have basic life insurance and long-term disability insurance protection. Therefore, minimum protection is mandatory for both plans. For the other plans, you are free to select no protection if you want.\"\n[110] The witness referred to the definition of dependant on page 6 of the same document. It reads as follows:\n[translation]\n\"Dependant - Members of your family may be members of the following plans: health insurance, dental insurance, life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment.\nThe following dependants are eligible:\n* your spouse, to whom you are legally married or with whom you have been cohabitating for at least 12 months;\n* your dependent children under 21 years of age, your dependent children under 25 year of age who are regularly attending school, or your disabled children regardless of age, if they are solely dependent upon you for financial support.\"\n[111] Page 18 of the document provides information on spousal life insurance options. It states:\n[translation]\n\"Flex Benefits allows you to choose life insurance for your spouse for an amount of up to $250,000. The cost of this insurance depends on the age and gender of your spouse and on whether he\/she is a smoker.\nIf your spouse must provide a health statement, his\/her life insurance shall not be effective until Aetna Canada has approved the health status questionnaire. In the interim, the Bell Mobility life insurance that you already have for your spouse shall be maintained.\"\n[112] Page 19 deals with annual renewal and states:\n\"If you wish to increase your spouse's life insurance protection when you renew your selections for next year, your spouse must fill out a health status questionnaire.\"\n[113] The witness explained that the document indicates that the spousal life insurance premium must be paid entirely by the employee.\n[114] From the section of the brochure called [translation] Changing your selections, the witness cites the following (page 4):\n[translation]\n\"You renew your Flex Benefits selections every spring. This gives you the opportunity to review your benefit needs once a year and ensure that your coverage still fits those needs.\nYou can change your selections in the current year if there is a change in your family situation: marriage, divorce, birth or adoption, death of a family member or loss of the protection of a spouse. If applicable, please contact the Human Resources Representative in your region within 30 days of the change.\"\n[115] In 1998, the Flex II program replaced the Flex I program. An explanatory brochure called [translation] Flex Benefits 2 was again prepared and issued to employees (Exhibit I-8).\n[116] The witness stated that it contained the following definition of spouse:\n[translation]\n\" - the person to whom you are legally married; - or the person with whom you live and whom you publicly represent as your spouse.\"\n[117] On page 9, the brochure also describes the process in the event of the accidental death or dismemberment of an insured person: inform the benefits department as soon as possible and file a claims submission accompanied by substantiating documentation within six months of the event.\n(vii) Patti Sommerfeld [118] In 1995, she held the position of senior medical underwriter with the Aetna life insurance corporation, which had the group insurance contract for Bell Mobility employees.\n[119] The witness revealed that employees had to purchase a minimum of $10,000 in life insurance. They could also choose life insurance for an amount equal to one times their annual salary up to six times their annual salary rounded up to the nearest thousand dollars. As such, for employees choosing life insurance representing one times their salary and whose income was $24,000, their insurance would be rounded up to $25,000.\n[120] The witness said that the insurance application had to be filed within 31 days from the date an employee became eligible for insurance. Otherwise, a medical certificate is required, in other words a health questionnaire prepared by the insurer.\n[121] Regarding the insurance options that employees can select for their spouses, the witness revealed that the minimum amount was $25,000. They may also increase that in increments of $25,000 up to $250,000, with a medical certificate.\n[122] The witness explained that, in the event of death, the beneficiary needs to have a physician fill out the death claim form and obtain the original proof of death. A claim accompanying these documents must be sent to the insurer within six months of the death. Otherwise, the claim may be denied.\n[123] The witness explained that if a plan member tests positive for AIDS or immune system disorder, insurance will be denied.\n[124] The witness was asked to review the definition of spouse in the 1995 group insurance contract, which reads as follows:\n\"Spouse means a husband or wife by virtue of a religious or civil marriage ceremony, except that, a person living with a member will be deemed to be the member's spouse, if such person:\n- is publicly represented as the member's spouse; and,\n- has been living with the member for a period of at least one year (12 continuous months).\"\n[125] The witness stated that this definition of spouse applies to same-sex partners. She added that she had never seen a group insurance plan that excluded same-sex partners from part of the protection available to dependants.\n[126] To conclude the Respondent's evidence, a letter was filed (Exhibit I-10) attesting that the life insurance contract that the Complainant's spouse had had with Sun Life for $10,000 was cancelled on June 12, 1995 retroactive to July 1, 1994 due to unpaid premiums in July and October 1994 and January 1995.\nIII. THE LAW [127] Section 7 of the Act states that It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee on a prohibited ground. In addition, section 3 of the Act lists the prohibited grounds, which include sexual orientation and marital status.\n[128] The jurisprudence teaches that, with respect to discrimination, the Complainant must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a decision in favour of the Complainant in the absence of an answer from the respondent.\nIV. ANALYSis [129] Counsel for the Complainant acknowledged that in June 1995 the group insurance plan for Bell Mobility employees provided the life insurance option for same-sex spouses as well as the options for health insurance, dental insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance. He maintained, however, that the Respondent's representatives did not provide the Complainant with relevant information enabling him to purchase life insurance for his partner and that they did not allow him to do so.\n[130] In his testimony, Marc Genest stated that he did not recall whether human resource representatives in 1995 had held information sessions with employees to give them information on the group insurance plan. The preponderance of evidence is to the contrary, through both Lucie Laroche's testimony and the documents sent to employees by Bob Ferchat, President of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Marc-Andr\u00e9 Malboeuf, Human Resources Administrator (Exhibit P-11).\n[131] Marc Genest maintained that, after reading the information brochure on the group insurance plan, he met with Lucie Laroche on August 28, 1995 for clarification. He stated that during that meeting she told him that she had been living with a husband for four years. Lucie Laroche categorically denied that statement and explained that at that time she had had a husband for nine years and was the mother of two children.\n[132] Marc Genest claimed that during that meeting Lucie Laroche told him that the spousal life insurance option did not apply to same-sex spouses. The preponderance of evidence did not demonstrate the validity of that claim. In fact, the evidence revealed that Lucie Laroche worked with a task team to deploy the new group insurance plan and was therefore very knowledgeable of the content. She was asked to train the human resource representatives who held the information sessions for groups of employees. She herself conducted training sessions for employees. She stated that, during both the training courses for human resource representatives and the information sessions for groups of employees, she always mentioned that the life insurance option applied to same-sex spouses.\n[133] I accept Lucie Laroche's testimony rather than the Complainant's where she denied indicating to him that the group insurance plan did not allow employees to select the life insurance option for same-sex spouses. Moreover, I do not see what Lucie Laroche's interest would have been in hiding this information from the Complainant.\n[134] For the foregoing reasons, I cannot believe the Complainant's testimony where he stated that, during an information session held on June 15, 1998, Lucie Laroche announced that homosexual spouses were now eligible for all insurance options provided for in the group insurance plan. That claim is even less credible when considering the testimony of the insurer's representative, who stated that she had never seen a group insurance plan that excluded same-sex partners from part of the protection available to dependants.\n[135] In his testimony, Marc Genest maintained that in 1995 he informed Lucie Laroche during a meeting with her that he was the victim of discrimination since he was not allowed to purchase life insurance for his spouse. In his complaint, he also said:\n[translation]\n\"Right after receiving this information, I vehemently protested and pointed out that it was overt discrimination. Every step I took was unsuccessful and I was told that nothing could be done.\"\n[136] In cross-examination, he conceded that he had not stated being the victim of discrimination but rather of an unfair situation. He further acknowledged that, faced with being unable to obtain life insurance for his spouse, he did not dare press the issue because he had just achieved permanent employee status and was afraid of losing his job. This explanation may seem credible. However, why did he not bring it up again when renewing his group insurance plan in 1996 and 1997? Fear of losing his job cannot, in my view, be a valid reason. However, he did not do anything.\n[137] He also acknowledged that he did not seek recourse because he believed that there was nothing that could be done. Instead it was a friend who took steps for him that led to a complaint being filed on November 4, 2000.\n[138] Marc Genest maintained that he had to purchase life insurance for his spouse in addition to accidental death and dismemberment insurance in order to have enough financial protection in the event of his spouse's death. According to him, his spouse had $50,000 in life insurance at that time, for which he was the beneficiary. However, the evidence unequivocally showed that that it was $10,000 in life insurance.\n[139] Marc Genest stated that in 1997 his spouse could not pay his $800 life insurance premium and that his father paid the premium in return for becoming the beneficiary of the policy. However, as the documentation supplied by Sun Life, his spouse's insurer, demonstrates (Exhibit I-10), the Complainant's spouse had not paid the insurance premiums due in July and October 1994 and January 1995, with the result that the insurance was cancelled retroactively to July 1, 1994.\n[140] Marc Genest explained that it was important for him to obtain life insurance for his spouse because the couple had a relatively expensive lifestyle. They had a luxury apartment and they each had a vehicle. In 1995 and 1996 and until the fall of 1997, the couple's financial situation was good, according to the Complainant. After maintaining that his spouse's income was approximately $70,000 net, he was forced to concede in cross-examination that for 1995 and 1996 his spouse's annual income was around $40,000 gross and even lower in 1997 due to being away because of illness. He also had to acknowledge that his spouse had filed an assignment in 1996. He claimed that his spouse had never informed him about the financial problems he was having. I am not satisfied that the Complainant, who said that he had a very close relationship with his spouse, could not have been aware of his financial problems.\n[141] The Complainant stated that the information on the spousal insurance options simply paid lip service to it because in 1995 homosexuality was not recognized and accepted at Bell Mobility. The preponderance of evidence shows instead that homosexual employees were treated in the same way that heterosexuals were. Employees publicly acknowledged their homosexuality and, during employee-organized social evenings, they put on performances that joked about homosexuality. Employees have had very rewarding careers at Bell Mobility and have reached important executive positions without their sexual orientation being at all a consideration. The preponderance of evidence fails to support the Complainant's case that, during the training sessions, the human resource representatives did not inform employees about the possibility of insuring the lives of same-sex spouses.\n[142] The Complainant stated in his testimony that, between 1995 and 1998, Bell Mobility did not provide its employees with any information about the group insurance plan nor any information sessions for explaining changes to the insurance plan. This statement is in no way corroborated by the body of evidence on this point. In fact, when it was time for the annual renewal of the group insurance, employees received a brochure explaining the group insurance plan and were invited to make changes to their group insurance plan based on their needs and situation, which could have changed since the previous year. Information sessions for all employees were also held (Exhibit I-7).\n[143] The evidence revealed that in 1996 Michel C\u00f4t\u00e9, then administration coordinator at Bell Mobility and homosexual, purchased life insurance for his same-sex spouse.\n[144] Marc Genest firmly stated that he had never emailed Julie Walbrecq. However, the evidence showed that he sent an email to Julie Walbrecq on September 11, 2000 (Exhibit I-1, Tab 7).\n[145] In that email, Marc Genest referred to a basic life insurance option of $20,000 for same-sex spouses. However, it is very clear on page 18 of the brochure called [translation] Flex Benefits (Exhibit I-6), even for someone with limited knowledge of the insurance field, that there was no basic life insurance option for same-sex or opposite-sex spouses. The only basic life insurance coverage was $10,000 and it applied solely to employees.\n[146] The Complainant also claimed in his complaint that the basic spousal life insurance premium had to be paid through direct payroll deductions. The evidence showed that this claim was incorrect.\n[147] Marc Genest stated that after his spouse passed away he informed Lucie Laroche, who hastened to remind him that his spouse had no life insurance coverage. For her part, Lucie Laroche acknowledged having had a conversation with the Complainant, not right after his spouse's death but several months later, and she denied making such a statement to him. I do not see what Lucie Laroche's motivation could have been for acting in that manner.\n[148] Counsel for the Complainant stated that Bell Mobility did not have a policy for clearly informing employees of the possibility of obtaining life insurance coverage for same-sex spouses. According to him, the information was conveyed on request only. If we apply this view to the Complainant's situation, he would have applied for accidental death and dismemberment insurance and dental insurance for his spouse and he would have been informed that these options were recognized and why would they not have provided the same information for the life insurance application? I do not see why they would have acted differently in the case of life insurance for same-sex spouses than they did for accidental death and dismemberment insurance and dental insurance.\n[149] The preponderance of evidence leads me to conclude that, in June 1995 when the Complainant was making his insurance options selections for himself and his spouse, the [translation] Flex Benefits brochure provided him with very clear information for enabling him to understand that he had the option of selecting dental insurance, health insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance and life insurance for both himself and his spouse. Moreover, the information relayed by the human resources representatives enabled him to make well-informed selections. In fact, he selected dental insurance for his spouse because he believed that dental care was often needed. He did not see fit to select health insurance for his spouse because he was certain that his spouse was in good health. As for accidental death and dismemberment insurance, Marc Genest hastened to purchase this for his spouse in the amount of $200,000 for completely valid reasons, which he expressed in his testimony. Regarding life insurance for his spouse, I do not believe that, through its conduct, the Respondent prevented him or disallowed him from obtaining it. I do not believe that Marc Genest, knowing that his spouse had life insurance in the amount of $50,000 for which he was the beneficiary, really intended to purchase life insurance for his spouse.\nV. CONCLUSION [150] I believe that Marc Genest has failed to establish a prima facie case that Bell Mobility discriminated against him by treating him in an adverse fashion in the course of employment because of his sexual orientation and marital status by not allowing him to obtain life insurance coverage for his spouse.\n[151] Therefore the complaint is dismissed.\nRoger Doyon\nJune 4, 2004\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: T753\/0303\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Marc Genest v.

Grant Sinclair\n2004 CHRT 02\n2004\/01\/15\n[1] The complainant Maurice Bressette filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission dated March 30, 2002, against the respondent Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council. In the complaint, he alleged that the respondent discriminated against him on the ground of family status by refusing to hire him as a Family Case Worker, contrary to s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] On October 30, 2003, the Tribunal held a preliminary hearing to deal with two motions, one by the respondent disputing the Tribunal's jurisdiction under s. 67 of the Act; and one by the complainant to amend his complaint to add allegations of retaliation against him by the respondent, contrary to s. 14.1 of the Act.\n[3] The complainant's motion was not dealt with at the preliminary hearing. Instead, the Tribunal directed that complainant's amendment motion be dealt with the way of written submissions from the parties, the complainant to file by November 7, 2003, and the respondent to file by November 17, 2003. The Tribunal also scheduled the hearing dates for the complaint to be April 19-23, 2004 and April 26-30, 2004. The disclosure date for the complainant is March 31, 2004 and February 27, 2004 for the respondent.\n[4] There are a number of decisions by both this Tribunal and provincial human rights tribunals that deal with the question of amending a complaint to add an allegation of retaliation. (See Kavanagh v. Correctional Services of Canada (May 31, 1999), T505\/2298 (C.H.R.T.); Entrop v. Imperial Oil Limited (1994) 23 C.H.R.R. D\/186); (Fowler v. Flicka Gymnastics Club, [1998] B.C.H.R.T. No.2); Schnell v. Machiavelli Associates v. John Micka (April 25, 2001), T594\/5200 (CHRT).\n[5] Certain principles can be derived from these decisions as follows. A human rights complaint is not like a criminal indictment. There is discretion in the Tribunal to amend the complaint to deal with additional allegations, provided that sufficient notice is given to the respondent so that it is not prejudiced and can properly defend itself. The fact that the proposed amendment involves a different section of the Act to that in the original complaint does not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction.\n[6] It should not be necessary for individuals to make allegations of reprisal or retaliation arising after a complaint, by way of separate proceedings. Rather, an amendment should be granted unless it is plain and obvious that the allegations in the amendment sought could not possibly succeed. An obvious example, at least for allegations of retaliation, would be where the alleged incidents of retaliation were shown to have occurred prior to the filing of the complaint. The Tribunal should not embark on a substantive review of the merits of the amendment. That should be done only in the fullness of the evidence after a full hearing.\n[7] In his submission, the complainant referred to numerous incidents occurring after March 30, 2002, which he alleges amount to retaliation. In my opinion, out of this multitude of incidents referred to by the complainant, some disclose a tenable claim for retaliation. It is not plain and obvious that the complainant would not succeed with these allegations.\n[8] This is not to say that the complainant has established that the respondent did contravene s. 14.1 of the Act. This remains to be proven by the complainant at the hearing of the complaint. All that this Tribunal has concluded is that the original complaint should be amended to add an allegation under s. 14.1 of the Act.\n[9] In its submission, the respondent argued that the complainant's submission and documentation is just a continuation of a dialogue between the Band Chief, the Band Administrator, the Band Council, and this should not and can not be characterized as retaliatory. In my view, this is not a basis for refusing the amendment. It is a submission that should be made, on evidence, at the hearing of the complaint.\n[10] Finally, dealing with the question of prejudice to the respondent, I note that the respondent has known at least since October 22, 2003 when the complainant first filed his motion, that the complainant intended to seek this amendment. The respondent also has known since that date, the documentation and the incidents that the complainant relies upon. Further, since November 7, 2003, the complainant has provided further disclosure to the respondent setting out further incidents he intends to rely upon. The complainant is also to provide full disclosure by March 31, 2004.\n[11] In my opinion, the respondent has been given adequate notice of the case to be met and will not suffer any prejudice if the amendment is granted.\n[12] Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the complainant's motion to amend the original complaint to add an allegation of retaliation under s. 14.1 of the Act, is granted.\nSigned by\nJ.

INTRODUCTION [1] The following ruling deals with an objection to an expert's report tendered by the complainant. The report was prepared by Dr. Frances Henry, who appears to be eminently qualified as an expert on racism. Dr. Henry has a PhD in social anthropology, has many publications, and has testified as an expert before many courts and tribunals. At this point in the proceedings, at least, her qualifications are not in issue.\n[2] In the introduction to the report, Dr. Henry poses two questions. Those questions are as follows:\nWhether or not it is possible that race played a role in having the Complainant placed in the 13th position on the competition eligibility list, or whether it was simply favoritism and incompetence on the part of the competition panel? Whether or not it is possible that the refusal to appoint the Complainant to a six plus term even though he met the legal requirements for doing so on a number of occasions, was an act of racism?\nI would have thought that each of these possibilities is properly before the Tribunal.\n[3] Dr. Henry then sets out a substantive framework for the evaluation of these questions. She asserts that there is a new racism, which has replaced older and more deliberate forms of racism. This kind of racism includes more covert, subtle and sometimes even unconscious forms of behavior and attitude that nevertheless serve to discriminate against minority groups. The new racism manifests itself in a discourse of denial, which obscures the racial motivations behind many discriminatory acts in the workplace. As Dr. Henry puts it, on page 3 of her report, there is a refusal to accept reality of racism despite the evidence of racial prejudice and discrimination in the lives and in the life chances of people of color.\n[4] Dr. Henry then applies these general observations to the facts of the case. The report provides little however in the way of statistical or scholarly information that would shed light on the precise circumstances before me. The real thrust of her argument is simply that this failure of perception is the principal contributing factor in the case before me. The difficulty with such an approach is that it blankets anyone who rejects the complainant's assertions with accusations of racism. These accusations naturally come with the imprimatur of an expert. This merely puts the Respondent on the defensive and upsets the equilibrium that provides the basis of any fair hearing. As a practical matter, it is impossible to assert such propositions without offering an opinion on the credibility of the witnesses to be called by the other side. This is not the proper subject of opinion evidence.\n[5] The Complainant has argued that the report is necessary to rebut the findings in the report of the Public Service Commission. This report has been filed as an exhibit in the hearing and deals with the same fundamental allegations that are before the Tribunal. The point is that the Commission's investigator, Ella Coffil, rejected the Complainant's allegations. Mr. Bagambiire and Mr. Flaherty have accordingly argued that Dr. Henry's report provides a necessary corrective to the views expressed in her report. This line of argument cannot succeed. Although the contents of the report may have some value, in establishing the chronology and indeed some of the facts in the case, it has nothing to say on the fundamental issue before the Tribunal. The question whether Mr. Brooks was discriminated against under the Canadian Human Rights Act lies exclusively within the keeping of the Tribunal.\n[6] All of this comes with a qualification. I share many of the general concerns in the Henry report and do not want to prevent the Complainant from arguing his case. Mr. Brooks is free to argue that those who made the decisions regarding his employment were unable to see the racial elements in their decisions. Those kinds of submissions are well within the ordinary range of argument in a case of this nature. I also agree that a Tribunal should be careful to distance itself from whatever perspective was adopted by the investigator from the Commission. There is no arguing with the proposition that the decision of the Tribunal must be based on the facts and evidence before the Tribunal rather than the preconceptions of the parties.\nII. LAW [7] The test for determining the admissibility of an expert's report was set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9. There, Justice Sopinka held that the admission of expert evidence depends on the application of four criteria:\nrelevance, whether the evidence is necessary, the absence of an exclusionary rule, and the qualifications of the expert.\nThe Court went on to say that a costs-benefits analysis should be conducted to determine whether the probative value of an expert's report outweighs its prejudicial effect.\n[8] The first criteria is accordingly relevance. Counsel for the Complainant appeared to raise two arguments. The first is simply that Dr. Henry's report is relevant because it tends to establish that race was a factor in the decisions that were made regarding Mr. Brooks. The problem with this argument is that the report provides no evidentiary basis for such a conclusion. There is none of the statistical or expert analysis that one would normally find in the report provided by an expert. The second argument goes to credibility. On this account, the report allegedly establishes that the investigator from the Public Service Commission was blind to the possibility of racism in the facts before her. This implies that she harboured racial views. This kind of issue is completely collateral to the matter before me however. There is no reason to investigate it.\n[9] On the broader issue, it seems to me that Dr. Henry has merely reviewed the facts of the case and advised the Tribunal that they support a finding of racism. This kind of coaching goes beyond the legitimate role of an expert. I agree with the decision of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court in Campbell v. Jones, [2001] N.S.J. No. 598 (QL), at para. 26, where that Court, in dealing with another report from Dr. Henry, held that: nothing in the report justifies reasoning from generalization of Social Science to the specifics of Constable Campbell in a court of law. Although the court in Campbell was concerned with the effect of such evidence on a jury, the more fundamental concern lies in the role of facts and opinion in the legal process. Mere statements of opinion are of little assistance in deciding whether a complainant was discriminated against.\n[10] The second question is necessity. The Supreme Court in Mohan, supra, held that the purpose of an expert's report is to provide an inference that would not be available without the evidence of the expert. At paragraph 21, the Court approved of the statement by Dickson J. in R. v. Abbey, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 24, at p. 42, where he held:\nAn expert's function is precisely this: to provide the judge and jury with a ready-made inference which the judge and jury, due to the technical nature of the facts, are unable to formulate, `An expert's opinion is admissible to furnish the court with scientific information which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge or jury. If on the proven facts a judge or jury can form their own conclusions without help, then the opinion of the expert is unnecessary'.\nThis is the context in which the question of necessity must be considered.\n[11] A Tribunal should not be too scrupulous in applying a standard like necessity. The question is whether the evidence is logically rather than probatively necessary. There must be a reason to call an expert and the mere fact that the evidence seems to advance the case for one of the parties is not sufficient. A party is not entitled to buttress its evidence by providing the Tribunal with the opinions of experts who happen to share its view of the matter. The case cannot be decided by polling the experts.\n[12] There are additional concerns that arise in the context of necessity. One is that the Human Rights Tribunal is an expert Tribunal, with its own expertise in the area of discrimination. It is accordingly in a position to reach an informed opinion as to the weight and value of any evidence of discrimination, without the assistance of an expert. Another concern relates to the nature of the report, which argues for a specific interpretation of the evidence before the Tribunal. In Brough v. Richmond, 2003 BCSC 512, at para. 14, the British Columbia Supreme Court stated:\nAn expert cannot lapse into advocacy, [E]very expert should avoid arguing the case, a matter which is more properly left in the hands of counsel. Surrey Credit Union v. Willson, [1990] B.C.J. No. 766 (S.C.) at p. 5. Expert opinions are inadmissible where they reflect or are a reworking of the argument of counsel. If an argument is dressed up as the report of an expert it will be rejected for what it is.\nI think that these comments apply to the report tendered by the Complainant.\n[13] The third concern is more substantive. Although the rule against providing an opinion on the ultimate issue before a Tribunal has been relaxed in recent years, it must still be respected. The responsibilities of the Tribunal cannot be delegated to experts, who have none of the legal training, evidentiary sensibilities or adjudicative experience of the members of the Tribunal. Every adjudicative body has an obligation to reach its own conclusions on the fundamental issues in a case, without direction from the parties.\n[14] The report of Dr. Henry is prejudicial in the true sense of the word. It comments on the evidence that the Respondent apparently intends to call and suggests that only one conclusion is available to the Tribunal at the end of the hearing. In my view, this undermines the independence of the process and implicitly impinges on the right of the Respondent to present its case. There is a danger that this might fetter the ability of the Tribunal to choose freely between the alternatives put before it by the different parties. This is exactly what the evidence of an expert must not do.\nIII. CONCLUSION [15] When I apply the kind of cost-benefits analysis contemplated by the Supreme Court in Mohan, I find that the report of Dr. Henry does not meet the standard set out in case law. It should therefore be excluded from the evidence. This is in keeping with the ruling in Singh v. Statistics Canada (January 5, 1998; trans. attached) in reaching this conclusion, where a panel of this Tribunal made a similar ruling with respect to a previous report from Dr. Henry.\nPaul Groarke\nHALIFAX, Nova Scotia\nJune 8, 2004\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: T838\/8803\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Cecil Brooks v.

INTRODUCTION [1] Bruno Boudreault alleged that he was discriminated against on the basis of his disability (problem with his left knee) when Great Circle Marine Services Inc., the Respondent, terminated his employment because his physical condition prevented him from meeting the requirements of the helmsman and longshoreman duties. The Complainant claimed that the Respondent failed to comply with the provisions of section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act).\n[2] Bruno Boudreault also alleged that the Respondent had a discriminatory hiring policy contrary to section 10 of the Act by requiring that all crew members on a ship, without exception, be in suitable physical condition, with the assessment of that condition left to the judgement of the ship's captain.\nII. THE EVIDENCE A. Complainant's evidence (i) Bruno Boudreault [3] Bruno Boudreault lives in \u00cele-aux-Coudres. In 1998, he worked as a day labourer at the Groupe Oc\u00e9an shipyard in \u00cele-aux-Coudres. In July 1998, he had surgery on his left knee. In the spring of 1999, he was hired by Croisi\u00e8res A.M.L. as a day labourer assigned to preparing boats for the tourist season. He then worked as a maintenance employee and recreation leader at H\u00f4tel Cap-aux-Pierres in \u00cele-aux-Coudres until September 1999. In March 2000, he obtained a job as a seaman and helmsman on the cruise ship Cavalier Maxime, owned by Croisi\u00e8res A.M.L.\n[4] During the winter of 2001, at a friend's suggestion, he contacted Andr\u00e9e Viger who, according to his information, was working for Logistec Navigation in order to seek work as a seaman on board a ship that was to travel to the far north during the summer. Andr\u00e9e Viger asked him to send her his curriculum vitae (C.V.) and a medical certificate. He sent her his C.V. and his certificate in marine emergency duties (M.E.D.).\n[5] The Complainant said that, on February 13, 2001, he went to meet Dr. Marcel \u00c9thier in \u00cele-aux-Coudres, who was designated by Transport Canada to conduct medical assessments. Dr. \u00c9thier conducted a medical examination. The Complainant stated that he informed the physician about the operation on his left knee. Dr. \u00c9thier issued the required medical certificate (Exhibit P-11), which the Complainant forwarded to Andr\u00e9e Viger.\n[6] Andr\u00e9e Viger contacted the Complainant again to point out that, if he held a bridge watchman or helmsman certificate, he would improve his chances of being hired. The Complainant obtained his helmsman certificate on May 9, 2001 (Exhibit P-14). Upon receipt of this document, Andr\u00e9e Viger informed him that he had obtained employment as a helmsman\/longshoreman and that \u00c9douard Nadeau, the personnel manager, would contact him to provide him with the terms of employment.\n[7] The witness said that he received a call from \u00c9douard Nadeau confirming his employment as a helmsman\/longshoreman. \u00c9douard Nadeau asked him whether he was familiar with longshoreman work. He stated that he had replied having seen longshoremen work but had no experience himself. \u00c9douard Nadeau asked him to board the Umiavut at Valleyfield harbour on June 16, 2001 and that he would meet him there personally. At the Complainant's request, \u00c9douard Nadeau agreed to postpone his arrival until the following day, Sunday, June 17, 2001. The witness recalled that when he arrived he met \u00c9douard Nadeau to sign his employment contract (Exhibit P-I). \u00c9douard Nadeau gave him a tour of the ship. He issued him his seaman's book for it to be conveyed to the captain in accordance with the standards in effect.\n[8] The witness stated that he had not been told about the work he would be doing when the ship was in port. The crew commander, however, did mention to him that there was the possibility he would be assigned to operating a tug.\n[9] The witness recalled that, at the request of the chief petty officer, he started his watch shift from 8:00 p.m. to midnight. He had a four-hour shift and an eight-hour rest period followed by a four-hour shift. On Tuesday or Wednesday, he was in bed after his shift, which ended at 8:00 a.m., when he was wakened by the chief petty officer, who told him he was to go to the captain's office.\n[10] He went to Captain Robert B\u00e9langer's office where he met the captain and Andr\u00e9e Viger who was also at the meeting. The captain informed him that it had been brought to his attention that he was putting ice on his knee and that he was concerned that he had been injured on board the ship. The witness informed the Captain that that was not the case and that he had had surgery on his knee in 1998 and that he would sometimes put ice on his knee whenever it felt stiff, but that the situation did not prevent him from doing his work.\n[11] Since Captain B\u00e9langer seemed concerned about his physical condition, the witness stated that he had suggested he contact his orthopedic physician whose telephone number he provided to him. He also offered to undergo a medical examination by the orthopedic physician of his choice. Captain B\u00e9langer told him that he would review the situation and would speak to him again later in the day. Approximately one half an hour after he returned to his cabin, he was again summoned to Captain B\u00e9langer's office.\n[12] When he arrived at the office, he asked whether his orthopedic physician had been contacted. Andr\u00e9e Viger replied that she had two options: contact his physician and keep him employed or not contact his physician and terminate his employment. The witness stated that he suggested leaving the ship to go to his physician's office in Quebec and obtain his medical record. This suggestion was not pursued. Captain B\u00e9langer told him that he had to terminate his employment because the condition of his knee did not allow him to take the risk of retaining his services for a voyage to the north. At the Complainant's request, Captain B\u00e9langer issued him a letter attesting to the termination of his employment due to problems with his left knee (Exhibit P-2).\n[13] Bruno Boudreault immediately left the ship to return home. He stopped in Quebec. The following day, through his lawyer, he sent a formal demand letter to Logistec Navigation ordering it to reinstate him in his job (Exhibit P-3) before the ship's departure scheduled for the end of June 2001. However, since the formal demand letter did not refer to the employer stated in the contract, a second demand was sent to the employer\/Respondent on July 19, 2001 challenging the validity of the termination and demanding reinstatement.\n[14] The Complainant said that, to his knowledge, the ship left Valleyfield harbour on June 26 or 27, 2001. He stated that he had contacted Andr\u00e9e Viger to convince her to allow him to be reinstated in his job. On June 26, 2001, he faxed her a report from his orthopedist (Exhibit P-4) indicating that, as of June 14, 1999, he was fit to return to work after surgery on his left knee in July 1998 (Exhibit P-4). Andr\u00e9e Viger informed him that someone else had been hired and that she could do nothing for him. The Complainant also produced a letter from the orthopedist who treated him (Exhibit P-6), dated October 4, 2001, confirming that the medical status of his knee did not result in any functional limitations for any type of work.\n[15] The Respondent sent the Complainant an initial record of employment dated June 29, 2001, with no comments in the Observations section (Exhibit P-1). On July 16, 2001, the Respondent issued a second record of employment where it stated the following in the Observations section: According to the captain, unfit for work for medical and safety reasons. [translation]\n[16] The witness stated that after arriving home again he was very shaken by losing his job. As a result, it was several weeks before he took steps to look for work. He then went to the employment insurance office and the seafarers' union office to find work, but was unsuccessful. He also sought work at the Groupe Oc\u00e9an shipyard and on the Coast Guard ships. He was rehired on July 31, 2001 as a seaman\/helmsman on the \u00c9cho des Mers until October 12, 2001. From May 13, 2002 to September 21, 2003, he was employed as first mate on the Famille Dufour II and performed the same work in 2003.\n[17] The witness added that in January 2003 he took a radar simulator course. He intends to take a course in radiotelephony, which would allow him to take the exam for obtaining his Minor Waters Master certificate.\nB. Respondent's evidence (i) Robert B\u00e9langer [18] The witness began his maritime career as a seaman in 1975. Starting in 1980, he moved up through the officer ranks and in 1995 obtained a Master Mariner certificate. As a deck officer, he often had occasion to sail in the Canadian Arctic, particularly on the Lucien Paquin. This ship's activities focused on transporting all types of goods to posts and villages in the Arctic. It would also carry goods between villages and return goods south, namely to Montreal.\n[19] In 2001, Transport Nanuk engaged his services as a captain on the Umiavut, which had the same mission as the Lucien Paquin. The crew of the Umiavut consisted of personnel assigned to the navigation department. It included the captain, who was responsible for supervising all shipping activity. He had to ensure that the Canada Shipping Act and Transport Canada's regulations were respected, particularly regarding the safety of the crew, the ship itself and everything carried on board the ship. He had to be able to take the required steps in emergencies such as fire or a situation requiring abandonment of ship. He stayed in constant contact with the owner to provide current information about the ship's progress. There was also the senior ship's officer in charge of activities relating specifically to the cargo. Then there were three navigation officers whose responsibilities involved the ship's progress on the water. They performed eight-hour watches per day divided into four-hour periods of work according to a schedule that began at midnight. The navigation department also included three helmsmen. Each one was assigned to and worked with an officer.\n[20] The helmsman was responsible for steering the vessel in a specific direction according to instructions from the navigation officer. Conditions permitting, the automatic pilot system was turned on. At that point, the helmsman would be assigned to watch duty to ensure that the ship progressed safely.\n[21] The personnel on board the Umiavut also included five day-labourer\/seamen and one master seaman. The crew also included the engineering department personnel, specifically the chief engineer and two mechanics. Finally, there was the food department personnel, namely the head chef and one cook.\n[22] The delivery of goods to northern Quebec begins as soon as the ice breaks up, usually between July 1 and 15, and ends when the water freezes up again at the beginning of November. Captain B\u00e9langer explained the importance of meeting the scheduled delivery dates.\n[23] In addition to carrying goods, ships heading to northern Quebec must also supply longshoreman services because the destinations do not provide port facilities.\n[24] Captain B\u00e9langer described the goods unloading operations. Once the ship arrives at the delivery point, it is safely anchored as close to the pier as possible. Using cranes on the ship, the transit equipment, namely two tugs and two barges, are placed in the water. Tractors and unloading equipment for handling the goods on the pier are then placed on the barges. The tugs pull the barges to the pier and the handling equipment is unloaded there. The tugs and barges then return to the ship to proceed with unloading the goods. When these operations are complete, goods may be brought to the vessel for transportion to another destination, or the equipment is brought back on board the ship, as well as the barges and tugs. The ship then heads towards another delivery point.\n[25] Longshoring operations are assigned to crew members other than officers, mechanics and cooks. Captain B\u00e9langer explained that, for unloading goods, slings manoeuvred by crew members are placed around the goods and attached to the crane for removing them from the ship and depositing them on the barges.\n[26] There is also the beachmaster. This person is not assigned to navigation. While the ship is at sea, the beachmaster looks after the maintenance of all equipment used for unloading goods and plans the unloading process for when the ship arrives at the delivery point. During unloading, the beachmaster goes on to the pier to ensure that the unloading operations go smoothly. The beachmaster is accompanied by a tractor operator, and they both drive the tractors. A seaman goes on to the pier and performs the role of inspector. He looks after the administrative aspect of the goods delivery with the appropriate people.\n[27] The tugs are operated by a tug master. Because of his maritime knowledge, this is usually the helmsman's responsibility. In addition to steering the tug, he is also responsible, with the help of a seaman, for handling the lashings used to pull the barges to the pier.\n[28] On the ship there is a crane operator and a senior officer crane signaller who must ensure that the barges are loaded safely and in accordance with the requirements arranged with the beachmaster. In the ship's hold, a fork-lift truck operator and two seamen manoeuvre the goods for unloading.\n[29] Captain B\u00e9langer testified that crew members must be able to respond to emergencies on the ship, such as an onboard fire or the extreme situation of abandonment of ship. There is potential for fire in the engine room where there are quantities of fuel. The smallest leak can cause a fire. There is also the potential for fire with the goods on board the ship. Crew members must always be prepared to work together to fight fires using Transport Canada procedures, which set out the tasks to be carried out by crew members in such circumstances. Officers have supervisory duties, and seamen including the helmsmen must fight the fire. There may be the need to abandon ship in the event of fire or collision with ice or another ship, which requires the lifeboats to be put into the water.\n[30] After he was hired, Captain B\u00e9langer boarded the Umiavut at Trois-Rivi\u00e8res and travelled to Valleyfield harbour where he arrived on June 17, 2001. The ship normally was to put out to sea immediately after the loading was finished. During the day, the crew members began to board the ship. \u00c9douard Nadeau from Great Circle Marine Services Inc., who was a supplier of personnel for the Umiavut, except for the captain and chief engineer, was on board to greet personnel. The loading operations began on Monday, June 18, 2001 and ended as usual the following Friday.\n[31] Captain B\u00e9langer said that the voyage was originally planned for Canadian waters. However, since it had to go to Thule, Greenland, it became a foreign voyage. For shipboard personnel, Transport Canada regulations differ depending on whether it is a voyage in Canadian waters or a foreign voyage. For example, the witness indicated that Transport Canada regulations require every crew member to furnish a medical certificate in accordance with its standards and to have passed the marine emergency duties (M.E.D.) course. As to the Complainant, he had to hold a bridge watchman certificate. For a minor waters voyage, the regulations do not require seamen to hold a medical certificate.\n[32] The witness acknowledged that Bruno Boudreault met all Transport Canada requirements for performing the helmsman duties for a foreign voyage. Moreover, the work that the Complainant was to carry out during the goods unloading operations had not been determined, but he believed that he would have held the position of tug master.\n[33] He recalled that, on Tuesday, June 19, 2001, a crew member informed him that he had seen the Complainant put ice on his knee. He took the opportunity during Andr\u00e9e Viger's visit the next day, June 20, 2001, to tell her about the situation. He said the following to her (page 303 of the transcripts of proceedings):\n\"I would like us to meet with the person in question. This way, number one, I would not be the only one passing judgement and, number two, you would be able to ask questions too, if necessary.\" [translation]\n[34] The witness summoned the Complainant to his office and told him about the information he had received. He claimed that the Complainant acknowledged that he was putting ice on his knee because it would be painful at the end of his work day. He was unable to provide more detail about that discussion, which was 15 or 20 minutes long, aside from the fact that the Complainant had stated that the discomfort in his knee was from a situation that happened previously. The witness said that he thanked him for the explanations and that the meeting ended on that note.\n[35] After speaking with Andr\u00e9e Viger, Captain B\u00e9langer made the decision to terminate Bruno Boudreault's employment because he felt that the Complainant's knee would not heal with the workload that he would be assigned on board the ship, which required regular attendance. He explained that it was his duty on the ship to ensure the safety of the crew members, including the Complainant himself, and that it would have been irresponsible of him to retain the Complainant.\n[36] Captain B\u00e9langer states that he therefore summoned the Complainant to his office again and informed him that his employment was terminated immediately. He told him the following (page 309 of the transcripts of proceedings):\n\"...given the situation with his knee, which I believed was a certain amount of difficulty that started after two days of work, I believed that it was not safe for him or for the rest of the crew to have to require him to be on the Arctic voyage for an entire season.\" [translation]\n[37] The witness acknowledged that the possibility of the Complainant undergoing a medical examination had been considered, but not pursued. He explained that he did not need a medical opinion to tell him what he already knew, namely that the Complainant had pain in his knee. He felt that it was unwise to allow a person with knee pains to go to the Arctic. Also, at the Complainant's request, he agreed to issue him a letter of termination (Exhibit P-2). He recalled that the Complainant was replaced by a seaman with a bridge watchman certificate and that an extra seaman was hired and came aboard at Quebec.\n[38] When questioned about whether he had considered taking accommodation measures that would have enabled the Complainant to keep his job, Captain B\u00e9langer, without answering the question directly, first maintained that the living accommodation facilities on the ship did not allow extra staff to be hired to fill in for the Complainant's potential absences. Second, the constant work during the unloading operations did not allow staff to be replaced to prevent a potential loss of effectiveness and a delay in delivery times.\n(ii) Andr\u00e9e Viger [39] In 2001, Andr\u00e9e Viger was a human resources coordinator with Transport Nanuk. She was in charge of hiring office staff as well as navigation personnel on board the Aivik and the captain and chief engineer on the Umiavut rented by Transport Nanuk. Since the Respondent had to hire navigation personnel for the Umiavut, it called on the Respondent. She assisted \u00c9douard Nadeau, a representative of the Respondent, by sending him seamen's C.V.s. She anticipated that \u00c9douard Nadeau would have difficulties finding crew members to fill the helmsman and longshoreman positions.\n[40] Andr\u00e9e Viger recalled that, in the spring of 2001, Bruno Boudreault contacted her by telephone to seek work as a seaman. She asked him to send her his C.V. Upon receipt of that document, she contacted him to determine whether he held a bridge watchman certificate. The Complainant replied that he did not, but that he could take the exam to obtain it because he had the prerequisites for it. After obtaining his bridge watchman certificate, the Complainant notified the witness, and she asked him to fax her the document. She then verbally notified the Complainant that she had forwarded the information to \u00c9douard Nadeau, who would probably contact him to offer him a job.\n[41] The witness said that on June 20, 2001 she went to Valleyfield harbour to meet with Captain B\u00e9langer, who was on board the Umiavut. During that visit, Captain B\u00e9langer told her that the Complainant was putting ice on his knee, that he wanted her to attend a meeting with the Complainant and she agreed.\n[42] When the Complainant came to his office, Captain B\u00e9langer told him that it had been brought to his attention that he was putting ice on his left knee. The Complainant conceded to that fact and said that he had had an operation on his left knee, that it was not completely healed, but that it was well on the way to being healed. He added that he had arthritis in his knee and that the ice soothed the pain. The Captain asked him to go and said that he would let him know about his decision.\n[43] The witness revealed that, after reviewing everything, the Captain decided that for safety reasons he could not keep a person on staff who did not have all his physical capabilities. Captain B\u00e9langer summoned the Complainant to his office again and informed him that, for his own safety and that of the crew, he had to terminate his employment.\n[44] The witness recalled that the Complainant maintained that he could do his work. The Complainant also suggested calling his physician and arranging for his medical record to be supplied. The witness stated that she did not take these suggestions on the grounds that June 20, 2001 was a Wednesday and, with the ship leaving on Friday, June 22, 2001, she did not have time to contact the Complainant's attending physician. Because he insisted on providing his medical record, Andr\u00e9e Viger told him to have it sent to her and received from the witness on June 26, 2001 a faxed copy of the letter from the orthopedist Fran\u00e7ois Marquis.\n[45] When questioned about the possibility of the Complainant's undergoing a medical examination by an orthopedist, the witness recalled that it was impossible for her to arrange an appointment in two days with the Groupe Sant\u00e9 M\u00e9dicis, a firm of medical experts that she had been doing business with for several years.\n[46] When the Complainant realized that Captain B\u00e9langer's decision was irrevocable, he requested a letter attesting to his termination of employment (Exhibit I-2), and the witness faxed it to \u00c9douard Nadeau.\n[47] The witness recalled that, to remedy Bruno Boudreault's departure, the seaman Dave Cossette was promoted to helmsman and his position was filled by hiring a seaman.\n[48] The witness mentioned that the Umiavut was to clear Valleyfield harbour on June 22, 2001. However, most of the seamen on board did not hold the medical certificate required by Transport Canada, which had become mandatory because the ship was to make a foreign voyage in international waters. The witness revealed that she had arranged for a physician designated by Transport Canada to board the ship on Sunday, June 24, 2001 to conduct the medical examinations and issue the required medical certificates.\n[49] The witness stated that the Umiavut cleared Valleyfield harbour on Tuesday, June 26, 2001 for its first voyage to the far north. It returned on August 28, 2001. During that voyage, Dave Cossette, the Complainant's replacement, was paid $17,320.07: $10,296.74 as a helmsman and $7,023.33 as a longshoreman. During the second voyage from September 3, 2001 to November 4, 2001, the helmsman St\u00e9phane Lavoie, who replaced Dave Cossette, was paid $17,358.35: $9,524.01 as a helmsman and $7,834.34 as a longshoreman.\n[50] The witness stated that, when the decision was made to terminate the Complainant's employment, the possibility of limiting the Complainant's work as a helmsman and a longshoreman was not considered because the Complainant had been hired to perform both helmsman and longshoreman duties. In addition, limiting the duties would have required paying overtime hours.\n(iii) \u00c9douard Nadeau [51] \u00c9douard Nadeau is the president of the Respondent, Great Circle Marine Services Inc. It is a company that supplies personnel to work on ships. In 2001, the Respondent signed an agreement with Transport Umialarik for managing the Umiavut's crew except for the captain and the chief engineer. Umialarik's representative, Andr\u00e9e Viger, informed the witness of the personnel required on board the ship. She sent him Bruno Boudreault's C.V., the medical certificate and the bridge watchman certificate.\n[52] He contacted the Complainant to offer him employment as a helmsman\/ longshoreman on the Umiavut. Because he was not familiar with longshoreman work, the witness asked the Complainant whether he was familiar with this type of work. The Complainant informed him that he had never done that type of work, but that, according to the description that his friends had given him, he claimed that he would be able to perform the duties. \u00c9douard Nadeau told the Complainant to bring warm clothes with him without specifying those that he would provide him with and that appeared in the employment contract signed on board the ship.\n[53] The witness provided his client with the required personnel. He acknowledged that for some crew members, such as the Complainant, this was their first work experience on a ship travelling to the Arctic.\n[54] The witness said that with his permission the Complainant boarded the ship on June 17, 2001 at Valleyfield harbour. He had him sign the employment contract (Exhibit P-1). After hiring all personnel, the witness left the ship on June 19, 2001 and returned to Sh\u00e9diac (New Brunswick), where his residence and the Respondent's head office were located.\n[55] \u00c9douard Nadeau said that, on June 20 or 21, 2001, Andr\u00e9e Viger informed him that Captain B\u00e9langer had terminated the Complainant's employment for safety reasons, and she sent him a letter from the Captain (Exhibit P-2). He revealed that he did not question the Captain's decision, for the following reason (page 389 of the transcripts of proceedings):\n\"I did not challenge Mr. Boudreault's termination. I have 15 years experience as a seaman, as an officer, and the captain's decision is final. That meant that there was no discussing it with him.\" [translation]\n[56] Arrangements were made to replace the Complainant. A seaman already on board the ship, who had never travelled to the north, held a bridge watchman certificate and was promoted to helmsman. The witness then hired another seaman, who boarded the ship at Quebec.\n[57] After returning to his residence, \u00c9douard Nadeau received a telephone call from the Complainant notifying him of his termination because of putting ice on his knee. He told the Complainant that he deferred to the decision of the ship's captain and that he would try to find him another job. He tried to do so, but was unsuccessful. However, after receiving the Complainant's formal demand letter (Exhibit P-5) he stopped the employment search. He acknowledged that it was difficult to find a seaman with a bridge watchman or helmsman certificate.\n(iv) Georges Tousignant [58] In 2001, Georges Tousignant had been Director of Operations for Transport Nanuk since 1994. He was responsible for ship-related operations, namely ship supply, transportation of goods and ship maintenance operations. After completing his studies at the \u00c9cole de Marine, he obtained an initial officer's certificate in 1978. Starting in 1979, he worked as a navigation officer on cargo ships. He sailed primarily on the Great Lakes and in the Canadian Arctic. In 1992, he obtained a Master Mariner certificate.\n[59] The witness explained that in 2001 the Umiavut went to northern Quebec twice during the navigation period to deliver goods in wooden containers or crates or even in bundles such as building materials, and rolling equipment like trucks.\n[60] Georges Tousignant explained that the navigation season usually runs from the beginning of July to mid-November.\n[61] He said that the Umiavut arrived in Valleyfield harbour on June 17, 2001. The loading was to be done during the week so the ship could leave on Friday, June 22, 2001 for a foreign voyage because it had to stop at Thule, Greenland. However, because all the staff on board were to have undergone a medical examination in accordance with Transport Canada requirements and because some seamen did not hold a medical certificate, the departure was delayed until June 26, 2001 to allow them to undergo a medical examination by a physician designated by Transport Canada. A physician boarded the ship on June 24, 2001 to conduct the examinations of the seamen and issue medical certificates.\n[62] The witness stated that he was on board and that he himself had a medical examination that lasted about 15 minutes. The physician took blood pressure and performed a summary hearing and vision examination. Finally, the witness answered a questionnaire.\n[63] The witness explained that the Umiavut could carry a load of 3,000 tonnes and that the shipping and delivery charges were approximately $200 per tonne. He explained that the ship's operating costs while waiting at the pier were around $15,000 per day and, when sailing, between $18,000 and $19,000 per day. He mentioned that, when the ship was delayed due to the client, the carrier absorbed the costs incurred because of the delay.\n[64] Georges Tousignant acknowledged that, even when the carrier would do everything possible to meet delivery times, delays frequently occurred, particularly due to problems during navigation.\n[65] Georges Tousignant mentioned that during the goods unloading operations, crew members were assigned to longshoring. On the Umiavut, the longshore team consisted of ten crew members. He maintained that a missing longshoreman would result in a 10% loss in longshoring productivity.\n[66] The witness explained that, in the event that a crew member could not perform his longshoreman duties, he would be sent home and replaced by someone else. He conceded that the voyage could proceed without the replacement, but he thought that this was not a desirable course of action because, if a further crew member were to become unable to do the work, productivity would be even more impacted.\n[67] The witness explained the duties of a helmsman. This person steers the ship from a location called the wheelhouse. He receives his instructions for steering the ship from the navigation officer or from the captain. Formerly, the helmsman would steer the ship using a wheel; hence the designation wheelsman. With the advent of technology, this work was reduced through the use of an automatic pilot. The helmsman is assigned to watch duty. He keeps watch and brings to the navigation officer's attention any obstacles or situations that can impede navigation. His daily work schedule is eight hours, on a rotating schedule of four hours of work and eight hours of rest.\n[68] The witness stated that the wheelhouse contains seats used exclusively by the captain. A seat is also provided, on request, for the specialized pilot who boards the ship for several hours in a row. The witness mentioned that he does not see any reason for a seat to be provided for the helmsman. According to him, the established, recognized custom is for the helmsman to remain standing to do his work, except during his 15-minute rest break during his shift.\n(v) Marcel \u00c9thier [69] Marcel \u00c9thier is a physician designated by Transport Canada to issue medical certificates in accordance with the organization's regulations. He has his practice in \u00cele-aux-Coudres. With reference to the medical record, he stated that he had met with Bruno Boudreault in 1997 as an attending physician. He saw the Complainant again on February 13, 2001 for an examination required by Transport Canada.\n[70] Dr. \u00c9thier said that he conducted a complete medical examination including blood pressure, pulse, weight and blood sugar level. He also conducted a general physical examination of his head, lungs, heart, abdomen and extremities, and everything was normal. He noticed that his record contained no mention of the Complainant having a knee problem.\nIII. THE LAW [71] Bruno Boudreault filed a complaint against the Respondent alleging a contravention of the provisions of section 7 of the Act. Under this section, it is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly, to refuse to employ or continue to employ an individual or, in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee. The discriminatory practice must be based on a prohibited ground. Section 3 of the Act specifies that disability is a prohibited ground. He also alleged that the Respondent failed to comply with the provisions of section 10 of the Act in that it engaged in a discriminatory practice by requiring all crew members of a ship, without exception, to be in suitable physical condition, with the assessment of that condition left to the judgement of the ship's captain.\nFinally, paragraph 15 (1) (a) of the Act states that:\n\"It is not a discriminatory practice if any refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement.\"\nParagraph 15 (2) of the Act specifies that:\n\"For any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) to be considered to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement and for any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(g) to be considered to have a bona fide justification, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost.\"\n[72] In 1999, the Federal Court issued two major decisions referred to as Meiorin 1 and Grismer. 2 In these two cases, the Supreme Court set out the rules for the adjudication of human rights complaints. First, the onus is on the complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case of discrimination must cover the allegations made and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in favour of the complainant, in the absence of an answer from the respondent.\n[73] Once a prima facie case of discrimination has been established, the onus shifts to the respondent to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the challenged standard or policy is bona fide. To do so, it must demonstrate that:\nit adopted the standard for a purpose that is rationally connected to the performance of the job. It is necessary to consider whether the standard was adopted for the purpose of ensuring that the job is performed safely and effectively; that it adopted the standard in good faith, in the belief that it is necessary for the fulfilment of that legitimate work-related purpose; that the standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that purpose, namely the safe and effective performance of the job.\n[74] To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, the respondent must prove that it is impossible to accommodate the specific needs of an individual employee sharing the characteristics of the complainant without imposing undue hardship on the respondent.\nIV. ANALYSIS A. The prima facie case of discrimination [75] The evidence showed that Bruno Boudreault was hired by the Respondent for the period from June 15, 2001 to October 31, 2001 to perform helmsman and longshoreman duties on board the Umiavut, which was to carry and deliver goods to various posts and villages during two voyages to the far north. The ship's captain was Robert B\u00e9langer.\n[76] The Complainant had been required to board the ship anchored in Valleyfield harbour on June 17, 2001. Since the helmsman duties would be performed when the ship was at sea and the longshoreman duties at the time of unloading the goods, he was assigned to ship's watch. He performed four-hour watch periods separated by an eight-hour rest period.\n[77] On Wednesday, June 20, 2001, shortly after his watchkeeping shift ended at 8:00 a.m., he was summoned to the office of the Captain, who wanted to confirm the information he had received about him putting ice on his left knee. The Complainant confirmed this information. He explained that he had had an operation on his left knee in 1998, that he sometimes had stiffness or pain in his knee, which he soothed with ice. According to Andr\u00e9e Viger's version, the Complainant had mentioned that he had arthritis, which he denied. However, contrary to the statement made by counsel for the Respondent, neither the Captain nor Andr\u00e9e Viger mentioned that there had been any swelling in the left knee.\n[78] After receiving this information, the Captain asked the Complainant to return to his cabin and told him that he would inform him of his decision later in the day. The Captain spoke with Andr\u00e9e Viger and then summoned the Complainant to his office again about one half an hour later.\n[79] The Captain informed Bruno Boudreault that he had decided to terminate his employment because of the problems with his left knee. He felt that the Complainant's disability would prevent him from performing the helmsman and longshoreman work during the upcoming voyages because of the demanding nature of the duties. In addition, the Captain felt that the Complainant's knee problems were likely to jeopardize his and the crew members' health and safety.\n[80] In my view, the Complainant has successfully established a prima facie case of discrimination based on an real or perceived disability in the way the Captain handled it. I also believe that the Complainant's knee problems may constitute a disability and a discriminatory practice based on a prohibited ground within the meaning of section 7 of the Act. Moreover, there is no doubt that this discrimination prevented the Complainant from continuing his employment with the Respondent.\n[81] I also believe that the Complainant demonstrated prima facie that the Respondent contravened the provisions of section 10 of the Act by leaving it up to the Captain alone to assess an employee's physical condition. The Respondent should rely on the expertise of medical personnel who are qualified to shed light on the physical condition required of seamen, given the duties they would be called upon to perform. However, since Captain B\u00e9langer's employer is not a party to Bruno Boudreault's complaint, the Tribunal will not discuss measures for rectifying this situation.\nB. Bona fide occupational requirement [82] Once a prima facie case of discrimination is established, it is necessary to determine whether the discrimination is based upon a bona fide occupational requirement using the method suggested in the Supreme Court's jurisprudence.\nC. Was the standard adopted for a purpose that is rationally connected to the performance of the job? [83] To demonstrate the existence of a bona fide occupational requirement, the onus is on the Respondent to prove that requiring seamen, such as helmsmen or longshoremen, to be in suitable physical condition is rationally connected to the positions they hold. The focus at this stage is not on the validity of the standard in issue, but rather on the validity of its more general purpose 3. I believe that the general purpose of the standard in this instance is to ensure the safe and effective performance of the work. Therefore, I believe that suitable physical condition is rationally connected to the duties of seamen such as helmsmen and the longshoremen.\nD. Was the standard adopted in good faith? [84] At this stage, the onus is on the Respondent to demonstrate that the standard requiring suitable physical condition was adopted in good faith, in the belief that it was necessary for the fulfilment of a legitimate work-related purpose. However, if the requirement for suitable physical condition is not deemed reasonably necessary or is motivated by discriminatory reasons, it will not be considered justified.\n[85] The Respondent did not submit any evidence describing the suitable physical condition it requires of hired personnel on board the ship. In her list of authorities, counsel for the Respondent submitted the Crewing Regulations (Regulations) in force as of October 2003, which is subsequent to the start of this case, and she directed the Tribunal to part 8 of said Regulations, which deals with medical examinations of seafarers, which I will return to later. Counsel for the Respondent stated that part 8 of said Regulations had not been amended in October 2001 and that it applied in the present case. Neither did Captain B\u00e9langer shed any light for the Tribunal on the definition of this standard; he simply explained the objectives of the requirement for suitable physical condition of crew members.\n[86] The evidence showed that neither Andr\u00e9e Viger nor \u00c9douard Nadeau ever informed Bruno Boudreault, during the telephone conversations prior to his being hired, about the importance of suitable physical condition for performing helmsman and longshoreman duties.\n[87] They were satisfied with the medical certificate issued by Dr. \u00c9thier, which brings me to the discussion of the need for medical examinations of seafarers. When required, medical examinations of seafarers are conducted by a physician who is knowledgeable about the work of seafarers and is designated by the minister. It is mandatory for seafaring personnel holding the positions of captain, officer and helmsman to hold a medical certificate issued by a designated physician.\n[88] In addition, all seafaring personnel on board a ship making a foreign voyage must also hold a medical certificate. However, this is not the case for ships making a voyage in minor waters, for which the seamen do not require a medical certificate.\n[89] Section 66 of part 8 of said Regulations deals with the nature of the examination that the designated physician must conduct. It reads as follows:\n\"66 (1) The physician conducting a medical examination under this part shall ensure that the seafarer does not have any of the following disabilities:\na) an impairment that could cause a sudden loss of consciousness and cannot be controlled through medication;\nb) a disorder that could prevent the seafarer from reacting effectively, while on duty, in an emergency;\nc) a condition that could endanger the security of others, in light of the confined conditions on board ship;\nd) a condition that is likely to require emergency medical care and that cannot be controlled through medication;\ne) an untreated psychiatric disorder.\n(2) The physician conducting a medical examination under this part shall ensure that the seafarer has:\na) adequate muscle strength to carry a mass of 22 kg;\nb) the physical capacity to wear breathing apparatus and life-saving equipment;\nc) adequate vision and hearing and the agility and strength to perform the duties of fire fighting, first-aid administration and ship abandonment in an emergency.\"\n[90] The testimony of Dr. \u00c9thier, the designated physician, clearly shows that the Complainant's examination on February 13, 2001 was not conducted thoroughly enough to enable him to meet the requirements of section 66 of said Regulations, and the medical certificate issued does not meet them either. Dr. \u00c9thier mentioned that he had conducted a summary general examination of the Complainant.\n[91] The evidence showed that, when the Complainant was hired on June 17, 2001 as a helmsman\/longshoreman on board the Umiavut, the voyage as it was then planned was to be made in minor waters. The Regulations did not require medical certificates for the seamen. The evidence is that several of the seamen hired did not hold a medical certificate, and the Respondent in no way required it. It was only when the voyage became a foreign voyage that the medical certificate was expected from the seamen, not from the desire to check the seamen's physical condition, even summarily, but only because the Regulations required it.\n[92] From what sufficiently serious and convincing data did Captain B\u00e9langer conclude that Bruno Boudreault was not in suitable physical condition to meet the requirements of the helmsman and longshoreman duties? It bears emphasis that the longshoreman duties that the Complainant would have had to perform were not determined. The evidence showed that he would probably have been the tug operator, specifically the tug master.\n[93] The first piece of information that Captain B\u00e9langer received was that the Complainant had placed ice on his knee. There was nothing during the previous days indicating that the Complainant was unable to fulfil the watch duties he was assigned to and which, incidentally, are inherent in the helmsman duties. The second piece of information that Captain B\u00e9langer received came from the Complainant, who told him about the operation on his left knee three years earlier and that he had some stiffness and sometimes pain in his left knee, warranting putting ice on it. The Complainant assured him that he was capable of doing his work.\n[94] This information alone guided Captain B\u00e9langer's decision to terminate the Complainant's employment. Why was the Complainant's suggestion not taken regarding contacting his orthopedic physician or going to the hospital to obtain his medical record? Andr\u00e9e Viger's response was that there was no time since it was a Wednesday and that the ship was to clear the harbour that Friday. In reality, the ship put out to sea the following Tuesday. The evidence also showed that the Complainant suggested he undergo a medical examination by a physician of the Respondent's choice. It should be recalled that the evidence is that seamen holding a bridge watchman certificate were a very rare commodity. Yet Andr\u00e9e Viger still did not take the Complainant's suggestion, pretexting to having no time to do so. Andr\u00e9e Viger explained that she had been doing business with a firm of medical experts for several years. As such, her claim that it would have been impossible for her to obtain an appointment within two days leaves me very sceptical. However, it was possible for her to engage the services of a physician, who boarded the ship on Sunday, June 24, 2002 to conduct medical examinations of the seamen not holding the required medical certificate.\n[95] The information that Captain B\u00e9langer had at hand did not in itself justify his finding regarding the Complainant's physical condition. Moreover, the content of the Complainant's medical certificate, even if Captain B\u00e9langer had read it, would not have led him to a more well-informed decision. To properly determine whether the problems with the Complainant's knee resulted in his physical condition being unsuitable for performing the helmsman and longshoreman duties safely and effectively, he should have obtained a medical assessment that met the requirements of section 66 of the Regulations.\n[96] Once the standard regarding suitable physical condition was adopted, every candidate should have been officially informed of its existence and importance prior to being hired, which was not done. In addition, even though they stated they were satisfied with the medical certificate from the physician designated by Transport Canada to confirm a candidate's physical condition, the evidence showed that the certificate was not an initial employment condition for all seamen. Finally, if suitable physical condition was essential, a thorough medical assessment meeting the requirements of section 66 (1) of the Regulations should have been mandatory to ensure that the standard was met.\n[97] I conclude that the standard regarding suitable physical condition for employees was not reasonably necessary and does not constitute a bona fide occupational requirement. Thus, the Respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice by terminating the Complainant's employment due to his unsuitable physical condition, namely the problems with his left knee.\n[98] Therefore, Bruno Boudreault's complaint is substantiated.\nV. REMEDIES A. Reinstatement [99] After concluding that the complaint is substantiated it is incumbent on the Tribunal to restore the Complainant to the situation he would have been in, had it not been for the discrimination, namely his termination on June 20, 2001.\n[100] The evidence showed that the Complainant was hired under a term contract of employment, specifically from June 15, 2001 to October 31, 2001. Therefore, even though the Complainant stated that the Respondent should have informed him of the possibility of another employment contract, I do not believe reinstatement to be well founded.\nB. Damages for financial loss [101] Bruno Boudreault claims lost wages due to his termination. The evidence revealed that, during the ship's first voyage, namely from June 26, 2001 to August 28, 2001, the Complainant's job was done by another helmsman and longshoreman, who was paid $17,320.07. In her argument, counsel for the Respondent maintained that $447.09 should be subtracted from that sum, which is the amount that the Respondent paid the Complainant for his work from June 17, 2001 to June 20, 2001. She submitted that the Complainant's replacement was also working from June 17 to June 20, 2001 and that he received the same amount as the Complainant did. However, nothing in the evidence indicated that the Complainant's replacement was working during that time. I conclude from this that the Complainant's financial loss from June 21, 2001 to August 28, 2001 was $17,320.07.\n[102] For the ship's second voyage, the parties agreed that the Complainant's financial loss was $17,358.35. Overall, the Complainant's lost income for the duration of the employment contract was $34,678.42. However, from July 31, 2001 to October 12, 2001 he earned $5,616.00, so his actual lost income was $29,062.42.\n[103] I therefore order the Respondent to pay to the Complainant the sum of $29,062.42. Since this lump sum awarded to the Complainant could potentially impose a greater tax liability on him, which would penalize him for no reason, I order the Respondent to pay to the Complainant an additional sum to cover the extra tax obligations that may be imposed on him upon receiving the ordered payment, and taking into account his other income and the accompanying compulsory deductions.\n[104] The Complainant was also claiming lost employment insurance income due to his termination. He justified this financial claim by the fact that working for the Respondent would have earned him a much higher income during his employment contract than what he received at another job. As a result, the employment insurance benefits were much lower than those he would have received if he had remained employed with the Respondent. However, the Complainant was unable to quantify the amount of employment insurance benefits that he lost, so this lost income cannot be accepted.\n[105] The Complainant was also claiming an amount of $7,000 on the grounds that his termination prevented him from accumulating hours as a helmsman for eventually becoming eligible for a Master Mariner certificate. The Complainant acknowledged that the amount he was claiming was completely arbitrary, with no data to establish the validity of it. Nothing in the evidence indicated that the Complainant had made any effort after his termination to continue working towards eventually meeting the requirements of a Master Mariner certificate. As a result, the evidence does not justify awarding the amount claimed for lost career advancement.\nC. Expenses (i) Clothing purchases [106] The evidence showed that during a telephone conversation \u00c9douard Nadeau informed the Complainant that, since he was to go to the far north, he would need suitable clothing. The Complainant purchased thermal underwear, a sleeping bag, outerwear and winter boots, which cost him a total of $700.\n[107] I order the Respondent to pay to the Complainant the sum of $700.\n(ii) Legal fees [108] After the Complainant lost his job, he hired a lawyer to represent him throughout his case from the filing of the complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission to the end of the hearing before the Tribunal.\n[109] Counsel for the Complainant submitted a lawyer's bill to the Tribunal for $6,377.46. Counsel for the Respondent acknowledged that the fees claimed are directly connected with the complaint, except for an amount of $360. Counsel for the Respondent is correct on that point because that $360 is connected with a civil claim that the Complainant brought against the Respondent.\n[110] The Complainant requested that the Respondent be ordered to compensate him in an amount of $6,377.46 to pay his legal fees, but I feel that the amount of $6,017.46 should be considered instead.\n[111] The provisions of section 53 (1) of the Act confer on the Tribunal the power to award the Complainant any or all of the wages that he was deprived of and any expenses incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n[112] The analyses in Stevenson 4 and Nkwazi 5 lead me to conclude that the legal fees claimed by the Complainant are part of the expenses incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice. Therefore, I order the Respondent to pay to the Complainant an amount of $6,017.46 for his legal fees.\n(iii) Pain and suffering [113] Under the provisions of section 53 (2) (e) of the Act, the Tribunal can order the Respondent to compensate the victim by an amount not exceeding $20,000 for any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n[114] The evidence revealed that the Complainant was upset by the sudden loss of his job. He lost his hope of pursuing his helmsman career and eventually obtaining his Master Mariner certificate. This sudden lost of employment impacted his morale. In light of these facts, I order the Respondent to pay to the Complainant an amount of $3,000 for pain and suffering.\n(iv) Compensation for reckless and wilful conduct [115] With reference to subsection 53 (3) of the Act, the Complainant requested that the Respondent be ordered to pay him $20,000 in compensation due to the fact that the discriminatory practice of which he was the victim was recklessly and wilfully engaged in.\n[116] There is nothing in the evidence demonstrating the validity of this request, and it is dismissed.\n(v) Interest [117] I order the Respondent to pay to the Complainant simple interest on all the foregoing sums awarded. This simple interest shall be calculated on a yearly basis at a rate equivalent to the Bank Rate set by the Bank of Canada (Monthly Series).\n[118] The interest on the amounts payable for pain and suffering and expenses shall run from the date of the termination to the date of the final payment. It shall be likewise for the amount payable for lost income. However, the interest shall be calculated as the wages would have become payable to the Complainant.\nRoger Doyon\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nJune 30, 2004\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: T818\/6803\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Bruno Boudreault v.

Accordingly, the complainant wants to be represented by Alain Duguay for the purposes of presenting her evidence.\n[4] The Tribunal was therefore called to decide on the right of an individual to act both as a Commission's witness at the hearing on the evidence and as the complainant's representative during the presentation of her evidence at the hearing.\nSubsection 50(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act provides that:\nAfter due notice to the Commission, the complainant, the person against whom the complaint was made and, at the discretion of the member or panel conducting the inquiry, any other interested party, the member or panel shall inquire into the complaint and shall give all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations.\n[5] Despite the existence of this provision, the Tribunal has always been concerned about giving the most disadvantaged a full and ample opportunity to assert their rights by being represented by a layperson. In my opinion, the fact that an individual acts as a witness in one branch of this matter and as the complainant's representative in the other branch could not cause any prejudice to the respondent, or amount to interference with the efficient administration of justice.\n[6] Accordingly, the Tribunal authorizes Alain Duguay to testify at the hearing of Nathalie Beaudet-Fortin's complaint, brought pursuant to section 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act and to act as her representative at the hearing of her complaint under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nRoger Doyon\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nJuly 6, 2004\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: T898\/1804\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Nathalie Beaudet-Fortin v.

PAIN AND SUFFERING\nII. WILFUL OR RECKLESS CONDUCT\nIII. RULING ON QUANTUM\nIV. OTHER MATTERS\n[1] The following decision deals with remedy. I believe that the obligation of the Tribunal to proceed expeditiously, in the wording of the Act, extends to the provision of relief. I have accordingly advised the parties that I would deal with as many of the outstanding matters as possible before dealing with the question of costs.\n[2] The Complainant has asked for compensation under two heads. The first is for twenty thousand dollars, the maximum, for pain and suffering under s. 53(2)(e) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The second is for the same amount under s. 53(3), which allows a Tribunal to award additional damages if it finds that a Respondent has engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly. The Complainant has also asked for interest on the award and the costs of the hearing.\nI. Pain and suffering [3] There is no doubt that the Complainant suffered emotionally as a result of the unfairness she encountered in the promotional process. The experience rattled her. She came out of it with her self-esteem in question. I am satisfied that that she is entitled to a substantial award for pain and suffering.\n[4] There was some debate as to the purpose of such damages. Counsel for the Complainant argued that damages for pain and suffering are not intended solely as monetary compensation for the pain and suffering experienced by the victim. They are also intended to express society's condemnation of such practices.\n[5] I am not convinced. The law of human rights is remedial and not punitive. The purpose of damages is to put the Complainant in the position that she would have been in had the discrimination not occurred. It is the experience of the Complainant rather than the conduct of the Respondent that should be consulted in determining the amount of any award.\n[6] I believe that the argument made by Mr. Gordon should be made under section 53(3), which provides a separate head of damages in cases where the conduct of the Respondent is wilful or reckless. The condemnatory element in the section may carve out an exception to the general rule that the legislation is remedial. This provides a deterrent and serves to discourage those who deliberately discriminate.\n[7] The situation is different under section 53(2). As a general rule, the nature of the Respondent's conduct is only relevant in determining damages for pain and suffering when there is a causal link between the Respondent's conduct and the Complainant's feelings. If the Complainant's stress and disappointment was aggravated by the conduct of the RCMP, I accordingly agree that its conduct must be taken into account in awarding damages for pain and suffering. This is the situation that presents itself in the present case.\n[8] The Complainant has submitted that the conduct of the RCMP contributed unnecessarily to her suffering. I have some sympathy with this position. The conduct of the RCMP in the case was at least intransigent. It prolonged the situation well beyond its natural termination point. This contributed to the her distress and must be taken into account in compensating her. If there is a message for the RCMP, it is that it failed to redress the situation.\n[9] I have already recognized that there was stubbornness on both sides. It is evident that Corporal Brown was unwilling to return to work without an admission that she had been wronged. This was not entirely reasonable. I also accept that the force made sincere and well meaning attempts to resolve the situation. One of the ironies of the case is that it gave the Complainant medical leave to deal with the psychological aspects of the matter.\n[10] There are other factors. I am not in a position to settle the dispute between the parties as to the extent of the Complainant's pre-existing psychological condition. There are nevertheless many circumstances outside the control of the RCMP that contributed to her emotional and mental state. Her father was dying; she had a history of migraines and there is a suggestion from the Respondent that she had difficulties at home. She also refused medication, apparently on medical grounds, and rejected the overtures of the Respondent. This must also be considered in determining the appropriate level of compensation.\nII. Wilful or reckless conduct [11] The Complainant has also claimed exemplary damages for wilful or reckless conduct under section 53(3). My colleague Mr. Hadjis has awarded damages under the section in a number of cases dealing with harassment. The Complainant accordingly provided me with copies of his decisions in Woiden v. Lynn 2002 CHRT 6, Bushey v. Sharma, 2003 CHRT 21, and Groupe d'aide et d'information v. Jean Barbe, 2003 CHRT 24.\n[12] I do not see how these decisions can have any bearing on the circumstances before me. The individual in each case had acted in a manner that was humiliating and flagrantly offensive. In Woiden, for example, the Respondent used the most derisive language and regularly addressed his female staff as fucking bitches. There is nothing remotely like this on the facts before me.\n[13] The RCMP may have discriminated against the Complainant, but it acted well within the normal standards of management. The Career Management Unit was under enormous pressure from all sides and conducted itself in a professional manner. There was none of the insulting conduct that played such a prominent role in the cases provided by the Complainant. I do not accept that the comments of Sgt. Kallin enter into the matter.\n[14] The section may apply in situations other than harassment. It nevertheless requires something more than stubbornness. I would have thought that the provision provides for an award in circumstances where the Respondent intended and perhaps wanted to discriminate against the Complainant. Intention in the law extends to recklessness. This distinguishes those cases that fall under s. 53(3) from the usual instance of discrimination, which does not require proof of an intention.\n[15] The Complainant has argued that recklessness brings in a lower standard than wilful. She relied on a definition from The Dictionary of Canadian Law:\nReckless: Describes a person who, knowing that there is a risk that something may happen as a result of acting in a certain way or existing circumstances, takes the risk when it is unreasonable to take it, considering the nature and degree of the risk known to be present.\nThis definition would only apply if the Respondent knew that the Complainant was in a precarious psychological state and acted as it did, in the knowledge that it might precipitate a break-down. The facts simply do not support such an allegation.\n[16] I do not see the indicia of recklessness here. The language used by the Board of Inquiry in Cameron v. Nel-Gor Castle Nursing Home (1984), 5 C.H.R.R. D\/2170, goes far beyond the kind of circumstances before me, which cannot be described as rash, heedless or wanton. The RCMP may have been in the wrong, but it conducted itself in a measured and professional way. I do not think it is fair to describe its actions as reckless.\nIII. RULING ON QUANTUM [17] Taking all of these considerations into account, the Respondent is ordered to pay the Complainant ten thousand (10,000) dollars in compensation for her pain and suffering. She is entitled to interest on such a sum at simple interest, calculated on a yearly basis at the Canada Savings Bond rate. Interest will be payable from March 14, 2000, up to the date of payment. The Respondent is directed to pay this sum within four weeks of the date of this ruling.\nIV. OTHER MATTERS [18] The Complainant has also asked that a copy of my decision on liability be placed on her personnel file. The Respondent has not resisted such an order. I am accordingly directing the Respondent to place a copy of that decision, along with the present decision, on Corporal Brown's file. There is no reason to extend this direction to future rulings.\n[19] I gather that the Complainant has requested educational leave. A new issue has also arisen with respect to the transfer that I ordered in my earlier decision. I gather that the Complainant has applied for educational leave. The Respondent has responded by filing a Notice of Motion asking for a ruling that the Tribunal is functus on the matter. The substance of the matter is set out in the material filed by the Respondent.\n[20] I cannot go into the details of the controversy without further evidence. It does not matter. The reality is that both sides have agreed that the RCMP has complied with the substance of my order. I am satisfied that the RCMP has gone some considerable distance beyond its obligations to provide the Complainant with a transfer. The present decision can accordingly be treated as a formal ruling that the Tribunal does not have any jurisdiction to deal further with the matter.\n[21] Counsel for the Complainant has provided the Tribunal with copies of some of the correspondence between the parties on this issue. His letter to the Tribunal suggests that the application is unnecessary and merely reflects the desire of the Respondent to portray the Complainant as unreasonable while the matter of damages is before the Panel. The Complainant accordingly submits that the application amounts to an abuse of process and requests the costs of the application. This will have to be decided at a later date. I can assure the Complainant however that the application from the Respondent had no bearing on my decision regarding the quantum of damages.\n[22] The only outstanding issue between the parties is the matter of costs. The Respondent has raised a preliminary issue as to whether the Tribunal has the authority to award costs under the Canadian Human Rights Act. This requires further reflection.\nSigned by\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nJuly 16, 2004\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: T769\/1903\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Jacqueline Brown v.Royal Canadian Mounted Police\nDATE AND PLACE OF HEARING: June 17 and 18, 2004 Vancouver, B.C.\nDECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL DATED: July 16, 2004\nAPPEARANCES: Charles Gordon\nFor the Complainant\nKeitha Richardson For the Respondent\nReference: 2004 CHRT 5\nFebruary 4, 2004\n",

Grant Sinclair Pierre Deschamps 2004 CHRT 26 2004\/07\/28\n[1] The Tribunal has three motions, two from the respondent, Bell and one from the complainant CEP.\n[2] In its first motion, Bell asks the Tribunal to reconsider its decision precluding it from cross-examining Ms. Blackstaffe on the AT&T Study, the Terms of Reference pertaining to the Joint Study and the training given to members of the Joint Committee and Subcommittee.\n[3] Bell's second motion is for an order that the expert report of Dr. Lawrence Gould dated March 25, 2004 on the calculation of interest, not be received in evidence by the Tribunal, or alternatively, that certain portions be struck.\n[4] CEP requests that the remainder of Ms. Blackstaffe's cross-examination by Bell be limited in time and specifically suggests an end date of September 14, 2004.\nA. Bell's reconsideration request - Cross-Examination on the AT&T Study [5] In her examination in chief, Ms. Blackstaffe testified that the Subcommittee for the Joint Study visited New Jersey to discuss with representatives of AT&T and CWA, their job evaluation study. Bell vigorously objected to this evidence because Ms. Blackstaffe had no direct personal knowledge of the AT&T Study. Bell also objected that this evidence was not relevant, the AT&T Study was never implemented and thus could not be used to evaluate the Joint Study. Bell was also concerned that Ms. Blackstaffe's evidence was hearsay, based on what she had been told by persons involved in the AT&T Study who could not be cross-examined.\n[6] The Tribunal concluded that Ms. Blackstaffe could be asked about the Subcommittee's visit to New Jersey, the information she obtained and what use was made by the Subcommittee of this information. Subsequently, Bell discounted its previous objections and sought to cross-examine Ms. Blackstaffe on the AT&T Study, specifically as to the difference between the point scores given to splicers versus operators at AT&T as compared to the point scores for these two jobs in the Joint Study. The Tribunal did not allow this questioning to continue because it involved direct knowledge of the AT&T Study and required an evaluative comparison. Ms. Blackstaffe was not qualified in either case.\n[7] In Bell's Outline of the Cross-examination of CEP Witness, Patricia Blackstaffe, dated June 30, 2004 and provided to the Tribunal, Bell states that the cross-examination on the AT&T Study is important for evaluative purposes so that one can properly appreciate the complete lack of reliability of the audit results. This alleged lack of reliability is to be proved by comparison of the AT&T Study process to the Joint Study process.\n[8] In oral submissions on this matter, Bell's position is that the cross-examination on the AT&T Study would not involve any comparison to the Joint Study. Rather Bell proposes to ask Ms. Blackstaffe what she learned about the AT&T Study and how she used such information; why she hired a consultant to review the AT&T Study; its value in the pay equity negotiations between Bell and CEP in 1988-1990, and finally, whether the Joint Committee was given any information relating to the AT&T Study.\n[9] In our opinion, these proposed questions parallel to a large extent what CEP asked Ms. Blackstaffe in chief. We have concluded that Bell can cross-examine Ms. Blackstaffe on the AT&T Study, but the questions must be strictly limited to the matters outlined in the preceding paragraph.\nB. The Terms of Reference - Joint Study [10] As we understand from Bell's Outline for the Cross-Examination and oral submissions, Bell wants to establish through cross-examination of Ms. Blackstaffe that decision-making for the Joint Study was located not in the Joint Committee as per the Terms of Reference. But, in fact, was relocated to the Subcommittee. Bell alleges that this was achieved by Ms. Blackstaffe, so that CEP was able to unduly influence the results of the Joint Study.\n[11] The Tribunal has heard extensive evidence from both Linda Wu and Ms. Blackstaffe relating to the negotiations leading to the adoption by the parties of the Terms of Reference. More to the point, there has been exhaustive evidence from Ms. Wu and more particularly Ms. Blackstaffe, pertaining to the operations of the Subcommittee. Ms. Blackstaffe has produced voluminous documentation including hand-written notes, meeting agendas of the two committees, memoranda to CEP officials, minutes of Subcommittee and Joint Committee meetings and much more documentation, all of which show how the Subcommittee operated, the decisions it made and the role it played in the Joint Study, all in contrast to the role of the Joint Committee. Ms. Blackstaffe was cross-examined in great detail on this documentation.\n[12] In our opinion, there is no need for any further evidence on this matter for Bell to pursue its allegations. Further cross-examination on the Terms of Reference would add little if anything to the Tribunal's knowledge and understanding of this area.\nC. Training of the Joint Committee [13] Bell asserts that the Joint Committee did not receive adequate training on job evaluation or pay equity. Bell alleges that Ms. Blackstaffe had much more expertise and used this to CEP's advantage. It is not clear for the Tribunal just what the nature of Bell's cross-examination will be. The Tribunal will deal with the appropriate scope of Bell's cross-examination on this matter if and when any objections are made.\nD. Dr. Gould's expert report on the calculation of interest [14] Bell's motion is that the Tribunal not receive in evidence the report of Professor Lawrence Gould on the calculation of interest. At this point in the hearing, Dr. Gould has not been called as a witness nor has the Tribunal been apprised of his qualifications. We understand that it is at the request of CEP that Bell brought this motion at this time, rather than at the time when Dr. Gould is to testify. CEP made the request of Bell to avoid any delay in the hearing and to provide certainty for Dr. Gould as to if and when he would be testifying.\n[15] In our view, the timing of this motion is ill advised. Bell has made it clear that if it does not succeed on this motion, it reserves its right to cross-examine Dr. Gould on his qualifications and make further objections to his expert report if so advised. The Tribunal having learned this, indicated to the parties that this motion would be better dealt with after the Tribunal has heard from Dr. Gould about his qualifications and how these relate to the purpose and scope of his report. The parties resisted this suggestion.\n[16] We do not see any useful purpose being served by hearing this motion now. CEP intends to call a number of witnesses before Dr. Gould. As to when he would testify is not predictable. Bell intends to cross-examine Dr. Gould on his qualifications so that any contemplated time saving is illusory. Finally, it is not particularly advisable for this Tribunal to deal with the admissibility of potentially important expert evidence without knowing anything about the qualifications of the witness, except as set out in Dr. Gould's draft, expert report which has been left to the Tribunal to plow through with no guidance from the parties.\n[17] The Tribunal has concluded that this motion is premature and untimely for the reasons set out above. Accordingly, the Tribunal will not decide this motion at this time. This is without prejudice to Bell to bring this motion or any other motion regarding the proposed evidence of Dr. Gould at some future time. It is also without prejudice to CEP to offer any arguments in response to any motion by Bell.\nE. CEP's request to limit the cross-examination of Ms Blackstaffe [18] CEP seeks to limit Bell's cross-examination of Ms. Blackstaffe to 10 or 12 more days. From what the Tribunal has heard to date, it appears that what is primarily if not entirely, driving this request, is Ms. Blackstaffe's desire to complete her cross-examination because of her job pressures.\n[19] Ms. Blackstaffe's cross-examination commenced on December 15, 2003. As of June 30, 2004 it had not yet been completed. From December 15, 2003 to June 30, 2004, Ms. Blackstaffe was on the witness stand for approximately 26 days. In the same period, the Tribunal had scheduled 57 hearing days. Thirty-one hearing days were cancelled at the instance of the parties. There were various reasons for this including, counsel mistaking the date for school break holidays, the witness attending other meetings, counsel providing further and late document disclosure, and medical\/personal reasons. It is obvious that if the hearing had proceeded as scheduled, or even on most of the scheduled dates, Ms. Blackstaffe's cross-examination and any re-examination would have been completed on or before June 30, 2004.\n[20] As acknowledged by the parties, the Tribunal is the master of its own proceedings. According to Brown and Evans, Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada (Toronto: Canvasback Publishing, 2003), a tribunal has the discretion to limit cross-examination in order to keep the proceedings within reasonable bounds. Mewett and Sankoff, Witnesses (Toronto: Carswell, 2004) also recognize that the right to cross-examine is not unlimited and that courts have a discretion to limit questioning that is repetitive or prolix, but that this discretion should be exercised carefully.\n[21] CEP has identified a number of ways by which the remaining cross-examination of Ms. Blackstaffe could be shortened, as follows:\nmaintain the Tribunal's ruling on AT&T Study; limit the cross-examination to matters not already covered. The Tribunal has done this for the Terms of Reference; Counsel should not be repetitive with questions already asked. The Tribunal has previously directed this and Bell counsel has essentially complied and will continue to do so; Bell counsel should and has agreed to provide Ms. Blackstaffe with documents to read in advance of being cross-examined on them; Counsel should and will agreed in advance to enter documents on consent; the Tribunal has directed that Bell counsel should not pursue a line of questioning where Ms. Blackstaffe has indicated that she has no recollection or knowledge of the subject matter. Bell counsel has complied and will continue to comply with this direction. CEP argues that if these suggestions are adopted, then the cross-examination of Ms. Blackstaffe should take only 10 to 12 days to complete. Ergo, its request to limit her cross-examination to that time.\n[22] In our opinion, this is not a situation that calls for the Tribunal to exercise its discretion and time limit Bell's cross-examination. Bell has withdrawn the 17 questions that it proposed to ask Ms. Blackstaffe. This, plus the limits on cross-examination for the AT&T Study, no further cross-examination on the Terms of Reference, and compliance by counsel with the procedures referred to above, should reduce significantly the time required to complete Ms. Blackstaffe's cross-examination, perhaps even to the number of days suggested by CEP. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not grant CEP's request.\nSigned by\nJ.

Retention of Jurisdiction\n[1] This decision relates to remedy. In an earlier decision in this case, I determined that the Respondent, the Department of National Health and Welfare (Health Canada), had discriminated against the Complainant, Dr. Shiv Chopra (Canada (Human Rights Comm.) v. Canada (Dept. of National Health and Welfare) (No. 5) (2001), 40 C.H.R.R. D\/396 (C.H.R.T.)). At the request of the parties, I only addressed the question of the Respondent's liability under the Canadian Human Rights Act. I retained jurisdiction to hear evidence and submissions on remedy at a later time, if the parties were unable to reach an agreement in this respect.\n[2] On July 8, 2002, the Complainant notified the Tribunal that the parties had failed to come to an agreement and requested that a hearing be convened to deal with the issue of remedy.\nI. BACKGROUND [3]Dr. Chopra filed his complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) on September 16, 1992. He alleged that Health Canada had discriminated against him because of his race, colour, and national or ethnic origin, in the manner in which the management position of Director of the Bureau of Human Prescription Drugs (BHPD) was staffed between September 1990 and the spring of 1992. In 1995, a Tribunal chaired by Daniel Soberman dismissed the complaint. In 1998, the Federal Court of Canada - Trial Division reviewed and set aside that decision. The Court remitted the matter back to the Tribunal to be determined on the basis of the existing record augmented by the statistical evidence that had been excluded by the first Tribunal. In January 1999, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld the Court's decision. The additional evidence was led before me during hearings that were conducted between May 1999 and December 2000.\n[4] In my decision, I noted that Dr. Chopra was screened out of the competition for the BHPD Director's position because he lacked recent management experience. During the two-year period leading up to this competition, the indeterminate BHPD Director's position remained vacant. Dr. Chopra had requested that he be assigned to act in the position temporarily but he was turned down. Had he been appointed, he would have acquired the recent management experience that he needed to be screened into the competition. On the basis of the evidence presented, I found that the denial to Dr. Chopra of the opportunity to act in the position was due in part to discrimination on the basis of his national or ethnic origin.\n[5] However, I also observed that even if Dr. Chopra had been screened into the final competition, he would not necessarily have won. This was a question to be determined later, when addressing the issue of remedy.\nII. LEGAL FRAMEWORK [6] The Tribunal derives its remedial jurisdiction from s. 53 of the Act. The remedies contemplated therein are designed to prevent future discrimination as well as to compensate individual victims. The goal of compensation is to make the victim whole for the damage caused by the act that is the source of liability (Canada (Attorney-General) v. McAlpine (1989), 12 C.H.R.R. D\/253 at para. 13 (F.C.A.)).\n[7] Dr. Chopra is seeking an immediate appointment to an EX-level position and compensation for wage loss from 1990 to this day. To establish his entitlement to these remedies, he must demonstrate that the Respondent's discriminatory practice denied him the opportunity to gain recent management experience, which would have in turn led the way for him to act in the position and to later be screened into the final competition. This exercise is obviously speculative. The Tribunal must endeavour to turn back the clock and consider what would have happened had the discrimination not occurred. By what standard must such a determination be made?\n[8] Commission and Complainant counsel both submit that the Tribunal need only conclude that there existed a serious possibility of the occurrence of an event. For instance, if there existed a serious possibility of Dr. Chopra's winning the 1992 final competition, had he been screened in, a finding could be reached that he was denied the position because of the discriminatory act. In support of their contention, they cite the reasons given by Mr. Justice Marceau in Canada (Attorney General) v. Morgan [1992] 2 F.C. 401 (F.C.A.). The complainant in that case had attempted to enrol in the Canadian Forces but was turned down for grounds that were ultimately deemed discriminatory. The issues before the Federal Court of Appeal pertained to the remedies to which the complainant was entitled. The Court reflected on the question of how to identify the loss to be compensated. On this point, Mr. Justice Marceau wrote the following, at pages 412-13:\nI have great difficulty with the proposition adopted by the Review Tribunal and accepted by my colleague that it was sufficient to look at the probable result of the recruiting process to be able to draw the conclusion that the loss was that of a job rather than a mere opportunity. We are not dealing with the establishment of a past fact which in a civil court need only be proved on a balance of probabilities. Nor are we concerned with the relation between a particular result and its alleged cause. It seems to me that the proof of the existence of a real loss and its connection with the discriminatory act should not be confused with that of its extent. To establish that real damage was actually suffered creating a right to compensation, it was not required to prove that, without the discriminatory practice, the position would certainly have been obtained. Indeed, to establish actual damage, one does not require a probability. In my view, a mere possibility, provided it was a serious one, is sufficient to prove its reality. But, to establish the extent of that damage and evaluate the monetary compensation to which it could give rise, I do not see how it would be possible to simply disregard evidence that the job could have been denied in any event. The presence of such uncertainty would prevent an assessment of the damages to the same amount as if no such uncertainty existed. The amount would have had to be reduced to the extent of such uncertainty.\n(my emphasis)\n[9] The other two Federal Court of Appeal judges who sat on the Morgan case did not adopt the same approach. Mr. Justice MacGuigan, at page 425 of his dissenting judgment, suggested that a tribunal should look at the probableresult of the whole hiring process in determining whether a complainant is entitled to compensation for the loss of a position. Mr. Justice Mahoney opted to not articulate any position on this question. He noted that he and his colleagues all agreed that in any event, on the facts of the case, the complainant would certainly have been able to enlist but for the discrimination.\n[10] In Canada (Attorney General) v. Uzoaba[1995] 2 F.C. 569 (F.C.T.D.), Mr. Justice Rothstein explicitly referenced and adopted the test articulated by Mr. Justice Marceau in Morgan. In Canada (Attorney General) v. Green[2000] 4 F.C. 629 at para 142 (F.C.T.D.), Mr. Justice Lemieux stated that he took from Morganthe principle that if a complainant seeks to establish actual damage, losing a job, her losing a promotion, probability is not required but a possibility is sufficient provided it was a serious one. The Court went on to explain, at paragraph 151, that in making certain of its findings, it was guided by the serious possibility test in Morgan. In Nkwazi v. CSC(2001), 39 C.H.R.R. D\/237, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal applied the serious possibility test in determining whether the complainant would have succeeded in obtaining a more senior position had the respondent's act of discrimination not hindered her from competing.\n[11] Based on these and the other authorities submitted by counsel, I am satisfied that a complainant seeking a remedy with respect to a discriminatory denial of a higher employment position need only present evidence of a serious possibilityof success.\nIII. REMEDIES BEING SOUGHT BY DR. CHOPRA A. Compensation for wage loss - Acting BHPD Director [12] In my earlier decision, I found that Health Canada had discriminated against Dr. Chopra by having failed to give him the opportunity to act in the BHPD Director's position. I concluded that one of the factors for not appointing him was his national or ethnic origin, and that Health Canada's explanation for not considering him for the position (lack of recent management experience) was pretextual.\n[13] Health Canada contends that Dr. Chopra was unqualified to act in the position and that, as a result, he never would have been selected to act in the BHPD Director's position, whether or not the discrimination had occurred. This contention cannot be sustained, however. Dr. Claire Franklin was given the assignment and it was renewed thereafter even though she herself was found by the Public Service Commission Appeal Board to have not been fully qualified for the acting post. It is evident that at this stage, Health Canada was not overly concerned about whether a candidate met each of the stated qualifications. I am therefore satisfied, taking into account the evidence in this case regarding Dr. Chopra's qualifications at the time and the minimal concern for qualifications demonstrated by Health Canada, that there existed a serious possibility of Dr. Chopra's being assigned to act in the BHPD Director's position were it not for the acts of discrimination practised against him.\n[14] What would have been the length of his acting assignment? Dr. Franklin was assigned to a series of three acting term appointments from October 20, 1990, to September 20, 1991, a total of eleven months. From September 20, 1991, until February 13, 1992, Dr. Franklin no longer formally acted in the position, but she informally continued to retain the responsibilities of the position. Her classification and salary returned to the levels of her previous posting. Although Dr. Franklin had officially ceased acting in the BHPD Director's position, I am satisfied, based on the findings in my earlier decision, that her acting appointment was in effect maintained throughout this period. From February 13, 1992, to April 21, 1992, the evidence is that no one acted in the position. On April 21, 1992, the Public Service Commission confirmed Dr. Franklin's appointment as BHPD Director on an indeterminate basis. This decision was appealed but the Federal Court ultimately decided to not interfere with the appointment. Accordingly, the period in question during which the acting position was occupied consists of about sixteen months (or 68 weeks) that extended from October 20, 1990, to February 13, 1992.\n[15] On September 13, 1990, Dr. Chopra wrote to the Director-General of the Drugs Directorate, Dr. Emmanuel Somers, proposing himself as a candidate for the acting position. Dr. Chopra suggested that he and other candidates be assigned to act on a rotational basis. The most efficient of these persons would then be allowed to continue in the position indeterminately. In the circumstances, this would have been a reasonable option that Dr. Somers and Assistant Deputy Minister, Dr. Albert Liston, could have chosen to implement, were it not for the decision that they had already taken to appoint Dr. Franklin. The evidence is that acting assignments were usually given for terms not exceeding four months because when this course was followed, a formal competitive process was not required. Acting assignments that extended beyond four months were treated as appointments against which other employees could file appeals pursuant to the Public Service Employment Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-33. In the present case, although Dr. Franklin's assignments were each of a duration of four months or less, they were formally renewed two times, for a total period of eleven months.\n[16] There were at least three individuals who expressed an interest in the acting BHPD Director's position: Dr. Chopra, Dr. Franklin and Dr. Michele Brill-Edwards. Dividing the period during which Dr. Franklin occupied the position (68 weeks) by three, to reflect the number of interested candidates, would in my view be appropriate. I am not concerned by the fact that the figure derived (22 b weeks or about 5 a months) exceeds the ordinary four-month term of acting assignments. As I have said, in Dr. Franklin's case, Health Canada had no difficulty renewing and effectively extending the terms beyond this period.\n[17] Respondent counsel suggested that I should base my calculations on a period of eleven months to reflect the fact that as of September 20, 1991, Dr. Franklin had ceased acting in the position. However, as I stated earlier, the change occurred only in theory. In practice, she continued to exercise the same functions as before. The 68-week period is more realistic.\n[18] As my determination on this point is based on the assumption that the three candidates were equally interested in acting in the BHPD Director's position, I see no reason not to order that the damages for lost wages should run from the date of the first acting term. Dr. Chopra is therefore to be indemnified for all wages and other benefits that he lost over a period of 22 b weeks commencing October 20, 1990, the date when the first acting term began.\nB. Compensation for wage loss - BHPD Director, Indeterminate Position [19] Dr. Chopra is seeking compensation for wage loss in relation to the indeterminate BHPD Director's position. He claims that had he acted in the post in the months leading up to the 1992 final competition, he would have acquired the recent management experience needed to be screened in. Once screened in, he maintains that there would have existed a serious possibility of his winning the competition.\n[20] The screening guide to the competition set out certain minimal qualifications required for a candidate to advance to the second stage of his or her assessment. They relate to the individual's education, experience, official languages proficiency and previous job performance. In the screening record used by the Selection Committee, only four of the fourteen candidates considered were identified as being qualified in each of these categories, including Dr. Franklin and Dr. Brill-Edwards. Dr. Chopra was excluded because he lacked recent experience in managing a scientific or medical organization with responsibility for a number of disciplines or program activities and a budget. This deficiency is identified on the screening record with an X. However, in addition to this annotation, a question mark was placed next to Dr. Chopra's name with respect to his level of recent experience as an official spokesperson for Health Canada or other organizations on health issues encompassing multiple dimensions. While no evidence was led to fully explain the connotation of the question mark, it is obvious that this rating is not as affirmative as the check marks found elsewhere on the screening record, such as the one confirming that Dr. Chopra had the necessary educational background.\n[21] Of the four candidates who were screened in, two opted to withdraw their candidacies, and the remaining two (Dr. Franklin and Dr. Brill-Edwards) proceeded to the next stage of assessment. A separate Selection Profile was adopted for this phase, which contained the statement of qualifications found in the screening guide augmented by several new requirements. They included knowledge of management techniques, knowledge of conducting trials and tests of the safety and efficacy of drugs, knowledge of the scope and nature of drugs for human use, and knowledge of the role of government in health protection and related policies, programs, objectives and priorities. In addition, the candidate was to be assessed on his or her abilities to communicate, to manage a regulatory program, and to judge, summarize and discuss scientific and medical data. The person's leadership skills and his or her personal suitability were also factors to now be considered.\n[22] The Selection Committee concluded that Dr. Franklin was the only qualified candidate. She testified before the Tribunal during the recent set of hearings regarding remedy. She detailed in what respects she felt she satisfied the various requirements contemplated by both the screening guide and selection profile for the BHPD Director's position. For instance, from 1984 to 1990, she had managed a division within the Environmental Health Directorate of Health Canada, with a staff of about 45 persons and a budget of about $10,000,000. She had been an official spokesperson for Health Canada before numerous committees and had been interviewed by the media. She also discussed in detail the reasons for which she felt that she met the knowledge requirements for the position.\n[23] Dr. Franklin described the assessment process used by the Selection Committee. Twenty-four hours prior to her interview with the Committee, she was given a one hundred page document on a scientific topic unrelated to the field of human prescription drugs and about which none of the candidates would have had any specific knowledge. She was required to read the information overnight, assimilate it, and then make a brief presentation and answer questions during the interview. Furthermore, one hour before meeting with the Committee, the candidates were given a document about which they had to prepare a briefing note intended to be read by someone at a more senior level. The topic of this document was unrelated to human prescription drugs. Dr. Franklin recalls that her interview with the Selection Committee was long and intense. Her evidence with respect to the assessment process was not challenged.\n[24] Dr. Chopra testified at the recent hearings on remedy as well. He was asked what would have happened to him had he gained the acting experience in the BHPD Director's position. He replied that he always had excelled in his studies in multiple disciplines. He is an industrious person who, for instance, had applied himself to learn French well before it became popular or necessary to do so. He claims that his managers recognized his potential, as reflected in his being recommended for the Career Assignment Program and the Objectives Oriented Management (OOM) Program. He believes that he was more qualified than Dr. Franklin with respect to the knowledge component, since it related to scientific areas in which he had worked for years, areas about which he claims she lacked sufficient knowledge.\n[25] It was pointed out to Dr. Chopra that Dr. Franklin had about thirteen years of management experience leading up to her acting appointment to the BHPD Director's position in 1990, far in excess of the several months' experience he would have acquired had he also been rotated into the acting position. Dr. Chopra's response was that in his view, management skills constituted a minor component of the job relative to the far more important scientific knowledge skills. As such, he contended that he had would have been more qualified than Dr. Franklin had he been given the opportunity to compete against her. Yet at no time did Dr. Chopra specify in what manner he could satisfy each of the required qualifications stipulated in the Selection Profile.\n[26] Did he have experience acting as a spokesperson for Health Canada or a similar organization on sensitive health issues? Did he have knowledge of the role of government in health protection? Did he have knowledge of management techniques and approaches? Dr. Chopra and the Commission are apparently of the view that it is somehow self-evident that he possessed, or would have possessed, the necessary qualities for the position. His performance assessments were fully satisfactory. He worked within the Bureau so he must have been knowledgeable in the relevant field. He was seconded to the OOM project in 1975, and participated in a six-week management-training program in 1977, so he must have knowledge in management techniques and approaches.\n[27] Other than Dr. Chopra's personal assertions that he was more qualified than Dr. Franklin, no attempt was made to lead any specific evidence to support that claim. The Commission and the Complainant argue strenuously that such an exercise is wholly unnecessary. They submit that one need not compare the two aspirants to the position, given the serious possibility test articulated in Morgan. The Complainant is not obliged to prove that he certainly, or even probably, would have been selected for the job. If it was seriously possible for Dr. Chopra to be successful in the competition, his actual loss will have been established and all that will remain to be determined will be the extent of the damage and the evaluation of the monetary compensation to which it gives rise.\n[28] The Complainant argues that the experience he would have acquired while acting in the BHPD position, in and of itself, would have created a serious possibility of his winning the competition. In its 1992 annual report, the Public Service Commission referred with some concern to a then recent study indicating that employees who have received an acting appointment are four times more likely to receive a subsequent promotion than those who have not. In its 2000-2001 annual report, the PSC reiterated its concern about the use of acting appointments and the fact that acting incumbents have an advantage in subsequent competitive processes for the same position. The report referenced a study regarding 249 EX appointments made over two three-month periods in 1998 and 1999. The study showed that of 83 candidates who acted in a position prior to staffing, 77 (or about 93%) won the competition for that position.\n[29] The Respondent led evidence to demonstrate that the data from this last study is incomplete. For instance, there was no way of knowing whether more than one person had acted in those 77 positions nor whether the periods studied were in any way representative. The study's writer, Madeleine Desroches, testified that she selected the periods at random. She also acknowledged that she identified the 83 candidates based principally on information she culled from several forms prepared in the course of the appointment processes. Apparently there was no obligation on the part of the employer to note in these forms whether the position had been previously staffed on an acting basis. This, therefore, allowed for the possibility that Ms. Desroches may have failed to identify all of the cases where someone had acted prior to the indeterminate staffing action.\n[30] The Respondent contends that if this type of analysis is to be conducted at all, it should be focussed on Health Canada. Of the 25 acting EX-1 level appointments of four months or longer between July 1990 and July 1993, only six of the employees were later promoted into EX level positions on an indeterminate basis (about 24%). Of the ten acting EX-2 level appointments of four months or longer during the same period, four were later promoted (40%). The combined percentage would be about 29%.\n[31] I do not find the concerns raised by the Respondent with respect to the PSC data to be significant. It is certainly possible that the employer omitted to note in some of the forms that the position had been previously staffed on an acting basis, but the fact remains that in 93% of those cases where the form contained sufficient information, it was found that the acting candidates were subsequently promoted to the position. This evidence must surely have been compelling enough to cause the PSC to bring the issue up in its 2001-2002 annual report. I also cannot ignore the fact that the PSC had conducted another study prior to its 1992 report that drew a similar conclusion: those who act in a position are more likely to receive a subsequent promotion than those who have not. No evidence was led to contradict the 1992 PSC study, which falls precisely into the period when the BHPD Director's position was being staffed. Even when one turns to the Health Canada data presented by the Respondent, the percentages do not rule out a serious possibility of success for persons who act in the position.\n[32] These findings all lead me to conclude that had Dr. Chopra acted in the BHPD Director's position for just over five months, a mere but serious possibility would have existed of his later being successful in the final competition for the indeterminate position.\n[33] The story does not end there, however. It may be that Dr. Chopra suffered this loss but, as Mr. Justice Marceau noted in Morgan, supra, to establish the extent of Dr. Chopra's damage and evaluate the monetary compensation to which it gave rise, evidence of any uncertainty related to Dr. Chopra's acceding to the position cannot be ignored. The damage award must be reduced to the extent of such uncertainty.\n[34] I have already identified many of the elements giving rise to uncertainty in this case. The selection process was very complicated and some of the testing procedures were deliberately organized so as to not provide any advantage to persons already working within the Bureau of Human Prescriptions Drugs. With respect to Dr. Chopra's particular case, I have no specific evidence before me of whether he would have satisfied the criteria set out in the Selection Profile and to what extent. His most recent management experience would have been limited to his acting assignment of just over five months. In accordance with my earlier findings, Dr. Brill Edwards and Dr. Franklin would also have gained the same experience. However, the evidence is that Dr. Franklin had additional and extensive management experience, far in excess of Dr. Chopra's.\n[35] It should also not be forgotten that although Dr. Brill-Edwards was screened into the competition, she was not found to be qualified for the position. Being screened in does not necessarily mean you are qualified. In Dr. Chopra's case, there also remained the issue of the question mark that had been entered on his screening record with respect to his experience as an official spokesperson. I am equally mindful that this case does not involve jobs of a generic nature. The evidence is uncontroverted that each EX position is unique, requiring different skill sets, abilities, knowledge and education. Acceding to an EX position is by no means simple or automatic.\n[36] Taking all of these elements into account, I am satisfied that the Complainant's wage loss should be reduced by two thirds (b) to reflect the relatively high level of uncertainty of his being successful in the final competition.\n[37] There is another factor to be considered as well. As noted by the Federal Court of Appeal in McAlpine, supra, at paragraph 13, only such loss as is reasonably foreseeable is recoverable. The victim of discrimination must therefore demonstrate that he has taken reasonable steps to mitigate his loss (see Morgan, supra at para. 14). For instance, in the present case, the Complainant must show that he took steps to improve his chances of successfully competing for an EX-level position and that he applied for such positions when the opportunity arose.\n[38] In 1997, Dr. Chopra was named Acting Chief of the Central Nervous System, Endocrine and Antiparasitic Drugs Division, Bureau of Veterinary Drugs, in which position he gained four months of line management experience. Yet in the ensuing years, he never entered any competition for promotion to the EX level. In 2002, Dr. Chopra was offered the opportunity to act as Leader for the Microbiological Safety Team in the Human Safety Division. Dr. Chopra claimed in his testimony that he refused this offer out of protest because this sort of staffing action would have been unfair to his fellow employees. However, in his letter of refusal, he gave as his reason for turning down the offer the fact that the position would effectively not constitute a promotion for him. As a VM-4 level employee, acting in the proposed REM-01 level position would not have been treated as a promotion. Be that as it may, had he accepted the position, he would have gained additional critical line management experience. Evidence was led in this case that employees often accept new positions even if they technically do not constitute promotions just for the purpose of gaining experience for future advancement.\n[39] Overall, aside from the 1993 Bureau of Veterinary Drugs competition, to which I referred in my previous decision, no evidence was led to indicate that Dr. Chopra had since applied for any other promotions to indeterminate positions at the EX level. He was screened out of two competitions for positions at the VM-5 level, and this only occurred fairly recently, in 2002. It may be that Dr. Chopra did not perceive himself as having any chance of success, or that he felt some level of frustration with his previous attempts at being promoted. But the fact remains that the only finding of discrimination with respect to Dr. Chopra relates to the staffing of the acting BHPD Director's position in 1990. In my previous decision in this case, I found that prior to 1990, Dr. Chopra had failed to seize upon several opportunities for advancement when they arose. He was unwilling to search for promotions in areas that were not directly within his scientific field of expertise, even though in respect of EX employees, senior management skills are generally more important than expertise in a particular scientific discipline. I concluded that no inference of discrimination could be drawn from this period. The evidence suggests that this pattern has continued to this day. I am not persuaded that the Complainant has taken all reasonable measures to mitigate his damages.\n[40] Considering these shortfalls with respect to Dr. Chopra's duty to mitigate his damages, I find that the Complainant's entitlement to compensation should be limited to a period of six years following the date when the PSC confirmed Dr. Franklin's appointment to the position, April 21, 1992.\n[41] To summarize, the Complainant is entitled to a sum equivalent to one third (a) of his lost wages and benefits at the EX-2 level over a period of six years, commencing April 21, 1992 and ending April 20, 1998.\nC. Compensation for wage loss beyond the EX-2 level [42] Dr. Chopra is claiming compensation for wage loss with respect to subsequent promotions that he would have received after obtaining the indeterminate BHPD Director's position in 1992. He submits that he would have reached the EX-3 level by about 1995, the EX-4 level by 1998, and the EX-5 level by 2001.\n[43] In support of this claim, Dr. Chopra led the evidence of Dr. John Samuel, Ph.D., who testified as an expert in systemic discrimination and career progression in the Federal Public Service. Dr. Samuel described the efforts that have been made since the early 1990's to promote the upward mobility of visible minorities within the Federal Public Service as a result of which visible minorities could have gained an advantage in the promotions process. In Dr. Samuel's opinion, had Dr. Chopra secured an initial foothold into the EX level, he would have benefited from these efforts, adding that it is quite likely Dr. Chopra would have risen within the EX ranks given his capabilities, determination and tenacity.\n[44] I have difficulty accepting Dr. Samuel's findings. First of all, it is not clear by what measure he has reached his conclusion regarding Dr. Chopra's capabilities, determination and tenacity. It appears that Dr. Samuel basically reviewed Dr. Chopra's curriculum vitaeand concluded that he is a highly motivated individual whose capabilities went far beyond the kind of positions he has been able to occupy in the Public Service. Dr. Samuel suggested that the career progression of other EX-level employees indicated that the Complainant would have successfully advanced to the highest levels of management. Yet Dr. Samuel's analysis of the career paths of employees who would have been Dr. Chopra's peers at the EX-2 level in 1992 was incomplete and inconclusive. Only a few individuals were studied and it was revealed on cross-examination that many of them were not appropriate comparators.\n[45] Dr. Samuel referred to a handful of visible minority group members who held very senior executive posts over the last decade. However, few if any of these individuals would have been Dr. Chopra's peers at the EX-2 level in 1992. No comparison was conducted between the progression of visible minority group and non-visible minority group employees in support of his contention that Dr. Chopra would have benefited from the Government's policy of encouraging the promotion of minority group members, advancing to the level of Assistant Deputy Minister by 1998, as envisaged by Dr. Samuel. I also have some concern about the expert's objectivity. He demonstrated an affinity for the Complainant and his cause, and a predisposition against the Respondent. He declared at one point, for instance, that he did not trust even the most basic employment and career progression data produced by Health Canada because in his view, Health Canada's cultural assessment is not favourable and the department is not very conducive to people with certain backgrounds.\n[46] However, irrespective of the probity of the expert's evidence, I am simply not persuaded that Dr. Chopra's denial of a promotion to the EX-3 level or beyond was a serious possibility. Let us not forget that the Respondent's discriminatory conduct related to its failure to appoint Dr. Chopra to the acting BHPD Director's position in 1990. It is far too remote and speculative to conclude that even a serious possibility would have existed of Dr. Chopra's reaching the highest echelons of senior management merely because he would have acted in the Director's position for a little over five months, especially when one also factors in the mitigation concerns discussed earlier as well as the unique nature of every EX position. No person can assume that advancement within the EX ranks will come automatically in the normal course of his or her career. The Complainant's claim for wage loss compensation beyond the EX-2 level is denied.\nD. Compensation for wage loss - another EX-level position [47] I have already found that there existed significant uncertainty with respect to the Complainant's likelihood of winning the BHPD Director's competition in 1992. The Complainant argues, however, that even if he had not been successful on this occasion, the recent management experience that he would have acquired while acting in this position would have resulted in his being appointed to another EX-level position at some point in his career.\n[48] I am not persuaded that this would have been the case. As I have already discussed, the appointments process to the senior management level can be distinguished from that of lower employment levels. The qualifications for each position are unique and the competition to gain entry into EX-level positions appears to be quite intense. Dr. Samuel acknowledged in his evidence, for instance, that there were typically thousands of applicants for the hundreds of EX-level jobs he has analyzed as part of his past research studies.\n[49] The mere fact that Dr. Chopra would have acquired five to six months' management experience were it not for the discrimination does not result in there being a serious possibility of his being appointed to an EX position later in his career. An obvious distinction is to be drawn from my finding with respect to the EX-2 BHPD Director's competition of 1992. In that instance, the acting experience he would have acquired within that very positionled me to conclude that there existed a mere but serious possibility of his winning the competition. I cannot draw the same conclusion with respect to any of the other EX positions that were staffed over the course of the last twelve years, and even more so when considering that no evidence was led identifying a specific EX-level position for which Dr. Chopra would have become more qualified had he acquired the recent management experience in the Acting BHPD Director's position. Indeed, the Complainant did manage to acquire recent management experience five years later, in 1997, when he served as an Acting Chief of a division. Nonetheless, this has not, in and of itself, led to his gaining an appointment to an indeterminate EX-level position in the ensuing years.\n[50] For these reasons, I am not convinced that merely by serving as Acting BHPD Director for just over five months in 1990-91, there would have developed a serious possibility of the Complainant's later gaining an indeterminate appointment to a different EX-level position.\nE. Dr. Chopra's Claim for an Immediate Appointment to an EX-level Position [51] In addition to his claim for lost wages, the Complainant is seeking an order from the Tribunal that he be appointed immediately to an EX-level position. Although I have concluded that but for the discrimination, there existed a mere but serious possibility of his having won the 1992 BHPD Director's position, I have also reduced the award of compensation to account for the considerable uncertainty relating to his being successful in that competition and the shortfalls regarding his duty to mitigate his loss, in accordance with the Morgantest. As such, I am satisfied that full restitution of the Complainant's loss with respect to his loss of a promotion has been made. Under these circumstances, an order that Dr. Chopra now be appointed to an EX-level is not justified.\nF. Gross-up for Income Tax Liability [52]The lump-sum payment to Dr. Chopra with respect to wages that he would have otherwise earned over several years may result in an unexpected increase to his income tax burden. I therefore direct the Respondent to pay Dr. Chopra an additional amount sufficient to cover any additional income tax liability he may incur as a result of the payment.\nG. Non-pecuniary Damages [53] The act of discrimination in this case occurred in 1990, prior to the 1998 Bill S-5 amendments to the Act. Under the older version of s. 53(3) of the Act, a victim could only seek non-pecuniary damages up to a maximum of $5,000. The amended version of the Actallows for compensation of up to $20,000 for pain and suffering (s.53(2) e)), and an additional sum of up to $20,000 if the Tribunal finds that the person who engaged in the discriminatory practice did so in a wilful or reckless manner (s.53(3)).\n[54] Dr. Chopra contends that he is entitled to compensation under the newer provisions of the Act. In Nkwazi, supra, at paragraphs 257-270, the Tribunal held that these provisions did not have retrospective effect and therefore could not be applied to cases where the discriminatory conduct occurred prior to the coming into force of the amendments to the Act. Counsel for the Complainant respectfully submits that this interpretation is in error. I have carefully reviewed the Nkwazidecision as well as the authorities referenced by Complainant Counsel, but I am not persuaded by his arguments. I am instead in agreement with the conclusions of the Tribunal in Nkwazi. Dr. Chopra's claim for non-pecuniary damages therefore remains subject to the older version of the Act.\n[55] Dr. Chopra testified as to the emotional strain and embarrassment he experienced as a result of his inability to elevate himself to an EX-level position. He spoke of his discomfort at work and of being shunned by others, due in large part to the publicity he has attracted. I am mindful, however, that some of this publicity may be attributable to issues that are not related to the present complaint.\n[56] When assessing this award, the maximum amount of $5,000 must be reserved for the very worst cases that fall within the range (Premakumar v. Air Canada(2002), C.H.R.R. D\/63 at para. 107 (C.H.R.T.); Desormeaux v. Ottawa Carleton Regional Transit Commission2003 CHRT 2 at para. 128). Having considered all of the circumstances in this case, I order the Respondent to pay to the Complainant the sum of $3,500 in special compensation, pursuant to s. 53(3) of the older version of the Act.\nH. Interest [57] The Complainant and the Commission contend that interest should be awarded on the basis of the rates established in accordance with the Ontario Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C-43, given that the discrimination occurred in Ontario, the province in which Dr. Chopra also resides. They allege that the Canada Savings Bond (CSB) rates are conservative and will not satisfactorily remedy the loss suffered by the Complainant. I am not persuaded of this. No evidence was led to demonstrate how CSB, or other rates set by the Bank of Canada for that matter, would not result in the Complainant's gaining full restitution for his loss. Did these rates, for instance, fall below the rate of inflation over the same period? It was argued that there have been lengthy delays in this case, none of which were the fault of the Complainant. That may be, but I do not believe that any blame can be attributed to the Respondent either. The delays came about in large part because of the sinuous course his case has taken, from Tribunal to the Federal Court and back.\n[58] The Tribunal has adopted the Bank Rate (Monthly series) set by the Bank of Canada in its recent decisions and I see no reason for not applying this rate in the present case (see Bushey v. Sharma2003 CHRT 21 at para. 147; Groupe d'aide et d'information sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au travail de la province de Qu\u00e9bec Inc. v. Barbe2003 CHRT 24 at para. 77; Boudreault v. Great Circle Marine Services Inc.2004 CHRT 21 at para. 117).\n[59] I am not persuaded that interest should be compounded either, as proposed by the Complainant. Compound interest is warranted only if it can be deduced from the evidence or circumstances of the case that it was required to cover the loss (see Morgan, supraat 420). Aside from the long period between the date of the complaint (September 16, 1992) and the date of my decision (August 13, 2001), I do not see any circumstances in this case to distinguish it from any other complaint that typically comes before the Tribunal. I have already explained that I do not attribute the delay to the fault of anyone. I am not convinced that the delay creates any special circumstances that would result in the Complainant's not being fully compensated through the payment of simple interest.\n[60] Simple interest is therefore payable with respect to all of the monetary awards made in this decision. The interest shall be calculated on a yearly basis at a rate equivalent to the Bank Rate (Monthly series) set by the Bank of Canada. The interest with respect to wage loss shall be calculated as the wages would have become payable, in accordance with the findings in this decision.\n[61] With respect to the award for non-pecuniary damages, interest shall be payable from October 20, 1990. However, in no case shall the interest be allowed to exceed the maximum allowable sum of $5000 (Canada (Attorney General) v. Hebert(1995), C.H.R.R. D\/375 at para. 23 (F.C.T.D.).\nI. Public Posting of Decision [62] The Complainant is seeking an order that this decision be posted publicly within Health Canada's facilities and distributed across the country via internal electronic mail to all employees of the department. It is argued that such a publication will serve the educational function of human rights legislation. The Respondent opposes this request.\n[63] I do not think such an order is needed. I fail to see how a mass e-mailing and large-scale publication of a decision discussing the details of the compensation to which the Complainant is entitled can significantly serve to promote human rights. One must not forget that this was a case of individual discrimination. I did not make any findings of systemic discrminiation. Furthermore, there already was widespread coverage of this case in the national media when my previous decision was issued and the Complainant made no request for public posting prior to its release. In any event, this and all previous decisions regarding the complaint are and will remain accessible to the public on the Internet. The Tribunal's website is www.chrt-tcdp.gc.ca.\nIV. Retention of Jurisdiction [64] I retain jurisdiction in the event a dispute may arise with respect to the quantification or implementation of any of the remedies awarded in this decision.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

MATERIAL FACTS [1] This matter involves ten complaints brought to the Canadian Human Rights Commission between October 1992 and July 1994.\n[2] Each of the complainants reached their prescribed retirement age prior to September 3, 1992. However, none of the complainants were released from the Canadian Armed Forces until after September 3, 1992.\n[3] Prior to September 3, 1992, each of the complainants were required to take fully paid leave made up of a combination of different forms of leave including: accumulated leave (i.e. accumulated annual leave), annual leave (i.e. annual leave for the year of release), special leave and rehabilitation leave in accordance with the QR&O and the Canadian Armed Forces Administrative Orders. This leave is collectively referred to as retirement leave in article 16.18 of the QR&O. The complainants were required under the QR&O to take this leave prior to their release.\n[4] The complainants received their full salary and benefits and accumulated full pensionable time while on leave prior to release. They were not required to report for active duty during their leave but were subject to being recalled to report for active duty at any time until their release from the CAF.\n[5] All of the complainants were released from the CAF after September 3, 1992.\nII. BACKGROUND [6] On August 14, 1992 the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal issued its decision in Martin et al. v. Canada (Dept. of National Defence) (1992), 17 C.H.R.R. D\/435. The Tribunal held that articles 15.17 and 15.31 of the Queen's Regulations and Orders were not regulations made for the purpose of paragraph 15(1)(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act and, accordingly, could not justify the discriminatory practice of compulsory retirement.\n[7] On September 3, 1992, the Governor in Council amended articles 15.17 and 15.31 of the QR&O to comply with paragraph 15(1)(b) of the CHRA, thereby rendering the compulsory retirement provisions operative from that day forward.\n[8] The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal subsequently confirmed in Carter v. Canadian Armed Forces, [2000] C.H.R.D. No. 1 No. T.D. 2\/00, aff'd, [2001] F.C.J. No. 1922 (F.C.T.D.); [2003] F.C.J. No. 212 (F.C.A.), that the amendment to articles 15.17 and 15.31 of the QR&O on September 3, 1992, put an end to the discriminatory practice that occurred with the release of Mr. Carter on May 27, 1992, because he had reached the compulsory retirement age. Accordingly, the Tribunal concluded that the Canadian Forces were not required to pay damages for lost wages after September 3, 1992.\nIII. QUESTION IN ISSUE [9] The issue for the Tribunal in this proceeding is whether the requirement that the complainants take their retirement leave prior to September 3, 1992, is a discriminatory practice contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA.\nIV. ARGUMENT OF THE COMMISSION [10] The Commission argues that the complainants were compelled to take retirement leave under the CAF retirement policy when such policy was found to be discriminatory.\n[11] According to the Commission, the complainants were, in effect, forced out of the workplace because of their age as compared to other CAF members. This, the Commission argues, constitutes adverse differentiation in employment, contrary to s. 7(b) of the CHRA, and is pursuant to a policy that deprived the complainants of employment opportunities, contrary to s. 10 of the CHRA.\n[12] The Commission also argues that as a result of the discriminatory practice, the complainants had a vested right to compensation that is in no way affected by the amendment to the QR&O. The QR&O amendments are not retroactive. The QR&O amendments may impact compensation, they cannot impact liability. For this proposition, the Commission relies on the Carter decision.\nV. THE ARGUMENT OF THE RESPONDENT, CAF [13] The structure of the CAF's argument is built on the decisions of the Tribunal and the Federal Court in Carter. Master Corporal Carter filed a complaint against the CAF with the Commission on August 25, 1993, alleging age discrimination, contrary to s. 7 of the CHRA. He was released from the CAF on May 27, 1992 and had been on retirement leave from June 1991 until his release. At the time of his release, the compulsory retirement provisions of QR&O 15.31 were not operative because of the Martin decision.\n[14] There was no issue that Mr. Carter, because of the discriminatory practice, was entitled to compensation. The issue was the amount of compensation. The Commission's position was that the compensation period should run for 24 months from his release date. The CAF countered that the compensation period should run from his release date, May 27, 1992 to September 3, 1992, when the CAF compulsory retirement policy was validated.\n[15] The Tribunal concluded that Mr. Carter had a vested right to compensation once it was proved that he was the victim of a discriminatory practice. And the appropriate compensation period should be from May 27, 1992 to September 3, 1992.\n[16] The Federal Court on judicial review, agreed with the Tribunal's conclusion that Mr. Carter had a vested right to compensation, but no vested right as to the amount of compensation. As to the compensation period, the Court said that there must be a causal connection between the discriminatory practice and the amount of compensation. In Mr. Carter's case, the causal connection was broken on September 3, 1992, by the amendment to the QR&O, which allowed the CAF to release Mr. Carter. It was on that date when the discriminatory practice ended.\n[17] The CAF argues that the Commission has failed to make a prima facie case for the contravention of ss. 7 & 10 of the CHRA because it has not shown that the complainants suffered any adverse consequences or lost opportunities.\n[18] The CAF points out that it was a matter of record both before the Tribunal and the Federal Court, that Mr. Carter was put on retirement leave from June 1991 to May 27, 1992. If being put on retirement leave was a discriminatory practice, then it was open to the Commission to argue that the compensation period for Mr. Carter should have started in June 1991, not May 27, 1992. But the Commission did not argue this. Rather, the Commission's position was that Mr. Carter's right to compensation crystallized on May 27, 1992, the day of his discriminatory release. Both the Tribunal and the Federal Court in their decision explicitly referred to Mr. Carter's release as being the discriminatory practice. Thus, the CAF argues, Carter stands for the proposition that the requirement to take retirement leave is not a discriminatory practice.\n[19] And with good reason, says the CAF, because there are no adverse consequences to being put on retirement leave. This is because a member of the CAF, while on retirement leave, receives everything that he would be entitled to if on active duty.\n[20] The CAF makes another argument which also focuses on release. The QR&O require retirement leave to be taken prior to release. As pointed out in Carter, Mr. Carter could have been released from the CAF as of September 3, 1992, when the CAF compulsory retirement policy was validated. All of the complainants in this case were released after September 3, 1992. Presumably, if the complainants wanted to take their retirement leave, they would have to do so prior to their release. They did so. Accordingly, there was no discriminatory practice.\nVI. DECISION [21] The argument of both the Commission and the CAF are somewhat seductive. But I have concluded that the policy of the CAF that required the complainants to take their retirement leave prior to September 3, 1992, constitutes a discriminatory practice contrary to ss. 7(b) and 10 of the CHRA. As stated earlier, the complainants were taken out of active duty and put in retirement status, although still on the CAF roster. They became stay at home soldiers. Many of the complainants wanted to continue on active service as demonstrated by their requests for an extension of service. Some were granted, some were not.\n[22] In my view, it is not accurate to say that there were no adverse consequences because the complainants received the same benefits that they would have received if on active service. There are other benefits in addition to salary and pension benefits that are available to those on active duty, but not to those on retirement leave. Promotion, occupation transfers, would be examples. Undoubtedly, the CAF offers educational training, upgrading of a member's trade or occupation, leadership courses, all of which could enhance a CAF member's career opportunities.\n[23] Another adverse impact was poignantly described by Chief Justice Dickson in Reference re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta) [1987] 1 S.C.R. 313, 368, where he said:\n\"Work is one of the most fundamental aspects in a person's life, providing the individual with a means of financial support and, as importantly, a contributory role in society. A person's employment is an essential component of his or her sense of identify, self-worth and emotional well-being\".\n[24] Further, I do not accept the CAF's contention that Carter decided that retirement leave is not a discriminatory practice. Although it was open to the Commission to argue this in Carter, its failure to do so is not determinative in this case. Nor can it be said that the Federal Court, by referring to the discriminatory practice being Mr. Carter's release on May 27, 1992, conclusively decided that Mr. Carter's retirement leave could not be a discriminatory practice. It must be remembered that in Carter, liability for the CAF's retirement policy was not in issue, only compensation. Neither the Tribunal nor the Federal Court was asked to consider a compensation period running from the date of retirement leave instead of the date of the release. In my opinion, whether or not being put on retirement leave prior to September 3, 1992 was a discriminatory practice, remained an open question after Carter.\n[25] Finally, there is the argument of the CAF that the compulsory release policy was immunized by the September 3, 1992 amendment to the QR&O. And, because retirement leave is an incident of the former, it also is immunized.\n[26] To accept this argument would require that the amendment to the QR&O be given retroactive application. What was once discriminatory before the amendment is no longer discriminatory because of the amendment. The amendment to QR&O 15.17 and 15.31 did not expressly provide for retroactive application, nor did the CAF argue that it had this effect.\n[27] For the reasons set out above, I have concluded that the CAF policy requiring the complainants to take retirement leave prior to September 3, 1992 was a discriminatory practice contrary to s. 7(b) and s. 10 of the CHRA. The result is that the complainants have a claim for compensation because of the discriminatory practice. As to the amount of the compensation, if any, that is left to another day.\nSigned by\nJ.

Hadjis\n2004 CHRT 29\n2004\/08\/20\nI. FACTS\nII. LEGAL FRAMEWORK\nIII. ANALYSIS\nIV. REMEDY\nV. RETENTION OF JURISDICTION\n[1] The Complainant alleges that the Respondent sexually harassed her in contravention of s.14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Neither the Complainant nor the Respondent were represented by legal counsel at the hearing, and the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) opted to not appear at all.\nI. FACTS [2] The Complainant and the Respondent were employed as bus operators by Penetang Midland Coach Lines (PMCL), based in Toronto. They had become friends on the job, having had occasion to work together on several one-day charters. In August 1999, PMCL sent both drivers to the Canadian Forces Base in Petawawa, Ontario. This was the first time they had worked together out of town for more than one day. The charter was scheduled to last for about a week and consisted of their shuttling Canadian Forces personnel to and from their military exercises. They worked from ten to fifteen hours per day.\n[3] While in Petawawa, they stayed at a local hotel. They had separate rooms, the doors of which faced each other. The Complainant claims that about two or three days into the assignment, she came back to the hotel at about 8 p.m., after completing her shift. She changed out of her work clothes and into a sweatshirt and shorts. Around 9:00 p.m., the Respondent telephoned the Complainant from his room asking if she wanted to do anything that evening. They decided to watch television together in her room and he came over several minutes later.\n[4] According to the Complainant, her room had two double beds. She sat on one and he sat on the other, while they both watched television. At some point, she nodded off to sleep. She woke up at about 3 a.m. and found the Respondent lying on her bed next to her. He was nude and was touching her with his hand below the waist in her private area. She immediately sat up and told him to stop. He laughed at her, but she insisted that he leave. He got up, put on his clothes and left the room, the whole time still laughing.\n[5] The Complainant stayed in her room the remainder of the night, unable to sleep. At about 3:30 a.m., she called a friend to tell him what had happened. He advised her to call the police, but she said that she would not do so before speaking to her dispatcher, Gord Tuttle.\n[6] She called Mr. Tuttle in the morning and recounted to him what had occurred. Mr. Tuttle suggested sending up another driver to replace her but she told him not to bother, as the charter was to be ending shortly. She assured Mr. Tuttle that in the meantime, she would deal with the problem herself until her return to Toronto. She also explained to him that she had decided to not call the police because it would result in her and the Respondent no longer being available to work, leaving the assignment short-staffed. She decided to put her duty to perform her job ahead of the other matter. The Complainant testified at the hearing that an additional reason for her unwillingness to call the authorities was that she had the misfortune of being a victim of a serious crime in her youth and she suffered emotionally during the ensuing criminal proceedings. She did not want to undergo a similar experience again.\n[7] Later that morning, when she went to pick up her bus at the military base, she found the Respondent standing next to his. He approached her and asked if she was the type of girl who would report this, presumably to her employer or to the authorities. She just told him to stay the fuck away, and walked to her bus. She worked the remaining days of her assignment and drove her bus back to Toronto alone on the last day, Sunday, August 29, 1999.\n[8] The Respondent denies the incident, as alleged by the Complainant. He acknowledges that he went over to her room that evening but he denies ever being in bed in the nude with her, nor touching her private parts. He claims that while they were watching television, he massaged her back at her request, for a matter of several minutes only. They then both returned to watching television. At some point, he noticed that the Complainant had fallen asleep. He continued watching the program for a while longer and then got up, put on his shoes and left the room while the Complainant was still asleep.\n[9] On Monday, August 30th, her first day back at work in Toronto, the Complainant reported the incident to her supervisor, Greg Pockneil. He asked her to put her complaint in writing. About one week later, Mr. Pockneil convened her to a meeting at which the Respondent and the branch manager, Gord Moodie, were also present. After hearing both sides of the story, Mr. Pockneil and Mr. Moodie told the parties that they would consider the matter and get back to them.\n[10] In the ensuing weeks, the employer arranged the working assignments so as to ensure that the Complainant and the Respondent never worked together. However, she could not help but run into him occasionally at the workplace, at the beginning or end of her shifts. She claims that one day in September 1999, the Respondent parked his bus at such an angle that she could not exit her car from her parking space. She asked him to make room but he refused. She complained to one of the managers who in turn instructed the Respondent to move his bus. She contends that the Respondent's conduct was in retaliation to her having complained to the employer that he had sexually harassed her while on the trip to Petawawa.\n[11] According to the Complainant, the employer never disciplined the Respondent over the alleged hotel room incident. She found it uncomfortable to continue running into him in the company's yard. She deliberately avoided going into the dispatch room in order to preclude coming into any contact with him. Rumours began spreading at the workplace about the incident. She claims that the Respondent had been making accusations to others that she was a racist (the Respondent is a member of a visible minority group). She made numerous requests to her employer that the Respondent be fired. Yet, as the months passed, nothing happened and finally, on December 17, 1999, she resigned from her position. In her letter of resignation, she claimed that she was leaving in part because she had been sexually assaulted by another worker and nothing was done about it.\nII. LEGAL FRAMEWORK [12] According to s. 14(1)(c) of the Act, it is a discriminatory practice to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination in matters related to employment. The prohibited grounds include sex (s. 3(1)). Section 14(2) specifies that sexual harassment is deemed to be harassment on a prohibited ground.\n[13] Sexual harassment is broadly defined as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse job-related consequences for the victims of harassment. Sexual harassment in the workplace attacks the dignity and self-respect of the victim, both as an employee and as a human being. (Janzen v. Platy Enterprises Inc. [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252).\nIII. ANALYSIS [14] I am satisfied on the evidence that the hotel room incident took place, as alleged by the Complainant. Her evidence at the hearing was unwavering and forthright. She recalled the circumstances in detail.\n[15] The Respondent's recollection of the events, on the other hand, was patchy. He initially testified that the Complainant's hotel room had only one bed and that they both watched television while lying down on it. He changed his position later in his evidence, testifying that he was not sure if it was one bed or two. He does not recall when he left, claiming that he also dozed off. His lack of specific recall is odd considering that the Complainant's formal complaint against him and the meeting with their supervisors occurred only days after their return to Toronto. It is not as if the accusation was made against him months after the event's occurrence. The Respondent's testimony at the hearing to the effect that he gave the Complainant a back rub for a few minutes at her request appeared improvised and lacked any credibility.\n[16] The Respondent called into question Complainant's decision not to report the event to the police, suggesting that her failure to do so is indication that the incident never took place. To support his contention, the Respondent sought to introduce evidence that the Complainant had no difficulty calling authorities to report other acts committed against her in the past. He cross-examined the Complainant with respect to a series of sensitive, personal matters regarding her prior relationships. The Complainant did not raise any objection to these questions and readily acknowledged that she called the police after a violent attack against her by a former boyfriend, resulting in her hospitalization. She also disclosed that she notified the police to complain that her ex-husband had been returning to her household and harassing her children. I accept her interpretation that these incidents were of a more serious nature than the incident alleged against the Respondent and warranted police intervention.\n[17] Moreover, I am not persuaded that this evidence lends any credence to the Respondent's contention that the incident in the hotel room never took place. The Complainant was clearly committed to her work, as evidenced by the enormous efforts she made one night in Petawawa to repair the Respondent's bus, which he had abandoned by the side of the road. When she called him at his hotel room to assist her, he refused, and she was forced to call upon Canadian Forces personnel to help get the vehicle working. I have no difficulty believing the Complainant's claim that in deciding to not call in the police after the hotel room incident, she chose to place the execution of her professional duties ahead of her personal matters. In addition, I accept her evidence that she was also fearful of subjecting herself to the ordeal that victims sometimes experience in the course of criminal prosecutions.\n[18] In any event, the Complainant did in fact report the incident immediately to her superiors at work, whom she expected would deal with the matter appropriately. She complied with the employer's request to submit a complaint in writing. She felt, however, that the employer never adequately addressed her concerns. She found herself with no choice but to leave a job that she claims she loved. She contacted the Commission in the days following the incident and a complaint was filed several months later. The investigation and other stages of the process ended up taking years and in the meantime the Complainant endured a serious illness.\n[19] The Respondent suggested that the Complainant had fabricated her claim against him in pursuit of a financial windfall at his expense. However, this theory is not supported by the facts of the case. At the end of her evidence, the Complainant initially told the Tribunal that she was not seeking any remedy under the Act, other than a letter of apology. Only after taking some time to consult the Act during a break in the hearing, did she inform the Tribunal that she was seeking $2,500 in damages for pain and suffering (s. 53(2) (e)), and $2,500 in special compensation (s. 53(3)). She did not make any claim for lost wages. Indeed, the Complainant pointed out that she did not want to claim any additional amounts from the Respondent because she was mindful of his modest means and did not want to financially ruin him. She also requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to pay these sums to a charitable organization instead of her. I therefore fail to see how the Respondent's assertion regarding the Complainant's motives can be supported.\n[20] The Respondent cited a couple of instances in the days following the incident when he claims the Complainant did not demonstrate any hostility to him. He sat down next to her at a restaurant table where she was already seated with a friend. On another occasion, he claims she accepted a sandwich from him. The Complainant denies these facts, as presented, claiming that she and her friend had finished their meal and were awaiting their bill when he Respondent sat down at the next table. They left soon thereafter. She denies outright ever having accepted the sandwich from the Respondent. More importantly, neither of these trivial incidents is indicative of the openness or friendliness that prevailed between the parties prior to the hotel room episode. The Respondent did not lead any evidence to suggest that their amicable relationship had remained unchanged after his visit to her hotel room that night. This sudden change in their friendship would be consistent with the Complainant's claim that she became cool and distant vis-\u00e0-vis the Respondent for the remainder of their assignment, pending her return to Toronto and her filing of a complaint against him with the employer.\n[21] On the balance of probabilities, I am persuaded that the events as alleged by the Complainant occurred on the evening in question. I find unconvincing the Respondent's contention that nothing out of the ordinary took place.\n[22] I am also satisfied that his behaviour that night constituted sexual harassment. His conduct was unwelcome, of a sexual nature and detrimentally affected her work environment. She was no longer comfortable working at the same workplace with the Respondent, which was one of the factors in her decision to resign from PMCL. While the incident occurred during a single evening, the Respondent's conduct was severe enough to create a hostile working environment by the measure of any reasonable person (See Canada (HRC) v. Canada (Armed Forces) and Franke (1999), 34 C.H.R.R. D\/140 at paras. 29-50 (F.C.T.D.)).\n[23] I therefore find that the Respondent discriminated against the Complainant by sexually harassing her. The complaint is substantiated.\nIV. REMEDY [24] As I explained earlier, the Complainant is seeking $2,500 in damages for pain and suffering. She is also claiming that the Respondent engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly, for which she is seeking special compensation in the sum of $2,500.\n[25] The Complainant testified as to how the harassment affected her emotionally following the incident. Her life was disrupted, particularly at work. She modified her working habits so as to avoid contact with the Respondent. His discriminatory conduct was ultimately one of the factors that led to her departure from her job at PMCL, which she enjoyed very much. I am satisfied that the Complainant experienced significant pain and suffering as a result of the discrimination. There is also no question that the Respondent's conduct in the hotel room that evening was wilful.\n[26] Taking these circumstances into account, and considering the prevailing case law with respect to non-pecuniary damages involving harassment (see e.g., Bushey v. Sharma, 2003 CHRT 21; Woiden v. Lynn (No.2) (2002), 43 C.H.R.R. D\/296 (C.H.R.T.)), I am satisfied that both of the Complainant's claims are more than justified. The Respondent is ordered to pay the Complainant the sum of $2,500 in compensation for her pain and suffering (s. 53(2)e)), and the sum of $2,500 in special compensation (s. 53(3)). Simple interest shall be payable on both of the monetary awards, to be calculated on a yearly basis, at a rate equivalent to the Bank Rate (Monthly series) set by the Bank of Canada. The interest will run from August 29, 1999.\n[27] The Complainant has also requested that the Respondent be ordered to provide her with a letter of apology. In Canada (Attorney-General) v. Stevenson, 2003 FCT 341, the Federal Court found that the Act does not empower Tribunals to make such orders. The Complainant's request for a letter of apology is therefore denied.\nV.

The Respondent has taken the position that the Tribunal has no power to award costs. I think that a proper resolution of this question requires considerable review of the caselaw, both in the courts and before the Tribunal.\n[2] The Respondent submits that the Canadian Human Rights Act does not give the Tribunal the power to award costs. The complainant demurs. Her counsel advises me that she has incurred legal costs in the range of $11,000.00 since the matter first arose. Most of these costs arise out of the hearing. Counsel has submitted that the failure of the Tribunal to order the Respondnt to pay her costs will effectively deprive her of the compensation to which she is entitled under the Act.\nII. DAMAGES A. Damages do not Include Costs [3] The basic rule in our law is simple. The power to award damages does not include the power to award costs. The Canadian Human Rights Act gives the Tribunal the power to award compensation. I think this is a form of damages and must be distinguished from costs.\n[4] The decision of the Cour d'appel de Queb\u00e9c in Hrtschan c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville), REJB 2004-55545, at para. 60, holds that the distinction between damages and costs is a causal one:\n60. Dans la logique de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile, laquelle requiert un lien de causalit\u00e9 directe entre la faute et le pr\u00e9judice, il ne suffit pas de dire qu'il a fallu recourir aux services d'un avocat pour conclure, au terme d'un proc\u00e8s qui tranche le cas, que la totalit\u00e9 de la note des honoraires et d\u00e9bours engag\u00e9s par la victime donne la mesure du pr\u00e9judice subi. (emphasis added)\nAt para. 75, Justice Pelletier cites Professor A. Popovici, in Le Sort des honoraires extrajudiciares, (2002) R. du B. 53, as authority for the proposition that costs are not damages.\nThe Respondent provided me with an English translation of the passage at para. 60, which is conveniently quoted, without commenting on the precision of the translation.\n60. In the logic of civil responsibility, which requires a direct causal link between the fault and the prejudice, a victim cannot rely on the assertion that he had to resort to the services of a lawyer to then be automatically awarded fees and disbursements at the end of the trial, on the basis that the lawyer's total bill equals the prejudice suffered.\nThere is a sense in which the legal costs of a trial or a hearing do not flow directly from the injury. They have a second, contractual origin. As a result, they do not form an ordinary head of damages or compensation.\n[5] This gives rise to the principle that damages and costs must be recovered separately. It follows that the power to award costs requires a discrete and explicit head of authority. This principle applies, rather resolutely, in both the common law and civil law systems. A tribunal and indeed a court only enjoys the power to award costs in the manner and on the terms set out in the relevant legislation.\nB. Initial Fees [6] The test is causal and the question is open to considerable refinement. In spite of the general rule, some legal costs qualify as damages. The decision in Hrtschan, for example, recognizes that a party with a legal complaint is entitled to seek the advice of a lawyer. The fees for such advice are a recoverable head of damages.\n[7] This does not change the general rule.\n61. Si la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 des premi\u00e8res consultations et des premi\u00e8res prestations de service peut, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 la r\u00e9clamation pour frais extrajudiciaires une l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 du genre de celle que je viens d'\u00e9voquer, il n'en va pas n\u00e9cessairement de m\u00eame pour la suite des \u00e9v\u00e9nements. De fait, la situation risque de s'embrouiller tr\u00e8s rapidement au fil du d\u00e9roulement du conflit judiciaire.\nThere is a difference between a party's initial consultation with a lawyer and the representation provided during the course of a hearing or trial.\n[8] A person who has been discriminated against will in the normal and entirely predictable course of events seek the advice of a lawyer. This preliminary advice is sufficiently close in the causal chain to constitute a direct and inevitable consequence of the original wrong. It accordingly constitutes a foreseeable part of the damages that the complainant has suffered as a consequence of the discrimination. The actions of the discriminator are the proximate cause of the expenses that a complainant incurs in seeking such advice.\n[9] I take it that the original recourse to a lawyer and the advice of a legal representative constitutes an exception to the general rule that costs are not damages. The ultimate issue in each case is causal. The question in logical terms is whether the legal costs claimed by a Complainant are a necessary consequence of the discrimination. Once the original advice has been tendered, received and paid for, a Complainant is in a position to instruct counsel. At this point, the causal chain is broken and any decisions regarding the provision of legal services derive logically from factors that are only indirectly related to the original cause of action.\n[10] The exception to the general rule has been recognized in the law of human rights. In Waters v. British Columbia (Ministry of Health Services) 2003 BCHRT 13, the B.C. Tribunal dealt with legal fees that were incurred prior to the filing of a complaint. At para. 212, the Tribunal held that these expenses were recoverable:\nIn Radloff v. Stox Broadcast Corp., [1999] BCHRTD No. 36, the Tribunal held that legal expenses that arise from the contravention but which cannot be characterized as costs' of the proceeding may be compensable: Radloff at para. 99 (see also Leeder v. O'Cana Enterprises Ltd. (c.o.b. Alisa Japanese Restaurant), [1999] B.C.H.R.T.D. No.1 at para. 29).\nThe point is that there was a sufficient nexus between the contravention of the Act and the expenditure to characterize it as compensation or damages.\n[11] There are other cases where the exception arises. In Curling v. Torimiro [2000] O.H.R.B.I.D. No. 169 (QL), at para. 61, for example, a Board of Inquiry held that it was entitled to award compensation for a Complainant's legal expenses as part of a restitutional award under the Ontario Code.\n[12] Where, as in this case, a complainant incurs legal expenses which are directly caused by the conduct of a respondent in violation of the complainant's rights under the Code, a respondent can, in an appropriate case, be ordered to pay compensation in respect of these expenses as part of a make whole remedy.\nThe decisive words are directly caused. The Board found, at para. 62, that the Complainant was claiming legal expenses that were incurred specifically:\nas a result of the retaliatory actions which have been found to infringe her rights under s. 8. It is significant that the retaliatory conduct took the form of legal action and threatened legal action, and necessitated a legal response.\nCurling recognizes that there are cases where the causal link between the costs and the discrimination is so close that a party is entitled to legal expenses, on the basis that they flow directly from the discrimination.\nC. Legal Fees from the Hearing [13] The legal expenses that occur later in the process come within the exclusionary rule, however. They should not be construed as damages. This includes the cost of an expert's report and other expenses that arise from the litigation, rather than the original discrimination. The source of these expenses lies in the instructions of the parties and the advice that they receive. This is inherently variable. The appropriateness of the decision whether to call witnesses or raise certain points of law is an incurable matter of judgement. Different persons may make these decisions differently.\n[14] Justice Pelletier expresses reservations with the idea that judges should enter into this area. It is not for adjudicators to second-guess the parties, in determining what services were appropriate. There is also the danger of retrying the case. This says nothing of the problem of dealing with matters handled in confidence or under the cloak of privilege. There are public policy considerations that prevent an adjudicator from looking too closely at the personal decisions of the parties or evaluating their conduct of the case.\nIII. COSTS A. The Common Law Rule: The Power to Award Costs Requires Statutory Authority [15] The common law has always held that an adjudicative body does not enjoy the power to award costs unless it has been expressly given such a power. There is a separate power that permits it to deal with abuses.\n[16] This rule does not admit exceptions. The power to award costs is an extraordinary power, which requires explicit statutory authority. In Family and Children's Services of Annapolis County v. Clark, [1983] N.S.J. No. 586, for example, the Nova Scotia Appeal Division held that the Family Court of Nova Scotia had no power to award costs. At para. 5, the court sets out the historical position:\nThe Family Court is a statutory court of record created by S.N.S. 1967, c. 98. As such it can only have jurisdiction in the substantive matter of costs if such jurisdiction is expressly given it by the Act creating it or some other Act. There is no inherent jurisdiction in statutory courts to award costs. This was made clear by this court then differently structured and constituted in Re Charles Brown (1928), 60 N.S.R. 76; 49 C.C.C. 402. The issue there was whether a County Court judge had the power and jurisdiction to award costs on a successful habeas corpus application. The statutory power to hear the application was given by the County Court Act, R.S.N.S. 1923, c. 215, as amended by S.N.S. 1924, c. 50, s. 3. The Act, however, was silent as to costs. This court held that the County Court judge did not have the power to award costs. The judgment of the court was delivered by Chisholm, J. (later C.J.N.S.), who said (pp. 78, 79 N.S.R.):\n... The recovery of costs eo nomine was unknown to the common law; the courts have no inherent power to award costs which can only be granted in any case or proceeding by virtue of express statutory authority. 2 Coke's Inst. 288; Duffill v. McFall (1878), 42 U.C.Q.B. 597; Lehigh Valley Railroad Co. v. McFarland (1882), 44 N.J.L. 674 5 Ency of P. and Prac. 108.\nI have quoted such a long passage because it illustrates the unequivocal nature of the common law rule.\n[17] There are similar decisions in the area of human rights. In Ontario (Liquor Control Board) v. Ontario (Ontario Human Rights Commission), for example, [1988] O.J. No. 167 (QL), three judges of the Ontario High Court of Justice dealt summarily with the issue:\nThe applicants\/appellants submitted that Baum erred in law and jurisdiction by awarding costs to the respondents Karumanchiri, Ng and Yan. There is no inherent jurisdiction in a court, nor in any other statutory body, to award costs.\nRe Brown, [1928] 3 D.L.R. 234, 49 C.C.C. 402, 60 N.S.R. 76 (N.S.S.C.)\nOrkin, The Law of Costs, 1968, Canada Law Book Limited, Toronto, p. 1\nThe Board of Inquiry is created by the Ontario Human Rights Code, 1981, S.O. 1981, c. 53. As a statutory body it can only have jurisdiction to award costs if such jurisdiction is expressly given to it either by the Code or some other act.\nRe Lachawski and Federated Mutual Insurance Co. (1980), 29 O.R. (2d) 273, 19 C.P.C. 126, 113 D.L.R. (3d) 209 (Div. Ct.)\nFranco v. Kornatz et al. (1982), 29 C.P.C. 38 (Ont. H.C.)\nRe Clark and Family and Children's Services of Annapolis County (1983), 37 R.F.L. (2d) 171, 39 C.P.C. 168, 3 D.L.R. (4th) 728 (N.S.C.A.) affirming (1983), 34 C.P.C. 57 (N.S. Co. Ct.) which varied (1983), 57 N.S.R. (2d) 77, 120 A.P.R. 77 (Fam. Ct.)\nRe Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth and Hamilton-Wentworth Save the Valley Committee, Inc. et al. (1985), 51 O.R. (2d) 23 (Div. Ct.) [n.p.]\nThis reflects the development of the law of costs in Ontario, which derives from the common law.\n[18] The bench in Ontario Liquor Control Board holds specifically that restitution does not include costs:\nThe legislature has expressly provided for the recovery of costs in limited circumstances to the person complained against under s. 40(6) of the Ontario Human Rights Code, 1981, S.O. 1981, c. 53. The power of the Board of Inquiry under s. 40(1) to make restitution including monetary compensation is not an express provision for the award of costs to complainants under the Code. The rule of liberal interpretation to carry out the objects of the Code to, as far as possible, remedy the effects of and prevent discrimination do not apply to procedural matters or the question of costs. [n.p.]\nThere is also the decision of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in Moncton v. Buggie and N.B. Human Rights Commission [1985] N.B.J. No. 276 (QL), at para. 35, which holds that a Board of Inquiry has no power to award costs.\nB. Other Sources of the Power to Award Costs [19] It may be significant that the rule was different in equity. In Oasis Hotel Ltd. v. Zurich Insurance Co. [1981] B.C.J. No. 690 (QL), the B.C. Court of Appeal reviewed the history of the power in the courts of equity. The Supreme Court of British Columbia enjoys the powers of the English High Court of Chancery, apparently as they stood in 1858. The Court of Appeal held that this gave it the power to award costs, in the words of Middleton J. in Re Sturmer and Town of Beaverton (1912) 2 D.L.R. 501, (Ont. Div. Ct.), at para. 11, not from any authority but from conscience and arbitrio boni viri. This latin maxim is explained by Albert Mayrand, Dictionnaire de maxims et locutions latines utilis\u00e9es en droit (3d, Yvon Blais), as the equivalent of Selon l'arbitrage d'un bon citoyen.\n[20] The courts of equity seem to have had a mandate to provide effective remedies. This may help to explain why the remedial powers of a statutory body seem to be significant in determining whether it has the power to award costs. Thus, in Banca Nazionale v. Lee-Shanok, [1988] F.C.J. No. 594 (QL), a unanimous bench of the Federal Court of Appeal reviewed s. 61.5(9) of the Canada Labour Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. L-1, which gave an adjudicator the authority to order an employer who had dismissed an employee to reinstate the employee and do any other like thing that it is equitable to require the employer to do in order to remedy or counteract any consequence of the dismissal. (italics added) The court held that the purpose of the section was to make whole an employee who has been wrongly treated by his employer. The difficulty I have, writes Stone J.A.,\nis in viewing an award of compensation, gained at some considerable expense to a complainant in terms of legal costs, as having the effect of making him whole. Legal costs incurred would effectively reduce compensation for lost remuneration, while their allowance would appear to remedy or, at least, to counteract a consequence of the dismissal.\nThe court accordingly held that the Labour Code gave the adjudicator the power to award costs.\nIV. THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES A. The Position of the Respondent [21] The Respondent submits that the general rule with respect to federal legislation is clear. It has provided me with a number of authorities on the matter. In Big Island Band v. Big George, [1995] F.C.J. No. 543 (QL), for example, the court considered the same provision that was before the court in Banca Nazionale. The case can be distinguished from the decision in Banca Nazionale, since the adjudicator had found against the claimant but awarded costs. At para. 6, Justice Nadon quotes Sara Blake in Administrative Law in Canada (Butterworths), at page 105. He then writes, at para. 8,\nI am in entire agreement with the proposition set forth by the learned author in Administrative Law in Canada that express authority is necessary to empower a board or tribunal to make an award of costs against a party. I should add that, in my view, an adjudicator has no inherent jurisdiction to make such an award.\nIt is evident, on this view, that a statutory tribunal like the Human Rights Tribunal has no power to award costs unless the statute explicitly gives it such a power.\n[22] The Respondent also provided me with a number of excerpts from other federal Acts. Section 251.12(4)(a) of the Canada Labour Code, for example, gives a referee on a matter under appeal the power to award costs in the proceeding. Under section 25.1(1) of the Canada Transportation Act, the Canadian Transportation Agency has all the powers that the Federal Court has to award costs in any proceeding before it. Section 30.16(1) of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act states that the Canadian International Trade Tribunal may award costs of, and incidental to, any proceedings before it. Other Acts contain the same explicit language.\n[23] There are other arguments on the Respondent's side. Part 11 of the Federal Court Rules deals with costs. The court has assessment officers. The rules deal with matters like security for costs. There is also a Tariff. There is an entire scheme to deal with costs. The Respondent submits that there is nothing of this nature in the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Act is completely silent on the matter.\n[24] The Respondent also submits that the Complainant incurred costs because the Commission withdrew from the hearing. This decision was taken relatively late in the process. If anyone should be responsible for those costs, the argument goes, it is the Commission. There is at least a suggestion in Canada (A-G) v. Morgan (1991) 21 C.H.R.R. D\/87, at para. 67, that Respondents should not be held responsible for problems that arise out of the conduct of the Commission.\nB. The Position of the Complainant [25] Counsel for the Complainant relied on the caselaw that I have discussed below. He essentially took the position that the remedial provisions of the Act would be rendered ineffective without an award of costs.\n[26] Counsel for the Complainant also submitted that the Tribunal has the same power as arbitrators, who apparently have the authority to award costs. He relied on the decision of the British Columbia Labour Relations Board in Re Graham [2000] BCLRBD No. 1 (QL), where the Board held at para. 46 that its jurisdiction to award costs and expenses . . . as a form of damages is well-established. At para. 48, it continued as follows: The Board described the intent of an order for reimbursement of reasonable costs as the bringing about [of] a situation whereby the successful complainant obtains a `break-even finale rather than a loss': Tony McNamara and Pierre Comeau, IRC No. 302\/88 (Reconsideration of C25\/88), p. 12.\nC. The Position of the Commission [27] The Canadian Human Rights Commission was advised that the question of costs was before me. It chose not to appear, however, and has not taken a position on the matter. I accordingly do not know the circumstances under which the Commission withdrew from the case.\nV. LEGISLATION A. The Canadian Human Rights Act [28] The parties agreed that the fundamental starting point in any inquiry into the question before me is that the Tribunal is a creature of statute. As a result, it enjoys the powers that are granted to it by the Act.\n[29] It has generally been accepted that the only provisions in the Act that could provide the Tribunal with the power to award costs are found in section 53(2)(c) and 53(2)(d) of the Act, which gives a Tribunal the authority to make an order:\n(c) that the person [engaging in the discriminatory practice] compensate the victim for any or all of the wages that the victim was deprived of and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice;\n(d) that the person compensate the victim for any or all additional costs of obtaining alternative goods, services, facilities or accommodation and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice ...\nBoth of these provisions have been used in the jurisprudence. It is evident that the exception regarding the fees paid for initial advice would come under (d).\n[30] There are two fundamental arguments against the use of these provisions as the source of the Tribunal's power to award costs. The first is that they refer to expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice. This identifies the expenses as damages. There must be an uninterrupted causal link between the discrimination and the expenses that are being claimed.\n[31] The second argument is that the principles of statutory interpretation do not support such a reading of the Act. There are at least two principles that apply. The first is ejusdem generis, which holds that the meaning of general terms is restricted by the particular terms that precede them. Thus, the reference to expenses in section 53(2)(d) is a reference to expenses like the expenses incurred in obtaining alternative goods, services, facilities or accommodation. The reference in section 53(2)(c) is to the kind of expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the loss of wages.\n[32] The second principle is expressio unius est exclusio alterius. In Driedger on the Construction of Statutes (3d; Butterworths), at p. 168, Ruth Sullivan writes that this principle applies whenever there is reason to believe that if the legislature had meant to include a particular thing within the ambit of its legislation, it would have referred to that thing expressly. Justice Lemieux relies on this kind of argument in Green, infra, at para. 186, where he writes: if Parliament had intended the Tribunal to award legal costs, it would have said so. The argument is that Parliament has set out a number of specific heads of relief. If it had wanted to give the Tribunal the power to award costs, it would have included this within the list. The rule takes added force in the immediate instance from the extraordinary nature of the power to award costs, which is only available if the enabling legislation expressly grants it.\n[33] There may be other problems. I am inclined to think that section 53(2)(c) contemplates the full recovery of the expenses incurred by the Complainant. This is not the general rule with legal costs, which are usually awarded on a more qualified basis. To suggest otherwise would treat fees as disbursements. Indeed I note that the entry for expense in The New Shorter Oxford Dictionary lists the word disbursement as a synonym. I think this is the kind of meaning that attaches to the use of the word in the section.\n[34] There are also practical issues. The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal is an expert tribunal, with a thorough knowledge of the legal and factual issues that commonly arise in the context of discrimination. It has no experience in the taxation of accounts, which has been recognized as an independent area of expertise. There is a relatively complex body of rules and principles governing legal accounts.\n[35] The immediate case also presents a good example of the problematic nature of an inquiry into costs. If the Tribunal has the power to award costs, I have been advised that the Respondent wishes to dispute the fees charged by the representative for the Complainant. This may take the Tribunal into the without prejudice negotiations between the parties.\nB. Other Human Rights Legislation [36] In Discrimination and the Law (Carswell; 2004, Rel.2), at p. 15-124, William Pentney writes that provisions concerning costs vary greatly across the country. Section 37(4) of the British Columbia Human Rights Code, for example, allows a Tribunal to award costs if a party has engaged in improper conduct. This is a high standard: see Cook v. Citizens Research Institute, 2002 BCHRTD 6.\n[37] There are analogous provisions in Alberta, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland (against any party who deserves such a penalty), and Manitoba (for frivolous or vexatious conduct). The Ontario Code allows a Board of Inquiry to award costs against the Ontario Human Rights Commission for a claim that is frivolous or vexatious, or made in bad faith. The legislation in the Yukon and Saskatchewan restrict an award of costs to the party contravening the Act.\n[38] There are Acts with language similar to the provisions in the federal Act. Section 28.4(1)(iv) of the Human Rights Act of Prince Edward Island, for example, allows a human rights panel:\n(iv) to compensate the complainant or other person dealt with contrary to this Act for all or any part of wages or income lost or expenses incurred by reason of the contravention of this Act;\nThe similarities are apparent. Section 28.4(6) of the provincial Act, however, states a panel may make any order as to costs that it considers appropriate. The Respondent submits that this only demonstrates what is missing from the federal Act.\n[39] Pentney has the following to say about the Canadian Human Rights Act:\nNeither the federal Act nor the legislation of the Northwest Territories, New Brunswick or Nova Scotia specifically confers a power on the respective tribunals to award costs. However, it could be plausibly argued that in [each case] this power could be inferred from the plenary jurisdiction of the tribunals to bring about restitutio in integrum and\/or to further the purposes of the enactments. (15-125)\nThe reality however is that the federal legislation lacks the kind of explicit provision that the common law requires.\n[40] The decision in Ontario (Liquor Control Board) v. Ontario (Ontario Human Rights Commission), supra, seems to go the other way.\n[41] I was also provided with a copy of the recent decision of a Nova Scotia Board of Inquiry in Johnson v. Halifax Regional Police Service (unrpt.; 28 May 2004), which held that it had the power to award the Complainants the costs of retaining independent counsel. The Board paid particular attention to the federal jurisprudence. I do not find the decision helpful however. Although the Human Rights Act of Nova Scotia is silent on the question of costs, s. 8, its remedial section is much broader than the comparable provisions in the federal Act. Pentney describes this provision as the most general, and probably the broadest, remedial power available in Canada. It is of no real assistance in interpreting the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nVI. JURISPRUDENCE UNDER THE CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACT [42] The question whether the Tribunal has the power to award costs under the Canadian Human Rights Act has a relatively long history in the jurisprudence.\nA. Early Cases (i) Morrell: The Tribunal Rules that it Does Not Have the Power to Award Costs [43] The early cases seem to hold in favour of the Respondent. In Morrell v. Canada (Employment & Immigration Commission) (1985), 6 C.H.R.R. D\/3021, at para. 24348, the Tribunal held that section 53(2)(d) does not give the Tribunal the power to award costs:\n[Paragraph 53(2)(d)] is intended to cover expenses directly related to the discriminatory conduct, and not expenses related to legal proceedings under the Human Rights Act. The latter are more a question of costs, and there is no provision in the Act for recovery of costs. Consequently, I do not believe I have any authority to make an award for expenses related to the hearing.\nThis passage from Morrell may be the simplest and most straightforward statement of the law in the jurisprudence. It distinguishes between the costs of the litigation and the expenses incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice, such as counselling or medical expenses borne by the Complainant. The former expenses do not flow from the original injury and cannot be compensated under the Act.\n(ii) Other Cases [44] Morrell was followed by a number of cases where the Tribunal recommended or urged that the Commission pay the Complainant's costs. In Hinds v. Canada Employment and Immigration Commission, 1988 CHRT 88, for example, a certain Ms. Mactavish appeared for the Complainant. At the end of the case, she argued that the Tribunal had the power to award costs. Although the Tribunal recognized her singular contribution to the case, it refused to order costs and merely urged the Canadian Human Rights Commission to indemnify the Complainant.\n[45] The same kind of practice was followed in Oliver v. Canada (Parks Canada) (1989), 11 C.H.R.R. D\/456, where the Tribunal criticized the Commission and stated that it was unfair to hold the Respondent responsible for the costs of the Complainant.\nB. Thwaites: The Federal Court holds that the Tribunal has the Power to Award Costs [46] The position of the Tribunal changed in the early nineties. In Thwaites v. Canadian Armed Forces (1993), T.D. 9\/93, a panel of the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to pay for the legal fees incurred by the Complainant during the course of the hearing. At the end of the decision, the panel held:\nWe feel, given the complex nature of this case, that Ms. Reierson served an important and useful function in acting as counsel for Thwaites. We agree with the Tribunal in Grover v. National Research Council (T.D. 12\/92) that Section 53(2)(c) of the CHRA, granting the Tribunal power to compensate for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice is of sufficient latitude to encompass the power to award costs. That Tribunal stated at p. 91:\nIf the purpose of remedies is to fully and adequately compensate a complainant for the discriminatory practices, then surely the consequence of costs is part and parcel of a meaningful remedy for a successful complainant.\nAccordingly, in the circumstances of this case, we order the CAF to pay the reasonable legal costs of Thwaites, including the actuarial fees incurred in support of the presentation of his case. If the parties cannot agree as to the amount, the costs should be assessed on the Federal Court scale.\nThe matter was subsequently reviewed in the Federal Court.\n[47] In Canada (AG) v. Thwaites, [1994] 3 F.C. 38 (QL), at para. 56, Justice Gibson endorsed the position taken by the Tribunal at the hearing:\nThe fact that lawyers and judges attach a particular significance to the term costs or the expression costs of counsel provides no basis of support for the argument that expenses incurred does not include those costs unless they are specifically identified in the legislation. On the basis of the principle that the words of legislation should be given their ordinary meaning unless the context otherwise requires, and finding nothing in the relevant context that here otherwise requires, I conclude that the Tribunal did not err in law in awarding Thwaites reasonable costs of his counsel including the cost of actuarial services.\nThis was the first of four rulings from the Federal Court on the matter. There is no escaping the fact that it runs counter to the common law, which holds that a statutory body has no power to award costs without an express statutory warrant.\n[48] The decision in Thwaites was followed by the Tribunal in Swan v. Canada (Armed Forces), [1994] CHRT 15, where the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to pay to the Complainant the costs of his legal counsel to be taxed as applicable under the Rules of Court for the Province of Manitoba.\nC. Lambie: The Federal Court rules that the Tribunal does not have the Power to Award Costs [49] The second decision from the Federal Court is found in Canada (Attorney General) v. Lambie, [1996] F.C.J. No. 1695, where the question was whether the Complainant was entitled to claim expenses for leave and time spent to develop and prepare his complaint. The case was heard by Justice Nadon, who had rendered the decision in Big George, supra. He seems to have been unaware of the decision in Thwaites.\n[50] The Decision in Lambie, like the decision in Big George, recites the common law rule. At the end of his decision, Justice Nadon quotes the passage from Morrell v. Canada, supra, at para. 24348, where the Tribunal held that paragraph 53(2)(d) is not intended to cover expenses related to legal proceedings under the Human Rights Act. There is no provision in the Act that gives the Tribunal an express power to award costs. It follows that the Tribunal has no power to do so.\nD. Intervening Cases: The Tribunal continues to hold that it has the Power to Award Costs [51] The decision in Lambie would support the original position of the Tribunal in Morrell. In spite of this, the Tribunal continued to hold in the intervening cases that section 53 of the Act gives it the power to award costs. I was a member of the panel in Koeppel v. Department of National Defence (1997), T.D. 5\/97, which awarded costs to the Complainant on the basis of Grover and Thwaites. We did not inquire into the substantive issue, however, and were unaware of the decision from the Federal Court in Lambie. In Bernard v. Waycobah Board of Education, [1999] C.H.R.T. 2, a Tribunal also ordered the Respondent to pay the costs of Ms. Bernard's legal counsel on the Federal Court Scale. The case does not discuss the jurisdictional issue.\nE. Green: The Federal Court rules for the second time that the Tribunal does not have the Power to Award Costs [52] The jurisdictional issue resurfaced in Canada (Attorney General) v. Green, [2000] 4 F.C. 629 (QL), where the Tribunal awarded the Complainant the legal costs that she had incurred while the matter was before the Commission. The Complainant had apparently retained the services of counsel for the purposes of arguing that the complaint should be referred to the Tribunal.\n[53] Like Justice Nadon in Lambie, Justice Lemieux gave the idea that the Tribunal has the power to award costs very short shrift. At para. 185-186, he holds:\n[185] The Attorney General cites Canada (Attorney General) v. Lambie (1996), 124 F.T.R. 303 (F.C.T.D.), where my colleague Nadon J. said at page 315 that the Act does not confer jurisdiction to award costs although Parliament could easily have included such a power.\n[186] I agree with my colleague that if Parliament had intended the Tribunal to award legal costs, it would have said so. Reference is had to paragraph 53(2)(d) which refers to compensation to the victim for any or all additional costs of obtaining alternative goods, services, facilities or accommodation. There is no mention of legal costs, an indication Parliament did not intend the Tribunal have the power to order the payment of legal costs.\nThis follows the principle of expressio unius. It also follows the common law rule. The court held that the Tribunal has no power to award costs unless the Act expressly provides it. The fees in the case nonetheless appear to come under the exception relating to the initial cost of consulting a lawyer.\nF. Nkwazi: The Tribunal continues to rule that it has the Power to Award Costs [54] The decisions in Lambie and Green did not resolve the matter. The issue was revisited by Ms. Mactavish, now the Chairperson of the Tribunal, in Nkwazi v. Canada (Correctional Service), [2001] CHRT 29. The case is notable in the present instance because the facts were similar to the facts before me. The fundamental problem was that the Commission had withdrawn.\n[55] The substance of the Respondent's submissions was that the Commission should pay the Complainant's costs. At para. 20, Ms. Mactavish writes:\nAccording to counsel for CSC, Ms. Nkwazi's legal expenses were incurred entirely as a result of the decision of the Canadian Human Rights Commission to withdraw from this proceeding. The Commission's decision to withdraw constitutes a novus actus interveniens and breaks the chain of causation between the discrimination suffered by Ms. Nkwazi and her decision to retain independent counsel.\nThis line of reasoning comes from the common law. It goes more properly to damages, however, rather than costs.\n[56] Ms. Mactavish at least implicitly suggests that Green may have been decided on a misreading of Lambie, which dealt with the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to compensate a Complainant for the time spent to develop and prepare [the] complaint. At para. 12, she accordingly follows the lead of Justice Gibson in Thwaites.\nI do not accept CSC's contention that the term 'expenses' should be given a restricted meaning, based upon the ejusdem generis principle of statutory interpretation. I agree with Mr. Justice Gibson that the ordinary meaning of 'expenses incurred' includes legal expenses, and that there is nothing in the context in which the term is used in paragraph 53 (2) (c) that requires a different interpretation.\nIt will be apparent that I find myself in a different position. If the rule at common law applies, I think there is little doubt that Morrell, Lambie and Green were correctly decided. The principles of ejusdem generis and expressio unius apply.\n[57] The Tribunal in Nkwazi also relies on the principle of restitutio in integrum however. At para. 17, Ms. Mactavish states:\n... the interpretation of the word 'expenses' espoused by Gibson J. in Thwaites is one consistent with the principle governing remedial orders under the Canadian Human Rights Act. Where a complaint is substantiated, the task of the Tribunal is to attempt, insofar as may be possible, to make whole the victim of the discriminatory practice, subject to principles of foreseeability, remoteness and mitigation. A victim of a discriminatory practice could hardly be said to have been made whole if she were unable to seek reimbursement for the legal expenses associated with the pursuit of her complaint.\nThis is in keeping with the reasoning of the Federal Court of Appeal in Banca Nazionale, supra.\n[58] The Tribunal in Nkwazi also felt that the decision not to award costs in those cases where the Commission does not appear would essentially deprive Complainants of the right to bring a complaint before the Tribunal. At para. 15, Ms. Mactavish holds:\nInterpreting the term 'expenses' in the narrow and restricted way that Lemieux J. did in Green, so as to deny victims of discriminatory practices the right to recover their reasonable legal expenses associated with the pursuit of their complaints would, in my respectful view, be contrary to the public policy underlying the Canadian Human Rights Act. The practical result of such an interpretation would inevitably be that the quasi-constitutional equality rights guaranteed by the Act would become meaningless in cases where the Canadian Human Rights Commission withdraws from the hearing: complainants of modest means such as Beryl Nkwazi would simply be unable to proceed further with their claims.\nThis brings in larger policy concerns.\nG. Premakumar and Milano: The Tribunal follows Nkwazi [59] Ms. Mactavish followed Nkwazi in Premakumar v. Air Canada 2002 CHRT 04\/26, where she relied specifically on the principle of restitutio in integrum. At para 31, she held:\n[31] Where a complaint is substantiated, the task of the Tribunal is to attempt, insofar as may be possible, to make whole the victim of a discriminatory practice, subject to principles of foreseeability, remoteness and mitigation. Section 53 (2) (c) of the Canadian Human Rights Act empowers the Tribunal to reimburse the victim for any expenses incurred by that individual as a result of the discriminatory practice.\nThe point is simple: to deny Mr. Premakumar reimbursement for his reasonable legal expenses would render his victory before the Tribunal essentially a Pyrrhic one.\n[60] Ms. Mactavish also awarded reasonable legal expenses in Milano v. Triple K Transport 2003 CHRT 30, on the same basis.\nH. Stevenson: The Federal Court follows Nkwazi [61] The matter came to a head in Stevenson v. Canada (Canadian Security Intelligence Service) [2003] 2003 FCT 341, where Justice Rouleau reviews both streams of authority. Like Ms. Mactavish, who was recently appointed to the Federal Court, he holds that the ruling in Lambie merely limits the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to award costs to exceptional cases. My difficulty with such a position lies in the plain statement, in Lambie, at para. 42: The statute does not confer the jurisdiction to award costs although Parliament could easily have included such a power. Perhaps this is obiter.\n[62] More significantly, Justice Rouleau then adopts the position of Justice Gibson in Thwaites and Madam Mactavish in Nkwazi. I am not convinced that this completely resolves the matter. For one thing, the legal costs awarded in Stevenson were for the costs associated with filing a complaint and making submissions to the Commission. This is apparent in the decision of the Tribunal, at [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 40, para. 108, where the member held:\nI am satisfied ... that the Complainant did have a right to consult counsel with regard to the possibility of making a complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Commission and that the legal assistance given him in respect of the submissions made to the Commission was necessary. These expenses were a reasonably foreseeable outcome of the discriminatory conduct.\nThe case accordingly does not deal with the recovery of costs incurred during the course of the hearing.\n[63] The costs awarded in Stevenson are therefore more properly considered under the exception in the law relating to the initial costs of consulting a lawyer. At para. 25, for example, Justice Rouleau states:\nThe fact that the words legal costs or costs of counsel are not expressly mentioned in either paragraphs 53(2)(c) or (d) does not support the argument that expenses incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice excludes legal expenses incurred by a complainant in bringing a complaint for discrimination. In a case such as this, where a complainant consults a lawyer regarding the well-foundedness of his complaint, an expense of that nature is entirely justifiable. (italics added)\nAnd at para. 26:\nIn my view therefore, costs of counsel or any legal costs incurred in the course of filing a complaint for discrimination constitute expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice as referred to in the legislation and the tribunal has accordingly acted within its jurisdiction in awarding legal expenses to the respondent. (italics added)\nIt is apparent that these kinds of damages come properly under section 53(2)(d) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The historical issue regarding costs arises later in the process, with regard to the costs incurred in the course of litigating the case.\n[64] The decisions in Stevenson and Nkwazi have nevertheless been followed by the Tribunal in Boudreault v. Great Circle Marine Services, 2004 CHRT 21, where Member Doyon awarded the Complainant legal fees in the sum of six thousand dollars.\nI. The Question posed by Nkwazi [65] The decisions in Nkwazi, Stevenson and some of the other cases raise an obvious question. If the Tribunal has some power to award costs, why doesn't the Act deal with the matter? I think the answer lies in the role of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, which has changed over the years. The Act was passed in 1985, almost twenty years ago. I do not believe that Parliament, the Commission, or any of the interested parties, foresaw the current situation.\n[66] The general assumption in the early cases was that the Commission would be appearing in the hearings before the Tribunal. I am inclined to think that Parliament shared this assumption when it originally passed the Canadian Human Rights Act. As a practical matter, it follows that the cost of litigating the Complainant's case would be borne by the Commission. There was no need for Parliament to deal explicitly with the question of the Complainant's costs. The Act is nevertheless premised on the idea that a successful Complainant will receive the compensation to which she is entitled without a set-off for legal costs.\n[67] The more recent jurisprudence reflects the fact that the Commission has reconsidered its position. At paragraph 28 of Premakumar, for example, Ms. Mactavish distinguishes between the role of counsel for the Commission and counsel for the Complainant. She then holds:\n[29] In light of my conclusion as to the respective roles of the Commission and the complainant, I have some difficulty with the reasoning of the Tribunals in Potapczyk and Pond. [Potapczyk v. MacBain, (1984), 5 C.H.R.R. D\/2285 and Pond v. Canada Post Corp., (1994) 94 C.L.L.C. 17,024]. In these cases, successful complainants were denied their legal costs, in the absence of any identifiable conflict between the position of the Commission and that of the Complainant. While noting the obligation of the Commission to represent the public interest, the Tribunal in Potapczyk went on to observe that the Canadian Human Rights Act ... permits an individual who has a complaint to have it prosecuted by competent counsel for the Commission without incurring personal expense. This observation was subsequently relied on by the Tribunal in Pond to deny Ms. Pond her legal expenses.\nThese are telling remarks.\n[68] I am not completely comfortable with this distinction between the roles of counsel. It seems to me that every human rights complaint has a public interest component, since that is what gives the legislation its particular force. This is not the issue before me however. The reality is that the Commission no longer appears before the Tribunal on a regular basis. As a result, the burden in most cases falls on the Complainant rather than the Commission. I agree with Madam Mactavish that the reasoning in cases like Potapcyzyk and Pond can no longer be sustained.\n[69] The changes in the practice before the Tribunal have made the matter of costs more significant than it was in the past. It also explains why the Act fails to address such a pivotal matter. The old reasoning may still apply in cases where the Commission appears before the Tribunal.\nVII. ISSUE A. The Tribunal does not have a Common Law Power to Award Costs [70] The question posed by the parties is whether the Tribunal has the power to award costs. I think this question has two different answers. The first is that the Tribunal does not have a common law power to award costs. It is of little avail to argue that the Act should be interpreted liberally, or in a manner that favours complainants. The power to award costs cannot be found in the Act. It is simply not there. I am accordingly in agreement with what was said by the Federal Court in Lambie and Green. If Parliament intended to give the Tribunal the power to award costs, it would have done so, in accordance with the rules and conventions governing the matter.\nB. The Tribunal nevertheless has the Power to Protect the Viability of the Remedies under the Act [71] The Tribunal nevertheless has adjudicative responsibility for the remedies under the Act. There are certain powers that flow from this. This reflects the remedial nature of the legislation and the fundamental nature of the rights of the person. I think that the Act gives the Tribunal the power that it needs to protect the viability and integrity of the remedies under the Act.\n[72] The same kind of issue arises in other contexts. In Day v. DND, No. 4, 2002\/12\/18, at paragraph 20, I suggested that something more than a doctrine of necessary powers but less than the doctrine of inherent jurisdiction was needed to provide the legal basis for some aspects of the Tribunal's authority.\n[73] I think there is considerable merit in the Respondent's submissions concerning the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. I say this because, in my view, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal derives more from the Tribunal's mandate under the Canadian Human Rights Act than from the literal wording of the Act. This mandate is broad, remedial, and quasi-constitutional. In my view, the Tribunal has all the incidental powers that are necessary to carry out the role that the legislation has assigned to it.\nI think that this kind of implied or instrumental reasoning is sufficient to provide the Tribunal with the necessary power to protect the viability of the remedies under the Act.\n[74] These kinds of powers must be traced to the provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Tribunal remains a statutory body, which only enjoys the powers granted by the Act. There is even a sense in which these powers must be express, as the common law suggests. The decision in Banca Nazionale addresses these concerns, however, and I think it is sufficient if there is an express intention to make a successful Complainant whole. This can be found in those provisions of the Act that deal with personal remedies.\n[75] The relevant subsection reads as follows:\n53(2) If at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may, subject to section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice and include in the order any of the following terms that the member or panel considers appropriate . . .\nThe word include might be thought to leave the Tribunal with some additional powers, but the French text suggests that it is limiting. The subsection then contemplates an order:\n(b) that the person make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that are being or were denied the victim as a result of the practice;\n(c) that the person compensate the victim for any or all of the wages that the victim was deprived of and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice;\n(d) that the person compensate the victim for any or all additional costs of obtaining alternative goods, services, facilities or accommodation and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice ...\nI think it is the cumulative effect of these provisions that is significant. The Tribunal has the power to order that the person discriminating provide the victim with rights, opportunities and privileges; that it repay wages and wage-related expenses; and that it reimburse the Complainant for the cost of any alternative goods, services, facilities, accommodation and the expenses related thereto. There is no reason to discuss the precise meaning of the different provisions. Taken together, the intention is to give the Tribunal the power to redress any loss that the Complainant has suffered as a result of the discrimination. The legislative intention is to make the victim whole.\n[76] The jurisprudence in the area supports such an interpretation. The real question in this context is not whether the Tribunal has an explicit power to award costs. It is whether the failure of the Tribunal to award costs would subvert the right of a successful complainant to restitution. I think the answer is plain. The legal fees in a case like the one before me could easily be greater than the damages awarded to a complainant. There will also be cases, as Ms. Mactavish recognized in Nkwazi, where the complainant does not receive a monetary award.\n[77] I have already held that the Tribunal does not have an express power to award costs. It nevertheless has the power to preserve the viability of its process. This includes the power to order the payment of costs, in order to preserve the damages to which a complainant is entitled. The governing principle is that the complainant is entitled to receive the bulk of the damages intact. Anything less would not be resititutio in integrum.\n[78] This is a residual power, which gives the Tribunal the power to protect the efficacy of the remedies awarded under the Act. There are limits to such a precept. The principle of restitutio in integrum applies to damages, not costs, and does not give a successful complainant a right to claim the entirety of their legal costs. It follows that any costs are subject to the normal rules of taxation. This includes the cost of expert's reports and other expenses related to the conduct of the hearing.\n[79] It is important to recognize that one of the purposes of the Act is to bring the question of discrimination under public scrutiny. This is not possible unless complainants are willing to come forward with complaints of discrimination. The Tribunal should not interpret the Act in a way that discourages those with legitimate complaints from seeking their legal remedies.\n[80] It is evident that this and other cases may serve notice on Parliament that the present Act deserves attention. It does not seem entirely fair, for example, to restrict costs to a successful complainant. The only question in the present case however is whether the failure of the legislation to specifically address the question of costs--when there was no real reason to do so--should be allowed to defeat the manifest purpose of the legislation. The answer is plain.\nC. The Complainant Has a Right to an Effective Remedy [81] There is another side to this. Much of the impetus for the passage of the Canadian Human Rights Act came from international sources, such as the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. There are international obligations in the area. The law of human rights is fundamental. The prohibition against discrimination in section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights also gives the parallel provisions in the Canadian Human Rights Act constitutional backing.\n[82] It would be wrong if the provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act served to defeat the remedies that it provides. The Complainant provided me with a copy of a briefing paper by Joanna Birenbaum and Bruce Porter (apparently available on the Department of Justice website) on the right to adjudication under the Canadian Human Rights Act. The paper does not deal specifically with the question of costs. It nevertheless contains the following passage:\nThe denial of adjudication of human rights claims is clearly inconsistent with international law, particularly Article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) which guarantees that any person whose rights or freedoms...are violated shall have an effective remedy and that any person claiming such a remedy shall have this right thereto determined by competent judicial, administrative or legislative authorities.\nThe same paper states that sections 7 and 15 of the Charter of Rights guarantee the same rights.\n[83] There are important policy issues here. The purpose of the Canadian Human Rights Act has always been characterized as remedial. This purpose must be respected. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Liberties speaks to this the best, in requiring that state parties provide effective remedies for those persons whose rights have been infringed. The present case concerns marital and family status. I think that article 23 of the Covenant recognizes the particular importance of such a status, which is at least implicitly included in the prohibition against discrimination in article 26.\n[84] The right to an effective remedy is also an integral part of our own law. Perhaps this comes from equity; I cannot say. An effective remedy is nevertheless one that is meaningful and concrete. It is unimpaired by the circumstances that exist outside the immediate purview of the process. I think that the Tribunal has the power and indeed an obligation to see that the remedies under an act like the Canadian Human Rights Act are not frustrated by extraneous factors like the costs of a hearing. This would defeat the purpose of the litigation, the intention behind the Act, and the fundamental law of human rights.\nVIII. ADDITIONAL ISSUES A. Can a Lay Representative Appear Before the Tribunal? [85] Mr. Finding acted for the Complainant throughout the course of the hearing. He is not a lawyer. Although the Respondent was aware of this, it did not object to his participation in the hearing. The Respondent nevertheless took the position in its final submissions that he was not entitled to act for the Complainant. It also took the position that he had contravened the Legal Profession Act, R.S.B.C. 198, c. 9, in doing so.\n[86] The issue for the Tribunal arises out of the wording of s. 50(1) of the Act, which states that the Tribunal shall give the parties a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations. The French version of the section states that the Tribunal shall give the parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations.\n[87] The word avocat in the French text certainly suggests that the word counsel should be restricted to lawyers. There is a recent decision in Beaudet-Fortin v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Canadienne des Postes, [2004] CHRT 23, in spite of this, where the Member states that it has been the practice of the Tribunal to permit representatives who are not lawyers to appear. The matter has not been definitively decided and should be resolved in a case where there is a live issue.\n[88] The Respondent provided me with a number of cases that deal with the services of representatives who are not lawyers. There seems to be a concern that such representatives may be practicing law, in contravention of the provincial legislation that governs such matters. I share these concerns. They are better dealt with, however, in a hearing where the matter has been properly raised at the outset of the process.\nB. Are the Fees of a Lay Representative Recoverable? [89] The more immediate question concerns the power to award costs. If the Tribunal has such a power, the Respondent argues, it should be restricted to lawyer's fees. There is no authority under the Act, in its view, to award costs for the services of a lay representative.\n[90] Counsel for the Complainant submitted that there was no reason to distinguish between representatives who are lawyers and representatives who are not. The Labour Relations Board in Graham, supra, for example, recognized that the fees of such representatives should be recoverable. At para. 49, the Board held: Regardless of the form of representation chosen, the intent of the Board's award of costs is to provide the successful complainant with a full indemnity for fees and expenses reasonably incurred. This is not a true indemnity, but the point remains. At para. 50, the Board relies on Orkin, The Law of Costs, 2nd ed., p. 3-37 (para. 311), in setting out a series of factors that provide a rough guide in assessing solicitor-and-client costs. Counsel for the Complainant suggests that the Tribunal should adopt the same approach.\nC. Waiver [91] The real issue lies elsewhere however. Counsel for the Complainant argued that the Respondent waived any right to object to Mr. Finding's fees. After all, the Respondent knew from the beginning that Mr. Finding was not a lawyer. Counsel knew that he was charging fees for his services. If Counsel wanted to contest the matter, it should have done so at the beginning of the hearing.\n[92] The Respondent replied by citing Saskatchewan River Bungalows Ltd. v. Maritime Life Assurance Co. [1994] 2 S.C.R. 400, [1994] S.C.J. No. 59 (QL), at paras. 19 and 20, for the proposition that the doctrine of waiver should be narrowly construed. At para. 20, the Supreme Court held:\nWaiver will be found only where the evidence demonstrates that the party waiving had (1) a full knowledge of rights; and (2) an unequivocal and conscious intention to abandon them.\nThere is a reason for the use of such strong language:\nThe creation of such a stringent test is justified since no consideration moves from the party in whose favour a waiver operates.\nIt follows that the waiver must be explicit.\n[93] The Respondent argues that it may have waived any objections to the use of a representative who is not a lawyer. It did not take a position on the issue of fees however. This is true enough. There is nothing to suggest that it consciously intended to abandon its right to contest the question of costs. The Complainant submits that this does not resolve the matter however. The RCMP should have raised the issue earlier.\n[94] I think the Respondent acquiesced. The decision not to object to Mr. Finding's participation in the hearing constitutes a waiver, in my judgement, that applies to the entirety of the proceedings. It is too late to speak of retraction. Nor can the Respondent waive the issue piecemeal. I do not see how it can say that it waived its right to dispute the matter for some purposes and not for others. There is nothing in the record to support such a position.\n[95] I see no reason why the Respondent cannot place limitations on its original waiver. These conditions must be explicit and prospective however. They cannot be introduced after the fact. The caselaw holds that a waiver must be explicit. But the same goes for the fine print. If a party intends to add exceptions and conditions to its waiver, however, that must also be explicit. It is the Respondent who must accordingly take responsibility for the failure to clarify the matter in the present case. It follows that Mr. Finding's lack of professional status cannot be used to prevent the Complainant from recovering her costs.\nIX. RULING [96] For all of the above reasons, I would rule as follows:\n1. Section 53(2)(c)\n[97] There is no jurisdictional issue with respect to legal costs that can be characterized as damages or compensation. The initial fees for obtaining legal advice can be construed as expenses incurred by the Complainant as a result of the discriminatory practice under s. 53(2)(c). It would be wrong to deny a complainant the natural legal reflex, in seeking the advice of counsel.\n[98] The Complainant is accordingly entitled to recover the cost of her initial consultations with a lawyer. I think this extends to preliminary discussions with the other side, for the purpose of determining whether it was necessary to file a complaint.\n2. Costs\n[99] I am satisfied that the Tribunal has a residual power to award costs in order to preserve the compensation awarded to a successful complainant. The Complainant is accordingly entitled to her reasonable costs. The Respondent has nevertheless raised a legitimate question on the jurisdictional issue before me. In the circumstances, each party will bear its own costs for any fees incurred with respect to the present application.\n[100] Since the Tribunal is under the supervision of the Federal Court, it makes sense to make use of the Federal Court rules in deciding such a matter. Rule 400(3), which is attached as Appendix A to the present ruling, sets out a list of factors that may be considered in determining what costs are appropriate under the Act. I think this provides the right starting point in such an exercise.\n[101] If the parties cannot settle the matter by themselves, they are invited to make written submissions to the Tribunal. I will retain jurisdiction for three months from the date of this ruling. I would also like to thank counsel on both sides for their assistance. The material provided by counsel for the Respondent was particularly helpful.\nSigned by Dr .

INTRODUCTION [1] The complainant, Mr. Ronald J. Howell, became a member of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) on September 9, 1983. At the time, he was approximately 20 years old and had a grade 11 education. He was born on December 15, 1962 and is currently 42 years of age.\n[2] After Mr. Howell completed basic training, he was posted to Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Winnipeg. He began his trade specific training in February of 1984 at CFB Borden in Ontario. There, he underwent his initial training as a driver. He was then posted to Toronto. Initially, he was at the rank of Private.\n[3] In September of 1985, Mr. Howell became a regular member of the CAF. He was posted to CFB Petawawa in a support unit. He remained in Petawawa from 1985 until 1993. While in Petawawa he was promoted to the rank of Corporal. By 1987, he completed training which qualified him as a vehicle technician.\n[4] He received positive job performance appraisals until his release.\n[5] Unfortunately, throughout his career with the CAF, Mr. Howell experienced a series of knee surgeries.\nII. DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT - DRILL INCIDENT [6] Mr. Howell alleges that his superiors aggravated his existing right knee problems when they forced him to participate in a platoon drill on March 23, 1995 without his brace (drill incident). He alleges that had the CAF accommodated his request to get his brace or to go to the medical infirmary, at the time, by excusing him from drill exercise, he would not have sustained further knee deterioration of such magnitude as to result in his release. He alleges that but for the drill incident he would still be a member of the CAF today.\nIII. FACTS A. Knee Injuries Existing Prior to Drill Incident [7] Mr. Howell has a longstanding and complex history of right knee injuries and surgeries. These are outlined in the report of Dr. Randall dated December 9, 20031 with attachments and his complete medical file found in Volumes 1-42. It is suffice to say that Mr. Howell's right knee injuries began in about January 1982 when he was involved in a serious car accident. As early as May 1984, Mr. Howell complained of pain in his right knee particularly during activities such as running and playing sports. He also complained that his right knee buckled in the mornings. He suffered a major right knee injury in September1989 when he twisted and injured his right knee after stepping on a rock during a voluntary athletic competition, known as the Ironman Competition. He was taken to the hospital and treated for a major knee injury (right knee anterior cruciate ligament injury). His right knee problems began with this incident.\n[8] Then, in 1990, he slipped while kicking a tire and further injured his right knee. He underwent his first right knee surgery for ACL reconstruction on May 21, 1991.\n[9] Following that surgery, Mr. Howell was prescribed a Generation II brace which he obtained in about November 1993.\n[10] In about May 1992, he re-injured his right knee while marching in a military parade exercise and twisting his right knee. In August 1992, he underwent a second surgery, an arthroscopy to his right knee.\n[11] By June 1, 1993, Mr. Howell was posted at CFB Shilo and promoted to the rank of Acting Master Corporal. He was required to pass a Junior Leaders Course (JLC course) in order to receive his promotion to Master Corporal. The JLC course was designed to teach non-commissioned officers leadership skills. Early in his posting, he experienced problems while performing a drill routine. On June 16, 1993, he was seen by a physician for his complaints of soreness after performing drill. He was advised to use crutches, ice, a knee brace and knee elevation to alleviate the symptoms.\n[12] In January 1994, he complained of discomfort with walking, and particularly running. He was referred to a physician to determine if he was fit to participate in a JLC course which would involve considerable physical activity. The CAF then referred him to Dr. de Korompay, a civilian orthopaedic surgeon. Mr. Howell reported to him his experience of occasional locking of his right knee, discomfort and other popping sensations which symptoms appeared to have been aggravated by his job. Based on Dr. de Korompay's recommendation for a further arthroscopy, Mr. Howell was found to be unfit for the course.\n[13] Dr. de Korompay performed a third surgery on Mr. Howell's right knee in February 1994 after a slip and fall. Dr. de Korompay noted a medial meniscus tear which he resected. The doctor also noted that although Mr. Howell had a partial tear in his ACL, he had reasonable stability. He felt that Mr. Howell could continue with his CAF duties. In fact, by March 1994, Mr. Howell's supervisors continued to recommend Mr. Howell for promotion.\n[14] In September 1994, Mr. Howell participated in a JNCO (Junior Non-Commissioned Officer) course, which is similar to the JLC course. The JNCO course included the administrative aspects of the JCL course with an added component of infantry. During that course, he began to experience anterior right knee problems and pain. He realized that his knee was not sufficiently well to complete the course. He asked to be released from the course. Upon such request, he was given a medical RTU (medical Return to Unit), giving him permission to leave the course and return to the unit without being given a course failure. The CAF recommended that he be given another opportunity to take the course once his medical condition was resolved. At the time, he was assessed by his supervising officer as being neither physically nor mentally prepared for leadership training. Mr. Howell agreed with this assessment because the JNCO course included an infantry component not found in the initial JLC course.\n[15] After his return to Shilo, Mr. Howell undertook aggressive physiotherapy for PFS (patella femoral syndrome), the most common cause of anterior knee pain. He tried to rehabilitate his knee in preparation for the JNCO course to be held at CFB Shilo in February 1995.\n[16] In December 1994, he passed a fitness test, and the base physician at Shilo advised him to wear cushion soles and inserts and to wear a knee brace, as well as to avoid impact sports. Mr. Howell indicated to the physician that he would try his best in the course.\n[17] By January 1995, Mr. Howell reported to the base physician that he was having good results from using cushion insoles and his knee brace. At this time, the base physician gave Mr. Howell a chit that he was fit for starting another JNCO course. A chit was a note given by a physician to CAF members who were unable to perform their CAF tasks due to medical problems. The chit outlined the limitations of the member to his supervisors. The member was responsible for giving the chit to his respective supervising officers who passed the chit up to the members' unit officers.\nB. Alleged Discrimination - March 1995 - Drill Incident [18] Mr. Howell started his JNCO course again on February 27, 1995. At the start of the course, Mr. Howell advised Sergeant Thompson that he had a knee injury and was required to wear a brace. Sergeant Thompson had no difficulty with this request.\n[19] Unfortunately, on March 7, 1995, Mr. Howell slipped on ice when walking into a building. He was diagnosed with a vulgus strain of the right knee. As of March 13, 1995 his knee condition was essentially unchanged: he was taking Ibuprofen for pain, and was icing his leg and elevating it. He was given a chit to wear his knee brace.\n[20] During a weekly interview with Sergeant Thompson, on about March 20, 1995, Mr. Howell asked him if he could be excused from participating in further drill testing given that he had already passed his drill portion of the course. Drill involved marching, halting, swift right and left turns, hard pounding and stomping of the feet, and standing in the attention position for long periods of time. Mr. Howell indicated that this type of drill activity was hard on his knee. Sergeant Thompson agreed to excuse Mr. Howell from participating in the drill portion of the course on March 23, 1995. He told Mr. Howell to rest his knee in preparation for phase two of the course, consisting of infantry tactics. Sergeant Thompson obtained the consent of other CAF staff to facilitate an exemption from drill for Mr. Howell.\n[21] On the morning of March 23, 1995, Mr. Howell participated in the physical fitness component of the course, wearing shorts and without his brace. He played aggressive hard charging army style basketball. Sergeant Thompson observed Mr. Howell playing this game.\n[22] Later that morning, after breakfast, Mr. Howell reported to the parade square without his knee brace believing that he was excused from drill. Lieutenant Hart asked Mr. Howell why he could participate in PT (physical training) but not in drill. Mr. Howell replied that he had worn his brace and running shoes. Lt. Hart replied that if he could participate in basketball, he could participate in drill. Mr. Howell stated that he did not have his brace with him. His brace was in Brandon, Manitoba. Lt. Hart ordered him to participate in the 40 minute drill without his brace. When Mr. Howell resisted, Sergeant Thompson began using expletives and demanded to know why Mr. Howell was not participating in drill. Mr. Howell again indicated that he did not have his brace with him. Again using expletives, Sergeant Thompson ordered Mr. Howell onto the parade square in spite of the fact that he did not have his brace with him. Mr. Howell obeyed the orders and participated in the first half of the drill for about 20 minutes. During a break, Mr. Howell sought permission of Sergeant Houde to go to the medical inspection room (MIR) to be excused from drill. Sergeant Houde gave him permission to do so. However, when Sergeant Thompson observed Mr. Howell putting on his jacket, he used expletives to order Mr. Howell back onto the parade square to finish the drill. Mr. Howell advised him that he wished to go to MIR and Sergeant Thompson denied this request. Sergeant Thompson told him to go to sick parade the next morning. Mr. Howell repeated his request to go to MIR for a chit but again this request was denied by Sergeant Thompson in less than polite language. Mr. Howell completed the second half of the drill as ordered.\n[23] After completion of the drill Mr. Howell's knee felt painful and swollen. However he did not report to MIR immediately. In fact, he completed the rest of his CAF activities for the day. The next morning, Mr. Howell reported to the base physician.\nC. Subsequent History to Drill Incident [24] The following day being Friday, March 24, 1995, Mr. Howell's knee was swollen. He indicated to the base physicians that he was in pain and was having problems bearing his body weight. He was given a steroid shot and an anaesthetic in order to reduce the swelling and discomfort in the knee. Mr. Howell reported that his knee had been locking and hurting for about 4 weeks to that date. He was referred to the base hospital for further assessment.\n[25] No medical restrictions were imposed on Mr. Howell and he was told to return to the course. He did so. He was given a practice test in preparation for his upcoming small party tasking which he failed. However, this failure did not affect his mark as each member was given a practice chance to pass.\n[26] Mr. Howell went home to Brandon for the weekend. The members had been given a leave pass for the weekend. He iced his knee and elevated it and felt confident that he could return to the course.\n[27] He returned to his course on Sunday evening March 26, 1995. On Monday, March 27, Mr. Howell, participated in physical training consisting of marching with a full rucksack. After breakfast, on his way to an underground classroom, his knee locked. He fell head first down a set of stairs. He fell on top of another member and was unable to stand in the stairwell. He was taken to MIR where he complained of pain in his right knee and true locking incidents. The base physician suspected the existence of a meniscal tear. This was a significant injury.\n[28] A base doctor recommended that Mr. Howell fall within a temporary category. He was unfit to work and not capable of completing the course. He recommended a medical RTU or medical return to unit for Mr. Howell. A medical RTU is where, due to a medical condition, a student is released from the course without any career ramifications. Once the member is well the member is then permitted to take the course again. Mr. Howell was given crutches and prescribed Tylenol 3 for pain.\nD. Small Party Tasking [29] After taking Tylenol 3 Mr. Howell felt sleepy and groggy. Nonetheless, that evening Mr. Howell was further tested in a test known as Small Party Tasking. Through small party tasking members were evaluated on their ability to command others to carry out an assigned task. Mr. Howell voluntarily participated in the small party tasking even though he indicated to Warrant Officer Legge that he was concerned about his ability to take the test given his medicated state. Mr. Howell was permitted to take the test from his bed in the barracks. His task was to direct team members to move furniture from one room into another. He failed the test due to his medicated state of mind. The following day, he was released from the course. However, Lieutenant Hart gave him a course failure on his course report for below standard performance and poor motivation and attitude. He was demoted in rank. In March 1996, Mr. Howell grieved this report successfully and it was amended to indicate that he failed the course due to medical reasons. Lieutenant Hart's concerns that Mr. Howell exhibited disrespectful attitude towards his supervisors were maintained on the revised course report post-grievance. Mr. Howell was satisfied with the amended course report. His rank of acting Master Corporal was reinstated with retroactive pay.\nE. Medical History After the Alleged Discrimination [30] Mr. Howell was again referred to Dr. de Korompay, who saw him on June 12, 1995. Mr. Howell advised Dr. de Korompay of the drill incident but did not advise him of his March 27, 1995 fall down the stairs. Mr. Howell exhibited some anterior and retropatellar discomfort and medial joint line symptoms. Dr. de Korompay recommended that Mr. Howell undergo another right knee arthroscopy which he performed in July 1995. This was Mr. Howell's fourth surgery. During the surgery, Dr. de Korompay found a meniscal tear as well as a slight tear to his ACL graft. Dr. de Korompay removed a significant portion of Mr. Howell's anterior meniscus. The injuries that Dr. de Korompay observed in June 1995 and during the surgery of July 1995 were caused by the March 27, 1995 fall. Further, the wearing of the requested knee brace during the drill would not have prevented such or similar injuries.\n[31] Post surgery Mr. Howell was advised to wear soft-soled boots. His condition improved to the point that, in August 1995, he was participating in heavier sporting activities such as European handball. He completed the forced march portion of CAF warrior training and had his temporary restricted medical category reinstated to full duties (G2O2\") as of October 1995. His job duties were not modified and his knee surgeries did not prevent him from working as many overtime hours as he was accustomed to working prior to the surgery. Mr. Howell and Dr. de Korompay saw his July 1995 surgery as having successfully resolved his knee problems.\n[32] However, Mr. Howell had further incidents involving his right knee following the July 1995 surgery. These included a first degree strain of his right knee in about April 1996 when he was lifting a generator at work. His knee went into spasms but the symptoms resolved quickly. Unfortunately, his knee pain persisted and, in August 1996, he was given a temporary restriction in medical category due to bilateral knee pain, with the right knee being worse than the left knee.\n[33] He consulted Dr. de Korompay again in September 1996, complaining that he could not run and was experiencing pain while running. Mr. Howell testified that his physical and mental condition had deteriorated. Dr. de Korompay suggested that he perform another scope to his knee to determine if there were mechanical problems leading to his symptoms. He felt that unless he could remedy the problems, Mr. Howell would have to consider retiring from the CAF given his need to run. Dr. de Korompay performed a fifth arthroscopy on Mr. Howell in January 1997 and found that degenerative changes in his knee would prevent Mr. Howell from performing his CAF duties, including running. Dr. de Korompay felt that Mr. Howell should have permanent restrictions from prolonged running, particularly with weights such as having to carry backpack.3 After the surgery, Dr. de Korompay had a serious discussion with Mr. Howell about his inability to continue his career with the CAF. Mr. Howell agreed that he needed to retire from the CAF to protect his knee. He was also having mental anxieties.\nF. Release from CAF - March 1998 [34] Thus, on February 20, 1997, Mr. Howell voluntarily assessed himself as being incapable of performing a number of tasks due to his knee injuries, specifically the General Duties of his vehicle technician job. He indicated that he could not walk cross-country over uneven terrain for long distances, could not stand for periods of up to 10 hours each, and could not dig a personal trench. Mr. Howell completed the form knowing that his responses to the questions would result in a medical release.\n[35] On that day, he was given a permanent category of G4\" and found to be unfit for UN duties \/ field duties. He was awarded O3\" as being unable to perform his occupational duties such as running, rucksack, drill, marching or other high impact activities. This ultimately resulted in a CAF career medical review board reviewing Mr. Howell's career prospects. The board found that Mr. Howell's employment limitations drastically restricted his capacity to perform the full spectrum of his CAF duties. He was found not to meet the universality of service principle. As a consequence, he was discharged from the Canadian Forces effective March 31, 1998.\nG. Post Release [36] Following his discharge from the CAF, through a military insurance plan, Mr. Howell commenced retraining. He completed his grade 12 and then began a college radiology course. Because the radiology course required him to stand frequently, he was unable to take on the vocation of a radiology technician. After aborting his retraining in May 1999, he decided to start his own small engine repair shop which he ran from approximately June 1999 to about June 2003. He did not make a profit. Rather, the business operated at a loss.\nH. Application for PTSD Pension [37] During the intervening years from the date Mr. Howell left the CAF to the date of the hearing, he was awarded four disability pensions from the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA). The effective date and percentage amounts of the pension are found at page 8 of Respondent's tab 13 of its additional disclosures4. In brief, Mr. Howell is currently receiving a pension assessed as a 20% disability for his right knee. That pension was effective April 2, 1998.\n[38] In February 2004, Mr. Howell made an application for a federal disability pension alleging that the drill incident contributed to or caused him to suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and that the drill incident led to his course failure and his ultimate release from the CAF. Dr. McIntrye, a psychiatrist, supported Mr. Howell's application by providing an opinion to DVA that Mr. Howell had PTSD and that the drill incident seemed to have precipitated Mr. Howell's anxious and depressive syndrome. The pension was granted after appeal. Mr. Howell had not served in combat. Thus, Mr. Howell eventually began to receive a second pension retroactive to September 24, 2002 for a 40% disability.\n[39] The total amount of the pension that Mr. Howell receives is $2,162.63 per month. That figure is 72% of the total amount which the Complainant would be entitled to if he was completely disabled and takes into account the fact that the Complainant is married and has three children.\nIV. BASES OF MY FACTUAL FINDINGS [40] The bases for my factual findings are outlined below.\nA. Lay Witnesses [41] As the events occurred many years ago, and because there is a conflict between the written notes of the events and the oral testimony of the witnesses, I place more weight on the written notes. As well, where there is a discrepancy between the testimony of Mr. Howell and that of Sergeant Thompson and Captain Hart, I prefer the testimony of the latter two CAF witnesses.\n[42] I find Sergeant Thompson to be a candid witness. I find him to have acted reasonably in his dealings with Mr. Howell prior to the drill incident. He had accommodated Mr. Howell's request for special consideration twice prior to the drill incident. He initially advised Mr. Howell that he had no difficulty with him wearing his brace during the course. Then he specifically exempted Mr. Howell from performing drill upon Mr. Howell's request. In fact, he obtained the consent of others to secure this exemption. I also prefer the evidence of Captain Hart over that of Mr. Howell. I find Captain Hart to be the most candid, direct and credible witness. I find both of these CAF witnesses to be more independent than the complainant. Both testified that they did not have extensive dealings with the complaint.\n[43] On the other hand, I do not find the oral testimony of Mr. Howell reliable given a number of factors. First, he had a more partisan interest in the complaint. Mr. Howell had lived and relived the drill incident in his mind many times since it occurred, each time revising his memory in a different context. For example, he testified that he had been advised by Dr. McIntyre that the drill incident was akin to him being raped5.\n[44] Second, he readily admitted that his memory of certain events was limited. There were discrepancies in his evidence in salient details. For example, he testified that during the drill incident he had asked permission to go to the barracks to get his brace and that this request was denied. Yet, his notes and other documentation regarding the drill incident indicate that he had not asked for permission to retrieve his brace from his barracks. Rather, he had asked permission to go to MIR to get a chit to be excused from drill. As well, he testified that he had initially refused an order to do the drill. Again, his notes, redress of grievance and complaint do not support such an event.\n[45] Third, Mr. Howell suffers from PTSD and filed a complaint for a pension for PTSD based on this same drill incident. Thus his mental abilities of recall and accuracy are compromised. His independence with respect to his account of the drill incident is also compromised.\n[46] I do not find the evidence of Corporal Finokio to be helpful. His memory of the drill incident and the surrounding time period was limited and he was about 30 feet away from Mr. Howell and Captain Hart when it occurred.6\nB. Mr. Howell's Notes [47] The written notes of Mr. Howell made the same day of the drill incident, confirm that Mr. Howell twice repeated to Sergeant Thompson and Lieutenant Hart ...I don't have my brace.... Had the brace been five minutes away in his barracks at Shilo, as he testified during this hearing, he would have spontaneously stated to the Sergeant I don't have my brace but it is only 5 minutes away. Please let me get it, or words to that effect. He did not do so.\n[48] As well, Mr. Howell asked for permission to go to MIR to get a chit excusing him from drill. Had the brace been five minutes away in his barracks, he would have asked permission to go to his barracks to obtain the brace rather than to go to MIR to be excused from drill.\n[49] While it is true that on March 13, 1995, Mr. Howell asked for and received a chit from the base physician allowing him to wear a knee brace, I accept Sergeant Thompson's evidence that he did not receive such a chit from Mr. Howell. This is consistent with Mr. Howell's notes of the drill incident wherein he asked for permission to go to MIR for a chit excusing him from drill. He did not state to Sergeant Thompson, Sergeant, I gave you a chit telling you that I need to wear a knee brace for drill or Sergeant, you have the chit\", or words to that effect. He would have spoken such words had Mr. Howell twice given Sergeant Thompson a chit. In fact, the chit itself has not been produced in this hearing as part of his CAF file. Further, Mr. Howell testified that he wanted to obtain an updated chit because he was not sure if the staff had passed the other chits to Sergeant Thompson. Thus, in his testimony, he admitted that he did not give the chits to the Sergeant personally.\n[50] Mr. Swayze urges that I accept that Mr. Howell would have acted in his best interests and worn the brace the morning of the drill incident during basketball. However, with respect to the time period of September 1994 to March 1995, Mr. Swayze questioned Mr. Howell as to Dr. de Korompay's advice to him regarding knee care. Mr. Howell testified that Dr. de Korompay had specifically told him to wear his knee brace during drill and to try to avoid contact sports. Yet, Mr. Howell, contrary to his doctor's advice, participated in an aggressive game of basketball. He did not seek an exemption from participation in basketball as he did with respect to participation in drill.\n[51] Sergeant Thompson specifically observed Mr. Howell's knee and whether he was wearing a brace that morning. This is consistent with the fact that Mr. Howell had requested special consideration for exemption from drill based upon the state of his knee. Sergeant Thompson would have carefully observed Mr. Howell and his knee that morning.\nC. Expert Witnesses [52] I find that Dr. de Korompay testified in a candid, professional and helpful manner. Yet, I prefer the opinion of Dr. Randall to that of Dr. de Korompay with respect to the likelihood that the drill incident led to the injuries recorded by Dr. de Korompay in June 1995 and for which he performed surgical procedures in July 1995. Some of my reasons are outlined below.\n[53] In assessing Mr. Howell in June 1995 and in formulating his opinions, Dr. de Korompay was not given the benefit of assessing Mr. Howell's injuries in light of the March 13, 1995 slip on ice. He testified that Mr. Howell had not advised him of the fall. Nor was he otherwise advised of Mr. Howell's March 27, 1995 head first fall down the stairs or the May 10, 1995 incident of Mr. Howell's knee giving way and recurring locking. In his report of September 12, 2003, Dr. de Korompay confirmed that he was not aware of other episodes of injury in the interim. Based on the limited information that Mr. Howell and his counsel gave to Dr. de Korompay about Mr. Howell's medical situation at the relevant times, he opined that the findings presented on the scope of July 1995 could be attributed to the injury of March 1995.\n[54] Dr. de Korompay freely acknowledged that in assessing the extent of the contribution of the drill incident to Mr. Howell's final state, he relied upon what the patient told him and what he saw in his knee after examination. Mr. Howell informed him that the drill incident caused him significant trauma with subsequent pain and swelling.\n[55] Dr. Randall, on the other hand, obtained and reviewed Mr. Howell's complete medical file, contained in four volumes. Dr. de Korompay was not given the benefit of doing so. While it is true that Dr. Randall had not examined Mr. Howell in formulating his opinion, neither had Dr. de Korompay after Mr. Howell's significant knee injuries during his CAF career, and particularly those that occurred from March 1995 through to June 1995.\n[56] For the same reasons, I also reject Dr. de Korompay's opinion that had Mr. Howell worn his knee brace during the drill incident, the brace would likely have prevented the injury he observed in June 1995 and July 1995. Given that I do not accept that the June 1995 and July 1995 injuries were caused by the drill incident, the effect of not wearing a brace during the drill incident does not assist me with assessing its relationship to those subsequent injuries. As well, I accept Dr. Randall's opinion that a derotational knee brace would have played a minimal role in his knee stability that day for all of the reasons he outlined in his expert report. Even Dr. de Korompay acknowledged that the question of whether a brace provides any stability support after an adequate rehabilitation program is controversial.\n[57] Finally, with respect to possible psychological benefits of the knee brace to Mr. Howell, while some evidence was produced in the hearing by the respondent to the effect that Mr. Howell\nsuffered from PTSD7, the complainant and the Commission failed to call Dr. McIntryre to testify in an expert capacity. I note that he remained a potential witness throughout the hearing as per the Tribunal's potential witness list. Thus, I am unable to find that the failure to wear a brace during the drill incident precipitated or contributed to Mr. Howell's deteriorated psychological state. Respondent counsel asked me to draw an adverse inference against Mr. Howell for failing to call Dr. McIntyre. I do not need to do so to dispose of this case.\nV. ISSUES [58] Based upon my findings of fact I now address the legal issues that arise.\n[59] The jurisdiction of this tribunal arises from Mr. Howell's complaint dated July 20, 1998. Mr. Howell's counsel, Mr. Swayze, confirmed in his opening statement that the crux of Mr. Howell's complaint centres around the drill incident of March 23, 19958. Mr. Swayze argued that the CAF denied Mr. Howell the use of a knee brace, a piece of equipment which he required in order to properly function, and that this act constituted a discriminatory act. He argued that as a result of that incident, Mr. Howell required further knee surgery and further deterioration of his knee occurred. But for this incident, his knee would not have deteriorated as quickly as it did, and he probably would have spent more time in the CAF. Mr. Swayze argued:\nWe will show, Madam Chair, that this was a case where a split second decision, had he been given an extra five minutes to walk across to the barracks and pick up his knee brace, had he been given that time, we wouldn't be here today, Madam Chair.9\n[60] Thus, in accordance with the complaint, the submissions of counsel and Mr. Howell's own testimony, the only issues that arise in this case are those relating to the drill incident. The issues are:\nDid the drill incident constitute a discriminatory practice contrary to section 7(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act?10 Did the drill incident constitute a discriminatory practice contrary to s. 7(b) of the Act? If the answer to either of these questions is in the affirmative, has the CAF established a BFOR defence further to s. 15(a) of the Act? If not, what remedies should be awarded to Mr. Howell?\nVI. LAW A. Human Rights Law [61] Mr. Howell filed a complaint dated July 20, 1998, pursuant to s. 7 of the Act as it stood on that date, complaining about events that occurred in March 1995. Section 7 of the current Act states that it is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\na) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\nb) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of employment. One of the prohibited grounds is disability.\n[62] Section 15(1)(a) outlines the bona fide occupational requirement (the BFOR) defence:\nIt is not a discriminatory practice if any refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement.\nSection 15(2) states:\nFor any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) to be considered to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement and for any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(g) to be considered to have a bona fide justification, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost.\nSection 15(8) confirms that section 15 applies to both direct and adverse effect discrimination.\nSection 15(9) states:\nSubsection (2) is subject to the principle of universality of service under which members of the Canadian Forces must at all times and under any circumstances perform any functions that they may be required to perform.\n[63] The Act as it stood in March 1995 did not contain provisions equivalent to the current section 15(2), 15(8) and 15(9). These amendments came into force and effect as of June 30, 1998.11\n[64] In 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada released its decisions in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. British Columbia Government and Services Employees' Union (B.C.G.S.E.U.), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 [Meiorin] and British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868 [Grismer]. In these two cases, the Supreme Court of Canada replaced the former jurisprudential distinction between direct and indirect discrimination with a unified approach. Under the unified approach, the onus remains upon the complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one that covers the allegations made, and which, if believed, is sufficient and complete to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent. Once a prima facie case of discrimination has been established by the complainant, the onus shifts to the respondent to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the discriminatory standard or policy is a BFOR. In order to establish a BFOR, the respondent must prove that:\nA) it adopted the standard for a purpose or goal that is rationally connected to the function being performed. At this stage, the focus is not on the validity of the particular standard, but on the more general purpose, such as the need to work safely and efficiently to perform the job. Where the general purpose is to ensure the safe and efficient performance of the job, it will not be necessary to spend much time at this stage;\nB) it adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfilment of that legitimate work-related purpose, with no intention of discriminating against the claimant. Here, the analysis shifts from the general purpose of the standard, to the standard itself; and;\nC) the impugned standard is reasonably necessary for the employer to accomplish its purpose; i.e. the safe and efficient job performance. The employer must establish that it cannot accommodate the claimant and others adversely affected by the standard without experiencing undue hardship. The employer must ensure that the procedure, if any, to assess the issue of accommodation, addresses the possibility that it might discriminate unnecessarily on a prohibited ground. As well the substantive content of a more accommodating standard offered by the employer must be individually sensitive. Alternatively, the employer must justify his reason for not offering such an alternative standard.\n[65] The Supreme Court's rulings in Meiorin and Grismer are also instructive in assessing whether or not an undue hardship defence has been established. In Meiorin, the Supreme Court observed that the use of the word `undue' implies that some hardship is acceptable; it is only `undue' hardship that will satisfy the test.12 An uncompromisingly stringent standard may be ideal from the employer's perspective. Yet, if it is to be justified under human rights legislation, the standard must accommodate factors relating to the unique capabilities and inherent worth and dignity of every individual, up to the point of undue hardship. The Supreme Court has further observed that in order to prove that a standard is reasonably necessary, a respondent always bears the burden of demonstrating that the standard incorporates every possible accommodation to the point of undue hardship. It is incumbent on the respondent to show that it has considered and reasonably rejected all viable forms of accommodation. The onus is on the respondent to prove that incorporating aspects of individual accommodation within the standard was impossible short of undue hardship. In some cases, excessive cost may justify a refusal to accommodate those with disabilities. However, one must be wary of putting too low a value on accommodation. It is all too easy to cite increased cost as a reason for refusing to accord equal treatment. The adoption of the respondent's standard has to be supported by convincing evidence.13 Impressionistic evidence of increased cost will not generally suffice. Innovative and practical non-monetary avenues of accommodation ought to be considered. Finally, factors such as the financial cost of methods of accommodation should be applied with common sense and flexibility in the context of the factual situation under consideration.14 As observed by Cory J. in Chambly v. Bergevin [1994] 2 SCR 525, what may be entirely reasonable in prosperous times may impose an unreasonable financial burden on an employer in times of economic restraint or recession. I note that the term `undue hardship' is not currently defined in the Act.\n[66] In the case at the bar, first and foremost, the issue that must be squarely addressed, is whether or not the complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination? This tribunal, further to ss. 49 and 50, is to conduct an inquiry into the complaint. This inquiry is to be independent, impartial and have due regard to the evidence presented and the relevant law. This tribunal is bound by the Federal Court of Appeal's ruling in Hutchinson v. Canada (Minister of the Environment) (C.A.) (2003), 4 F.C. 580. The court confirmed that both Meiorin and Grismer considered the effects of discrete, explicit standards or policies which served as screening tools; i.e., an aerobic capacity standard that adversely discriminated against women, and a visual acuity standard for the issuance of driver's licenses, constituting direct discrimination. The Federal Court of Appeal distinguished those cases from a transaction between the parties that was not driven by a pre-existing policy. Instead, there was a course of dealings in which the parties operated from an understanding of their respective rights and obligations. In Hutchinson, it was difficult to isolate and identify a particular policy or standard. In Meiorin, the Court's analysis began from a finding that the policy in question distinguished between people adversely on a prohibited ground. The Federal Court ruled that where one is dealing with a course of conduct, the more appropriate question is, does the transaction between the parties, taken as a whole, result in adverse treatment on a prohibited ground? If the transaction taken as a whole does not disclose adverse treatment, then the inquiry is at an end. If adverse treatment on a prohibited ground is shown, one proceeds to the three questions envisioned by the Supreme Court's analysis in Meiorin. In Hutchinson, the Court ruled that it was reasonably open to the Commission to find that the transaction between the appellant and the respondent, taken as a whole, did not disclose adverse treatment.\n[67] Further, in Hutchinson the Court affirmed that a complainant does not have the right to hold out for his or her preferred alternative. In that case, the respondent did attempt to accommodate the complainant's disability by moving her to alternate work sites, employing her on a seasonal basis, promoting a scent free environment and offering telework. The Federal Court adopted the ruling in Ontario (Ministry of Community and Social Services) v. OPSEU (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 560, where the Ontario Court of Appeal found that the employer's \"Religious Observance Policy\" was sufficient to accommodate the individual needs of adherents of minority religions. An employee claimed the right to paid time off to observe eleven religious holidays. The employer's policy provided for two paid days off for religious observance and allowed for additional days off to be taken via scheduling changes and earned days off accumulated through the employer's compressed work week option. The employee took the position that his earned days off from the compressed work week were his to use as he saw fit and that the employer could give him 11 paid days off for religious observance without undue hardship. The Court held that since the employer's policy was sufficiently inclusive to accommodate the claimant, the issue of accommodation to the point of undue hardship did not arise. The Federal Court ruled that one of the corollaries of this position is that claimants cannot refuse a reasonable solution on the ground that the alternative which they favour will not cause the employer undue hardship.\nB. Human Rights Law and Tort Law [68] The principles developed in tort law to restore victims to the position they would have enjoyed but for the wrongful act apply to human rights cases. Consequences of the act that were too indirect or too remote must be excluded from the damages recoverable.15 Subsequent to rulings by the Federal Court of Appeal such as in Morgan, the Supreme Court of Canada outlined a principled approach to assessment of causation in Athey v. Leonati, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 458. Causation is established where the defendant caused or contributed to the injury. The general, but not conclusive, test is the but for test, which requires the plaintiff to show that the injury would not have occurred but for the negligence of the defendant. Where the but for test is unworkable, the courts have recognized that causation is established where the defendant's negligence materially contributed to the occurrence of the injury. A contributing factor is material if it falls outside the de minimus range. Causation need not be determined with scientific precision. It is essentially a practical question of fact which can best be answered by ordinary common sense. At the same time, plaintiffs need not be placed in a better position than they would have been prior to the tort. Thus it is important not only to assess the plaintiff's position after the tort but also to assess what the original position would have been. It is the difference between these two positions: the original position and the injured position which constitutes the plaintiff's loss. If an intervening event was unrelated to the tort and affected the plaintiff's original position\", the net loss is not as great as it might have otherwise seemed. Thus, damages are reduced to reflect this.\nVII. ANALYSIS A. Prima Facie Case Not Established [69] In this case, I find that the transaction as a whole that occurred between Mr. Howell and the CAF surrounding the drill incident and the subsequent JNCO course failure did not constitute adverse treatment by the CAF against Mr. Howell.\n[70] With respect to s. 7(a) of the Act, Mr. Howell had a pre-existing history of knee problems prior to the drill incident. Thus, he had a disability within the meaning of the Act. However, the CAF did not refuse to employ him due to the events that transpired during the drill incident. Rather, Mr. Howell voluntarily chose to retire from the CAF due to events that transpired subsequent to the drill incident, not causally connected to the drill incident. Mr. Howell had largely recovered from his March 1995 injuries by October 1995 when his medical category was reinstated allowing him to perform full duties. At this time, his job duties were not modified and his knee surgeries did not prevent him from working as many overtime hours as he was accustomed to working prior to the surgery. Both Mr. Howell and Dr. de Korompay saw his July 1995 surgery as having successfully resolved his knee problems. In February 1997, well past his October 1995 surgical recovery, Mr. Howell evaluated himself as being unable to perform certain general military duties due to ongoing knee injuries. At the time of completing these forms, Mr. Howell was aware that this would lead to his termination as he would be found to breach universality of service principles of the CAF. Mr. Howell sought this result as he had accepted the recommendation of his physician that he should retire from the CAF. Consistent with Mr. Howell's expectations and desires, the CAF eventually discharged Mr. Howell in March 1998 on the basis that he did not comply with universality of service. The issue of the applicability, content and context of the duty of universality of service in March 1995 does not arise in this case. The complainant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Further, even if such a case had been established, the Tribunal is bound by the ruling of Irvine v. CAF 2003 FCT 660 (T.D.) wherein the court ruled that while Meorin does apply retroactively to events that occurred prior to the 1999 ruling, it must be applied with a contextual appreciation of the universality of service policy as it existed in March 1995. Thus, had the analysis proceeded to assessment of the respondent's defence, in the facts of this case, I find that the respondent would have successfully advanced its universality of service defence.\n[71] Secondly, I do not find that the CAF contravened s. 7(b) of the Act. It did not differentiate adversely against Mr. Howell by refusing to accommodate his request for a knee brace during drill or an exemption from drill. Mr. Howell sought a knee brace which was not medically required for him to perform drill safely. While the CAF officers denied Mr. Howell the opportunity to obtain a chit excusing him from drill due to the fact that he did not have his knee brace with him, there is insufficient evidence before me to demonstrate that more probably than not Mr. Howell required the knee brace to safely perform drill. The morning of the drill, just a few hours prior to the drill parade, Mr. Howell played an aggressive game of basketball without his brace. If he was able to perform this type of physical activity without a brace, then he was equally capable of performing drill without a brace. Mr. Howell's conduct of playing aggressive basketball without a brace is consistent with the expert opinion of both orthopaedic surgeons, Dr. Randall and Dr. de Korompay. They agreed that the brace was not physically necessary for patients one year post-surgery. They agreed that one year post-surgery, the knee brace functions to provide psychological support to the wearer, rather than mechanical support.\n[72] In short, Mr. Howell was not entitled to demand accommodation of a medical condition by a brace without an objective basis for such accommodation. In the facts of this case, he did not have the right to hold out for his preferred means of accommodation.\n[73] I do not find that the CAF adversely differentiated against Mr. Howell by assessing him negatively on the JNCO course report. Mr. Howell successfully challenged that course report through grievance proceedings. The report was amended to his satisfaction. Mr. Howell testified that he was satisfied with the revised course assessment that continued to maintain instructor concerns about Mr. Howell's performance and attitude. Indeed, Mr. Howell did not grieve the course failure even though he grieved the course evaluation. As well, I find that had the drill incident not occurred Mr. Howell would have been unable to successfully complete the JNCO course for a number of other reasons. Although Mr. Howell was given a chit that he was fit for the JNCO course, Mr. Howell himself was less confident about his ability to participate in the course. He indicated that he would try his best. Secondly, the JNCO course had an added infantry component not found in the JLC course that would have required greater physical fitness than the earlier course, and he had received an RTU from the September 1994 JNCO course. Thirdly, Mr. Howell's ability to pass the physical components of the course were compromised by his March 7, 1995 fall on ice and, more importantly, by his March 27, 1995 head first fall down the stairs.\n[74] Thus, the complainant and the Commission have failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination within the meaning of either section 7(a) or section 7(b) of the Act.\nB. Causation - July 1995 Injuries [75] Lastly, even if the analysis had proceeded to the assessment of quantum, I do not find that Mr. Howell could have successfully advanced the quantum claim he asserts. I find that Mr. Howell did not suffer significant immediate harm immediately following his drill participation. Immediately after the drill incident, Mr. Howell's knee felt painful and swollen. However he did not report to MIR until the next morning. In fact, he completed the rest of his CAF activities for the day without his brace. This conduct can be contrasted to the March 27, 1995 head first fall down the stairs. This was a severe injury. Immediately after this fall, Mr. Howell saw a physician and was advised that he was incapable of continuing with the course and that his category was changed. Had Mr. Howell suffered a debilitating injury due to the 40 minute drill, he would have reported to MIR immediately thereafter. I find that the drill incident did not materially contribute to Mr. Howell's pre-existing right knee problems: Using a common sense review of his complex medical history I find that the effect of the drill incident upon his right knee fell within the de minimus range. Had the drill incident not occurred, in light of his ongoing knee injuries, I find that Mr. Howell would have found himself in virtually the same medical situation as he experienced after the drill incident.\n[76] Dr. Randall confirms that individuals, such as Mr. Howell, who undergo ACL reconstruction will at some point develop degenerative changes both from the initial injury and subsequent wear due to high impact activities they resume following ACL reconstruction. Thus, irrespective of the drill incident, given his 1991 ACL reconstruction and the nature of his CAF duties, Mr. Howell would have suffered from degenerative change during his subsequent career with the CAF. I have already found that the injury observed by Dr. de Korompay in June \/ July 1995 was caused by the March 27, 1995 head first fall down a flight of stairs. Indeed, Dr. de Korompay freely acknowledged that a fall could have resulted in the damage that he observed in June and July 1995. I accept Dr. Randall's opinion that it was unlikely that Mr. Howell could have suffered a significant tear to his meniscus without an acute event such as the March 27, 1995 fall.\nVIII. CONCLUSION [77] The 1995 drill incident, and the subsequent JNCO course failure, did not constitute discriminatory practices contrary to section 7(a) of the Act. Nor did they lead to Mr. Howell's termination from the CAF in 1998 in light of pre-existing and intervening incidents. Rather, the fall of March 26, 1995, more probably than not, led to Mr. Howell's need for the July 1995 surgery. Mr. Howell recovered from this operation by October 1995. Thereafter, the April 1996 generator incident led to Mr. Howell's subsequent more serious knee injuries that led to his voluntary actions to secure release from the CAF.\n[78] The 1995 drill incident and the JNCO course failure did not constitute discriminatory practices contrary to s. 7(b) of the Act. Mr. Howell was not medically required to wear a knee brace during the drill incident, and any denial by the CAF of the opportunity to secure such a brace did not constitute discrimination. Mr. Howell was satisfied with the amended course evaluation post-grievance. I do not find that the CAF failed to accommodate Mr. Howell with respect to his disability. To the contrary, Sergeant Thompson made at least two attempts to accommodate Mr. Howell's requests prior to the drill incident. Further, throughout his career, and during the years of 1995 and 1996, the CAF accommodated Mr. Howell's needs for physical care for his knee condition.\n[79] Thus, I dismiss Mr. Howell's complaint in its entirety.\n[80] At the request of counsel I am not addressing the issue of costs herein. The parties may deal with them amongst themselves. If they are unable to agree, I retain jurisdiction to address this issue.\nShirish P.

Hadjis\n2004 CHRT 32\n2004\/10\/05\nI. FACTS\nII. LEGAL FRAMEWORK\nIII. ANALYSIS\nA. Prima facie case\nB. Respondent's Explanation\n[1] The Complainant alleges that the Respondent (Bell) discriminated against him on the basis of his disability (alcoholism) by terminating his employment, in violation of s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Complainant acted on his own behalf at the hearing. The Respondent was represented by legal counsel. The Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) opted to not appear at the hearing.\nI. FACTS [2] The Complainant began working for Bell in 1973, as a technician. By 1990, he held the position of Director - Installations and Repairs.\n[3] In 1996, Bell established a division called Gateways\", which dealt exclusively with the company's largest clients. Gateways' mandate was to sell, install and maintain telecommunications equipment. Gateways operated as an autonomous enterprise within Bell. Its continued existence was, however, conditional on its generating a profit, failing which Bell intended to dismantle the project. To improve the venture's chances of success, Bell transferred in its top-rated or elite technicians and managers.\n[4] The Complainant was transferred into the Gateways division in 1997. There were four levels of management employees within Gateways, ranging from D\", the lowest, up to A. The Complainant was employed at Level D. His duties entailed the supervision of 10 to 15 technicians who installed or repaired customers' equipment. Level D directors worked independently and many, including the Complainant, worked remotely from home. Although the Complainant was assigned some office space within one of Bell's buildings, he only attended it occasionally. He was provided with a company vehicle with which he drove to the sites where his technicians were working. Level C and D managers held meetings periodically, either at Bell's offices or at outside locations such as restaurants.\n[5] The Complainant stated at the hearing that he has had an alcohol dependency problem for most of his adult life. Bell maintains a program offering assistance to its employees facing any number of difficulties in their lives, including substance abuse. In 1990, under the auspices of this program, the Complainant received his first alcohol dependency treatment, which was paid for by Bell. He took a leave of absence from work for about three months and completed the treatment with success.\n[6] By 1995, the Complainant began to consume alcohol again. He did not disclose the recurrence of his alcohol problem to Bell but somehow, in 1997, rumours of alcohol abuse reached senior management. The Complainant was called to a meeting with a Level B senior executive, John Moon, regarding these reported suspicions. The Complainant convinced Mr. Moon that the allegations were false and unfounded.\n[7] Shortly after this meeting, the Complainant was assigned to a team within Gateways that fell under the supervision of Garry Pr\u00e9vost, a Level C director. The Complainant informed Mr. Pr\u00e9vost that he had recently met with Mr. Moon about a personal problem without specifying to what it related. The Complainant suspects that Mr. Moon may have provided Mr. Pr\u00e9vost with all the details about the meeting but he does not have any direct evidence to support his contention. In fact, the Complainant acknowledges that the only personal problem he ever discussed with Mr. Pr\u00e9vost related to certain marital difficulties he was experiencing.\n[8] Mr. Pr\u00e9vost eventually alluded to these personal problems in the Complainant's 1998 annual assessment, which was prepared in February 1999. Mr. Pr\u00e9vost noted that the Complainant had achieved very good results in his sector despite a personally very disturbing period. Both the 1997 and 1998 evaluations were positive overall. Mr. Pr\u00e9vost commented that the Complainant was ready to be promoted to the next level.\n[9] In 1999, the Complainant was transferred to a team headed by Jean-Guy Boucher, a Level C Director. Mr. Boucher testified that he spoke to Mr. Pr\u00e9vost about the Complainant on the occasion of the transfer, but all discussions related to performance. There was no mention made by Mr. Pr\u00e9vost of the Complainant's personal problems. All of Mr. Pr\u00e9vost's directors were eventually transferred to Mr. Boucher's team and personal matters were never discussed with respect to any of them, according to Mr. Boucher.\n[10] Gateways' unionized technicians went on strike in 1999 and Level D directors took over their tasks. They worked in teams of two, driving out to customers' locations to install and repair equipment. One of the directors complained to Mr. Boucher that the Complainant smelled of alcohol and asked that she no longer be assigned to work with him. The possibility that a member of his team was driving while on the job in an intoxicated state was of great concern to Mr. Boucher. Instead of confronting the Complainant with the complaint, Mr. Boucher opted to instruct Bell's internal security team to investigate. The Complainant was observed undercover over several days and a report was provided to Mr. Boucher stating that no significant drinking had been detected. The Complainant was viewed having an occasional beer or two at lunch, nothing out of the ordinary. Consequently, Mr. Boucher considered the matter closed.\n[11] The Complainant confirmed in this testimony that he was by this time going to great pains to conceal his drinking habit. He was consuming excessively only when at home, not while at work. Prior to any scheduled meetings with other directors, he refrained from drinking and he took special medication to suppress any bodily shakes. He acknowledges that he did not show up at work glassy-eyed and that he walked at a normal gait. He spoke coherently. Basically, he never showed up drunk at work. However, although he may not have been drinking while on the job, there may have remained a residual odour on him from his previous night's consumption of alcohol, which was probably what his colleague had detected during the strike period.\n[12] Through the course of 1999, certain deficiencies in the manner with which the Complainant managed his crew began to emerge. He was not doing on-site supervision on a daily basis and generally, his management style was not being executed in a tight fashion, according to Mr. Boucher. He was arriving late to scheduled meetings with other directors or failing to attend altogether. The Complainant explained in his testimony that he tried to steer clear of meetings that were conducted in restaurants or brasseries in order to avoid the temptation to drink in the presence of his colleagues.\n[13] Early in 2000, Mr. Boucher met with the Complainant to discuss his 1999 assessment, which was being prepared at that time. Mr. Boucher raised these performance issues with the Complainant. He also confided to the Complainant that during the strike, security agents had been assigned to investigate into his possible alcohol abuse, but their report proved negative. The Complainant assured Mr. Boucher that this finding was correct and that he did not have an alcohol problem. The Complainant explained in his testimony that his response was typical of an alcoholic who refuses to recognize that he has an addiction.\n[14] The Complainant's situation worsened over the summer of 2000. He had undertaken the sole care of his daughter while his spouse was away for about two weeks, and had therefore decided to stop drinking entirely during this period. By August 9th, he was in terrible shape due to the withdrawal symptoms he was experiencing. He realized that he needed help and decided to turn to Mr. Boucher for assistance. Early that morning, the Complainant telephoned him at his home. Mr. Boucher could tell from the Complainant's voice that he was in crisis. The Complainant told Mr. Boucher that he had an alcohol problem and wanted Bell's assistance to free himself of it. Mr. Boucher met up with the Complainant and drove him directly to Bell's Disability Management Group (DMG) facility situated within Bell's downtown Montreal offices. The DMG was responsible for the management of the health-related benefits to which Bell employees were entitled, including the treatment of substance abuse.\n[15] While being driven in, the Complainant told Mr. Boucher that he was an alcoholic and that he needed help. The Complainant explained that it was his fear of revealing his drinking problem that had prevented him from attending meetings with colleagues. Mr. Boucher testified that the Complainant also admitted that he encountered certain financial difficulties on account of his alcoholism, which he tried to resolve by filing a false expense claim. The Complainant adamantly denied this allegation in his testimony at the hearing.\n[16] The Complainant met with a physician on staff with the DMG, and was immediately referred to and placed in a treatment program. It consisted of three weeks of closed treatment during which he resided in the clinic full-time, followed by a four-week period of half-day treatments for which he travelled in from home, and a series of group therapy sessions for three months thereafter. The treatment was successful and the Complainant has managed to keep his alcohol problem under control to this day. The cost of the treatment was paid for by Bell.\n[17] The clinic had instructed the Complainant to not enter into any contact with his employer, including Mr. Boucher, during the course of the treatment. At the close of the initial stage, on September 26, 2000, the Complainant's physician issued a certificate authorizing his return to work on October 2, 2000. The same day, the Complainant picked up a voice-mail message from Rachel Turcotte, a representative of Bell's Employee Development Centre (EDC) otherwise known as Carrefour Carri\u00e8re. The EDC provided training and counselling to Bell employees who had lost their positions and served as a referral service for other positions within the company. Ms. Turcotte advised the Complainant that he could begin using the services of the EDC starting October 10, 2000. He was shocked at the implication of this news and contacted Mr. Boucher immediately. Mr. Boucher met the Complainant and confirmed that he had been selected for a voluntary departure from his employment. The Complainant would be reassigned to Carrefour Carri\u00e8re for a duration of three months. If at the end of this period the Complainant had not managed to find other employment within Bell, he would have no effective choice but to take early retirement. A special enhanced early retirement package was presented to him, one that would significantly increase the pension from what he would have ordinarily been entitled to, as well as provide him with a lump sum payment equivalent to four months' pay. This news was obviously most upsetting to the Complainant, particularly as it came just after completing the clinical portion of his alcohol dependency treatment.\n[18] Mr. Boucher testified as to the circumstances that led to the Complainant's dismissal from his position at Gateways. In 1996, there were between 550 and 600 Bell employees working within Gateways' Quebec division. The Gateways venture did not prove viable and by 2003, when the division was dismantled entirely, the number had been reduced to about 300. Mr. Boucher's team dropped from about 19 directors and 250 technicians to 11 directors and 125 technicians. Overall, Mr. Boucher estimates conservatively that more than 20,000 employees have left Bell since 1995. The company had determined that it had a surplus of management personnel and initially, it tried to reduce their numbers by offering them voluntary departure packages that included early retirement benefits with substantial bonuses. However, not enough directors opted to accept these offers and as a result, the company determined that some of its management staff would have to be released. Employees who were targeted for release were entitled to receive similar packages, which curiously continued to be referred to as voluntary in the documentation submitted to the departing employees.\n[19] It was in this context that during his summer holidays in July 2000, Mr. Boucher received a call at home from his own supervisor, a Level B director named Pierre Moody. Mr. Moody explained to him that five management positions had to be eliminated within the Quebec region, including two from Mr. Boucher's own team and two more from another team that he was temporarily managing. Mr. Moody and Mr. Boucher testified that they quickly passed through the list of directors and, within a matter of five minutes, had agreed upon the first choice for dismissal \u00e6 the Complainant. They were both of the view that all of the directors, including the Complainant, were outstanding performers, Gateways was after all composed of Bell's elite employees. However, they also concurred that the Complainant was unquestionably the weakest candidate amongst the strong group. Mr. Boucher and Mr. Moody had spoken to each other in the past with respect to the Complainant's failure to supervise his team as tightly as the other directors.\n[20] The two managers were unable to agree, however, on who should be the second director to be released. Mr. Boucher eventually convinced senior management to take into account that another Level D director had been dismissed several months earlier. In addition, Mr. Moody released Mr. Pr\u00e9vost (Level C) and two acting Level D directors were returned to their lower level permanent positions. Consequently, Mr. Moody's target of five employees was met. No one other than the Complainant was let go from Mr. Boucher's own team.\n[21] These departures were scheduled to be announced simultaneously in the second week of August 2000. However, Mr. Boucher informed Mr. Moody that the Complainant was being treated for a serious personal problem and they therefore decided it would not be appropriate to make the announcement to him at that time. He would be informed of the decision upon his return to work. Mr. Moody and Mr. Boucher both expressed regret at the hearing for the sudden manner with which the Complainant was notified of his release. Mr. Boucher had intended to meet the Complainant face to face upon his return to work and inform him of the decision. Unfortunately, Ms. Turcotte, who had been advised in advance of the Complainant's impending referral to Carrefour Carri\u00e8re, chose to call and welcome him to the centre. She was unaware that he had yet to be notified of his release.\n[22] While assigned to Carrefour Carri\u00e8re, the Complainant attended all of the compulsory workshops and training sessions. He acknowledged, however, that he did not consult Carrefour Carri\u00e8re's job referral service more often than perhaps once a week, and may have even skipped a week on occasion. He did not apply for any other position at Bell over the course of the three months that he was assigned to Carrefour Carri\u00e8re. The Complainant testified that he was not qualified for any of the positions posted. Moreover, he was certain that no other manager would hire him since his personal file would have clearly indicated that he was returning from an extended medical leave. In any job interview, he would have been asked to give the reason for his absence, which would have obliged him to reveal his alcohol problem and the fact that he was just coming off of a recovery program. The hiring manager would also likely learn of the medical problem from the candidate's previous manager, who would be consulted before any hiring decision would be made. Under these circumstances, no one at Bell would ever have hired him again.\n[23] The Respondent contends that the Complainant's concerns were unfounded and unjustified. Mr. Boucher testified that when applying for another position within the company, a director is only required to produce his curriculum vitae. The hiring manager could, at the interview stage, ask to view the candidate's prior annual performance assessments. The employee's absenteeism record would only warrant further inquiry in the case of a series of many recurring absences of short duration. A single absence of an extended period would likely be interpreted as being medically related and would not be a consideration in the hiring decision. The DMG never releases any details about an employee's medical file and according to company policy, even if a manager somehow learns of a candidate's medical condition, he or she is forbidden from treating it as a factor in the hiring decision.\n[24] The Complainant claims that the Respondent chose to terminate him even though other staffing options were available. This indicates, he argues, that the principal factor in the decision to dismiss him was his alcohol dependency. The Complainant referred specifically to the case of his fellow Level D Gateways director, Michel Lecompte. At the same time as the employer was looking to eliminate five managerial positions within Gateways' Quebec division, Mr. Lecompte had applied to transfer out of Gateways to another branch of Bell known as Technology and Network (T & N). Mr. Lecompte's transfer was withheld, however, until December 2000. Had it been granted earlier, Mr. Boucher would have met his staff reduction target without dismissing the Complainant. Moreover, Mr. Lecompte's departure left an opening that could have been offered to the Complainant but no such offer was forthcoming.\n[25] The Respondent disagrees with the Complainant's contention. Mr. Boucher noted that Mr. Lecompte managed the most elite team within the Gateways division, known informally as the SWAT team. Its crew was made up of the most knowledgeable and specialized technicians, who dealt with the largest equipment installations. Mr. Lecompte's management of these individuals had to be very tight, calling for direct supervision in all respects. Furthermore, as the head of the SWAT team, Mr. Lecompte was required on a daily basis to deal directly with customers, a responsibility that the other directors did not have. Mr. Lecompte testified that in his opinion, any Level D director could have done his job, but Mr. Boucher disagreed, suggesting that perhaps Mr. Lecompte was simply unaware of his own special talents. Mr. Boucher claims that of the roughly fifteen directors in his team at the time, no more than three were qualified to run the SWAT team. The Complainant was not among them.\n[26] Mr. Lecompte's request for a transfer came in late August or early September, well after the July date when the Respondent alleges the decision to release the Complainant was made. Mr. Boucher felt that Mr. Lecompte was too valuable to the team so the initial request for a transfer was turned down. Around the month of October 2000, a new Level C director, Christiane Fontaine, formally replaced Mr. Boucher. Mr. Lecompte took this opportunity to file a new request for a transfer, and it was approved on December 18, 2000. Mr. Boucher testified that although he was no longer managing this team, he actively assisted Ms. Fontaine during the period of transition. It was therefore he who in effect approved Mr. Lecompte's transfer. Mr. Boucher was also the person who decided to replace Mr. Lecompte with another director from within the team, Ronald Gagnon, one of the few Level D directors whom Mr. Boucher felt was able to lead the SWAT team. Mr. Boucher testified that there was no question of recalling the Complainant to take over Mr. Lecompte's position - the Complainant was simply not qualified.\n[27] In the fall of 2000, Bell issued a new directive for 2001, mandating a reduction of five more managerial positions within Mr. Moody's section. For this reason, the official elimination of Mr. Gagnon's old position, which was based in Quebec City, was postponed until January 2001 so as to be tallied amongst those job reductions. This meant that there remained no vacancy within the division into which the Complainant could be reassigned. In accordance with the directive, four more Level D directors from Mr. Boucher's section were let go in 2001. He describes these individuals as experienced and outstanding managers. None of them were replaced after their forced departures.\n[28] The Complainant's assignment to Carrefour Carri\u00e8re came to an end on January 2, 2001. Since he had not obtained another position within Bell by then, his only option was to accept the enhanced retirement package. Between January and May 2001, he provided some services to Bell as a private contractor. In November 2001, the Casino de Montr\u00e9al hired him as a slot machine attendant. He remains employed by the Casino but only on a casual basis. His twelve-hour shifts are longer than when he was employed at Bell, and he often works overnight and weekends. According to the Complainant, Casino employees have few opportunities for advancement.\nII. LEGAL FRAMEWORK [29] It is a discriminatory practice, under s. 7 of the Act, to dismiss an employee on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination. Addiction to alcohol is considered a disability, which is a prohibited ground (see Crouse v. Canadian Steamship Lines Inc., [2001] C.H.R.D. No.12 at para. 56 (C.H.R.T.) (QL).\n[30] As the Supreme Court of Canada stated in Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at para. 28, the burden of proof is on a complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case in this context is one that covers the allegations made and which, if the allegations are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour, in the absence of an answer from the respondent. Once the prima facie case is established, the onus then shifts to the respondent to provide a reasonable explanation for the otherwise discriminatory behaviour. If a reasonable explanation is given, it is up to the complainant to demonstrate that the explanation is merely a pretext for discrimination (see Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (No. 1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 at para. 38474 (C.H.R.T.); Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204 at paras. 17-23).\n[31] The Federal Court of Appeal noted, in Holden v. Canadian National Railway Company (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 at para. 7, that discriminatory considerations need not be the sole reason for the actions at issue in order for the complaint to be substantiated. It is sufficient that the discrimination be one of the factors in the employer's decision.\nIII. ANALYSIS A. Prima facie case [32] The Complainant has established, as alleged in his complaint, that he was told he would be removed from his position while still being treated for his alcohol dependency. Bell possessed information about the Complainant's alcohol-related problems going back to 1990, when he entered his first alcohol dependency treatment program. The Complainant was the only person from Mr. Boucher's team dismissed during the summer of 2000 round of job cutbacks. The dismissal came within weeks of the Complainant's open admission to Mr. Boucher of his alcoholism. Mr. Lecompte testified that he asked to be transferred out of Gateways but was turned down just a few days before the Complainant was informed of the dismissal. The Complainant contends that Bell could have chosen to accept Mr. Lecompte's request and cancel the plan to dismiss the Complainant. The decision to do otherwise, argues the Complainant, demonstrates that Bell's motives for its actions were not really to reduce staff, but rather to release the Complainant due, at least in part, to his alcohol problem.\n[33] I am satisfied that these allegations, if believed, would be complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the Complainant's favour, in the absence of an answer from the Respondent. A prima facie case has been established.\nB. Respondent's Explanation [34] The Respondent contends that the Complainant was dismissed in the course of widespread job cutbacks throughout Bell. He was selected from amongst his colleagues because of certain deficiencies regarding his performance when compared to the others. Both Mr. Boucher and Mr. Moody testified that the decision to dismiss the Complainant was theirs alone and that the matter of his alcoholism was not a factor at all in their decision. I found these individuals credible and forthright, and for the reasons set out below, I have determined their explanation to be reasonable. This is not to say that the Complainant's evidence was false or misleading. To the contrary, I found him sincere and refreshingly candid. But simply put, the facts, as they were revealed in the hearing, served to substantiate the Respondent's explanation.\n[35] The evidence is undisputed that Bell, in its attempt to deal with ever-increasing competition, has over the years significantly reduced the number of its employees. These cutbacks have extended to the managerial level. The Complainant was not alone in being targeted by this strategy of forced departures. A Level C director was also dismissed at the same time as him, and two acting Level D directors were returned to their lower level duties. More revealing is what transpired in the following months and years: five additonal Gateways managerial positions were eliminated in 2001 and another five or six in 2002. In 2003, even Mr. Moody was affected by the employer's strategy. He was released from his Level B position and sent to Carrefour Carri\u00e8re. It is clear that the Complainant was not alone in being terminated. He was one of many persons affected by widespread changes within the company.\n[36] In any event, I accept the evidence of Mr. Boucher and Mr. Moody that they had no knowledge about the Complainant's alcohol dependence problem in advance of their decision to terminate him, which was made weeks before the Complainant called upon Mr. Boucher's assistance to get to a treatment centre. The Complainant himself testified that he explained to Mr. Boucher the nature and extent of his alcoholism during his phone call of August 9, 2000, and their subsequent drive in Mr. Boucher's car. If Mr. Boucher knew of the problem, why was the explanation necessary?\n[37] The Complainant referred back to the incident involving his colleague who refused to work with him during the strike on account of the scent of alcohol emanating from him. The Complainant argues that Mr. Boucher knew, or should have known, of the Complainant's problem at this point. Mr. Boucher, however, received independent information from Bell's security service that the Complainant was not drinking abusively. In fact, the Complainant made the same affirmation directly to Mr. Boucher during the performance assessment interview, and he testified that he was successfully hiding his dependency from everyone at work and even from his family at home. The evidence is that the Gateways directors worked independently and only met periodically. There was little opportunity for Mr. Boucher to personally draw any other conclusion than that the Complainant was in fine health.\n[38] It may well be that as a corporation, Bell had knowledge about the Complainant's prior alcohol dependency treatment, which took place in 1990. However, aside from the fact that the company's Disability Management Group held this information in confidence and would not have revealed it to other Bell employees, almost a decade had passed and the Complainant had not made another formal request for additional assistance. Furthermore, by his own account the Complainant convinced Mr. Moon, during their meeting in 1997, that he did not have a drinking problem. The Complainant also acknowledged that he did not speak to his director, Mr. Pr\u00e9vost, about his alcoholism either. In sum, there is no evidence to demonstrate that either Mr. Boucher or Mr. Moody had any way of knowing about the Complainant's alcoholism.\n[39] The Complainant produced a document at the hearing that appears to emanate from Bell, which the Commission communicated to the Complainant as part of its disclosure. No one at the hearing could definitively explain the origins of the document. The document was entitled Log sheet. Directors ordinarily wrote down their working notes with respect to their staff's performance on log sheets. The document in question refers to the rumours of alcohol abuse that led to the Complainant's meeting with Mr. Moon. It also refers to some of the deficiencies in his work performance. Mr. Boucher acknowledged that he used to prepare log sheets with respect to his directors, but denies having been involved in the preparation of the document produced by the Complainant at the hearing. Indeed, the document appears to be a compilation of numerous log sheets, dating back to early 1998, at least a year before Mr. Boucher became the Complainant's supervising director. Mr. Boucher claims he never saw the document before the hearing and maintains that he had no knowledge of any alcohol-related incident in the past, involving the Complainant. Having examined the document closely and considered all of the evidence presented at the hearing, I am persuaded that Mr. Boucher did not prepare the document. The format and syntax of the text suggests that it was written by a third party who compiled the information from numerous log sheets. This document cannot, therefore, be relied upon to advance the notion that Mr. Boucher was aware of the Complainant's alcoholism prior to the July 2000 decision to dismiss him.\n[40] The Complainant contends that over the years, sufficient indicia of his disability came before the Respondent, which should have prompted it to intervene more actively in his case. He claims that had Bell referred him to treatment at an earlier stage, both his health and his work performance would not have deteriorated to the same extent. An improved work record would have in turn meant that he would not have been the first person selected for release in the summer of 2000.\n[41] This raises a related point. Mr. Boucher and Mr. Moody claim that they selected the Complainant for dismissal based on his weaker performance record, when compared with the other managerial employees. The Complainant appears to suggest in his submissions that the deficiencies in his performance were linked to his disability, alcoholism. In such circumstances, choosing to terminate an employee because of his poor performance may in fact be discriminatory. In effect, the disability becomes a factor in the decision to dismiss (see eg. Desormeaux v. Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission 2003 CHRT 2 at para. 72; Parisien v. Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission 2003 CHRT 10 at para. 46).\n[42] However, in the present case, the Complainant, by his own admission, deliberately and successfully misled his supervising directors into sincerely believing that he was not an alcoholic. Although an employer has a duty to inform itself about an employee's disability and how the person can be accommodated, it seems only logical and fair that this duty should not be extended to situations where the employer does not in good faith have any knowledge whatsoever of the employee's disability.\n[43] This is certainly the case before me. The Complainant performed an excellent job of negating the indicia that he claims were placed before his employer. His ability to conceal his secret was aided by the fact that the Complainant only occasionally met Mr. Boucher, thereby restricting the latter's opportunities to view any outward symptoms of the disability.\n[44] The Complainant, in asserting that the Respondent should have compelled him to seek treatment years before he was dismissed, seems to be implying that the Respondent failed in its duty to accommodate him and his disability. It may well be, as the Complainant claimed in his testimony, that his denial of the existence of a problem was a symptom of the disease, and that he should not be faulted for this. However, there must be a limit to this principle. The employer had put in place a mechanism to accommodate the Complainant's disability, which was quite effective as evidenced by the fact that the Complainant called upon the service twice during his career at Bell. But the accommodation remained contingent on one basic component - the employee's responsibility to take matters into his own hands and ask for help. As was pointed out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970, the search for accommodation is a multi-party inquiry, that commands an active participation on the part of the complainant. In the present case, the Complainant did not make any such effort prior to his telephone call to Mr. Boucher on August 9, 2000. To the contrary, he deliberately misled the employer regarding his health. I am not, therefore, persuaded by this submission.\n[45] The Complainant put forth the evidence of Mr. Lecompte's transfer to T & N to demonstrate that the Respondent's explanation was pretextual. If Bell's intention in dismissing the Complainant was merely to reduce by one the number of management employees within Mr. Boucher's team, this goal could have been achieved by granting Mr. Lecompte's first request to transfer out of Gateways. However, as I have already indicated, I accept the evidence of Mr. Boucher and Mr. Moody that their decision to dismiss the Complainant was made in July, a month or more prior to Mr. Lecompte's transfer request. It was entirely within their prerogatives, as senior managers, to deny Mr. Lecompte his transfer. I see no reason to impugn this decision in the context of this human rights inquiry. As for the Complainant's assertion that he should have been assigned to replace Mr. Lecompte, I find the Respondent's reply persuasive \u00e6 the Complainant was not qualified to replace Mr. Lecompte. It is not in dispute that Mr. Lecompte headed the most elite of Gateways' teams. On the other hand, weaknesses had been identified with respect to the tightness of the Complainant's management style. It was reasonable for the Respondent to not have considered the Complainant as an appropriate replacement for Mr. Lecompte.\n[46] For all of the above reasons, I am not convinced that the Complainant's alcoholism was a factor in the decision to terminate his employment and I find the explanation provided by the Respondent reasonable. I have not been persuaded that the explanation was pretextual.\n[47] The complaint is therefore dismissed.\nsigned by\nAthanasios D.

CONCLUSION\n[1] The Tribunal has before it several preliminary issues raised by the parties regarding a complaint filed on September 23, 2002 by Johanne Guay (the Complainant) with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) in which she alleged that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (the Respondent) discriminated against her contrary to sections 7 and 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (the Act).\n[2] In their motions, the Complainant and the Commission seek an amendment to the complaint form to add allegations of retaliation contrary to section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 and an order amending the complaint to add three new respondents.\n[3] The Respondent requests that the style of cause be changed to show the Attorney General of Canada as the respondent instead of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. It also seeks an order serving several physicians and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Health Services with a subpoena duces tecum, ordering them to disclose the Complainant's medical records, clinical study notes, consultation reports, test results and laboratory examination results between January 1, 2000 and the present. Alternatively, it seeks an order requiring the Complainant to agree to this disclosure. It also seeks an order requiring the Complainant to disclose the names of all health professionals that treated her between January 1, 2000 and the present and that they be served with a subpoena duces tecum.\n[4] The Respondent also seeks an order requiring the Complainant to disclose the notes she took during her conversations with Inspector Marc Proulx and all other relevant notes she may have in her possession.\n[5] Finally, it seeks an order extending the communication time set out in Rule 6(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Interim Rules of Procedure to 30 days following receipt of the health information sought.\nI. PRELIMINARY ISSUES RAISED BY THE COMPLAINANT AND THE COMMISSION A. First issue: amendments to the complaint form to add allegations of retaliation contrary to section 14.1 of the Act [6] The Complainant and the Commission made a motion pursuant to Rule 3(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Interim Rules of Procedure. The purpose of the motion is to amend the complaint to add the ground of retaliation set out in section 14.1 of the Act. They allege that, subsequent to the filing of the complaint signed by the Complainant on September 23, 2002, the Respondent, by the actions of its employees, took retaliatory action against the Complainant.\n[7] In Schnell v. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc. and Micka, rendered on April 25, 2001, the Tribunal set out in paragraph 12 the test to apply in such a case:\nWith respect to the Commission's application to amend the complaint, the test as enunciated by this Tribunal is whether the nature of the allegations of retaliation are linked, at least by the complainant, to the allegations giving rise to the original complaint. The fact that the proposed amendment involves a different section of the Act in issue in the original complaint does not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction to allow such an amendment. There is a discretion in the Tribunal to amend the complaint to deal with additional allegations, provided that sufficient notice is given to the respondents to enable them to properly defend themselves.\n[8] In its written submissions, the Respondent did not object to the amendments requested by the Complainant and the Commission, provided that it receives sufficient notice enabling it to reply to the new allegations.\n[9] Since the hearing in this case has been postponed to March 8, 2005, there is no question that the Respondent has enough time to reply to the new allegations.\n[10] Therefore, the Tribunal grants the Complainant's and the Commission's motion. It also gives the Respondent 21 days from the date of the present decision to submit a written response to these new allegations, if it so desires.\n[11] The complaint is hereby amended to include the allegation of retaliation in accordance with section 14.1 of the Act.\nB. Second issue: order amending the complaint to add three new respondents. [12] The Commission and the Complainant seek an order adding Messrs. Marc Proulx, Normand Goulet and Denis Fortin as respondents. The Complainant and the Commission allege that these individuals are responsible for the harassment that the Complainant claims she was subjected to and that they committed retaliatory action against the Complainant after the complaint was filed with the Commission.\n[13] In support of its motion, the Commission maintains that Marc Proulx and Normand Goulet were referred to in the complaint, and they were questioned by the Commission's investigator. It adds that the addition of these new parties, with respect to the retaliation, was not reasonably foreseeable at the time the complaint was filed but that it has now become necessary to dispose of this aspect of the complaint.\n[14] According to the Commission, if the Respondent, as the employer of these individuals, is indeed responsible for the discriminatory acts that they may have committed in the course of their employment under section 65 of the Act, the fact still remains that they are discrete persons.\n[15] The Respondent argues that the addition of the three members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is unnecessary and will only complicate the proceeding and unnecessarily prolong the hearing.\n[16] In Desormeaux v. Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission, T701\/0602, October 2, 2002, vol. 1, p. 46, the Tribunal pointed out that paragraph 48.9(2)(b) of the Act specifically contemplates the addition of parties to the proceedings before the Tribunal. Subsection 48.9(2) also provides for the Tribunal to make rules of procedure governing the procedure before it.\n[17] Two of the Tribunal's relatively recent decisions deal directly with this issue: Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone, Section Locale 5044 du SCFP v. Telus Communication (Qu\u00e9bec) Inc., 2003 CHRT 31 (hereafter Telus) and Brown v. National Capital Commission, 2003 CHRT 43 (hereafter Brown).\n[18] In Telus, the Tribunal indicated that, although the Act gives the Tribunal the power to add parties to a proceeding when the Tribunal deems it appropriate, the legislative context surrounding this discretionary power argues for a measure of restraint or caution. The Tribunal pointed out that the Act provides for, in dealing with complaints of discrimination, a carefully developed process of investigation and inquiry in which both the Commission and the Tribunal have clearly defined roles. The addition of parties during a proceeding before the Tribunal deprives the new respondent of the benefit of certain means of defence it can normally have access to at the stage of the screening of a complaint by the Commission, notably the possibility of having the complaint dismissed without the need for an inquiry.\n[19] The Tribunal found, at paragraph 30, that the forced addition of a new respondent once the Tribunal has been charged with inquiring into a complaint is appropriate...if it is established that the presence of this new party is necessary to dispose of the complaint before the Tribunal and that it was not reasonably foreseeable, once the complaint was filed with the Commission, that the addition of a new respondent would be necessary to dispose of the complaint [translation]. In Telus, the Tribunal refused the addition of the third party, namely the Syndicat des Agents de Ma\u00eetrise de Qu\u00e9bec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone (the SAQT). The Tribunal believed that the impleading of the SAQT would be prejudicial to it from a procedural fairness standpoint.\n[20] In Brown, the Tribunal indicated that it can add a party when such a measure is necessary to decide all of the matters in dispute or provide a complete and effective solution of the matter before it. The member added another factor, which in his view is more significant than the question of foreseeability. He stated that the purpose of the Act is to remedy discrimination and that the Tribunal's power to add parties must be subordinated to that purpose. Human rights proceedings have a constitutional component that is often missing in civil proceedings. Since the litigation before the Tribunal is public interest litigation, the rules regarding the addition of parties must reflect the mandate of the Tribunal, which is to provide an effective remedy for discrimination. In Brown, the addition of a new party was requested not because the party was considered directly liable for the discrimination, but rather because it was considered essential for a more appropriate enforcement of the decision against the original respondent.\n[21] The original party in Brown was the National Capital Commission (the NCC). It became evident during the hearing that the solution to the problem that the Tribunal had to resolve would probably be found in an adjacent building belonging to the Department of Public Works. Although Public Works and the NCC are separate in law, they are both creatures of the Federal Crown. The addition of Public Works was permitted because it would allow for a more appropriate enforcement of the decision.\n[22] In the present case, the three new respondents that the Commission and the Complainant wish added are employees of the Respondent. In this regard, section 65 of the Act states the following:\n65. (1) Sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (2), les actes ou omissions commis par un employ\u00e9, un mandataire, un administrateur ou un dirigeant dans le cadre de son emploi sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s, pour l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par la personne, l'organisme ou l'association qui l'emploie.\n(2) La personne, l'organisme ou l'association vis\u00e9 au paragraphe (1) peut se soustraire \u00e0 son application s'il \u00e9tablit que l'acte ou l'omission a eu lieu sans son consentenent, qu'il avait pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour l'emp\u00eacher et que, par la suite, il a tent\u00e9 d'en att\u00e9nuer ou d'en annuler les effets.\n65. (1) Subject to subsection (2), any act or omission committed by an officer, a director, an employee or an agent of any person, association or organization in the course of the employment of the officer, director, employee or agent shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be an act or omission committed by that person, association or organization.\n(2) An act or omission shall not, by virtue of subsection (1), be deemed to be an act or omission committed by a person, association or organization if it is established that the person, association or organization did not consent to the commission of the act or omission and exercised all due diligence to prevent the act or omission from being committed and, subsequently, tomitigate or avoid the effect thereof.\n[23] In its written arguments, the Commission states that these employees are persons separate from the Respondent. It added that, according to section 4 of the Act, anyone found guilty of discriminatory practices may be subject to specific orders.\n[24] The Complainant is not seeking any particular remedy from these plaintiffs. The Respondent did not raise a defence for them based on subsection 65(2). Obviously, if the Respondent had raised such a defence, my decision on the addition of the parties could have been different.\n[25] Their discriminatory acts are one and the same as those alleged against the Respondent, and no evidence was submitted demonstrating that these acts were committed outside their employment. Thus, if it is established that the acts or omissions of its employees are discriminatory because they were committed in the course of their employment, they will be deemed, for the purposes of the Act, to have been committed by the Respondent.\n[26] Moreover, the Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that the Commission and the Complainant could reasonably have foreseen, at the time of filing the complaint and during the investigation, the addition of these parties. At the time, they chose not to add them. Adding them now, with no formal complaint having been brought against them, deprives them of the opportunity to present certain grounds of defence before the Commission pursuant to sections 41 and 44 of the Act.\n[27] The Tribunal is not satisfied that the addition of these respondents is necessary for the disposal of the complaint and, contrary to the decision in Brown, their presence is not essential for a more appropriate enforcement of the decision that would be made against the Respondent.\n[28] The request from the Commission and the Complainant for adding three new parties is denied.\nII. PRELIMINARY ISSUES RAISED BY THE RESPONDENT A. First issue: amendment to the style of cause [29] The Respondent brought a motion to amend the style of cause so that the Attorney General of Canada is designated as the respondent The current style of cause identifies the Royal Canadian Mounted Police as the respondent. The Respondent claims that only the Attorney General of Canada may appear in judicial proceedings to reply to acts committed by members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n[30] It adds that the capacity to sue and be sued is reserved solely for natural persons and corporations. Since the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. R-10 does not give the Royal Canadian Mounted Police a distinct legal personality, it therefore does not have the capacity to sue and be sued. It adds that the RCMP is not a person and thus cannot not be a party to a complaint under the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[31] Section 3 of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act stipulates that:\n3. Est maintenue pour le Canada une force de police compos\u00e9e d'officiers et autres membres et appel\u00e9e Gendarmerie royale du Canada. 3. There shall continue to be a police force for Canada, which shall consist of officers and other members and be known as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n[32] The Commission does not object to this motion. The Complainant maintains that the Attorney General of Canada is not her employer and that the amendment should not be granted.\n[33] In Plante v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2003 CHRT 28, the Tribunal had before it a motion very similar to the present one. In granting the Respondent's motion in that case, the Tribunal indicated that a review of the jurisprudence cited by the respondent, as well as the relevant provisions of the Crown Liability Act, discloses that the respondent is correct, and that the complainant's case should properly be brought against the Attorney General of Canada (representing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police).\n[34] I can understand how the Respondent's request may appear to the Complainant, but I believe that the Respondent's motion deals solely with the legal formalities of disputes to which the federal government is a party and that the Complainant will not suffer any prejudice as a result. Changing the style of cause will not impair the Complainant's capacity to present her arguments or the remedy that would be awarded to her if her complaint is sustained.\n[35] I therefore order that the respondent name be replaced with the Attorney General of Canada (representing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police).\nB. Second issue: medical records [36] On September 23, 2002, the Complainant filed a complaint with the Commission alleging that she was discriminated against by the Respondent on the basis of her disability. She alleged, among other things, that the Respondent refused to accommodate her medical condition and that she was harassed because of her disability. In her disclosure, the Complainant maintained that her supervisors required her to work days or shifts that did not take her physician's recommendations into account and that they refused to transfer her to a position more suited to her medical condition.\n[37] Her disclosure of documents reveals that, in addition to her attending physician, Dr. Mireille Belzile, she also consulted Drs. John Gosselin, Bruno Laplante and Jocelyn Aubut. In the Statement of Issues of Fact and Law, the remedies sought by the Complainant include a request for financial compensation in the amount of $20,000 for physical injuries and pain and suffering. She maintains that the Respondent's acts cause undue stress [translation] and cause insomnia, exhaustion, migraines and digestive problems [translation] to her.\n[38] According to the Respondent, as soon as a party brings his\/her medical condition into a dispute, he\/she implicitly waives his\/her right to confidentiality otherwise protecting his\/her medical record and that, since this record contains information that is potentially relevant to the facts in dispute, it must be disclosed. The Respondent adds that the extent of the disability is at issue, likewise the existence and extent of the psychological and physiological signs of stress that the Complainant claims to be suffering. It thereby concludes that the information pertaining to the Complainant's medical condition is relevant.\n[39] The Commission and the Complainant allege that the disclosure of the Complainant's medical records is not necessary because the Respondent has been aware of her medical condition for several years.\n[40] The Act and the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Interim Rules of Procedure codifies the rule of natural justice granting each party the right to a full and complete hearing. This right also includes the right to the disclosure of relevant evidence in the possession or care of the opposing party. However, in a motion such as the one before us, the Tribunal must weigh the competing interests: the interests of natural justice on one hand and the individual's right to privacy and confidentiality on the other.\n[41] In its amended Notice of Motion, the Respondent seeks an order for serving the Complainant's attending physicians with a subpoena duces tecum. The purpose of the duces tecum portion of the subpoena is to order third parties, who are not litigants, to produce documents that they have in their possession.\n[42] Other relevant principles must also be considered before I can render my decision. First, there has to be a rational connection between the documents requested and the issues in this motion. In other words, the information sought must be arguably relevant.\n[43] The request must not be speculative or amount to a fishing expedition. The description of the documents should not be too broad or general and should be identified with reasonable particularity. Finally, the request should not be oppressive, that is, should not subject a stranger to the litigation to an onerous and far-ranging search for the documents. (See CTEA v. Bell Canada, T503\/2098, Ruling No. 2.)\n[44] In Day v. Department of National Defence and Hortie, Ruling No. 3, 2002\/12\/06, the Tribunal used a three-step approach to determine whether documents should be disclosed or not:\nThe Tribunal should determine whether the information is likely to be relevant, which is not a particularly high standard. There must be some relevance, and the party seeking production of the information or documents must demonstrate a nexus between the information or documents sought and the issues in dispute. The material must be probative and arguably relevant to an issue in the hearing. This is meant to prevent production for purposes which are speculative, fanciful, disruptive, unmeritorious, obstructive and time-consuming. The Tribunal must then consider any other issues that may have a bearing on disclosure, without examining the documents. If there is no compelling reason to maintain the privacy of the documents, they should be released. If the Tribunal is unable to resolve the matter without examining the material, it should inspect the documents. In the final step of this process, it may be helpful for the party requiring the documents to be protected to draw the Tribunal's attention to passages or individual documents that raise concerns.\n[45] I find in the present case that the requested documents are likely to be relevant and that they could be relevant to an issue in the hearing. The Respondent has established that there is a connection between the requested documents and the issues in dispute, particularly regarding the remedies sought. In human rights proceedings, when a complainant seeks compensation for physical injuries and for pain and suffering, he\/she implicitly agrees to allow a respondent to have access to medical records or, in general, personal health information. The right to confidentiality of medical records no longer exists. In the present case, the Complainant is seeking financial compensation for physical injuries and pain and suffering. The right to confidentiality is therefore overridden by the Respondent's right to know the grounds and scope of the complaint against it. In human rights proceedings, justice requires that a respondent be permitted to present a complete defence to a Complainant's arguments. If a complainant bases the case on his\/her medical condition, a respondent is entitled to relevant health information that may be pertinent to the claim.\n[46] The Complainant and the Commission have not raised any arguments likely to have a bearing on my decision to order the disclosure of the documents sought.\n[47] In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal shall issue subpoenae duces tecum to Drs. Mireille Belzile, John Gosselin, Bruno Laplante, Jocelyn Aubut and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Health Services, ordering them to disclose to the Respondent's lawyers the Complainant's medical files, clinical study notes, consultation reports, test results and\/or laboratory examination results between January 1, 2000 and the present.\n[48] To protect the Complainant's right to confidentiality, it is also agreed that the Respondent's lawyers themselves shall consult these documents and shall not disclose their contents to any other individuals without prior permission from the Tribunal and without notifying the Complainant. It is also agreed that the disclosure of these documents does not mean that they are submitted as evidence and any issues in this regard shall be dealt with during the hearing. In addition, if the Complainant wishes to raise any issues regarding the confidentiality of certain information that may be contained in these documents but does not concern the present case, she is asked to inform the Tribunal as soon as possible. In such a case, upon notice to the parties, the Tribunal shall review the records to determine which information should be disclosed because of its relevance to the issues in the present dispute and which information should not be disclosed.\n[49] As to the Respondent's request for an extension of the communication time set out in Rule 6(1) of the Interim Rules of Procedure, the Tribunal sees no reason to grant this request and orders the Respondent to proceed with this, if not already done, within seven days following this decision. If, after the medical records are filed, the Respondent must make changes to its communication, it may at that time bring a motion before the Tribunal.\nC. Third issue: production of notes taken by the Complainant during conversations with Inspector Marc Proulx [50] In her disclosure, the Complainant appears to refer to personal notes she took during her conversations with Inspector Marc Proulx. In her reply to the present motion, she adds that these notes consist almost entirely of the information in the allegations of retaliation mentioned earlier.\n[51] Paragraph 6(1)(d) of the Interim Rules of Procedure requires that the parties disclose all documents in their possession for which they are not claiming any privilege and which are relevant to issues in the case. In the present case, no privilege was claimed for the notes in question.\n[52] I therefore order the Complainant to disclose to the Respondent the notes taken during her conversations with Inspector Marc Proulx and which she referred to in her disclosure.\n[53] My ordering the disclosure of these documents does not mean that they are admissible in evidence. This issue shall be dealt with at the hearing.\nIII. CONCLUSION [54] The Tribunal grants the Complainant's and the Commission's motion and orders that the complaint be amended to include the allegation of retaliation in accordance with section 14.1 of the Act.\n[55] The Tribunal gives the Respondent 21 days from the date of the present decision to submit a written response to these new allegations.\n[56] The Commission's and the Complainant's request for the addition of three new parties is denied.\n[57] The motion for the Respondent name to be replaced with the Attorney General of Canada (representing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) is granted.\n[58] The Tribunal agrees to issue subpoenae duces tecum to Drs. Mireille Belzile, John Gosselin, Bruno Laplante, Jocelyn Aubut and to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Health Services, ordering them to disclose to the Respondent's lawyers the Complainant's medical records, clinical study notes, consultation reports, test results and\/or laboratory examination results between January 1, 2000 and the present.\n[59] The Tribunal orders the Complainant to disclose to the Respondent the notes taken during her conversations with Inspector Marc Proulx.\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario November 18, 2004\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: T914\/3404\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Johanne Guay v.

RULING\n[1] The Commission has advised the Tribunal that it wishes to tender an expert's report. The Respondent has raised a number of objections to the report. I have received oral and written submissions from both sides.\nI. DELAY [2] The first objection relates to the tardiness of the report. The Complainant and the Commission were originally given until May 17th to provide its disclosure in the present case. This included any expert reports. The hearing was scheduled for September 13th. The period for disclosure was extended to June 4th, at the request of the Complainant. It was then extended to June 28th.\n[3] There was no expert's report. On September 3rd, the parties requested a conference call. The call was held on September 8th. The Commission applied for an adjournment of the hearing. I refused the request.\n[4] There was another frantic conference call on September 10th, the day on which the report was finally disclosed. The Respondent was naturally upset at the late disclosure of the report. All of the parties requested for an adjournment of the hearing. Since I was advised by counsel that the expert's report was central to the case, I agreed to adjourn the first week of the hearing until September 20th. This would allow the parties to deal with the expert's report at a subsequent sitting.\n[5] The Respondent has submitted that the late delivery of the report was tantamount to trial by ambush. It was impossible for the Respondent to review and respond to the report within the time set for the original hearing. The resulting delay has resulted in inconvenience and presumably some additional expense for the Respondent.\n[6] Although I sympathize with the Respondent's position, the Respondent has now had the Commission's report for some time. The adjournment of the hearing is sufficient in my judgement for it to respond to the expert's report. The Complainant and Commission have a right to a full inquiry and a proper airing of the complaint, and should not be deprived of their opportunity to present the case for hearing.\n[7] I agree with the Respondent that the Commission's conduct should be censured. There is to be no trial by ambush. I think there are other ways of dealing with the unfairness in the delivery of the report however. There may be a question of costs. It may also be possible to place limits on the Complainant's recovery, or deduct a set-off from the award. This was the course of action followed by the member in Charlton v. International Longshoremen's Association, Local 269 2004 CHRT 12.\n[8] The Respondent is free to raise the issue at the close of the case.\nII. WHETHER DR. WORTLEY CAN TESTIFY [9] The Respondent also objects to the Commission's decision to call Dr. Wortley as an expert. This requires explanation.\n[10] The Commission has advised me that the Respondent agreed, in settling another matter, to let the Commission investigate the racial aspects of the Respondent's inspection policies. This apparently requires information regarding hit rates, a reference to the number of times that members of an identifiable group are subjected to inquiry. The Commission says that this data was never provided. As a result, the Commission is unable to determine whether a systemic complaint should be filed against the Respondent. It is accordingly seeking an order from the Tribunal, in the immediate case, that the information be provided. This is one of the remedies that it has requested.\n[11] Mr. Underhill's submission in this regard deserves to be quoted in full:\nThe Commission concedes that this Tribunal could inquire into this complaint without reference to the Wortley Report and the phenomenon of racial profiling. However, such an approach would undermine the object and purpose of the Tribunal and its enabling legislation. The Commission is participating in this case because it is concerned that Mr. Orughu's experiences with the Respondent appear to be consistent with racial profiling (as that term is understood in the social science literature), and that there is preliminary evidence to suggest that Mr. Orughu's complaint may be but one example of a wider problem within the Canada Border Services Agency (the Agency). The Commission is not in a position to bring a systemic racial profiling complaint before this Tribunal and is therefore asking that the Tribunal inquire into Mr. Orughu's complaint as a single example of racial profiling, and pursuant to its fundamental statutory object of removing discriminatory practices, order a wider investigation into the matter.\nThere are a number of legal issues that arise out of these submissions. I cannot deal with these issues without full submissions from all of the parties.\n[12] At this stage, I think it is enough to focus on the evidence. Dr. Wortley is being tendered as a witness who can testify with respect to the larger problem of racial profiling within the Agency. This evidence is relevant to the complaint of Mr. Orughu, which may gain credence from the fact that the policies within Customs are in some sense prejudicial. The law of human rights recognizes that the context in which a complaint occurs is relevant to an inquiry. This generally includes some evidence of the general policies and practices of a Respondent.\n[13] The law also establishes that evidence with respect to systemic issues may be used to bolster the evidence of a personal complaint. In Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare) (re Chopra), [1998] F.C.J. No. 432 (QL), at para. 22, for example, the Federal Court ruled that the Tribunal had erred in not allowing the applicants to lead general evidence of a systemic problem as circumstantial evidence to infer that discrimination probably occurred in this particular case as well. The court in Chopra was dealing with statistical evidence, which requires the intervention of an expert.\n[14] I also agree that the Commission is entitled to ask the Tribunal to enquire into the broader allegation that Mr. Orughu's treatment raises concerns that there may be larger problems at the Agency. I agree with the Commission that an inquiry calls for some degree of exploration and is significantly broader than the trial process. It is also significant that the Tribunal is obliged, under section 50(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, to give all of the parties full and ample opportunity to present evidence. The Respondent will have ample opportunity to address any legal issues that arise in the context of the remedy that the Commission is seeking at the close of the case.\n[15] I think it is fair to characterize this aspect of the hearing as an inevitable and necessary adjunct of the inquiry into Mr. Orughu's complaint, which raises larger issues for the Commission. This is a matter of degree. The Commission has acknowledged that there is no systemic complaint before the Tribunal. The policies and practices of the Agency are not directly before the Tribunal. They have nevertheless been called into question by Mr. Orughu. I think it is probably impossible to divide these two aspects of the complaint in any definitive way. It is more a matter of keeping the evidence within its proper bounds.\n[16] The only legal question at this stage of the process is whether the testimony of the expert is relevant and necessary, if the Commission is to present the complaint for hearing. I think it is. The law of human rights has long recognized that the analysis provided by standard research methods may be indispensable, in determining whether the effect of a Respondent's policies is discriminatory. If Dr. Wortley is of the view that the Commission is not in possession of the information that it needs, to determine what the practices of the Respondent may be, that is in itself a legitimate piece of opinion evidence.\n[17] The matter goes beyond this, however, since Dr. Wortley is also being called as a witness on the facts. I say this because the Commission has submitted that he is familiar with the practices of the Agency and can speak about the protocols that are commonly used at inspection points. I realize that the Respondent disputes this. That can be dealt with when he is qualified however and cannot be decided at this point.\n[18] Even if Dr. Wortley cannot comment on the protocols employed by the Respondent, he appears to have some knowledge of international standards in the area and the practices that have been followed in other jurisdictions. This has apparently been the subject of comment in the social science literature. There also appears to be a body of research into what has been described as racial profiling. It is evident that this is a loaded term, with many pejorative associations, which should be used cautiously. The research in the area may nevertheless be of assistance in determining whether Mr. Orughu was discriminated against.\n[19] There are a number of points that could be made. At its simplest, however, the Commission is calling Dr. Wortley as an expert who can testify as to the use of racial identifiers, in customs or elsewhere. This goes to the substance of the complaint, which is that Mr. Orughu was treated differently at the border because of his race. As long as Dr. Wortley is properly qualified, I do not see why he should not testify.\nIII. THE SUBSTANCE OF THE REPORT [20] I nevertheless agree with many of the Respondent's criticisms of the report. These can be dealt with under a variety of headings.\nA. Necessity [21] The first is necessity. The Respondent relied on R. v. Beland, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 24, at p. 42, which follows Davie v. Magistrate of Edinburgh [1953] S.C. 34, at p. 40, where Lord Cooper said that expert evidence should not be allowed if the question falls within the knowledge and experience of the triers of fact. It is the Tribunal that must make the findings in the case and rule on legal issues. It would be a mistake for the Tribunal to receive instruction on the discharge of its duties in a particular case.\n[22] Dr. Wortley's report does not respect this fundamental principle. It contains a theory of the case and even comments on the legal strategy of the Respondent. This goes well beyond the role of an expert witness. An expert is not in the business of investigating and determining the facts of the case. If an expert's opinion is based on certain factual assumptions, those assumptions should be clearly laid out, in a neutral fashion, as assumptions.\n[23] Some of the reluctance to accept expert evidence comes from the fact that the weight of such evidence is easily overstated. Dr. Wortley suggests, for example, that Mr. Orughu's experiences are consistent with certain hypotheses in the social science literature. This may or may not be significant. The reality however is that a number of the observations made by Dr. Wortley simply clothe our common observations of life in the language of the social sciences, thereby giving them an air of scientific credibility that overstates their significance.\nB. Credibility [24] There is a more specific concern. The Respondent submits that the report comments on the credibility of the Complainant. Mr. Burnet referred me to R. v. Marquard [1993] 4 S.C.R. 223, at 248, which holds that a judge should rely on his own knowledge of the case in deciding such an issue. I would go further. It is the particular province of the Tribunal to assess the weight and significance of a witness' testimony, in accordance with the relevant legal rules.\n[25] There are many reasons why an expert is not in a good position to judge the evidence that comes before the Tribunal. Some of these reasons are a matter of policy. The law is burdened with consequences, which brings in considerations that do not arise in the academic exercise. Some of these reasons are a matter of expertise. The assessment and interpretation of evidence cannot be delegated to experts, who do not have the training, sensibilities or adjudicative experience of the members of the Tribunal. Some are simply practical. An expert is not in the position of the trier of fact, who will inevitably have a more comprehensive view of the case and the legal context in which it arises. There may also be a question of independence or partiality.\n[26] There is nothing to prevent counsel from canvassing the issues that arise in this context in his final submissions. I agree with the Respondent that paragraphs 19 and 20 of the report interpret the evidence and are offensive. The same is true of paragraph 39 and many other passages.\nC. Legal commentary [27] Dr. Wortley also indulges in legal commentary. The report shows little appreciation of the rationale behind some aspects of the law. It nevertheless wanders into legal terrain, and argues, for example, that the burden of proof should be on the Respondent. Dr. Wortley is not in a position to instruct the Tribunal in such matters.\n[28] Paragraph 14 of the report is offensive.\nD. Advocacy [29] Then there is a question of advocacy. Mr. Burnet referred me to Yewdale v. Insurance Corporation of B.C. (1995), 3 B.C.L.R. (3d) 240 (S.C.), at para. 4, where Justice Newbury states that experts must not become advocates. Thus the expert should express his or her opinion in an objective and impartial manner, and must not present argument in the guise of expert evidence.\n[30] The report frequently crosses this line and lapses into argument. Paragraph 37 of the report is offensive. The report also shows serious signs of bias. This is troubling. Although experts are called for the purpose of advancing a specific case, a Tribunal is within its rights to expect a certain neutrality from expert witnesses. These witnesses are allowed to provide opinion evidence because they possess the accumulated knowledge and insight of those who practice in their discipline. It is the fact that this knowledge has an objective component that makes it compelling.\nE. Ultimate issue [31] Then there is the rule regarding the ultimate issue before a legal body. An expert is allowed to give opinion evidence, in order to assist the Tribunal. It is not for the purpose of coaching or second-guessing the Tribunal in its deliberations. The Tribunal must reach its own conclusions in the case. I agree with the Respondent that paragraphs 16 and 17 of the report are offensive in this respect.\n[32] The issue before the Tribunal is whether Mr. Orughu was a victim of discrimination. This is a legal matter. It is not for Dr. Wortley to tell the Tribunal what constitutes discrimination, or whether Mr. Orughu was the victim of discrimination. Unfortunately, this seems to be the goal of much of the report, which is heavy-handed and rather didactic. I think it fails to respect the role of the Tribunal as the decision maker in the process.\n[33] The Commission tries to argue its way around this criticism by saying that Dr. Wortley has restricted himself to the observation that Mr. Orughu's treatment is consistent with racial profiling. That merely demonstrates the point. This is exactly what the Commission is trying to prove, in arguing that it needs the data from the Agency to investigate the systemic aspects of the case. It is for the Tribunal to draw its own conclusions on the evidence and determine whether the Commission's concerns are justified.\nF. Sources [34] There was a minor issue regarding Dr. Wortley's sources. Material such as newspaper articles may be helpful, in illustrating a point. They do not however provide a proper basis for expert evidence. This is not a matter that can be dealt with in the abstract and is better saved for another time. All of the material on which the expert relies, within reason, should be provided to the other side. This does not extend to standard texts, reference works, or work which would be familiar to other experts.\nIV. RULING [35] The report is inadmissible in its present state. The Commission has suggested, in such a circumstance, that I should allow it into evidence and ignore the offending passages. I think this would be a mistake. The report is fundamentally flawed and needs extensive editing. In the circumstances, I think it is preferable to let the Commission tender a revised report, should it wish to do so.\n[36] This does not necessarily dispose of the matter. The Respondent is within its rights to raise other issues when Dr. Wortley takes the witness stand.\noriginal signed by Dr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nNovember 25, 2004\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: T886\/0604\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Idris Orughu v.

LEGAL ISSUES\nA. Prima Facie case\nB. The case as a whole\nIV. RULING\nI. INTRODUCTION A. The positions of the parties [1] Cecil Brooks is black. He makes three allegations, all of them under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. His first allegation is simply that he was treated unfairly in the course of his employment.\n[2] The second allegation relates to an eligibility list that was drawn up in 1989. The Complainant alleges that the Respondent appointed two stewards from the list, after it had expired. Both of them were white.\n[3] The third allegation relates to a competition that was held in 1992 and 1993. The Complainant placed thirteen. He submits that there were serious irregularities in the process. He was discriminated against.\n[4] The Respondent submits that Mr. Brooks was treated fairly throughout the course of his employment. It also submits that competitions in the Coast Guard are subject to regulation. Promotions are based on merit. Although there may have been irregularities in the 1992 competition, there is no evidence of discrimination.\nB. The record [5] The major difficulty with the case lies in its historical character. The complaint was filed in 1996. The events that gave rise to the hearing took place as early as 1988, sixteen years ago. The delay is abusive.\n[6] The record is deficient. Most of the relevant documents have been destroyed. I have only heard from a few of the individuals who played a role in the events before me. In the circumstances, I do not think it is possible to establish anything more than the main features of the case. These are nevertheless sufficient to establish, in at least one instance, that something was seriously amiss.\nII. FACTS A. General background [7] Some matters are not in dispute. Mr. Brooks first applied for the Coast Guard in 1988. He went down to the Coast Guard Building, entered a competition, and was hired as a steward on a temporary basis. He later discovered that he had been hired under the employment equity program.\n[8] As a steward, Mr. Brooks' responsibilities were to maintain the mess, clean the dishes, serve the meals and keep the cabins. He was also responsible for ordering the necessary supplies. He was good at his job. He taught other stewards how to drain and clean the dish machine, how to make a hospital bed, and other points of practice.\n[9] The Complainant called character evidence. Tim Clayton and Tyrone Saunders, both cooks, testified that Mr. Brooks was good-natured, did extra work, and got on great with others. Charles Roy Hamilton, a deckhand, stated that Mr. Brooks was loved on the ships. He was happy go lucky and convivial, exactly the kind of person that you need at sea.\n[10] This deserves some elaboration. As supply officers, stewards have a special responsibility for observing and maintaining the morale of the crew. I accept Mr. Brooks' evidence that he was very good at this. He had a talent for lifting the spirits of others.\n[11] There was a darker side, however. Mr. Brooks had conflicts with his supervisors. He liked things his own way. There was an incident, for example, with respect to the stripping and polishing of floors on the Henry Larsen. There were problems much later, at the library. He resented his subordinate position and had difficulty accepting the normal lines of authority.\n[12] Mr. Brooks filed two complaints. The second was apparently a complaint with regard to the general hiring and personnel practices of the Respondent. It was never referred to the Tribunal.\n[13] Counsel for the Complainant submitted that evidence with regard to the general employment environment nevertheless in the Coast Guard was admissible on the inquiry into Mr. Brooks' complaint. After hearing from both sides, I allowed a limited amount of evidence on the issue, on the basis that it helped to establish the context in which the complaint arose.\n[14] The caselaw also establishes that this evidence may be relevant on the substantive issue of discrimination. In Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare) (re Chopra), [1998] F.C.J. No. 432 (QL), at para. 22, Justice Richard ruled that a previous Tribunal erred in refusing to let the applicants lead general evidence of a systemic problem as circumstantial evidence to infer that discrimination probably occurred in this particular case as well. Although the decision in Chopra dealt with statistical evidence, I think the same principle applies in the case before me.\n[15] The general environment relating to minorities at the Coast Guard during the relevant time was not particularly good. The Coast Guard was aware of this and wanted to deal with the matter. In 1991, its regional director asked Joan Jones, a community activist, to write a report on racism in the Coast Guard. James Francois, the equity officer, was assigned to assist her.\n[16] The Complaint tendered the report. The Respondent objected that there was no real methodology behind it. The report is basically a collection of unsubstantiated allegations. I agree with this assessment of the report.\n[17] I cannot see that it matters. Ms. Jones testified that her report was only intended to prove that minority employees felt there were systemic issues in the Coast Guard. This was exemplified, on the stand, by the testimony of Mr. Books. He testified that permanent positions were at least implicitly reserved for members of the white majority.\n[18] I allowed the report into evidence. If nothing else, it establishes that some employees believed that race was a factor in the decisions made within the Coast Guard. There was evidence from other witnesses to support this.\nB. The first allegation: general unfairness [19] Mr. Brooks feels that he was continually discriminated against in the course of his employment. An enormous amount of evidence was presented with respect to Mr. Brooks' work history. At times, the hearing served more as a discovery than a trial process.\n[20] As it turns out, most of the evidence presented by the Complainant was based on a misunderstanding of the staffing process. The best evidence was given by Brenda DeBaie, a human resources assistant, who testified for the Respondent. She has extensive experience in the area.\n[21] Ms. DeBaie testified that there were three kinds of appointments in the Coast Guard. Some appointments made through an open competition process. Some appointments were made under the exclusion order. And there were emergency appointments.\n[22] Mr. Brooks was originally hired under an exclusion order issued by the Public Service Commission under section 41(1) of the Public Service Employment Act, RSC 1985, C. P-33. This section permits the Commission to exclude employees from the application of the Act. The relevant order came into effect in 1988, under order-in-council SOR\/90-198.\n[23] The use of exclusion order appointments allowed the Coast Guard to meet the seasonal and short-term needs of the fleet. These appointments were limited however, and could not be extended beyond six months. This was reduced to three months in 1992.\n[24] Since employees could only be hired under the exclusion order for a limited period, it was necessary to keep a record of the length of time that they had worked under the exclusion order. This explains the time cards kept by Ms. DeBaie, which figured so prominently in the evidence. These cards should not be treated as an official record of employment.\n[25] Then there were the appointments made by means of a competitive process. These could either be specified period appointments or indeterminate, i.e. permanent appointments. These appointments were made in accordance with the current eligibility list. This was drawn up under the provisions of the Public Service Employment Act.\n[26] The specified period appointments were known as term appointments. Term appointments over six months were referred to as term plus six or term over six. The Complainant's letters of appointments change in February, 1990, and no longer refer to the exclusion order. These letters provide him with term employment.\n[27] There was a history of bitterness relating to the appointments. The exclusion order appointments appear to have had different pay scales. A term plus six brought an employee into the collective agreement. This came with health and dental benefits. It brought the right to ask for a revision of an employee's grade and status, if the employee was carrying extra duties. It brought the right to compete in closed competitions.\n[28] Mr. Fox, the union representative, testified that the appointments process had been historically abused by the Coast Guard. He seemed to feel that the exclusion order appointments were used to staff positions that needed to be filled on a more regular basis. He also felt that some employees were given preferential treatment. They were repeatedly given contracts, with few breaks, and were occasionally given acting positions. These positions were desirable from a financial perspective. They also gave employees valuable experience, which would allow them to advance.\n[29] Ms. DeBaie maintained a list of regular employees, who would be contacted when exclusion order appointments became available. This list was taken from previous eligibility lists and the employment equity list. This was as much a matter of convenience as anything else, since these employees had been cleared for employment and did not require training.\n[30] The process of awarding the exclusion order contracts was extremely internal. Time was short, there were many demands and, Ms. DeBaie simply worked her lists until she found someone who was willing to take the appointment. She acknowledged that she took the location of the employee and the ship into account, in placing her calls. She also avoided assigning someone to a commander, if the commander didn't want him. This was common sense, however, and she was simply happy to find someone who wanted an appointment.\n[31] Ms. DeBaie testified that she dealt with Mr. Brooks fairly and cordially. He was a very likeable person and was one of the most dependable employees. In spite of this, he would come into the office and vent about the employment he was getting. He was no different than 40 or 50 other employees in this respect. He didn't like the arctic assignments and complained that other employees were getting employment closer to home.\n[32] I have to say that there was a lot of room for favouritism in the system. In spite of this, I do not have any evidence that suggests Ms. DeBaie exercised her discretion in a discriminatory fashion. These issues do not arise with respect to the term appointments, since these appointments were awarded in accordance with an eligibility list.\n[33] I should mention some of the more specific allegations. Mr. Brooks submitted, that he went over six months on November 26, 1988 and should have been given a term over six for five days. I cannot see that it matters. Under the payroll regulations, any deductions would have had to be returned to him.\n[34] Mr. Brooks seemed to think that term appointments should be included within the calculations under the exclusion order. He also submitted that the exclusion order appointments awarded to some employees were converted to term plus six after the employee had served six months. He was wrong on both counts.\n[35] Mr. Brooks thought he was being treated unfairly and became increasingly bitter about the fact that he did not have permanent employment. This began to take its toll on him. By 1990, certainly, he felt that his peers thought there was something wrong with him. People were starting to look at him strange. This became part of the problem.\n[36] Mr. Brooks went for lunch in 1991 with the crew from the Henry Larsen, and was told that two stewards had been hired. He was also told that the office had been unable to reach him. He found this suspicious and eventually went to see Ms. Mahar, the crewing officer, about the term appointments. She said that they were hiring from the lists. He demanded to see the lists. There was a heated exchange. Mr. Brooks felt that he was subsequently punished for raising the issue. He only received eight weeks of employment on a de-commissioned ship for the rest of the year.\n[37] There were other allegations. Mr. Brooks was provided with an emergency notice of appointment in 1992, as a result of repairs to the Henry Larsen, which had apparently backed into an ice floe. This took him beyond the contract he had signed and the 182 days under the exclusion order. He still seems to feel that the emergency appointment was a way of denying him a term plus six appointment.\n[38] I think this says more about the deterioration in the relations between the parties than anything else. The real problem was that Mr. Brooks desperately wanted an indeterminate position. There was nothing in the exclusion order or term appointments however, that gave him a right to such a position. This does not mean the system was particularly equitable. It was inevitable that the use of exclusion order appointments, alongside term and indeterminate appointments, would arouse the suspicions of those who failed to obtain permanent employment.\n[39] There is no reason to go further. Whatever inequities existed at the time, the evidence in support of these allegations is not sufficient to establish a prima facie case. I accept the submissions of Ms. Cameron, for the Respondent, on this aspect of his complaint.\nC. The second allegation: the 1989 eligibility list [40] The second allegation relates to an eligibility list from 1989. There is a letter to Mr. Brooks, in August, 1989, which informs him that he is eighth on the list. There are also letters from January, 1992, offering indeterminate positions to two persons on the list.\n[41] The allegation of discrimination is rather vague. It is nevertheless based on the fact that the life of the eligibility list limited for two years. The Complainant accordingly submits that the list must have expired before these appointments were made. Both of the persons who were appointed in 1992 were white.\n[42] The Respondent relies on the fact that both of these candidates were ahead of Mr. Books on the list. It also submits that the list would have been finalized after Mr. Books received his letter. There was evidence that would support such a conclusion. The Complainant's case is entirely conjectural. Nor is there any evidence of wrongdoing. The competition was held some fifteen years ago and I do not believe that it is possible to reconstruct what happened on the record of the case. The evidence is simply too weak to support any findings of fact.\nD. The third allegation: the 1992 competition [43] The third allegation concerns a competition to establish an eligibility list for stewards in 1992. This is where the real issue in the case lies.\n(i) The competition board [44] The person responsible for the 1992 competition was Steve Savoury, a Supervisor in logistics. He testified that he appointed Don Smith and Rose Lucas to the competition board. He asked Ms. Lucas to sit on the board because she was a black woman. This would address the concerns of minorities.\n[45] Mr. Smith had major managerial experience and was appointed as chairperson of the competition board. He described a five or six stage process:\nThe board determined what qualifications were required. It screened out the candidates who were not qualified. It agreed on a list of questions, which tested the knowledge, ability and personal suitability of each candidate. It agreed on the answers. The board then conducted the interviews. The references were checked. The score from the references was added to the score from the interview. Finally, the board ranked the applicants in accordance with their score and prepared an eligibility list.\nThe entire process proceeded by consensus.\n(ii) The statement of qualifications [46] The parties entered two Statements of Qualifications into evidence. They are very similar. Each of them contains a list of qualifications, which are marked (S) or (R) to indicate whether they were part of the screening or rating process. Those candidates who did not possess the qualifications marked (S), should have been screened out of the competition.\n[47] The first Statement of Qualifications states that the candidates must have:\n(S) Work experience as a steward\/stewardess onboard a sea going vessel.\n[48] The second stated that candidates must have:\n(S) Work experience relating to steward\/ stewardess working onboard a sea going vessel.\nThis is significant because the candidate who finished first in the competition had never worked as a steward on a sea going vessel. The same is true of the second place candidate.\n[49] Mr. Bagambiire and Mr. Flaherty argued for the first Statement of Qualifications. They referred me to the report from the Public Service investigator, which states:\nMr. Savoury agreed that the Statement of Qualifications on the competition file read work experience as a Steward\/Stewardess onboard a seagoing vessel. [In spite of this, he originally stated that:] The screening board was looking for seagoing experience or stewards duties. A combination of both was not required. Ms. Boggs was screened [in] as she had seagoing experience as a clerk and worked as a waitress. It was [then] brought to his attention that a candidate who had DND experience as a food service attendant was screened out of the process. He amended his original statement saying experience both on a seagoing vessel and as a steward\/stewardess were required. The candidate with the DND experience had no seagoing experience. (17)\nI think this is in keeping with Mr. Savoury's testimony at the hearing, which was tailored The real force of the report however, lies in the suggestion that the first Statement of Qualifications was taken from the competition file.\n[50] Mr. McCrossin argued for the second statement. He relied on a routing slip from Ms. Mahar to Mr. Savoury, dated May 12, 1992. The slip contains a list of points. One is: Should redo S. of Q. to cut down applications. Another is: I have info. for S. of Q. . The slip suggests that the first Statement of Qualifications is a revision of the second.\n[51] The real issue is when the revision took place. Mr. Savoury was emphatic that it did not refer to the June competition. This merely serves his own interests. The contents of the slip strongly suggest that it was a response to a series of questions regarding the upcoming competitions. It is best described as a set of directions. The tone is imperative. Even Mr. Savoury agreed that staffing officers had the final say in the competition.\n[52] I find that the first Statement of Qualifications is the right one. The logic of the routing slip favours this. If there were enough applicants with experience as stewards, why would one want applications from other individuals?\n(iii) The closing date of the competition [53] The closing date of the competition is also significant. Although we do not have the job posting, the screening report states that Stephen Aubut's application was rejected on June 15th, on the basis that it was received after the post had closed. The applications that were received earlier in the day were accepted. The closing date of the competition was accordingly June 15th.\n[54] It is true that a number of applicants were accepted on the 16th. There is another explanation for this, however. The Canada Employment and Immigration Centre was also receiving applications. They clearly collected the applications they had received by the close of post on the 15th, and sent them over to the Coast Guard on the 16th.\n(iv) Screening [55] The screening was done by Mr. Savoury, rather than the competition board. Mr. Smith merely signed off the sheets. Ms. Lucas did not participate in the process.\n[56] The application form from Ms. Boggs is dated Dec. 8th, 1992, six months after the close of the competition. Mr. Savoury stated that he found Ms. Boggs' application on his desk one or two days after the screening closed. He asked the staffing officer if her application should be processed and was told to screen her into the competition. He neglected to say that Ms. Boggs was working for him at the time.\n[57] There was no record of any of this on the screening sheets and I do not believe that she was ever screened. I find as a fact that she entered the competition late. It is clear that Ms. Boggs should have been screened out, like Mr. Aubut, who simply missed the post.\n[58] Danny Greenough, who finished second in the competition, may have received the same kind of favour. I have already mentioned the list of applications at the end of the screening sheets that came in from the Canada Employment and Immigration Centre. This is followed by three applications, which must have come in independently. The last name on the list is Greenough, Daniel and a Date Rec'd of June 23. It follows that Mr. Greenough's application was late.\n[59] It is telling that Mr. Smith would not accept any responsibility for the decision to include Ms. Boggs and Mr. Greenough in the interviews. He pointed out that Mr. Greenough's name was added to the screening sheet after he had signed off on the screening. There was a considerable period of time between the screening and the interviews. As a result, he was not aware that the application of Ms. Boggs and Mr. Greenough were late. This is a lame excuse.\n[60] Mr. Smith was not alone in trying to distance himself from what had happened. I think it is significant that Mr. Savoury would not accept any responsibility either. He put the blame on the staffing officer, who never testified. Other witnesses side-stepped the issue.\n[61] There are also a number of substantive issues. I have already made it clear that Ms. Boggs did not meet the requirements in the Statement of Qualifications. She had no experience as a steward on a seagoing vessel. Mr. Savoury tried to argue his way around this by saying that she had experience as a waitress and experience on a seagoing vessel. In my view, this was a rather transparent attempt to stretch the requirements of the position beyond their legal limits. Close is not the same as being there.\n[62] The same issue arises with respect to the second place candidate. Mr. Greenough had onboard experience as an oiler, who is responsible for the repair and maintenance of ships. He did not have experience as a steward on a seagoing vessel.\n[63] The Complainant raised a number of other issues. He took the position, for example, that Mr. Greenough's schooling was deficient. There was a similar issue with respect to Mr. Strickland, who finished in 11th place. This led to a debate as to whether he had PSC approved alternatives. I do not see how I can decide these kinds of issues on the evidence before me. The evidence nevertheless suggests that there were many problems with the competition.\n(v) The interview process [64] Rose Lucas came back into the competition during the interviews. She assumed that the candidates had been properly screened. Mr. Smith had written up the questions and answers. They were of the nature: how do you clean a cabin? How do you set the mess for dinner? The candidates were scored on their answers.\n[65] Mr. Smith and Ms. Lucas testified that they tried to make the candidates comfortable. They took turns asking questions. The answers were marked immediately after the interview, on the basis of the scripted answers. Ms. Lucas stated that she and Mr. Smith participated equally in the scoring. They came to a consensus.\n[66] Mr. Smith and Ms. Lucas were willing to acknowledge that there may have been a problem with the interview process. They suggested that candidates who had studied the manual extensively may have had an advantage over candidates with actual experience, who may have given answers that took them outside the manual. This points up the deficiencies in the process.\n[67] Ms. Boggs had an excellent interview, which was reflected in her score. There are problems here. Even if she met the requirements in the Statement of Qualifications, her success in the interview process is hard to explain. She did not have the experience that one would expect of a winning candidate. I think the rest of the evidence suggests that some improper motive was at play.\n[68] The fact that Ms. Boggs used Mr. Savoury as a reference adds to the air of impropriety that surrounds the process. I realize that Ms. DeBaie saw nothing improper in this fact, since Mr. Savoury only did the screening. This neglects the obvious fact that he should have screened her out.\n(vi) Mr. Brooks [69] Mr. Smith phoned Mr. Brooks and asked him to participate in the competition. I accept Mr. Books' evidence, that they were looking for minority candidates. He received a letter in November, advising him that an interview had been scheduled. This took place on December 7, 1992, at the Coast Guard building. It took 45 minutes to an hour. Mr. Brooks says that Don Smith asked all the questions. Rose Lucas wrote down the answers.\n[70] Mr. Smith and Ms. Lucas testified that Mr. Brooks' interview went well. It was friendly, he was comfortable with the questions, and presented himself well. Mr. Brooks was asked if he got on well with other people. He said yes. His references were insufficient however. They wanted three references from his immediate superiors. Mr. Brooks suggested Karen Jewett and Murray McLean. Don Smith suggested Perry West.\n[71] Mr. West said Mr. Brooks was a hard worker. There was a small problem up north\", however, which was described as drinking. This apparently led to an accusation that Mr. Brooks had urinated in someone's sink. Mr. Smith was understanding. He said that these kinds of things happen on extended voyages and made a small deduction for the reference. This did not affect Mr. Brook's rating, Very Good, which was the highest that was available.\n[72] Mr. Brooks disputed Mr. West's account, and took issue with the score that he received for the interview. In his view, the score for interpersonal skills was particularly unfair. He feels that he should have received 20 points out of 20.\n(vii) Ms. Howe [73] Lisa Howe is also black. She participated in the 1992 competition and stated that it took her 14 years to get her indeterminate status. Although she has some bitterness over the issue, I found her evidence convincing.\n[74] Ms. Howe testified that your application had to be on time. If your application was late coming in, you should have been disqualified from the competition. You also needed experience.\n[75] Ms. Howe placed fifth in the competition. She knew some of the other candidates and was surprised by the results. She felt that she should have ranked first. Mr. Brooks should have ranked in the first three. I do not think she was in a position to judge exactly where Mr. Brooks should have ranked. The point is that she thought the competition was a travesty. She still feels that there was racism at the bottom of it.\n[76] Ms. Howe stated that Ms. Boggs never worked as a steward, once she had her full time status. It was just a matter of getting her a full time job, so that she could work her way in a better position. She also knew that Mr. Savoury was Terry Boggs' supervisor. He was running the competition. Ms. Howe concluded the process was fixed. It left her ticked off. Someone from the office was getting her job.\n(viii) The eligibility list [77] On February 25, 1993, the successful candidates--Terry Boggs, Danny Greenough, and Rick Starr--were offered indeterminate positions. All of them went on to other jobs. Mr. Greenough ended up in the engine room. Mr. Starr became a mate on deck.\n[78] Mr. Brooks was grossly insulted by the eligibility list. He had placed 8th in the 1989 competition; he had another 3 years of seniority; and now he found himself 13th, against individuals who had no experience. He was particularly indignant that Ms. Boggs had received a higher score for her knowledge of the duties and responsibilities of a steward. She hadn't even run a dish machine.\n[79] Mr. Brooks criticized Mr. Greenough's attitude. He stated that Mr. Starr had a drinking problem. Ms. Howe confirmed this. I think it would be unfair to comment on this aspect of the case without hearing from Mr. Greenough and Mr. Starr. There is evidence that Mr. Starr had more experience than Mr. Brooks.\n[80] Mr. Brooks was unfair to some of the candidates. He was insulted, for example, that Graeme Garrett was ranked ahead of him on the eligibility list. He testified that Mr. Garrett had less than a year of service and was ranked sixth in the competition. This is not a fair assessment of the situation. Mr. Garrett had 18 years of experience as a steward in the navy and had worked himself up to Steward Level (6). He had certificates. He had completed training as a flight steward. He had owned and managed a restaurant.\n[81] I am not in a position to determine the exact ranking of the candidates. The evidence does not however support Mr. Brooks' contention that he would have finished high enough on the eligibility list to receive an indeterminate appointment.\n(ix) The evidence of Mr. Fox [82] Mr. Fox is now the union President. He feels that the winners of the 1992 competition were cherry-picked. The competition was fixed. His reasons were straight forward. The process was partial. There was a very superficial assessment process. There were no proper references. The Coast Guard evaluations were not provided. The whole thing was a mess.\n(x) Subsequent events [83] Mr. Brooks suggested that he lost some status when he was placed 13th on the eligibility list. He stated that his co-workers would not listen to him. He could not teach them things. He nevertheless continued to work as a steward. He was a term plus six between 1994 and 1996. In February of 1996, he received a form letter advising him that his employment would be terminated on March 31st, as a result of down sizing. The letter was sent to all term employees.\n[84] Mr. Brooks was now a member of the union and decided to file a grievance. He was told a few weeks later that Kelly Carvery, the equity officer for the Coast Guard, would be dealing with the grievance. At some point, there was a meeting with John Thomas, the Commissioner for the Coast Guard to address the concerns of minorities. The meeting was chaired by Ms. Carvery. After the meeting, Mr. Brooks met with her personally. She had no knowledge of his grievance. She said something, which suggested that he would be rolled over into indeterminate status.\n[85] I am convinced that Mr. Brooks filed the original grievance. In any event, nothing happened. He eventually wrote up another grievance, which was entered as an exhibit. This grievance form is dated March 29, 1996 and states:\nI grive [sic] that under the collective agreement I have been desecrated [sic, discrinated] against by job threats, by unfair staffing or staffing practices, also promise a permanent position by Kelly Carvey.\nHe asked for a permanent position as promised by Kelly Carvey.\n[86] The problem was that Mr. Brooks was no longer a term employee. He was accordingly out of the union. There appears to have been some disagreement as to whether the grievance could go forward.\n[87] On April 25, 1996, the Director of Maritime Services wrote Mr. Brooks a letter advising him that he was not entitled to grieve, since he was no longer an employee. The letter stated that hirings were done on merit, there was a surplus of stewards and the Coast Guard was down-sizing. It then stated that the Coast Guard would investigate his allegations regarding general staffing practices. The grievance may have been taken further, but nothing came of it.\n[88] The Director subsequently wrote Mr. Brooks a letter stating that the Public Service Commission would conduct a review of the staffing procedures within the Coast Guard.\n(xi) The Public Service investigation [89] The Public Service Commission appointed Ella Coffill to investigate the allegations of improper staffing processes. Her report was issued on July 9, 1997 and does not deal directly with racial issues. It nevertheless contains a record of Ms. Coffill's conversations with a variety of witnesses and provided the basis of considerable cross-examination. It also contained a set of conclusions. These go both ways. Mr. Brooks was not satisfied with the report and filed a human rights complaint in August.\n[90] Ms. Coffill found serious irregularities in the 1992 competition. She upheld some of Mr. Brooks' allegations. There was some follow-up. There was a meeting to discuss the report. The Coast Guard also proposed corrective action in a letter to the investigator. This included a new competition and eligibility list.\n[91] Mr. Fox kindly wrote a letter, which Mr. Brooks signed, suggesting a resolution of the matter. The Coast Guard suggested measures of its own. The two parties drafted a conciliation agreement on September 22, 1997. The Coast Guard signed it. Mr. Fox witnessed the document, in anticipation of Mr. Brooks' signature. Mr. Brooks then balked and refused to sign.\n[92] There were a few consequences. Mr. Savoury, Mr. Smith and Ms. Lucas were required to take a 3 day course on staffing. They were not allowed to participate in staffing actions until they had completed it. Ms. Lucas was upset by the hostility aroused by the competition and she chose not to take the course. There seems to have been a further investigation of the allegation of racial discrimination, which merely delayed the human rights complaint.\n[93] The Acting Regional Director of the Coast Guard sent Mr. Brooks a letter of apology in April 1998. This had little effect. Mr. Brooks found the apology, without the offer of a job, insulting. I do not think that this was justified. It is not clear that he was entitled to an indeterminate appointment, ahead of the other candidates in the competition. I realize that the candidates who won the 1992 competition retained their positions. This must have rankled Mr. Brooks. Mr. Savoury played favourites and got away with it.\n(xii) Denouement [94] By this time, Mr. Brooks was working as a library support clerk, in merging two department libraries. The base salary was similar to that of a steward, but there was no overtime. Maureen Martin worked with Mr. Brooks. She testified that they were moving the periodicals into a new compact shelving system. They had sets from two libraries and would retain the best set. The final responsibility for deciding where the periodicals would go rested with a Mr. Oxley.\n[95] Mr. Brooks and Ms. Martin were both smokers and shared many cigarette breaks. They made fun of Mr. Oxley. Things went badly. Mr. Brooks complained that he had to take over the project and figure out a way to do it on his own. I think by now he simply resented authority.\n[96] Mr. Brooks left the library in August of 1997, without notice. He felt that he was going nowhere. There were a number of issues in his life, and everything came apart. There was a mental fracture. He became unglued.\nIII. LEGAL ISSUES A. Prima Facie case [97] The caselaw sets out a two-stage approach to the adjudication of a human rights complaint. The Complainant must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. The burden then shifts to the Respondent to provide a reasonable explanation for what occurred. This analysis provides the methodology that should be used in scrutinizing the evidence before the Tribunal.\n[98] There is a major qualification. As I understand it, this does not affect the fundamental burden of proof in the case, which remains with the Complainant. It would seem to follow that the burden on the Respondent is a rhetorical or explicatory burden, rather than a strictly evidentiary one.\n[99] The nature of a prima facie case was described in Ont. Human Rights Comm. v. Simpsons -Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at para. 28, as a case that covers the allegations made and which, if believed, is sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour. This description seems to have been taken from the test for a non-suit, since it suggests that the evidence should not be weighed.\n[100] This is a simple way of looking at the matter. The question on the prima facie test is whether there is evidence, taken by itself, which would establish on a balance of probabilities that the Complainant was a victim of discrimination. This was the way it was presented by the Respondent, which submitted that there is no positive evidence of discrimination before me. There is accordingly no case to meet. The complaint should simply be dismissed.\n[101] The Respondent cited Kibale v. Transport Canada (1985), 6 C.H.R.R. D\/3033, at para. 24369, in support of its position. The Tribunal in that case held that it is not possible to draw an inference of discrimination from an irregularity or outright illegality in the administration of the staffing process of the Public Service of Canada without some evidence linking the irregularity to a ground of discrimination. This principle has been followed in other cases, notably Chopra v. Canada (Dept. of National Health and Welfare) (No. 5) (2001), 40 C.H.R.R. D\/396, at para. 268, (CHRT) and Singh v. Statistics Canada (1998) 34 C.H.R.R. D\/203 (CHRT), at para. 241.\n[102] The Complainant, for his part, relied on the decision of the Board of Inquiry in Shakes v. Rex Pak Limited (1981), 3 CHHR D\/1001 (Ont. B. of Inq.), which holds, at para. 8918, that discrimination is almost invariably proved by circumstantial evidence. The complainant merely needs to establish that he was as qualified as the other candidates. This is enough to meet the prima facie test and shift the burden to the Respondent.\n[103] Mr. McCrossin was visibly uncomfortable with the Complainant's position. I think he felt that the Respondent has a right to choose between equally qualified candidates. He also tried to restrict Shakes to the facts of the case. In his submissions, he took the position that Mr. Brooks was not as well qualified as the other candidates. This is apparent in the results of the competition. Mr. Brooks finished well down the eligibility list. The evidence also establishes that some of the other candidates had better qualifications.\n[104] There is still the fact that the Complainant was better qualified than the candidates who finished first and second. Mr. McCrossin has an answer for this however. He says that the same can be said of other candidates in the competition, who were white. It follows that there is nothing racial in such a fact. This is resourceful but misses the point. The question for the Tribunal is whether Mr. Brooks and Ms. Howe were victimized because they were black. The fact that other candidates were victimized does not decide the matter.\n[105] There is a sense at least in which I agree with the Respondent. I do not believe that the line of reasoning in Shakes is all that helpful in resolving the question before me. The central issue in Shakes was whether the competition was unfair. Here the competition was manifestly unfair. The only question is whether there was a discriminatory component in the wrongdoing. This calls for a different kind of analysis.\n[106] The Complainant submits that there is evidence before me that would support an inference of discrimination. Some of this consists of the perceptions of Mr. Brooks, Ms. Howe and a number of minority employees, who believed that racism had permeated the workplace. The Respondent argues that there is little objective evidence to substantiate their beliefs. Some of this is attributable to the fact that the events in the present case occurred many years ago. The matter goes deeper than this, however.\n[107] The proof of discrimination has its own set of difficulties. Foremost among these is the fact that the same set of circumstances may be open to a variety of interpretations. It could be said that the act of discrimination lies in differentiation. The problem is that this differentiation does not exist independently of the actions of the parties. It must be inferred. It follows that here is an element of judgement in any assessment of the circumstances that give rise to a complaint of discrimination.\n[108] This brings in the impressions of the parties. I think there is an important point here for the Complainant. The problem is not that discrimination is difficult to see. The Complainant states that people who are discriminated against have no difficulty seeing it. They confront it at every turn. The problem is that their perceptions are routinely discarded as illegitimate.\n[109] This goes to the nature of discrimination. It is widely accepted that discrimination has an invisible face. Those who discriminate usually fail to see that they are discriminating. This does not mean that it is invisible to others: indeed, the suggestion is that the racism in the Coast Guard was readily apparent to those who were discriminated against.\n[110] There are legitimate concerns on the other side. The Board in Shakes recognizes the limits on this kind of impressionistic evidence, at para. 8918, when it quotes Professor Borins, in Kennedy v. Mohawk College (1973):\nIt should also be added that the Board must view the conduct complained of in an objective manner and not from the subjective viewpoint of the person alleging discrimination whose interpretation of the impugned conduct may well be distorted because of innate personality characteristics, such as a high degree of sensitivity or defensiveness.\nThe word innate seems unfortunate. The point in the immediate instance is that a Tribunal should be cautious, in relying on the perceptions of the parties.\n[111] There is something to both positions. It would be a mistake to reduce the process of adjudication to a contest between the perceptions on either side of the case. I nevertheless think that impressions, even mere impressions, may have some probative value. The beliefs of Ms. Howe, in particular, are entitled to some weight. Ms. Howe is not a party to the case and still works at the Coast Guard. She has not let her feelings interfere with her relations with her employer. I found her evidence credible and convincing.\n[112] I think Ms. Howe's testimony provides some evidence of discrimination. There is the testimony of Mr. Brooks and a number of other minority employees to support it. There is a context in which the competition occurred, and that context is full of an apprehension that race was a factor in the employment decisions of the Respondent. No one suggested that this was particularly explicit. It was nevertheless an integral part of the sociology of the situation. There was a general recognition that there were legitimate grievances in this area.\n[113] The Coast Guard shared these concerns. This explains why there was an equity list and an equity officer. This explains why the Jones' Report was commissioned. This explains why Rose Lucas was appointed to the competition board. This explains why Mr. Brooks was invited to participate in the competition. This explains the meeting that Mr. Brooks described, where the Director of the Coast Guard addressed the concerns of minorities. I think that this kind of circumstantial evidence adds credibility to Mr. Brooks' contention that he and Ms. Howe were discriminated against.\n[114] There is a rule regarding circumstantial evidence. As I understand it, it is not enough if circumstantial evidence is consistent with an inference of discrimination. This merely establishes the possibility of discrimination, which is not enough to prove the case. The evidence must be inconsistent with other possibilities.\n[115] I realize that the rule has been formulated somewhat differently in some of the caselaw. This is not the place to discuss the matter. The point is simply that the Respondent says here is another possibility. That possibility is that the process was corrupted by favouritism. I have already suggested that this kind of submission misses the point. There is nothing in the fact of favouritism that negates the possibility of discrimination. Indeed, it is in the nature of favouritism to favour some and disadvantage others.\nB. The case as a whole [116] The evidence before me is more than sufficient to meet the prima facie test. There is accordingly a burden on the Respondent to provide a plausible explanation for what occurred. It is apparent that the Tribunal should look at the totality of the evidence, in deciding such an issue.\n[117] The decision in O'Malley v. Simpsons Sears, supra, at para. 28, recognizes that there is an aspect of strict liability in the Supreme Court's decision to place the explanatory burden on the Respondent. For the most part, the Complainant was a spectator to events that occurred outside his control. It is the Respondent that is in the best position to explain what happened. It was responsible for the 1992 competition and has full access to the sources of information needed to determine what occurred.\n[118] The Respondent is in the best position to provide an explanation for what occurred. It has simply failed to do so. The only explanation I have really heard is that there was favouritism in the department. This simply shifts the focus of the inquiry. If there was favouritism, as there clearly was, the question is whether there was a racial element in that favouritism. I think this is where the burden falls on the Respondent.\n[119] The evidence supports the Complainant's submission that race had entered the employment process. It may not have been the primary factor, but it was there, in the background. The caselaw has held, since Holden v. Canadian National Railway Co. (1990) 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (F.C.A.), at p. 397, that this is sufficient to establish discrimination.\n[120] The Respondent did not provide any real explanation of the circumstances before me. The case on the Respondent's side consisted essentially of denials. The witnesses for the Respondent rejected the allegations of racism. But of course they also rejected the idea that the 1992 competition was corrupted by the politics within the department. Mr. Savoury kept his motivations to himself.\n[121] The Respondent has failed to meet its burden in the case. The complaint has accordingly been substantiated.\nIV. RULING [122] Mr. Brooks has waited a long time for some recognition of the problems that existed in the 1992 period. There may still be differences regarding his account of what occurred. The fundamental point is nevertheless clear. The Complainant has established that he was a victim of discrimination.\n[123] I should add that the allegation regarding the 1992 competition was not specific to Mr. Brooks. It was that the black candidates in the competition were discriminated against. It follows that Ms. Howe was a victim of the same discrimination. In point of fact, she had more to complain about than Mr. Brooks, since she finished fifth in the competition.\n[124] The parties are invited to make submissions on remedy. It may be of assistance to say that I am satisfied, on the evidence before me, that Mr. Brooks would not have obtained an indeterminate position, even if the competition was properly conducted. It is also clear that he refused to sign the proposed conciliation agreement. I would accordingly think that the major issue relates to pain and suffering. There is also the question of costs.\nSigned by\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nDecember 3, 2004\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT838\/8803\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nCecil Brooks v.

INTRODUCTION [1] Robert Coulter (the Complainant) alleged discrimination on the basis of a disability, in that the Respondent, Purolator Courier Ltd. (Purolator), refused to accommodate and continue to employ him contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (the Act).\nA. THE FACTS B. Background on the illness and employment with Purolator [2] The Complainant is married and has one son, 11 years old. He is the carrier of a disease called myotonic dystrophy. The first symptoms of his disease appeared at age 27 or 28, when he noticed a loss of muscle strength in his hands and difficulty relaxing the muscles after contraction.\n[3] In 1990, Dr. Pierre-Paul Noiseux, a neurologist, diagnosed the Complainant with Steinert's myotonic dystrophy, a degenerative change in the motor functions normally appearing in adolescence. Specifically, Steinert's myotonic dystrophy is a disease of the striated muscles that prevents quick and effective contraction and relaxation of all muscles. This disease can sometimes affect the heart muscles. It is a hereditary, congenital disease, meaning that the person is born with it. In society, this disease affects approximately three people in 10,000.\n[4] Steinert's myotonic myopathy or dystrophy can remain stable for a long period, or the affected person's condition may deteriorate gradually over the years until he\/she can no longer work.\n[5] The effect of this disease is seen in the slowness of movements affecting speech, diction, the opening and closing of the eyes and muscle relaxation. With speech, there is dysphonia, which is a variation in language performance caused by an impairment of the muscles that control speech, the muscles involved in breathing, and those of the larynx and pharynx. Thus, the pitch of the voice can change and even become virtually inaudible. A person with dysphonia can be hard to understand.\n[6] Among the people afflicted, there are degrees of variation or degrees of severity. The disease can appear at various stages of life. Some individuals may be carriers of the disease at birth and become symptomatic in childhood, while others may not become symptomatic until adulthood. The disease does not affect all individuals with the same severity. There can be slight manifestations of the disease in the 0-to-18 age group, moderate manifestation from 18 to 40 years of age and more serious manifestations in the 40-and-above age group.\n[7] According to Dr. Noiseux, the Complainant is moderately affected, meaning that he has difficulty walking - he walks slowly - and he has foot drop on both sides. He has reduced muscle strength during contraction, and relaxation is quite slow. He has also had an operation for cataracts on his eyes.\n[8] After diagnosing the Complainant with myopathy, Dr. Noiseux did not see him again until 1997. He said that he has seen him occasionally since 1997, about once a year, but not for treatment because there is no treatment for this disease. Between 1990 and 1997, he observed some deterioration primarily in the pupils and eyes. From 1997 to 2003, he determined that the Complainant was losing about 3% to 4% of his physical ability per year.\n[9] In 1991, the Respondent hired the Complainant as a courier (delivery driver). He said that he had told his new employer that he had Steinert's myotonic dystrophy. When he was hired, his supervisor was George Foster. He was the person who conducted his road test and interview. The Complainant was employed with Purolator for 7\u00bd years.\n[10] According to the description by Guy Wilson, Purolator's Human Resources District Manager for Quebec, Purolator is a transportation service company that picks up and delivers parcels, in other words, envelopes and small packages. In Quebec, it has three sorting centres and about 20 depots or sub-depots.\n[11] According to the Collective Agreement between Purolator and the Teamsters, there are three functional group categories at the depots. A functional group encompasses classifications having relatively similar activities. Within the functional group, there is the linehaul driver classification, which includes all drivers of heavy vehicles, which are vehicles with a net mass of five tonnes or more.\n[12] Then there are the couriers, which include conventional couriers, utility couriers, conventional foot couriers and utility foot couriers. Quebec does not have the last two classifications. The difference between conventional couriers and utility couriers is that the latter are used as replacements or during peak periods. They do not have dedicated routes, and their schedules may vary from day to day depending on the company's requirements. They are guaranteed 25 hours of work per week that can be increased with extra hours.\n[13] Until 1998, conventional and utility couriers had to hold a class 5 driver's licence. In February 1998, Purolator raised its driver's licence requirements for these positions to class 3. However, it continued to recognize the qualification of couriers with class 5 before the requirements changed. Also at that time, Purolator adopted a policy whereby employees who had not driven a Purolator vehicle for a year had to re-qualify in order to drive Purolator vehicles. Re-qualification involved taking the written examination and road test again. Examinations were administered by a Purolator driver\/instructor or unit manager. According to Mr. Wilson, these measures were adopted to comply with the spirit of the Act Respecting Owners and Operators of Heavy Vehicles, S.Q. 1998, c. 40, which the provincial government had just passed.\n[14] When he was first hired, the Complainant worked on call. In 1993, he obtained a permanent position with 32.5 hours a week, but he added that the weeks when he worked only 32.5 hours were rare because he was always willing to do overtime and often worked 45 hours a week. His regular shift would start at 1:00 p.m. and end at 7:30 p.m. During a normal day, he would make deliveries from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., and the rest of the day would be devoted to pick-ups. In 1998, he was paid $17.26 an hour.\n[15] When performing their duties, couriers must comply with certain standards, such as making a delivery in 6 minutes and a pick-up in 7 minutes. The work also required physical exertion. They are required to handle parcels up to 70 lbs. They must also be able to go up and down ramps and stairs and squat to gather parcels. In his testimony, the Complainant pointed out that, in a normal day, he would have to squat and stand up again between 60 and 80 times to lift packages and parcels.\n[16] The Complainant was working out of the Ville Saint-Pierre depot. This depot serves the greater part of downtown Montreal, namely Ste-Catherine, Sherbrooke, De Maisonneuve, Ren\u00e9-L\u00e9vesque and McGill College streets. This part of downtown Montreal is very busy with many pedestrians. The route includes Old Montreal, with its narrow streets, pedestrians and carriages.\n[17] There were two or three places along this route where, to make deliveries or pick up parcels, the courier would have to back the truck up to a loading dock. At other locations, the courier would have to carry parcels on foot. There are very few elevators in the buildings in Old Montreal. Therefore, parcels have to be carried up the stairs. This route is very different and more demanding from a driving perspective than a route in an industrial area where virtually every building has a loading dock.\n[18] To do his work, the Complainant drove a Curb Master truck about 14 ft. long and between 3,100 and 3,500 lbs. The driver's licence required for this type of truck, at the time the Complainant was hired, was a class 5 licence, in other words a regular driver's licence.\n[19] The Complainant testified that during his employment, he had two road tests in addition to the one in 1998, which is of particular relevance in this case. Both were conducted under the supervision of Ferrier Caron, a Purolator driver\/instructor whose responsibilities included conducting examinations of new drivers and coordinating the driver training. One of the tests was held in 1997 and the other in the fall of 1998, a few months before the one that would be conducted by George Foster. The Complainant indicated that, in both cases, Mr. Caron did not make any negative comments on his driving of the vehicle.\n[20] The Complainant also testified that, after the 1998 road test, he received a \"Certificate of Automobile Driving Excellence [translation]. This certificate states that Purolator is pleased to award Robert Coulter for two year(s) a certificate of automobile driving excellence in recognition of his accident-free, safe and courteous driving, his responsibility towards others, and the care he takes while driving motor vehicles on public highways and roads [translation]. The certificate is signed by Mark Tilden and Daniel Qu\u00e9villon, the operations manager, in Ville Saint-Pierre.\nC. The incidents leading to the December 15, 1998 meeting [21] In his testimony, Guy Wilson stated that, at the beginning of December 1998, Ferrier Caron informed him that he had noticed the Complainant having difficulty driving his vehicle. Mr. Wilson said that he then contacted the operations manager in Ville Saint-Pierre, Daniel Qu\u00e9villon, to inform him of the situation and suggest a route audit of the Complainant. Mr. Qu\u00e9villon assigned the task to Mr. Foster. Mr. Caron and Mr. Qu\u00e9villon were not called upon to testify at the hearing.\n[22] On December 7, 1998, George Foster conducted a route audit of the Complainant to evaluate his truck driving. According to George Foster, the goal of such an audit is to establish criteria for the number of stops that may be made within a given period of time on a given route. There are usually two route audits per year for each route. He added that the purpose of these audits is more to evaluate employee productivity than their ability to drive a truck. This testimony is not consistent with the one from Mr. Wilson, who said that the evaluation was requested because of concerns raised by Mr. Caron.\n[23] According to the testimony from Paul Oc\u00e9an, the depot's chief union steward, Mr. Foster had told him that he had conducted this route audit because he had noticed the Complainant taking longer than scheduled to complete his route. Therefore, his testimony appears to confirm Mr. Foster's account.\n[24] On December 7, 1998, Mr. Foster accompanied the Complainant on his route. From 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., the Complainant made his deliveries. He stated that he made about 15 deliveries and finished them around 3:00 p.m. He then proceeded with his usual letter and parcel pick-ups. He acknowledged that, at one particular customer location on Ste-Catherine Street, he received assistance loading boxes into the truck, but stated that he had not asked for this assistance. He added that that particular customer always gave him a hand loading boxes into the truck even though he never asked for help.\n[25] The Complainant stated that, during that day, George Foster made no negative comments about his vehicle driving or about safety. They returned to the depot around 7:45 p.m. He added that there had been no accidents or incidents that day.\n[26] On the Driving Certification Form [translation] that George Foster filled out during the evaluation, he noted two locations during the deliveries where there had been incidents. The first occurred at 2:18 p.m. and reads as follows, Hit entrance. Hit Dock Hard\"; the second occurred at 2:38 p.m. and states Hit Dock Hard. The evaluation started at 1:00 p.m. and ended at 8:15 p.m.\n[27] After this route evaluation, Mr. Foster also prepared a written report on December 15, 1998 because, according to him, there was a problem with the security of the truck which Mr. Coulter was driving.\n[28] In this written report, he noted that the Complainant had had difficulty controlling the steering wheel on several occasions, which, according to him, was due to the fact that he was holding the steering wheel with the palm of his hand instead of his fingers. He then noted the 2:18 p.m. incident at 1250 Ren\u00e9-L\u00e9vesque, where the Complainant hit a cement post. He added, On a couple of occasions, pedestrians crossing the street inadvertently, caused him to veer but in a dangerous fashion due to his inability to react quickly. He then added another incident, which he had not entered on his Driving Certification Form [translation], that occurred at 1 Place du Canada and, finally, he mentioned the 2:38 p.m. incident at 1800 McGill College. The Complainant hit the loading dock in both cases and, according to Mr. Foster, the impact was so hard that it hurt his back. In neither case was an accident report filled out, as stipulated in Article 25.03 of the Collective Agreement.\n[29] Mr. Foster also added that, during the parcel pick-up portion, he was walking at a normal pace and had to keep waiting for the Complainant: He appears to have great difficulty walking quickly. As to his ability to carry parcels, this too seemed inadequate in Mr. Foster's estimation. One of the procedures the Complainant used that was not compliant with Purolator's procedure, according to Mr. Foster, was the one the Complainant used to carry parcels from the loading dock to the truck. Instead of carrying a parcel in his arms and going down the stairs, the Complainant would place the parcel on the dock, go down the stairs and then retrieve the parcel from the dock. This was an unproductive method according to Mr. Foster. He noted that, on several occasions, the Complainant dropped parcels and on other occasions asked the customer to help him lift parcels. Regarding this latter case, he said he did not remember where or how often the Complainant had asked for help.\n[30] In his conclusion he stated, \"While these problems do effect the productivity of the company, the principal reason for these events is that Robert suffers from a degenerative disease called `Steinert's Myotonic Dystrophy' [translation]. I feel that there is both a security and an image problem so evident that I do not feel that Robert is capable of performing the duties of a courier as is required by the company. (My emphasis.) No solid evidence was submitted to the Tribunal regarding the road safety problem that the Complainant presented, other than the minor incidents that Mr. Foster indicated in his written report. No evidence of vehicle damage, if any, or of the extent of the back injuries Mr. Foster sustained. No evidence of customer complaints about the Complainant's work. Everything is based on Mr. Foster's perceptions. When asked whether other route audits of the Complainant had been conducted, Mr. Foster answered that he did not remember. However, since he testified that two route audits per year were done, it is very likely that the Complainant had been through this procedure before. The Complainant testified that Ferrier Caron had conducted such an audit just two months earlier.\n[31] Louise Fillion, the Senior Human Resources Advisor, and Marie-Claude Pilon, the Human Resources Advisor at the Ville Saint-Pierre depot at the time, testified having discussed the Complainant's route audit. Ms. Pilon described the problems that the Complainant had experienced on the road. Ms. Fillion said that she had advised her to meet the employee with Mr. Foster and advise him of the observations and to suspend him from the route with pay until he could be assessed by a physician.\n[32] On December 14, one week after the route audit, the Complainant, who had continued to perform his normal duties during that time, received a call from his employer to come in in the morning to make deliveries because they were short on drivers. This was a rather surprising request, given the safety problem that the Complainant supposedly presented.\n[33] Around 11:30 a.m., after he had finished his deliveries, he was asked to return to the depot. When he arrived, he was told that the supervisor wanted to see him in the conference room. George Foster; Marie-Claude Pilon; Richard Marques, a Ville Saint-Pierre supervisor; and Paul Oc\u00e9an, the Ville Saint-Pierre depot chief union steward, were present. In his testimony, George Foster said that he had no recollection of that meeting, whereas all those testifying who had attended the meeting confirmed that he was there.\n[34] During that meeting, Mr. Foster informed the Complainant that his truck driving was unsatisfactory and that his method of carrying parcels was incorrect. He criticized him for hitting two posts and for rolling [translation] parcels instead of lifting and carrying them. He then informed him that he would not be returning to his route to do the pick-ups and that a decision about him would be made the following day. He assigned him to inventorying parts in the garage. He was informed that he was to appear for work the next morning at around 8:00 a.m. to continue with the inventory.\nD. The December 15, 1998 meeting [35] On December 15, 1998, another meeting was held to discuss the Complainant's case. In addition to the Complainant, George Foster (he again said he had no recollection of this meeting), Louise Fillion, Richard Marques and Paul Oc\u00e9an were present. According to the Complainant's testimony, George Foster spoke first. Mr. Foster said that the Complainant was a hazard on the road, that he could not hold the steering wheel correctly and that he should not even have a driver's licence.\n[36] According to the notes that Marie-Claude Pilon took during this meeting, Mr. Foster had added, I saw you drop boxes that were not even five pounds. What does the customer think, that you're drunk? The Complainant was informed that he was relieved from his courier duties with pay until he could receive a neurological assessment.\n[37] The Complainant stated that he had been surprised and insulted by Mr. Foster's remarks, particularly since he had had a road test two months earlier and had received no negative comments about his truck driving.\n[38] The Complainant said that, during the December 15th meeting, he had indicated that he was prepared to do anything to keep working. He stated having asked whether he could do other duties, such as continuing with the inventory they had asked him to do. Mr. Foster had said no and had added that he had been hired to drive trucks and that since he could not perform his duties, he would have to go home. The Complainant had asked whether he could do foot courier duties and Mr. Foster answered that he could not because of the physical requirements of that position.\n[39] Paul Oc\u00e9an, who had also attended the December 15th meeting, added that Mr. Foster had informed the Complainant that the decision he had made was not easy but that he had to terminate his employment because he was no longer qualified for it. Mr. Oc\u00e9an had then asked what would happen with the Complainant. Mr. Foster had answered that there was nothing available for him, and Marie-Claude Pilon had added that the Complainant was going to go on insurance [translation] and that after that they would see. Again according to Mr. Oc\u00e9an, the Complainant continued to plead that he was capable of doing his work, and it was then that Mr. Foster had said, Look we don't want you here, you have a disability.\n[40] After the meeting, Mr. Oc\u00e9an informed the Complainant that the union was going to file a grievance challenging Purolator's decision. On December 22, 1998, the union filed a grievance demanding that the employer reinstate the Complainant in his courier position and pay him the wages that he alleged having lost.\n[41] After the December 15, 1998 meeting, the Complainant went home. Purolator continued to pay his wages based on 32.5 hours per week.\n[42] On December 24, 1998, the Complainant received a letter from Purolator summoning him to an appointment on January 19, 1999 for a medical assessment with Dr. Suzanne Rousseau, a neurologist.\nE. The period between January and December 1999 [43] After the December 15, 1998 meeting, the Complainant contacted his neurologist, Dr. Pierre-Paul Noiseux. The neurologist wrote a letter dated January 5, 1999 saying that the Complainant was capable of performing his courier duties, but with the observation that, because of his myopathy, his performance would be slower than that of someone not having this disease.\n[44] The Complainant stated that he had submitted a copy of this letter to Marie-Claude Pilon the following day, namely January 6, 1999. According to the Complainant, Ms. Pilon told him that the letter was not enough, that he would have to have a neurological assessment with a Purolator-designated neurologist.\n[45] On January 19, 1999, the Complainant arrived for his appointment with Dr. Suzanne Rousseau at Les neurologues de Maisonneuve private clinic. It is interesting that, in her letter of December 22, 1998 addressed to Dr. Rousseau, Marie-Claude Pilon stated that, since 1993, the Complainant had been involved in 19 road accidents, but immediately added that each of the road accidents was minor, a fender bender while turning, another while backing up ....none of the damage was very costly, but on the whole, it demonstrates Mr. Coulter's lack of `coordination' [translation]. (My emphasis.) She also indicated that [t]he manager [Mr. Foster] drew our attention to the fact that Mr. Coulter drove with his wrists [in his report, Mr. Foster wrote that the Complainant drove with the `palm' of his hands] and not with his hands, that he drives bent over almost at 90\u00b0, that he would get into the truck head first [I have trouble understanding what these two observations have to do with safety while driving a vehicle]'' [translation]. Finally, she requested that Dr. Rousseau assess the Complainant's ability to perform his work: Is he able to drive a truck safely? Is his hand grip strong enough to hold the steering wheel properly? Has there been any deterioration in his condition since your last examination in July 1997? [translation]\n[46] As Ms. Pilon's letter indicates, Dr. Rousseau had already conducted a neurological examination of the Complainant on July 23, 1997 to determine his neurological condition. Following that examination, she expressed the opinion that the Complainant's muscle weakness, while allowing him to engage in most normal daily activities, was nevertheless enough to put him in a risk position that I consider excessive in the job he holds. In fact, even though he is probably capable of driving a personal vehicle, his job requires him to drive a heavier vehicle for an eight-hour work period every day, thereby increasing the risk of an accident [translation]. (My emphasis.)\n[47] She then added that the disease progresses slowly and that deterioration and a heightened risk [translation] could be expected. Therefore, in 1997 the Respondent was aware of the Complainant's health condition. In cross-examination, Ms. Fillion said that she was unaware of the 1997 assessment until she read about it in Dr Rousseau's report. However, Marie-Claude Pilon was aware of it because she mentioned it in her letter of December 22, 1998.\n[48] In her 1997 report, Dr. Rousseau stated, \"I therefore believe that the applicant is at risk of an accident because of his myotonic dystrophy. However, in fairness, I suggest that it would probably be preferable to have his actual driving abilities evaluated, for example at the Constance-Lethbridge Centre or the Lucie-Bruneau Rehabilitation Centre (in ergotherapy) [translation]. (My emphasis.) The Respondent did not follow-up on this recommendation until two years later, specifically May 31, 1999. Between 1997 and 1998, there was no follow-up to this report. The issue of the Complainant's truck-driving safety apparently did not worry Purolator at that time.\n[49] After her second examination, Dr. Rousseau sent a report to Purolator on January 26, 1999. In the cover letter, she stressed, as she had in 1997, that the Complainant should undergo an evaluation of his driving abilities with a qualified ergotherapist.\n[50] In her 1999 report, she said she had essentially the same opinion as the one she had expressed in the July 1997 report. She added that the current muscle weakness that is obvious upon objective examination, while allowing him to engage in most normal daily activities, is enough to put him in a risk position that I consider excessive in the job he holds [translation]. It is interesting that this finding is not necessarily due, according to her report, to the fact that the Complainant was required to drive a heavy truck, but instead to the fact that he had to do so for an eight-hour shift every day [translation], which, according to her, unquestionably increases the risk of an accident [translation].\n[51] She then added that she had not observed any obvious or overall deterioration in his muscle strength since his previous assessment. However, she did explain that, since this is a disease that progresses slowly, deterioration and therefore a heightened risk could be expected [translation].\n[52] In response to specific questions put to her, Dr. Rousseau concluded that the Complainant was fit for remunerative work, but believed that he was at risk driving a truck safely and holding a full-time driving position. According to her observations, the Complainant is capable of holding a steering wheel with his hands, but the myotonic condition limits his ability to let go of the steering wheel when required to perform repetitive actions. In her view, the Complainant could be relocated [translation] to a more suitable work, preferably office work.\n[53] Ms. Fillion acknowledged in cross-examination that relocating the Complainant was never considered at that time. Purolator preferred instead to follow one of Dr. Rousseau's other recommendations, namely to conduct an evaluation of actual driving ability through a simulation exercise and an ergotherapy assessment, a recommendation that had been made previously in 1997.\n[54] Dr. Noiseux, the expert witness for the Commission and the Complainant, also conducted, at the Commission's request, a neurological assessment of the Complainant on July 28, 2003. He observed that, because of the dysfunction of the striated muscles, the Complainant had slowed muscle function during both contraction and relaxation and that this affected his mouth, tongue, eyes, hands, arms, feet, pelvis, quadriceps and all muscles involved in walking. As a result, with a sustained speed of contraction and slowed relaxation speed and with myotonia in the muscles, the doctor concluded that the Complainant's functioning was slowed.\n[55] As to strength, he said that the Complainant could not lift weights exceeding 40 lbs. He explained that it was frequency that was important in this case. The Complainant could lift an object weighing that much, but that if it was too often, he would probably be unable to do so.\n[56] He stated that, when squatting, the Complainant could not stand back up again without holding onto furniture or a support pole. In the cerebellum, his movements were slow, but not distorted. He exhibited a bit of steppage gait [translation].\n[57] In his assessment report, Dr. Noiseux concluded that the Complainant's muscle functioning was slowed throughout his whole body. He was unable to make quick movements because the muscles did not relax fast enough. In his view, the Complainant's medical condition did not prevent him from driving a delivery truck even though his muscle movements were slower than those of someone who does not have this disease. Therefore, according to his assessment, he was fit for his normal duties.\n[58] According to Dr. Noiseux, making quick movements was not possible since the muscles did not relax fast enough. He added that there was a manipulation paresis (a weakness). The only muscle not currently affected was the heart. He acknowledged that, because of the Complainant's medical condition, turning a steering wheel quickly using contraction and relaxation movements would be difficult. He agreed that, when turning, the Complainant would be slower with a larger turning radius. He also conceded that the total lack of the Achilles reflex prevented the cautionary or contraction and relaxation preparation movements required for acceleration and deceleration when driving a vehicle. The monosynaptic reflex, an involuntary reflex or automatism, is not there, but Dr. Noiseux immediately added that this does not prevent the Complainant from voluntarily ordering his foot to accelerate or decelerate, but again with some degree of slowness.\n[59] He also added that the Complainant's only restrictions were to not lift weights greater than 40 lbs., run, engage in sports and strenuous physical activity or go up stairs quickly.\n[60] Other than these restrictions, the Complainant is, in his view, capable of performing all courier duties, albeit slowly. He conceded that his conclusion was based on the job description that the Complainant had provided him, not on an official job description from the Respondent. He said that he had taken into account that the Complainant had performed his work with no problems from 1991 to 1998. In his view, this patient should have been relocated...to perform some other work that is consistent with his condition [translation], a recommendation similar to the one Dr. Rousseau had made in her 1997 and 1999 reports.\n[61] Dr. Noiseux said he saw no contradiction between the statement that the Complainant was fit for his duties and the comment that he should have been relocated [translation]. When the Complainant had been removed from duty, the Respondent, according to Dr. Noiseux, should have found him some work that was consistent with his condition, in other words work that could be performed with a degree of slowness, such as office work.\n[62] Dr. Noiseux also read Dr. Rousseau's two reports in order to prepare his assessment report. He stated that he did not share Dr. Rousseau's findings regarding the risk the Complainant presented in his truck-driving duties. According to him, this conclusion does not flow logically from the premises in the reports. As regards Dr. Noiseux's and Dr. Rousseau's assessments, since Dr. Noiseux was called to testify and was cross-examined and seemed to me to be a credible witness, where there are contradictions in the reports, I tend to favour Dr. Noiseux's findings.\n[63] Following Dr. Rousseau's report, the Complainant had another meeting with Louise Fillion and Marie-Claude Pilon, on January 29, 1999. They informed him of the findings in Dr. Rousseau's report and suggested that he submits an application under Purolator's long-term medical insurance [translation] plan. Ms. Fillion testified that she had told the Complainant that he had to have the forms filled out soon and attach a copy of a medical report because, from then on Purolator would no longer be paying him. Ms. Fillion also said that she had then informed the Complainant that arrangements would be made for an ergotherapist to conduct an assessment.\n[64] The medical insurance form was duly filled out and sent to the insurer, who refused the Complainant's application. The reason for the refusal was that Dr. Drainville, the Complainant's family doctor, indicated in his report that he had not placed the Complainant on sick leave. The Complainant did not appeal the decision. Ms. Fillion testified that, following the insurance company's refusal, she forwarded them a copy of Dr. Rousseau's report, but the decision remained unchanged.\n[65] When asked why she had not considered assigning the Complainant to another position when she received Dr. Rousseau's report, Ms. Fillion responded that it was not the Respondent's policy to assign an employee on medical insurance to another position, particularly since, at the time, the Complainant was asking to be reinstated in his courier position.\n[66] On February 15, 1999, the Complainant received his Record of Employment [translation]. According to this record, Purolator terminated his employment because, in the box indicating the reason for this record of employment [translation], the code M was entered, meaning termination [translation]. According to Marie-Claude Pilon, the use of the code M was an error. According to her, on February 16, 1999, instructions were given to deactivate [translation] the Complainant because he was no longer being paid. However, she added that he was still considered an employee. On June 21, 1999, after his assessment at the Lucie Bruneau Centre, which we will return to further on, the Complainant received an amended record of employment indicating that the reason was now code D\", meaning illness or injury [translation]. I do not doubt Ms. Pilon's testimony, but I do wonder about the time that passed between the error and when it was corrected.\n[67] The Complainant stated that, on February 25, 1999, after the first Record of Employment [translation] was issued, he filed another grievance. In this grievance, he challenged his termination. Surprisingly, when Purolator received this grievance, it did not correct what it had considered to be an error on the February 15, 1999 record of employment.\n[68] After his assessment with Dr. Rousseau, the Complainant was referred to an ergotherapist, France Duhamel, of the Lucie Bruneau Centre. According to Louise Fillion, there were to be two parts to the assessment. The first was a driving evaluation in a car and afterwards, if necessary, a second evaluation would be conducted in a truck. The Lucie Bruneau Centre had suggested this procedure. If there were any problems in the car, there would be no need to proceed with the second evaluation.\n[69] The Complainant's car-driving evaluation by the ergotherapist was held on May 31, 1999. The Complainant claimed to be surprised that the evaluation was done with a car having a 5-speed standard transmission and no power steering, whereas for the Respondent, he was required to drive trucks. The evaluation took two and a half hours and followed the Complainant's route.\n[70] The ergotherapist's report was submitted on June 7, 1999. The only comments from the Complainant's driving evaluation that could be considered negative are those regarding the turns that were executed slower than normal, according to the evaluator. The evaluator observed a tendency to turn on a slightly wider turning radius and that hairpin turns were a bit more difficult. She also noticed that the manoeuvres for backing up while turning had to be executed at a slower speed because of motor impairment, but that the Complainant backed up satisfactorily using the mirrors. There was no mention of any manoeuvres that could endanger the safety of the Complainant or pedestrians.\n[71] From her evaluation, she concluded that the Complainant was able to drive a motor vehicle safely. She suggested that he modify certain manoeuvres to compensate for his motor impairment, for example turning a little more slowly. She also added that the Complainant had functional limitations and suggested adding a ball (or other type of handle) to the steering wheel to make turning easier, due to the number of hours of driving per day.\n[72] According to Dr. Noiseux, adding a ball to the steering wheel would be pointless. He pointed out that the Complainant had to perform his driving tasks with both hands, and adding a ball would not make any difference He also said that the Complainant does not have a problem with his grip on the steering wheel. He does not have a muscle contraction problem; his problem is with relaxation.\n[73] When asked whether the Complainant could perform all aspects of Purolator's courier duties, Ms. Duhamel answered, With respect to driving a vehicle, Mr. Coulter is able to carry out all aspects of this part of the job. As for delivering parcels, it is possible that he has some difficulties, but it would be better for him to be examined by an ergotherapist in an occupational fitness assessment [translation]. This recommendation received no follow-up.\n[74] Finally, she stated that, for now and according to the road tests, the Complainant did not present any imminent danger. Despite the use of a car, this conclusion is very different from George Foster's. Mr. Foster had stated that, if it were up to him, the Complainant would not have a driver's licence.\n[75] According to Ms. Fillion, Purolator had problems with the ball recommendation because installing one would result in a restriction on his driver's licence. In addition, Purolator was still not sure of the Complainant's truck-driving ability. It had therefore been decided to conduct a second road test with a truck. On August 5, 1999, two months after Ms. Duhamel's report was submitted, Ms. Fillion had a conversation about this with Isabelle Fontaine of S\u00e9curiMed. However, it was not until October 14, 1999 that S\u00e9curiMed sent the Respondent a cost estimate for a road test with a truck. In the end, the truck test did not happen.\n[76] According to Purolator's witnesses, there were two reasons why this test never took place. First, apparently it was difficult to find an instructor who was able to conduct this test with a truck. However, no evidence was submitted regarding steps taken in this direction other than the cost estimate submitted by S\u00e9curiMed in October 1999. The second reason involves the SAAQ's decision on October 1, 1999 to issue restrictions on the Complainant's driver's licence preventing him from driving a truck.\n[77] Around September 1999, the Complainant decided to apply for his class 1 driver's licence so he could, according to him, find another driving job. On October 1, 1999, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'assurance automobile du Qu\u00e9bec notified him in a letter that it would not issue him a class 1 driver's licence because of his disability. However, the Complainant still had the privilege of driving vehicles corresponding to classes 5 and 6A licences, but with some restrictions including a vehicle weight restriction. In accordance with these new restrictions, the Complainant could not drive vehicles over 2,500 kilograms, which eliminated many employment opportunities for him, including with Purolator, whose trucks exceed this weight.\n[78] The Complainant stated that he could have appealed the SAAQ's decision, but that he chose not to do so because of Article 11.04(b) of the Collective Agreement. He believed that he could benefit from this article and be moved to another classification. A grievance was filed on December 8, 1999, asking the employer to apply Article 11.04(b).\n[79] Jimmy Mansell testified that, after this grievance was filed, he had discussions with Louise Fillion to determine the possibility of moving the Complainant within the company. Note that Article 11.04(b) does not provide for the creation of a new position but rather for moving an employee within the company in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 15.02 of the Collective Agreement. According to Mr. Wilson, this provision did not apply in the Complainant's case because his driver's licence had not been revoked, just reclassified [translation].\n[80] A meeting involving the Complainant, Mr. Mansell, Mr. Wilson and Ms. Fillion was held on December 22, 1999. During this meeting, the parties discussed the possibility of relocating [translation] the Complainant. According to Mr. Wilson, the marker [translation] position seemed to be the only operations position suitable for the Complainant because it was one of the few positions not requiring an employee to use much physical effort. Mr. Wilson stated that he was sure the Complainant would be able to perform most of the marker [translation] duties and that it was possible that a suitable environment would be found for his situation.\n[81] A marker is a person responsible for identifying the destination on parcels to facilitate sorting and directing. The wage is comparable to that of a courier.\n[82] Purolator representatives gave the Complainant a book to study the codes for becoming a marker because the Complainant would have to qualify for this position. If he was successful, the employer would then have to perform checks to find a position in accordance with the provisions of the Collective Agreement. According to Mr. Wilson, Purolator had shown the union that it was open to considering opportunities that may not comply with those provisions. To accomplish that, however, a letter of understanding with the union had to be signed.\n[83] The Complainant decided not to apply for the marker [translation] position because Mr. Mansell had told him that even if he qualified, he could not be moved to that position since he did not have enough seniority. Mr. Mansell explained that the Complainant could have been moved to a marker [translation] position, but that he would not have enough hours to support himself because of his low seniority. However, the Complainant acknowledged that the Respondent had told him during the December 22nd meeting, If you pass the marker position, we'll see if we can find you a job somewhere.\n[84] Purolator and the union never reached a point in their discussion where they contemplated a special agreement for deviating from the Collective Agreement in order to move the Complainant to a marker [translation] position.\n[85] A second meeting was held on January 7, 2000. Attending this meeting were the Complainant, Jimmy Mansell, Guy Wilson and Louise Fillion. During the meeting, they first discussed the possibility of relocating the Complainant to operations, but according to Ms. Fillion's testimony, the Complainant's medical condition meant that the only operations opportunity was the marker [translation] position. Therefore, it was decided to focus on clerical positions.\n[86] The Complainant expressed his desire to write the proficiency tests for a support officer position in the RRP (document control centre) and an operator position at the call centre. The Complainant passed the proficiency tests for both positions. These positions were in a different bargaining unit than the one for couriers, namely the Energy and Paperworkers' Union of Canada. In the end, the Complainant chose the call center operator position because the pay was better. The advancement opportunities in this position were also more attractive according to the Complainant.\nF. His position at the call centre [87] The Complainant started working at the call centre on January 25, 2000. His wage was $13.24 an hour.\n[88] The Complainant, even though already a Purolator employee, was considered a new employee for the purposes of this position because he had come from a different certification unit. Therefore, he was on probation for 60 days.\n[89] Jos\u00e9e Nadon said that she had met with the Complainant on February 8, 2000, to explain, among other things, the regular employee evaluations. As to these evaluations, every month the employees had to take general knowledge tests. Monthly monitoring of employee communications with customers was also conducted and evaluated by supervisors. These evaluations were used to prepare quality reports for each employee.\n[90] On his first quality report in February 2000, the Complainant received a mark of 84%. According to Jos\u00e9e Nadon, the Complainant's greatest difficulties during the evaluation were that he spoke too fast, that he failed to confirm some information and that he used the French familiar form of address with customers. In March 2000, the mark on his quality report increased to 94%; in April his mark was 91%. The same comments were made regarding his speech rate, his use of the familiar form of address and the fact that he sometimes failed to confirm information.\n[91] The May 2000 quality report was not submitted as evidence and no reason was given for its absence.\n[92] According to Ms. Nadon, the average for the Complainant's four call evaluations was 89%. She added that she saw no progress in his results, except between February and March. However, not having the May results, I find it difficult to draw this conclusion.\n[93] On the general knowledge tests, his marks were 85% for February 2000, 60% for March 2000 and 85% for April 2000. Note that, for April, only the mark was submitted as evidence because the test documents could not be located. On the May 2000 general knowledge test, the Complainant received a mark of 100%. His four-month average for the exams was 83%.\n[94] According to Ms. Nadon, the employer required its employees to achieve 95% on both evaluations. She added that the Complainant's performance evaluations were not very good. She said that she had met with the Complainant on April 26, 2000 and explained to him what the employer expected of him, the objectives he had to achieve and that he had a month to improve. She added that she told him he was on probation and that if he did not meet these expectations, Purolator would terminate his employment.\n[95] Ms. Nadon said that, since the Complainant's performance did not improve, she discussed his case with Ms. Fillion, who discussed it with Mr. Wilson. The decision was then made to terminate the Complainant's employment. According to their evaluations, the Complainant did not have the skills required for the call centre operator position.\n[96] On June 9, 2000, Jos\u00e9e Nadon met with the Complainant and told him that he was terminated because of the quality of his work.\n[97] The Complainant stated that his termination from the call centre was a surprise to him because he was in no way expecting it. He said he was shocked and discouraged by his employer's decision. Since he was on probation and was not permanent, he could not file a grievance. The Respondent never considered relocating him to another position. As Ms. Fillion pointed out, When someone on probation ... is terminated, relocating him\/her to another position is not considered. If he\/she doesn't have the skills for a specific duty or position, he\/she doesn't have the skills for another one [translation].\n[98] After his termination, the Complainant said that he met with people at Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec. Through them, he was accepted into a computer technical support officer course for September 2000 at John Abbott College in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue. Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec paid for the course.\n[99] On September 12, 2000, the Complainant filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. It was also around this time that the Complainant applied for Quebec Pension Plan disability benefits, which he would receive from October 2000 until his return to the labour market after finishing his course at John Abbott College. He said that he had applied for this because of his precarious financial situation. The amounts he received for his studies were not enough to support him and his family.\n[100] In mid-September 2000, he started his course at John Abbott College. He successfully passed his final exams. He then took three months of training. He found a job with a company called Gexel Telecom, a call centre providing technical support for high-speed users. In February 2002, he found a new job with another call centre, Sodema T\u00e9l\u00e9-Performance, where his work involved providing customers with technical support. He is still working for this company.\nII. ISSUES The questions I was called upon to decide can be summarized as follows:\nWas the Complainant discriminated against by the Respondent, Purolator Courier Ltd., on the basis of a disability? If the Tribunal answers in the affirmative, did the Respondent contravene section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act by refusing to accommodate and continue to employ the Complainant? If the Tribunal answers in the affirmative to the second question, to what remedies is the Complainant entitled?\nIII. RELEVANT PROVISIONS FROM THE CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACT The relevant provisions from the Canadian Human Rights Act are as follows:\n3. (1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for which a pardon has been granted.\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\na) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\nb) in the course of employment to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n15. (1) It is not a discriminatory practice if\n(a) any refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement;\n(2) For any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) to be considered to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement and for any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(g) to be considered to have a bona fide justification, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost.\nIV. ANALYSIS AND DECISION [101] In the Supreme Court's decisions in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 [also referred to as Meiorin\"] and British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868 [also referred to as Grismer\"], the classic distinction between direct and indirect discrimination has been replaced by a unified approach to the adjudication of human rights complaints. Under this unified approach, the initial onus is on a complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent.\n[102] Once a prima facie case of discrimination has been established, the onus shifts to the respondent to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the discriminatory standard or policy is a bona fide occupational requirement. In order to establish this, the respondent must prove that:\nit adopted the standard for a purpose or goal that is rationally connected to the function being performed. it adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfilment of that legitimate work-related purpose, with no intention of discriminating against the claimant. the impugned standard is reasonably necessary for the employer to accomplish its purpose, i.e. safe and efficient job performance. The employer must establish that it cannot accommodate the claimant and others adversely affected by the standard without experiencing undue hardship.\n[103] The Meiorin and Grismer cases address parameters for determining whether a defence based on undue hardship has been established. In Meiorin, the Supreme Court observed that the use of the word undue implies that some hardship is acceptable. It is only undue hardship that satisfies this test. An uncompromisingly stringent standard may be ideal from the employer's perspective. Yet, if it is to be justified under human rights legislation, the standard must accommodate factors relating to the unique capabilities and inherent worth and dignity of every individual, up to the point of undue hardship.\n[104] The Supreme Court further observed that, in order to prove that a standard is reasonably necessary, a respondent always bears the burden of demonstrating that the standard incorporates every possible accommodation to the point of undue hardship. [See Grismer, supra, para. 32.] It is incumbent on the respondent to show that it has considered and reasonably rejected all viable forms of accommodation. The onus is on the respondent to prove that incorporating aspects of individual accommodation within the standard was impossible short of undue hardship. [See Grismer, supra, para. 42.]\n[105] In the present case, there is no doubt that the Complainant has a physical disability, Steinert's Myotonic Dystrophy, and I do not believe that I need to elaborate further on that. The Respondent had been aware of this physical disability since the Complainant was first hired.\n[106] Once the existence of this disability is established, it is incumbent upon the Commission and the Complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Once this is established, the burden shifts to the Respondent to justify its decision based on a bona fide occupational requirement.\n[107] To determine whether a prima facie case has been established, we must return to the evidence surrounding the December 15, 1998 meeting. In the conclusion of the written report he prepared after his road test, George Foster wrote, While these problems do effect the productivity of the company, the principal reason for these events is that Robert suffers from a degenerative disease called `Steinert's Myotonic Dystrophy' [translation]. I feel that there is both a security and an image problem so evident that I do not feel that Robert is capable of performing the duties of a courier as is required by the company (My emphasis). It is clear upon reading this excerpt that the reason why Purolator removed the Complainant from his position was his disability. If that were not enough to convince us, we need only refer to the notes taken by Marie-Claude Pilon during the December 15, 1999 meeting, in which she wrote that Mr. Foster had said, I saw you drop boxes that were not even five pounds. What does the customer think, that you're drunk?\n[108] I am of the view that this evidence alone is sufficient to justify a verdict in the Complainant's favour, in the absence of an answer from the Respondent. Therefore, I find that a prima facie case of discrimination has been established and that it is now up to Purolator to justify its decision based on a bona fide occupational requirement.\n[109] On this point, if we rely on Mr. Wilson's testimony, the goal of Purolator's standard is road safety for its employees, the public and goods. According to him, this concern for road safety arises from the Act Respecting Owners and Operators of Heavy Vehicles, approved on June 20, 1998 by the Quebec government. It is obviously impossible to establish an absolute road safety goal because there is no such thing as a perfect driver. As the Supreme Court observed in Grismer, driving ability varies even among drivers with excellent vision, hearing and reflexes [translation] [Grismer, supra, para. 26.]. Therefore, there is a road safety goal that I would describe as reasonable. Moreover, given the nature of Purolator's services, we can also identify another standard, the goal of which is the effective performance of courier duties.\n[110] After determining the nature of Purolator's goals, we must now ask whether it has established, on a balance of probabilities, that these road safety and effectiveness goals are rationally connected with the functions it performs. In other words, whether the goal sought (safety and effectiveness) is rationally connected to the performance of the work in question (delivering parcels). I am of the view that a rational connection has been established. There is an unquestionable connection between road safety and effectiveness and parcel delivery by a private courier service. In fact, companies using vehicles in their business must be conscious of the safety of its employees, the general public and the goods it conveys. Also, to keep its market position, it must ensure that its services are as efficient as possible.\n[111] The third issue is whether Purolator's standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of the legitimate goal. To satisfy this requirement, it must demonstrate that, to meet its goals, it is impossible to accommodate individuals like the Complainant without experiencing undue hardship.\n[112] In Meiorin, the Supreme Court suggests an approach for taking into account various ways of accommodating an individual's abilitities. Beyond personal evaluations for determining whether the individual has the skills and abilities required for the job, the Respondent should consider different ways of performing the work while still achieving the legitimate work-related purpose. Purolator never carried out this evaluation.\n[113] As to the danger the Complainant presented while driving a vehicle, the evidence submitted at the hearing seems inconclusive to me. In the Driving Certification Form [translation] that George Foster filled out during the route evaluation, he noted only two incidents, and no reports were prepared for either of them.\n[114] In her letter of December 22, 1998, addressed to Dr. Rousseau, Marie-Claude Pilon said that, since 1993, the Complainant had been involved in 19 road accidents, but immediately added that each of the road accidents was minor, a fender bender while turning, another while backing up....none of the damage was very costly [translation].\n[115] In 1997, Dr. Rousseau examined the Complainant for the first time, and she observed that he was at risk of an accident because of myotonic dystrophy [translation]. She had suggested that it would probably be preferable to have his actual driving abilities evaluated by an ergotherapist. The issue of the Complainant's truck-driving safety apparently did not worry Purolator at that time since it did not follow up on this recommendation from Dr. Rousseau and did not remove the Complainant from the route.\n[116] In her second report in 1999, Dr. Rousseau reproduced her 1997 recommendation and suggested that the Complainant undergo an evaluation of his driving abilities with a qualified ergotherapist. She noted what she described as numerous [translation] accidents involving the applicant and added that, on the whole, these accidents demonstrate the applicant's functional difficulties [translation]. I have a hard time understanding on what Dr. Rousseau based her conclusions. Since she was not called upon to testify, I have no evidence before me for evaluating the reasons that led her to make this judgement. I have to agree on this point with the opinion from Dr. Noiseux, the Commission's and the Complainant's expert witness, and I find that this conclusion does not flow logically from the premises in Dr. Rousseau's reports.\n[117] I also find interesting a further conclusion in Dr. Rousseau's report, where she states that the current muscle weakness that is obvious upon objective examination, while allowing the applicant to engage in most normal daily activities, is enough to put him in a position of excess risk in the job he holds [translation]. This finding is not necessarily due, according to her report, to the fact that the Complainant was required to drive a heavy truck, but instead to the fact that he had to do so for an eight-hour shift every day [translation], which, according to her, unquestionably increases the risk of an accident [translation].\n[118] Another interesting observation was her adding that she had not observed any obvious or overall deterioration in the Complainant's muscle strength since her previous assessment. In that case, why did Purolator decide to take action then, whereas, in 1997 when the Complainant's condition was more or less the same, Purolator did not consider the situation to be serious enough to take any action? The only difference, according to Mr. Wilson, was the 1998 passing of the Quebec legislation, but the evidence on this issue is too patchy to make a bona fide occupational requirement from it in this case.\n[119] Nor is there evidence of any attempt on Purolator's part to determine whether it could not accommodate the Complainant in his courier duties or some other duties without experiencing undue hardship.\n[120] In her submissions, counsel for Purolator referred to the decision in Brimacombe v. Northland Road Services Ltd, British Columbia Human Rights Council, issued on June 17, 1998, to justify Purolator's request to remove the Complainant from the route while waiting for his medical examination. However, in Brimacombe, once the requested medical certificate was supplied, Northland, the employer, accommodated Brimacombe's disability by assigning him to another position. [See para. 84]. In the case before us, Purolator did not proceed that way, but instead stopped paying the Complainant's wages and suggested that he apply for disability insurance.\n[121] As to the Complainant's effectiveness problems, Purolator did not submit to the Tribunal any evidence of customer complaints regarding the Complainant's work. Only George Foster complained about the image [translation] the Complainant was projecting, his overly slow way of walking, and the way he conveyed parcels. Here, too, there was no attempt at accommodation, yet Mr. Foster found a way to criticize the Complainant's method of conveying parcels from the loading dock to the truck, which enabled him to accommodate his disability.\n[122] Has it been demonstrated that it was completely impossible for a person with the disability in question to meet the reasonable objectives of road safety and effectiveness? Has it been demonstrated that any accommodation would impose undue hardship? The answer is obviously no. Purolator's evidence is far from sufficient.\n[123] Therefore, I find that Purolator failed to demonstrate satisfactorily that, between December 15, 1998 and January 25, 2000, the Complainant, due to his disability, was unable to meet the road safety and effectiveness objectives without imposing undue hardship and that it therefore had the duty to accommodate the Complainant in the performance of his duties. Sending the Complainant home without pay as of the end of January and suggesting that he apply for disability insurance is definitely not an acceptable form of accommodation.\n[124] More than just meagre effort is required from the employer to meet its duty to accommodate. Accommodation is not limited to simply determining whether a complainant is capable of performing his\/her current work. The employer is responsible for initiating the accommodation process. [See Conte v. Rogers Cablesystems Ltd., T.D. 4\/99, decision rendered on November 10, 1999.]\n[125] Counsel for Purolator pointed out several times in her final submissions what she described as the strategy that the union and the Complainant had used during that time, which involved demanding that the Complainant be reinstated in his courier position. I attach little importance to this argument. The Complainant, faced with the difficult situation created by Purolator's decision to remove him from duty, had no choice but to try to protect his rights under the Collective Agreement. Faced with this decision, there was nothing preventing Purolator from immediately initiating the process for accommodating the Complainant like Mr. Oc\u00e9an and the Complainant had asked for at the December 15th meeting. Recall that, at that time, Mr. Foster's response had been that nothing was available for him and that Marie-Claude Pilon had added that the Complainant was going to go on insurance [translation] and that afterwards they would see.\n[126] But what about the period between January 2000 and June 2000, during which the Complainant was working at Purolator's call centre? I agree that the duty to accommodate requires that the employer consider alternatives including reorganizing essential duties, moving the employee to another position and even creating a position geared to the employee's condition. Obviously, the concept of undue hardship applies to this duty.\n[127] The evidence shows that, as of December 1999, Purolator finally made a reasonable effort to accommodate the Complainant. Mr. Wilson testified that he had evaluated the operations positions available and that he had concluded that the most appropriate position for the Complainant was the marker [translation] position, since the physical effort required was not as great. He also indicated that Purolator was prepared to consider a special arrangement with the union to find such a position for the Complainant. However, on the advice of his union representative Mr. Mansell, the Complainant decided to turn down this opportunity.\n[128] In his final argument, counsel for the Commission raised the point that Purolator had not considered the possibility of accommodating the Complainant in another position such as a sorter or caretaker. I believe that the evidence submitted by Mr. Wilson demonstrates that Purolator considered these possibilities but rejected them because it believed that they would require too much physical effort from the Complainant. Other possibilities were in clerical services and customer service. In the end, the Complainant accepted a call centre position.\n[129] However, counsel for the Commission asked us to consider the conditions the Complainant was placed in, in this new position, particularly the fact that he was put on probation for six months. Recall that the duty to accommodate does not require one party to depart significantly from the provisions of the Collective Agreement [Brimacombe - para. 75]. In this context, the Complainant had been informed of the conditions that the new position presented, and he accepted them.\n[130] Does the duty to accommodate require that the employment relationship be maintained at all costs? The duty to accommodate must be approached with some common sense. When the Complainant accepted a position that completely suited his abilities, he no longer required special accommodation for his limitations. The evidence does not show that the Complainant had any limitations in his operator position. His problems in this position were essentially performance-related. From then on, he was subject to the same rules and performance evaluation as all the other employees.\n[131] I believe that we must be careful not to acknowledge a duty to accommodate that gives a disabled employee the privilege of maintaining an employment relationship for as long as he\/she stays with the company. The duty to accommodate must be to allow disabled employees to keep their jobs as long as they are able to perform their duties.\n[132] The notion that the duty to accommodate gives employees like the Complainant the right to maintain the employment relationship is contrary to the very existence of the defence of a bona fide occupational requirement. In addition, as Professor Laflamme pointed out in her article L'obligation d'accommodement conf\u00e8re-t-elle aux personnes handicap\u00e9es un droit \u00e0 l'emploi? (2002) 62 Rev. of B. 125, at page 156, it could adversely affect true, sustainable integration of the disabled into the labour market [translation].\n[133] Therefore, I find that the Complainant was discriminated against on the basis of a disability, in that Purolator refused to accommodate and continue to employ him contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act during the period from December 15, 1998 to January 25, 2000 and that, because of this contravention, he is entitled to the following remedies.\nV. REMEDIES [134] According to paragraph 53(2)(c) of the Act, at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finding the complaint to be substantiated may make an order to compensate the victim for wages that the victim was deprived of and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n[135] In the Complainant's case, I believe that he is entitled to compensation for the wages he lost between December 15, 1998 and January 25, 2000. According to the evidence submitted at the hearing, the Complainant's last pay day at Purolator was February 5, 1999, and his first day of work at the call centre was January 25, 2000. I understand that, as of October 1999, the Complainant had a restriction on his licence preventing him from driving a truck. However, I find that Purolator still had a duty to accommodate him at that time.\n[136] Therefore, I order Purolator to pay to the Complainant the income he lost in wages between February 5, 1999 and January 25, 2000. This amount will be calculated based on the hourly wage rate provided for in the Collective Agreement in force at the time for a courier with the Complainant's seniority. To reflect the overtime that the Complainant could have worked during that period, I order the wages to be calculated on the basis of 37.5 hours of work per week.\n[137] By virtue of the power vested in me by subsection 53(2) e) of the Act, I also order the Respondent to pay to the Complainant $5,000 for the pain and suffering caused by its action.\n[138] As the Complainant stated during the hearing, he will have to use money from this amount to pay back the income he received from the employment insurance program during that period.\n[139] As to the claim for future lost wages, I believe that an order for this is not justified.\n[140] I accept the claim for the penalty amount that the Complainant had to pay on February 18, 1999 under his car rental contract, which he had to terminate early. I order the Respondent to reimburse the Complainant the sum of $24,449.82.\n[141] Due to lack of evidence, I do not accept the Complainant's claims for medical insurance, mediator fees, the loan he allegedly had to obtain from his father and losses to his pension fund.\n[142] By virtue of the powers vested in me by subsection 53(3) of the Act, I order Purolator to pay to the Complainant $7,500 in compensation for the reckless nature of its action. I believe that George Foster's attitude alone, during the December 15, 1998 meeting, warrants this order. I would also add the slowness with which those responsible at Purolator handled this matter, at least until December 1999, and their attitude of believing that it was enough simply to refer the Complainant to disability insurance to fulfill their obligations.\n[143] In accordance with subsection 53(4) of the Act and Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal's Interim Rules of Procedure, I award the Complainant interest on the aforementioned amounts, at simple interest, calculated on a yearly basis using the current Canada Savings Bond rate. The interest begins accruing on September 12, 2000, the date the Complainant filed a complaint with the Commission.\n[144] Purolator is responsible for calculating the amounts as soon as possible and informing the Complainant and the Commission in writing of the details.\n[145] I also order Purolator, in consultation with the Commission, to take steps to prevent similar practices in the future.\n[146] Finally, I agree to maintain my jurisdiction regarding the fiscal implications of my order relating to the income losses and the implementation of the remedies I ordered above.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nDecember 7, 2004\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT768\/1803\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nRobert Coulter v.

Grant Sinclair 2004 CHRT 38 2004\/12\/14\nI. FACTS\nII. ANALYSIS\nIII. ORDER\nI. FACTS [1] The Complainant, Public Service Alliance of Canada (Local 70396) has filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, dated March 6, 2000, alleging that the Respondent, Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation has contravened ss.10 and 11 of the Canadian Human Rights Act by applying a gender biased job evaluation plan to its employees in the Complainant bargaining unit.\n[2] In its disclosure request, the Complainant asked the Museum for the point factors weightings and the sub-factor weighting scale used in the job evaluation plan to calculate the point value of a particular job and determine the job classification. These in turn are used to set the pay level for the job.\n[3] The Complainant also requested production of the Computer Program that generates the point scores and classification levels from the data fed into it by Museum Human Resources staff. As I understand the Complainant's request, the Computer Program is necessary to validate or test the validity of the job point scores and job classifications. The Museum uses the Computer Program to avoid any human error that could result in manually calculating a job score and classification.\n[4] The Museum accepts that the point factor ratings and sub-factor weighting scale are relevant to the complaint and necessary for the Complainant to support its case. But it has serious concerns that if it discloses the point factor weightings and sub-factor weighting scale, the Complainant could use this information for purposes collateral to the complaint to the prejudice of the Museum.\n[5] The Museum filed a Notice of Motion with the Tribunal dated August 18, 2004 for an order restricting who can receive this information, how it can be used and requiring individual undertakings be given relating to disclosure. The Museum also resists producing the Computer Program because of a licensing agreement between itself and Watson Wyatt & Company, owner of the Computer Program. The agreement prohibits the Museum from copying the program or giving it to a third party and production could violate the Museum's contractual obligations. Further, the Museum says, the calculations done by the Computer Program can be done by other readily available software programs or manually.\n[6] The concerns of the Museum are set out in the affidavit of Rh\u00e9al Bouvier, Manager, Human Resources Staffing, Programmes and Policies for the Museum, which affidavit was filed at the hearing of the Motion. According to Mr. Bouvier, after the complaint was filed with the Commission, the parties established a Job Evaluation System Review Committee to attempt to design a new job evaluation plan.\n[7] On this Committee were Mr. Bouvier, Maggie Arbour-Doucet, Denise Corbett, both members of the Complainant bargaining unit, Robert Lamoureux, Classification and Equal Pay Officer employed by PSAC, four PIPSC representatives and three non-unionized members of the Museum.\n[8] At that time, Mr. Lamoureux's responsibilities included job evaluation, classification and pay equity issues for Complainant Local 70396. He continued to work with the Local until May 2004 when his responsibilities were taken over by Bonnie Carroll, also a Classification and Equal Pay Officer employed by the Complainant, who had these responsibilities from 1988-1997.\n[9] The Committee held a meeting on November 1, 2004. At the meeting, Mr. Bouvier was asked by Mr. Lamoureux if the Museum would provide committee members with the point factor weightings. He responded by requesting assurance from Mr. Lamoureux that if disclosed, the information be kept confidential. Mr. Lamoureux would not give such an assurance and also said that such information would likely get out. According to Mr. Bouvier, Ms. Arbour-Doucet and Ms. Corbett nodded their heads in agreement with this position.\n[10] Mr. Bouvier also deposed that in subsequent conversations, Mr. Lamoureux told him that he could not assure the confidentiality of the information if disclosed, and he would give the information to any bargaining unit member who asked.\n[11] Ms. Carroll, in her affidavit on behalf of the Complainant, agreed with Mr. Lamoureux's position and believed that this information should be shared with employees whose jobs were evaluated by the plan so they could understand how their job scores were determined. Further, Ms. Carroll stated that this information should be used by the Complainant, as the certified bargaining agent, for collective bargaining purposes.\nII. ANALYSIS [12] All parties agree that the implied undertaking rule, applies to any documents or information disclosed by the Museum. The rationale for this rule is that a party to litigation should have the full right of disclosure and inspection of relevant information, including that which is confidential, as is necessary to dispose fairly of the case. However, a party cannot use this right of disclosure for any purpose collateral to the litigation. If there is a real risk of such use despite the undertaking, additional restrictions can be imposed on how the disclosed information can be used. (See Zellers Inc. v. Venta Investments Ltd. [1998] O.J. No. 2118, (O.C.J.); Reichmann v. Toronto Life Publishing Co. [1990], 44 C.P.C. (2d) 206, 207-210 (H.C.J.); Alberta (Treasury Branches) v. Leahy [2000] A.J. No. 993, pp. 54-55 (Q.B.).\n[13] The Museum argues that the implied undertaking rule is not sufficient to protect the confidentiality of the disclosed information, information that it says has always been confidential and has never been disclosed to the Complainant. The risk of its collateral use, the Museum argues, is found in the statements of Mr. Lamoureux, and Ms. Carroll and the apparently nodding agreement of Ms. Corbett and Ms. Arbour-Doucet.\n[14] But these persons did not express an intent to breach an undertaking. Rather they expressed an unwillingness to give an undertaking at that time. This is not evidence suggesting that they would not honor any undertaking if they gave it.\n[15] As for the Complainant, its position is that the implied undertaking rule is sufficient to protect confidentiality. I do not agree. Unlimited disclosure within the Complainant bargaining unit is incompatible with confidentiality notwithstanding the implied undertaking rule.\n[16] For the Complainant to be given a full and ample opportunity to present its case the disclosure need only be shared with counsel, the instructing member\/members of the Complainant bargaining unit and any consultants retained by the Complainant for advice and\/or expert opinion. Disclosure should be limited to these persons only. And with the exception of counsel, who are subject to professional obligations and rules of conduct, these persons should be required to give written undertakings with respect to non-disclosure of the documents. In my opinion, this would satisfy both the concerns of the Museum and the needs of the Complainant.\n[17] The Commission is satisfied with the terms of the order sought by the Museum, except the terms relating to the Computer Program.\n[18] The Complainant asks for production of the Computer Program. The Commission agrees that it should be provided. This is somewhat problematic. Although the Tribunal can order disclosure by the Museum as an incident of ensuring a fair hearing under the Act, such an order could affect the proprietary interest of Watson Wyatt & Company. Fairness requires that Watson Wyatt & Company be given notice of the request and the opportunity to make submissions to the Tribunal as to under what terms, if any, the Computer Program should be produced.\nIII. ORDER [19] Until and unless otherwise ordered, the point factor weightings and the sub-factor weighting scale, as defined in the Notice of Motion (documents) shall be disclosed to the Commission and\/or the Complainant, in non-electronic format, only on the following terms:\nThe Complainant and the Commission shall not use the documents or the information contained therein for any purposes other than those of this proceeding; The Commission shall not disclose or communicate in any manner whatsoever the documents or the information contained therein to anyone other than its legal counsel, legal services branch staff, the Chief Commissioner, the Secretary General or any consultants retained for the purpose of providing it with advice and\/or expert opinion evidence, and with the exception of legal counsel only, subject to them providing written undertakings to be bound by the terms of this Order; The Complainant shall not disclose or communicate in any manner whatsoever the documents or the information contained therein to anyone, other than its legal counsel and their staff, the instructing member or members of the Complainant bargaining unit, and or any consultants retained for the purpose of providing it with advice and\/or expert opinion evidence, and with the exception of legal counsel only, subject to them providing written undertakings to be bound by the terms of this Order; and The Complainant and the Commission shall not make any additional copies of the documents and shall return to the Respondent the original copy thereof provided by the Respondent within one week of the close of the hearing of the complaint; The Complainant, the Commission and all other persons providing a written undertaking to be bound by the terms of this Order shall not scan the documents or in any way whatsoever convert the documents into electronic format; and The Complainant, the Commission and any other person or persons providing a written undertaking to be bound by the terms of this Order may enter the information contained in the documents into a computer program for the purpose of the within proceeding provided that:\nAll reasonable and necessary precautions are taken to ensure that that computer program, and all information files related thereto containing any information contained in the documents (Information Files), are maintained and stored in a secure manner so as to ensure that no person other than one who has provided a written undertaking to be bound by the terms of this Order will have access to the computer program and\/or the Information Files; All Information Files are permanently deleted from all computer storage media, including, but not limited to, all hard drives, computer disks, CD-ROMs and USB mass storage devices, within one week of the close of the hearing of the complaint; and All reasonable and necessary precautions are taken to ensure that all printed copies of the Information Files, including any portion thereof, all printed copies of any and all calculations performed the computer program using information contained in the Information Files, and any and all notes made in relation thereto, in electronic or other format, shall be maintained and stored in a secure manner so as to ensure that no person other than one who has provided a written undertaking to be bound by the terms of this Order will have access to them.\n[20] The form of the written undertaking shall be agreed upon by counsel for the parties within seven days of this Order and, failing agreement, shall be prescribed by the Tribunal.\n[21] This Order applies only to disclosure of the documents for the purpose of hearing preparation. It does not speak to any issues of confidentiality of the documents should the documents be put into evidence at the hearing of the complaint.\nSigned by J.

Attorney General of Canada (representing the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada) and Canadian Food Inspection Agency\ninstead of the current:\nStephanie Reid v. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and Canadian Food Inspection Agency.\n[2] In her letter requesting the amendment, counsel states:\nThe capacity to sue and be sued is reserved to natural and moral persons. The only organizations that constitute moral persons who can sue and be sued are those granted, by statute, a distinct legal personality. The Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food does not have a distinct legal personality. It is simply a department of the Government of Canada.\n[3] The issue does not arise with respect to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, which may sue or be sued under section 3 and section 15 of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act, S.C. 1997, c. 6.\n[4] Counsel submits that the proper Respondent is the Crown, which employs the individuals who participated in the events that led to the Complaint. The Queen however cannot be named in proceedings. The Common Law apparently holds that the Attorney General should be named as the Respondent, as representative of the Crown. None of this is in question on the application.\n[5] It seems to me that all of the parties, as well as the Tribunal, share a common interest in seeing that the right persons are before the Tribunal. This is a matter of clarity and is important in establishing who has the right to be heard in the case. It may, at least implicitly, determine who has the right to give instructions in the case.\n[6] Counsel for the Commission consents to the amendment. The Complainant has written a letter, in which she consents to the amendment on the basis of the Tribunal's assurance that this in no way prejudices my case and that both responding parties Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and Canadian Food Inspection Agency will continue to be parties to this action. I am not entirely sure what this statement means.\n[7] The Complainant is right in thinking that I cannot see any prejudice to the Complainant in permitting the amendment. As I understand it, the issues before the Tribunal will remain as they were before the amendment. Indeed, the prejudice lies on the other side of the application, since the Complainant will not be able to recover damages from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.\n[8] I am nevertheless obliged to state that the Tribunal is not in the business of providing the Complainant with guarantees. Dr. Reid bears full responsibility for any decisions that she makes regarding her case. She cannot escape that responsibility by placing conditions on her consent. Nor can she transfer that responsibility to anyone else, whether it is the Tribunal, its officers, or the other parties in the case.\n[9] The request for an amendment is not contentious. Dr. Reid has had ample opportunity to seek legal advice and respond to the application. In the circumstances, I am prepared to grant the request, with or without the consent of the Complainant. The style of cause will accordingly be changed to:\nStephanie Reid v. Attorney General of Canada (representing the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada) and Canadian Food Inspection Agency\n[10] I should add that Dr. Reid seems to be upset that the issue was raised during the conference call. Rather than go into the details of the matter, I would simply remind her that the Tribunal has the responsibility for managing the inquiry. This is a necessary feature of litigation. It is the adjudicator, not the parties, who controls the process. The parties are entitled to address any issue that concerns them. It is the Tribunal, however, that ultimately decides what matters will be dealt with in the course of a case conference. All of the parties are required to respect its decisions in this regard.\nSigned by\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nDecember 23, 2004\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: T921\/4104\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Stephanie Reid v.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS REGARDING MICHEL BEAUREGARD'S CREDIBILITY AS A WITNESS\nIV. THE LAW\nV. ANALYSIS\nVI. DISPOSITION\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] The complainant, Michel Beauregard (Beauregard), alleges he was discriminated against on the basis of a disability in that the Respondent, Canada Post Corporation (the Corporation), refused to accommodate him and terminated his employment, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (the Act).\nII. FACTS A. Relationship between the Complainant and the Respondent [2] Beauregard started working for the Respondent in 1993. During his employment, he held various positions, including driver, letter carrier and clerk. On August 31, 1997, he applied for a position in the automated area of the St. Laurent letter processing plant (LPP)1. He obtained the position and was assigned to the evening shift with a schedule of 3:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m.\n[3] On September 7, 1997, he was temporarily assigned to the daytime swing shift at the bulk processing plant (BPP) in the same plant. His assignment was to last until the employee who normally held that position returned or until September 5, 1998 at the latest. In this position, he worked the day shift from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.\n[4] On July 2, 1998, he was loaned to the swing shift at the Retail Sales Operations Branch. The letter confirming his being loaned to this branch states, you are considered on loan and will retain your position [translation]. Beauregard stated that he understood he was keeping his position on the daytime swing shift, which is surprising because this was a temporary assignment and was to end on September 5, 1998 at the latest.\n[5] On September 14, 1998, his employer asked him to return to his former position at the St. Laurent plant. Beauregard stated that when he returned, he was not put back into his position in the parcel area (BPP) but in the letter area (LPP) instead.\n[6] He said that he came to work on the morning of September 14, 1998, to the BPP area at 7:30 a.m. and that the supervisors told him that he had no business [translation] being in that area but that since he was there, they would keep him for the day but that the next day he would have to return to his position at the LPP, on the evening shift.\n[7] The next day, September 15, he appeared for work, at the LPP, at 3:30 p.m. but stated that he left work shortly after. He testified that, at the beginning of his shift on September 15, R\u00e9al Caron, the evening shift superintendent, came to see him and said, You are not here to make trouble. You are here to work, and I hope you're going to work so my numbers are good [translation].\n[8] R\u00e9al Caron testified that he did not know the Complainant and that he never had to work with him before. He stated that he was not informed about his case until October 1, 1998, when Beauregard left a message on the answering machine saying that he would not be coming to work due to illness.\n[9] Beauregard described his working conditions at the LPP as follows: They would watch over us constantly. They made little comments to me when they passed through my area. There was a very cold atmosphere, there were no windows, it was noisy, dusty, very hot near the machines where the letters are processed. There were a lot of problems and I did not feel very well starting... on the 14th, going back was difficult, but the 15th was even worse than what happened on the 14th [translation]. He added that he entered the plant backwards and that he did not feel well until he left in the evening, When I would leave in the evening after working in the plant, it was very relaxing to leave the plant [translation]. A little further on he added, It was such a relief. The employees had a term that they used that went, inside it's like a prison without bars. So, everyone used that expression and I think even a doctor said inside and outside. Also, that same expression can describe the difference in the work mentality between the plant areas and the postal stations. So, inside means the plants and outside means the postal stations. And they used the expression prison without bars. Everybody used that expression [translation]. In cross-examination, he explained, Obviously I would have preferred to stay at the stations. It's a career choice to work either at the stations or the plant. There are staff who love working in the plant. But I'm maybe someone who is better suited to the outside [translation].\n[10] After leaving work on September 15, 1998, Beauregard did not return until October 7, 1998.\n[11] According to R\u00e9al Caron, nothing particular was brought to his attention about the Complainant between September 15 and October 1, 1998. On October 5, 1998, while indicating he was still sick, his supervisor Ren\u00e9e D'Amours tried unsuccessfully to reach him.\n[12] On October 6, 1998, the Complainant consulted a physician, Dr. Allen Payne, for a sinus problem and also, according to him, for lack of sleep, no appetite and stress.\n[13] On October 7, 1998 he went to work. For part of that day, he received training outside of the automated area. Around 7:00 p.m., after finishing his training, he submitted a medical certificate to his supervisor. Caron stated that D'Amours contacted him in the 10 minutes that followed. Caron then went down to the floor to meet with Beauregard because the document he had submitted to D'Amours was an occupational injury document and that certain forms need to be filled out in such cases. The document was actually an official document from the Commission de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du travail du Qu\u00e9bec (the CSST). It is used for opening a claim file with the CSST.\n[14] According to Caron, the employer must complete a report explaining in detail the occupational injury. He said that he had gone down to the floor with D'Amours for this purpose and that he had contacted the union to inform them of the situation. Richard Gagnon, a union representative, arrived on the premises. Beauregard did not show up. Caron, D'Amours and Gagnon were informed that Beauregard had gone home and that he had just called in sick.\n[15] On October 13, 1998, R\u00e9al Caron sent Beauregard a letter by priority post with signature2, in which he requested that Beauregard contact him to provide more information about his medical certificate dated October 7, 1998.\n[16] Beauregard said that he did not receive this letter until October 28, 1998. The letter was sent to him by priority post with signature and since nobody was home when the letter carrier tried to deliver it, it was returned to the postal depot. Beauregard added that he then had 15 days to pick it up.3\n[17] On October 14 and 15, 1998, Caron said that he had tried several times to contact Beauregard by telephone. On the 14th, there was no answer. On the 15th, he said that he spoke with someone whom he assumed was Beauregard's father and that he left a message for Beauregard to contact him. On October 16, Beauregard contacted the administration and informed the receptionist that the employer should not phone him at home anymore.4\n[18] On October 19, 1998, Caron sent Beauregard another letter, by priority post without signature. In that letter, Caron referred again to the medical certificate from October 6, 1998 and to a medical certificate from October 13, 1998. Caron indicated that Beauregard had to comply with the procedures regarding occupational injuries and explained that he was giving him 48 hours, from receipt of the letter, to contact him. Otherwise, disciplinary action would be considered.\n[19] The Complainant states that he received this letter on November 4, 1998, exactly 15 days after it was sent.\n[20] In a third letter dated October 23, sent by priority post with signature, which Beauregard stated he received on October 28, 19985, Caron informed him that he was being given a one-day suspension for not having obeyed to the request in the October 19 letter. He gave him an additional 48 hours to contact him.\n[21] On October 23, 1998, the PPP's Occupational Health, Safety and Environment Department in St. Laurent sent Beauregard a letter by priority post with signature asking him to appear for a medical assessment on October 28 at the office of Dr. Marc Gu\u00e9rin. The letter carrier left a card in the mailbox on October 26. The letter was claimed at the retail postal outlet on November 10, one day before the 15-day period expired.\n[22] On October 28, 1998, the employer sent Beauregard a fourth letter, this time by priority post without signature. It was left in Beauregard's mailbox, and he said he received it on October 29, 1998. In the letter, Caron indicated that since he did not show up for the appointment with Dr. Gu\u00e9rin, the employer was giving him a two-day suspension. Another medical assessment appointment was set for November 6, 1998.\n[23] On November 3, 1998, Beauregard went to the employer to fill out the CSST document entitled Employer's Notice and Reimbursement Claim.\n[24] In the meantime, he also received another letter on October 29, by priority post without signature. He said he received this letter on October 30. This letter informed him of a three-day suspension, from November 6 to 10. Therefore, when he went to the employer on November 3, he knew he was suspended for three days. It is surprising that he subsequently stated that he had been surprised to receive a November 4 letter indicating that he was suspended.\n[25] The November 4 letter was an amendment to the October 29 letter. It simply changed the dates of the suspension from November 6 to 10 to November 9 to 12 because, according to the employer, Beauregard was to appear for a medical examination with Dr. Gu\u00e9rin on November 6.\n[26] At the meeting on November 3, 1998, Caron indicated that he had asked Beauregard about the circumstances in which the injury occurred and that he had responded with it's written on the sheet [translation]. He then asked him where the injury occurred, and he responded, in the LPP [translation]. Caron asked him for clarification and he responded, I don't have to answer your questions. It's written on the sheet [translation].\n[27] Beauregard reacted as follows to Caron's comments as I said earlier in the other document, he wanted me to specify a person involved in my problem. He didn't want me to specify a work location, but a person. He seemed to want me to pick a name and tell him that name. I told him that I did not have a name to provide, that it was a location and series of events [translation]. However, referring to Dr. Payne's notes regarding the medical consultation on October 6, 1998, he indicates noticed symptoms starting from the day of his transfer to the plant on 14-09-98, unpleasant, his supervisor causes him a great deal of stress [translation]. (My underlining.)\n[28] The Complainant added that he could not be more precise because, in his words, I had no examples to give him [translation]. However, on December 9, 1998, in a letter to France Villeneuve of the CSST, he gave three pages of examples with names and dates of events. In this document, he did not mention any events occurring at the automated plant on September 14 or September 15, 1998. The only events he mentioned having occurred between September 14 and October 1 are as follows:\nOn the 24th, I applied as an AP-2, telemarketing representative, and I was informed that I had been selected.\nOn the 28th, for the position mentioned above, I was informed that I was not selected because I did not have all the requirements (bilingual imperative BBBB), which is false because I speak English fluently. [Translation]\n[29] On November 6, 1998, Beauregard met with Dr. Gu\u00e9rin. I will discuss this appointment further on.\n[30] On November 12, 1998, he received another letter from R\u00e9al Caron giving him another three-day suspension because of his attitude during the examination with Dr. Gu\u00e9rin.\n[31] In a November 16 meeting, the employer informed Beauregard that it was still unaware of exactly what he wanted in terms of assignement or what his functional limitations were. Beauregard mentioned that he would be seeing his physician on November 19, 1998 and that, at that point, he would be better informed about his illness.\n[32] On November 25, 1998, another meeting was held to discuss his redeployment. Caron offered Beauregard an assignment to Matane, in a full-time position as a clerk. Beauregard stated that he had never filled out a transfer request for Matane. When informed that he had filled out such a request on May 16, 1997, he responded that the request was no longer valid because, according to the collective agreement, a transfer request is only good for one year.\n[33] Beauregard's refusal to accept the assignment to Matane is surprising in light of his statements to Dr. Payne and Dr. G\u00e9rard Cournoyer, psychiatrist.In Dr. Payne's case, during a visit on November 3, 1998, a few weeks before he was offered the assignment to Matane, he explained that due to a seniority problem, he could not get the type of assignment he wanted. He then stated that he wanted to go to Baie Comeau, that in the end he was prepared to go anywhere to get out of Montreal.\n[34] He mentioned to Dr. Cournoyer that he was free to go where he wanted because he did not have a spouse or children. In the words of Dr. Cournoyer in his report, he went to great lengths in filling out, in the space of about two weeks, approximately 240 transfer requests to assure his employer that he was truly prepared to work anywhere in Quebec so that he would no longer have to be `inside', a jargon term used among Corporation employees to refer to the automated plant where the working environment is, in the eyes of many, much more difficult than `outside'[translation]. If that is the case, then why did he turn down the offer of the assignment to Matane? Why did he not refer to this offer during his visit with Dr. Cournoyer? At the hearing, he stated that, at the time, there were changes in his personal life, which was why he did not want to go to Matane. But why did he not talk about these changes with Dr. Cournoyer, leaving him instead with the impression that he was free to go anywhere?\n[35] He stated that he did not remember those transfer requests because they were good only for one year and that he did not keep them after that. He said that he was unable to say if 240 was correct or whether it was he or Dr. Cournoyer who suggested that number. I personally do not see why or in whose interest Dr. Cournoyer would talk about 240 transfer requests if the Complainant had not brought up that figure.6\n[36] As to the transfer requests, he added,\n[Translation]\nQ. Now, I see there are many locations, it's marked Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Sept-\u00celes, Mont-Joli, Alma and we are going through the whole stack. There are some for Ontario.\nA. There are some for Ontario, yes.\nQ. And there is one for Matane at the top of the pile. After that I see Roberval, and all that.\nA. Yes.\nQ.And these are the locations that you were prepared to go to. Correct?\nA. When I signed that transfer request, yes, because of my situation in 1997, but from the union's perspective, when someone puts in a transfer request, there is nothing requiring him\/her to accept or not accept it because at times there are things in life that can change from day to day.\nQ. I understand.\nA. So there is nothing requiring him\/her to accept. It's just a request to keep one's name on the list. So you put your name on the Matane list, for example, and then when someone offers you the job ... it's good for a year. So a year from May 16, 1997. But it is in no way an obligation. It's just to keep your option open in the event that you may need it.\n[...]\nQ. But let's say, Mr. Beauregard, that you make applications like that to Matane, Sept-\u00celes, Roberval, Guelph and that you are in fact not interested in going to any of those places, could it be said that those requests were made in bad faith?\nA. It cannot be said that they were made in bad faith because you fill them out and wait to see if anything comes available there, whether it will serve your purpose. It's a way of improving your situation. So, if you look at the route presented to you at that time and that route does not suit you, you are entitled to turn it down.\nQ. But for example, Mr. Beauregard, I understand for a Montreal letter carrier putting in a request for a letter carrier route in Matane, he can look at what route would be suitable in Matane, but for an employee at the automated plants in St. Laurent and who absolutely does not like being at the automated plants in St. Laurent, do you choose a letter carrier route based on the number of floors or the number of staircases?\nA. Yes, exactly. You choose by number of floors and number of staircases and each step is counted. So, for example, if it is a route like the one I had in Youville, which has 230 staircases in a day, then you think about it.\nQ. You would rather stay at the plant.\nA. And the number of doors too. The number of doors varies greatly depending on the route and on the amount of sorting to do in the morning. So, if it's a route with a lot of sorting or not much sorting, these are all things you need to consider when the employer offers you a position.\n[37] On November 20, 1998, after meeting with the psychologist L\u00e9oline Daigle7 on November 2, Dr. Luc Morin on November 18, and Dr. Payne on November 19, he sent a letter to R\u00e9al Caron in which he requested an assignment under paragraph 54.02(b) of the collective agreement.8 This paragraph provides that, where an employee becomes physically handicapped because of health reasons and that the need for an assignment is supported by a certificate issued by a qualified medical doctor, upon written application, the employee may be assigned to any appropriate vacant position in his or her group. According to Beauregard, Dr. Payne's results showed that he could not be reinstated in his position at either automated plant. I do not intend to deal here with the issue regarding assignment under section 54 of the collective agreement because the grievance arbitrator has already dealt with it9.\n[38] On December 1, 1998, Georges Dolan, evening shift manager, gave Beauregard a copy of Dr. Gu\u00e9rin's medical assessment report. Dolan also asked him if Dr. Payne and Dr. Gu\u00e9rin could meet to discuss his case. Beauregard first answered yes to this request. However, when Dolan gave him the authorizations to sign, he asked if he could meet with his union representatives before signing the documents.\n[39] He stated that he discussed the issue with his union and that it suggested that he not sign the authorizations. Therefore he refused to sign them.\n[40] On December 3, 1998, he informed Georges Dolan, in a letter, that he had seen Dr. Payne again since the December 1 meeting and that Dr. Payne reconfirmed that he was able to go back to work outside of the two automated plants with no restrictions. The letter was countersigned by Dr. Payne.\n[41] On December 9, 1998, Caron responded to the December 3 letter and indicated that there was nothing in it showing that Beauregard could not do the work in his own position. He therefore ordered Beauregard to appear for work on December 14, 1998, in his position on his own shift, otherwise disciplinary action, not excluding discharge, would be considered [translation]. Beauregard replied that this demand was contrary to Dr. Payne's recommendation and that in addition, the CSST has not [yet] rendered its decision [translation].10\n[42] On December 16, 1998, Caron informed Beauregard that his employment with the Respondent was terminated as of December 17, 1998.11\nB. The visits with Dr. Allen Payne [43] Dr. Allen Payne is a general practitioner. He has a general practice and, according to what he says, he has also been doing CSST medicine since 1995. When a patient comes to see him following an occupational injury, he becomes the attending physician for CSST purposes. He provides all medical follow-up. He has no particular specialty in psychology or psychiatry.\n[44] In 1998, Dr. Payne was working out of both his general practice clinic and the Polyclinique M\u00e9dicale Populaire on Sainte-Catherine St. in Montreal. People can drop in to the Polyclinique without an appointment. A large percentage of the Polyclinique's clients are workers. Dr. Payne indicated that the Polyclinique handles an industrial quantity [translation] of CSST cases.\n[45] Dr. Payne said he saw Beauregard on October 6, 1998. Beauregard said he had gone to that clinic because he had to drive someone to the Papineau subway station that day near the clinic and that it was a union-recommended clinic. He stated that he felt comfortable going there.\n[46] In cross-examination, he admitted that he had already consulted Dr. Payne. In fact, Dr. Payne remembered seeing the Complainant in 1997 for another problem. However, in the two medical reports filled out on the CSST forms during the 1997 visits, in the section entitled Diagnosis and progress of the pathology and treatment there is the expression situational depression [translation]. When questioned about these visits, the Complainant stated that he had no memory of these documents because the copies, he stated, were illegible. His responses about the events surrounding his visits to Dr. Payne in 1997 were vague and less than convincing. It is also surprising that, in his testimony, Dr. Payne did not draw a connection between the 1997 medical reports and the 1998 ones, considering that he was the attending physician in both cases\n[47] In any event, the Complainant went to the Polyclinique on October 6, 1998, with what Dr. Payne described as sinus congestion, wakefulness at night, no recovery, poor appetite, low morale, wants to lie down after being up for only 2 hours; noticed symptoms since his transfer to the plant on 14-09-98, unpleasant, his supervisor causes him a great deal of stress, problem of `inside', slow of train and content of thought, will try to return to work in December, daily headaches, does not really like taking medication, appointment with Dr. Morin psychiatrist on 18-11-98 [translation]. (My underlining.)\n[48] In cross-examination, when counsel for the Respondent asked Beauregard which supervisor he was referring to, he said he did not remember. He also added that he was speaking generally\", that it was not one supervisor in particular who was causing him stress, but the workplace. However, according to Dr. Payne's notes, it was a supervisor who causes him a great deal of stress.\n[49] Dr. Payne stated that he had spent 10 to 15 minutes with Beauregard during his October 6 visit. Beauregard said he explained the entire situation to Dr. Payne at that visit. However, he stated that he neglected to inform Dr. Payne that he had been on sick leave since October 1. Dr. Payne acknowledged that the consultation was short because there were other people waiting [translation].\n[50] In his testimony, Dr. Jacques Gagnon, an expert witness in psychiatry, indicated that a proper psychiatric examination should take 40 to 50 minutes. He is of the view that a ten-minute examination is not thorough and that the resulting assessment is definitely not based on evidence. He added that the diagnosis should be based on a minimum number of significant symptoms. Another psychiatrist, Dr. G\u00e9rard Cournoyer, witness for the Commission and for Beauregard, added that he does not think that a psychiatric examination can be done in the space of a few minutes. He added that an examination of this sort should take at least an hour, sometimes longer. He stated that, before psychiatrists issue an opinion, they must be sure that they have truly gathered all the information on which to base that opinion. In his view, the first visit should last, on average, at least an hour or an hour and a half, because time must be taken to go through the person's entire background and medical history.\n[51] Dr. Payne stated that he arrived at his diagnosis by asking Beauregard certain questions. He added that he was attempting to assess the patient's higher mental functions, the risk of suicide and what he referred to as the inside, in other words the patient's ability to have insight into his own situation. He stated that, at that time, he wanted to gather data on the circumstances and context surrounding the symptoms.\n[52] He said he recalled Beauregard's condition when reviewing his notes, but added that there was nothing particular. You must understand that, at 50, 60, 70 patients a day...there was not necessarily anything more particular with Beauregard than with any other [translation]. He added that he had come to see him with a sinus problem first and that he then said, By the way, Doctor, I don't feel well, etc. [translation]. He stated that he was able to arrive at this conclusion by looking at his notes [b]ecause I marked down the reason for the consultation as congestion, then after I started talking. So, that means that logically he discussed his sinus problem with me, then it came out, when I questioned him a little further, that he did not feel well, that he had no appetite, etc., as I wrote in my notes [translation]. He added that the sinus problem was not connected with Beauregard's psychological state.\n[53] Dr. Payne stated that he asked a series of thorough questions as required by the R\u00e9gime d'assurance maladie du Qu\u00e9bec (the RAMQ). He acknowledged that consultations carried out by psychiatrists are much different. He said that he asked Beauregard how he was feeling. Beauregard mentioned that he would wake up during the night, that he had difficulty recovering from that, that he lost his appetite, that his morale was flat, as he described it, that he was tired, that he wanted to lie down after a couple of hours. He said he had had those symptoms since September 14, 1998.\n[54] The doctor acknowledged that it is important for a patient in a depressed state to be aware of his\/her state of mind, his\/her mental or psychological condition. In this regard, he noted that Beauregard was not crying and that he had not mentioned having cried at any point. He added that, to determine a state of mind, he looks at whether the information is delusional. Is the patient's speech normal or slow? Is the patient having trouble making connections?\n[55] He stated that, after ten minutes of this type of questioning, he had enough information to arrive at the diagnosis that Beauregard appeared to have work-related depression.\n[56] On the medical certificate12 from October 6, 1998, Dr. Payne wrote Reactive depression [translation] as the diagnosis. The date of the event is identified as September 14, 1998. Dr. Payne based this on what Beauregard told him: It is the worker who ultimately determines the date of the event [translation]. He added that, in a psychological case, the date of the event is usually based on the worker's memory of the date when symptoms began.\n[57] On the medical certificate, Dr. Payne also wrote RT 71098, meaning return to work on October 7, 1998. In his notes he wrote, will try to return to work in December [translation]. He stated that Beauregard had said this. However, Dr. Payne had written in the medical report that the return to work was planned for the following day. He added that, since it was a situational problem and not major depression, there could be administrative adjustments. Therefore, a relatively speedy return to work was possible. In his examination, Beauregard stated that he was the one who insisted on returning to work on October 7. He indicated that he had told Dr. Payne, I've had a few days rest, now. So on the 7th I want to try to work and function normally [translation].\n[58] I have no reason to challenge Dr. Payne's version, and I maintain that it was Dr. Payne, not Beauregard, who suggested going back to work the next day.\n[59] When comparing the copies from the medical certificate that Dr. Payne issued on October 6, 1998, we see an annotation on the worker's and employer's copies that does not appear on the physician's copy. This annotation adds, we suggest a change in work location [translation]. Beauregard said he could not explain why this addition appeared on those copies but not on the physician's copy. The doctor could not provide a satisfactory explanation either.\n[60] On October 6, 1998, Dr. Payne also issued another document entitled, Medical Report [translation], again on a CSST form. Dr. Payne explained that, because the medical certificate form in 1998 did not include a box for indicating whether the patient is referred to a specialist, physicians at that time would prepare a medical report that did have such a box. In this case, Beauregard was referred to Dr. Luc Morin, a psychiatrist.\n[61] At the time, Dr. Morin was a psychiatrist at the Polyclinique. He left the Polyclinique in December 2001. Dr. Morin was not called upon to testify. According to Dr. Payne, it would appear that he has passed away or is very sick.\n[62] Dr. Payne said he decided to refer Beauregard to Dr. Morin because he had a psychiatric problem. He also added that the fact that he suggested a change in work location also influenced him to make the referral because [it] could be a suggestion that the employer may or may not be happy with or may lead to problems, second opinions and all that. Therefore, at that time, it was also a question of specialist coverage, you could say. It is a standard procedure for generalists [translation]. (My underlining.)\n[63] On October 13, 1998, Beauregard had another visit with Dr. Payne. During this visit, Dr. Payne prepared a Medical Progress Report [translation]. The diagnosis was still the same, situational depression, this time with the words (work) and (location) [translation] added to clarify, according to Dr. Payne, that the situation was work-related. Below these annotations, he added, appointment, sick leave, October 20, 1998 [translation]. He therefore extended the sick leave to October 20. This appointment lasted only five minutes. Dr. Payne acknowledged that he did not re-examine Beauregard.\n[64] In his notes, Dr. Payne indicated, agrees to see psychologist, referred to Ms. Daigle, sinus X-ray13 [translation].\n[65] Dr. Payne stated that, during this visit, he was not surprised to learn that he had not returned to work on October 7, 1998. Beauregard explained to him that his situation was complex and that resolving it required more time from an administrative perspective and that it could not be done in 24 hours. Dr. Payne said he extended his sick leave because the problem had not yet been resolved from an administrative perspective.\n[66] Dr. Payne added that the adjustment disorder diagnosis was primarily an administrative management issue for which drugs are not prescribed. Instead, time is given to allow administrative management to resolve the problem.\n[67] On October 13, 1998, Dr. Payne noted an ongoing unmanageable depression. This condition was characterized by the fact that Beauregard said he had no appetite, low morale, no energy-the same characteristics he had identified at the examination on October 6, 1998. However, he acknowledged in cross-examination that it was not Beauregard who described these symptoms to him, but that during the five-minute visit, he noted that he seemed a bit downcast. He appeared to have the same types of symptoms [translation].\n[68] At the time of that visit, Beauregard was still waiting to see a psychiatrist, and Dr. Payne also invited him to make an appointment with the psychologist L\u00e9oline Daigle.\n[69] Beauregard saw Dr. Payne again on October 20, 1998. He said he had had an appointment with the psychologist Daigle between October 13 and 20. However, no evidence of this visit or what was said during the visit was presented at the hearing. He stated that he had also made an appointment with Dr. Morin during this period for November 18. However, in his notes for October 20, 1998, Dr. Payne indicated will make an appointment with the psychiatrist Morin [translation]. It appears, then, that on October 20, 1998, there was still no appointment made with Dr. Morin.\n[70] In the Medical Report that Dr. Payne filled out during the visit on October 20, 1998, the diagnosis was still the same, situational depression [translation]. The sick leave was extended to November 5, 1998.\n[71] On November 3, 1998, Dr. Payne performed another examination, this time lasting nearly 10 minutes. According to Dr. Payne, Beauregard was in the same psychological state as he was during his first visit on October 6, 1998. The doctor said he arrived at this conclusion by watching his actions, from his tone, the way he described the events and the copious details he provided. He concluded that Beauregard was emotionally disturbed. He stated that he was not in a position to provide objective clinical signs of this emotional disturbance since psychiatry is, according to him, rarely objective. He also added that Beauregard was not suffering from major depression.\n[72] He said that he was better able to identify subjective signs of an emotional disturbance. Among other things, he noted that Beauregard had what he described as circumstantiality. He added that his thinking was not delusional, but that it was not focused either. He was not obsessive. He went into copious detail to describe a situation that could have been summed up in a few words.\n[73] Dr. Payne recommended a sick leave due to situational or reactive depression [translation], which are the same thing in his view. He added that he would now describe his diagnosis as adjustment disorder [translation]. Dr. Payne never used this expression in his diagnoses. It first appeared in Dr. Luc Morin's note.\n[74] According to Dr. Payne, situational or reactive depression or adjustment disorder are equivalent, and the signs and symptoms are subtle as opposed to those of major depression. He added that drugs are not used to treat them.\n[75] Dr. Gagnon testified that adjustment disorder is a reaction to a significant event in a person's life. Everything usually returns to normal relatively quickly when the stressor is removed. He added that, in Beauregard's case, as soon as he was removed from his work environment, he should have returned to normal functioning within a few days, not in six weeks as Dr. Payne indicated.\n[76] Dr. Marc Gu\u00e9rin, another expert witness in psychiatry, mentioned that depression can take several forms but that it is characterized for the most part by a mood disorder, in other words the mood is sad. The sadness is generally accompanied by a relatively high level of anxiety. The main symptoms of depression are sadness and anxiety. Both of these lead to other symptoms such as difficulty concentrating. A person who is very anxious has difficulty concentrating. This results in a breakdown in emotional control. People who are sad often cry, they are less able to control themselves and are more sensitive. Anxiety generally leads to insomnia. With depression, what is seen most often is initial insomnia or early-morning insomnia: the person wakes up very early and cannot fall back to sleep. He finds that most people experience times when they wake up at night but manage to get back to sleep. It is not pathological in that case. What is more typical in depression is initial or terminal insomnia. Long-term insomnia will increase concentration problems because mental fatigue sets in, and the person will also complain of physical fatigue. Appetite problems are also involved. The person either loses his\/her appetite, which is more common, or eats more and becomes bulimic. In severe cases, when it becomes incapacitating, agitation or psychomotor retardation problems can arise. The person is so anxious that he\/she is disturbed, and is unable to stop moving or slows down mentally and physically. These are all pathological cases that can be considered major.\n[77] Dr. Gu\u00e9rin continued, indicating that adjustment disorder is a lesser form of depression. In the U.S. classification, the symptoms of adjustment disorder are essentially the same as the ones just described but are somewhat less intense. Adjustment disorder is usually directly connected with something identifiable: financial or family worries or problems at work. It is something that is at the end limit of normality.\n[78] When the pathology is self-sustaining, it is referred to as either situational or neurotic depressive disorder. In other words, the symptoms are out of proportion with what the person is experiencing in the external world. These people feel sad even if there is no real reason to feel sad. The pathology is more significant because it is out of proportion with or cannot be explained by the individual's normal or natural reactions. Dr. Gu\u00e9rin talked about extreme cases involving people on the verge of losing contact with reality. They are so sad that they start blaming themselves for everything bad. Their situation is virtually delusional.\n[79] According to Dr. Gu\u00e9rin, there is a gradation in depression symptoms. When a patient goes to see the doctor and says, I have such and such a symptom, for example I'm not sleeping as well...I have less interest, I'm worried, I'm having difficulty concentrating, the physician should question him\/her to determine if there are other symptoms associated with this condition. The physician should try to determine how great the symptoms are. Dr. Gu\u00e9rin stated that there are people who say, I'm having difficulty concentrating, but after a half-hour interview, the physician notices that they are concentrating well, not losing their train of thoughts, and answering questions well. If a person says, I don't have much appetite, the physician must determine if the person has lost weight. According to Dr. Gu\u00e9rin, the physician must take these steps in an attempt to objectify the pathology.\n[80] On November 19, 1998, the Complainant saw Dr. Payne again. According to Dr. Payne this appointment lasted about five minutes. During this appointment, Dr. Payne prepared a final report. Such a document is issued when the patient has reached, in the CSST's words, a state of consolidation [translation]. The final report is different than the other documents because it asks different specific questions. For example, will there be a permanent injury? [translation] and if yes is checked, it continues, will there be functional limitations? [translation]. If yes\", then, is this an aggravation of previous functional limitations [translation]. If the answer is yes, an assessment report must be prepared. In Beauregard's case, this assessment report was never prepared.\n[81] When asked why he did not prepare this assessment report, Dr. Payne responded, Excellent question. Perhaps it has to do with not being able to reach Mr. Beauregard, lack of availability, or because Mr. Beauregard had an administrative process and I was waiting for that? I can't answer you. [translation].\n[82] The consolidation date on the final report is indicated as November 23, 1998. Dr. Payne stated that he could not say for certain how he arrived at that date. According to him, from an administrative perspective, patients are normally consolidated two or three days after their visit. He also added, It can be that, because it is Thursday, for example, the patient is consolidated on Monday. And it's logical, if the 19th is a Thursday, the 20th, the 23rd, that's Monday. It's usually only for administrative reasons that we put the consolidation date a few days after [translation].\n[83] When asked whether it is normal for the consolidation date to be determined based on a day of the week, he responded, That depends. We're talking about administrative management here, and administrative management means that there will be an administrative, not just medical, consolidation. Consolidation must also be done from an administrative perspective, in other words, giving him the time to contact his employer [translation].\n[84] However, the consolidation date, for CSST purposes, is defined as the date of the therapy plateau of an occupational injury. Dr. Payne defines therapy plateau more broadly than in a strictly medical definition. He sees it as the date when it is the most convenient and practical for the worker to return to work, particularly in a case like this one because the problem is, in his view, more administrative than medical. In addition, Dr. Payne describes the Complainant's psychological examinations as venting, but I am not certain that it would call for a major medical treatment [translation].\n[85] He stated that, by an administrative problem, he meant that managing and resolving it are essentially administrative. He added, we are dealing with a problem that is mostly administrative and somewhat medical. ...To assign a percentage, you could say it's 80 [administrative]-20 [medical] or 85-15 [translation].\n[86] Dr. Payne had difficulty explaining what problem the Complainant had with his work, it seemed to be an issue involving difficult labour relations with several people [translation]. However, in his written report of the appointment on October 6, 1998, he wrote, his supervisor causes him a great deal of stress [translation], in the singular. Beauregard did not give him a name, nor did Beauregard tell him during their appointments what he did not like about the individual(s). But it was obvious to Dr. Payne that it was a labour relations issue. However, Beauregard apparently said that the automated plant was the problem, no windows, noisy, dusty [translation].\n[87] The November 19th medical report indicated the following diagnosis: situational depression. Return to work in accordance with paragraph 54.02(b) outside of 2 plants with no night hours. Day or evening 23-11-98, permanently according to psychiatric advice [translation]. Why does it talk about two plants?\n[88] Dr. Payne stated that he made this new diagnosis following the appointment between Beauregard and Dr. Morin. As to paragraph 54.02(b) of the collective agreement, Dr. Payne testified that the Complainant had asked him to refer to it; he himself was not aware of the provision.\n[89] He added that he had recommended that the Complainant work outside the two plants because of Dr. Morin's recommendation. However, if the problem is a question of labour relations with several people, it is hard to see how this recommendation would resolve the problem, especially if the supervisors are not the same at both plants.\n[90] He explained that he made these recommendations for the two plants because the two plants have the same work characteristics and because that was what caused the problem. As such, the problem is no longer work conflicts with supervisors but rather a work location problem.\n[91] Dr. Payne testified that Dr. Morin also recommended working outside the two plants [translation]. However, referring to Dr. Morin's handwritten note that he prepared after his examination of Beauregard, we see that he refers to plant in the singular, not the plural, Rec: Change of position and location (plant) [translation]. Moreover, there is nothing leading us to believe that Dr. Morin was aware of the second plant.\n[92] Dr. Payne eventually acknowledged that Beauregard requested that he restrict him, through a medical certificate, from the two plants and from the night shift, but added that his recommendation was not based on this request, but gave no further explanation. He also admitted that Beauregard explained to him that he had made an application under paragraph 54.02(b) of the collective agreement and asked him to write that recommendation on the certificate. Dr. Payne admitted that he was not familiar with the paragraph in question and recognized that it is not a medical provision, and added that administrative management is required for this case anyway.\n[93] He said that he had suggested with no night hours because he considered Beauregard fragile, which made it difficult for him to adjust to working nights. The noise, isolation, stress and night work are, according to him, factors that could bring on a relapse. He recognized, however, that it very well could have been that Beauregard asked him to restrict him from the night shift, but he is not as certain about this as he was regarding the suggestion about the two plants.\n[94] As to the appointment with Dr. Morin, the only evidence we have about this is Beauregard's testimony and Dr. Morin's note. This appointment apparently lasted about 45 minutes. Dr. Morin's questions dealt specifically with the work location and the Complainant's state of mind when he was inside his workplace and when he was outside. Beauregard indicated that Dr. Payne had asked Dr. Morin this specific question, Should the patient be transferred or relocated to a job outside the two plants [translation], and Dr. Morin responded in the affirmative. However, Dr. Payne never referred to that question in his testimony or his notes. As to the two plants\", it should be remembered that Dr. Morin in his note referred to plant in the singular.\n[95] Moreover, Dr. Morin's note was very brief, and I reproduce it here in its entirety, Working at Canada Post since June 93 in an automated mail-processing plant. Complains of management harassment. Has been a replacement employee at postal stations. Felt that the work was pleasant supervisor \u00c6 superintendent. Occupational injury: work-related situational depression (Dr. Payne) versus suspension according to management. Environment (plant: noise - isolation - stress. Diagnosis: acute stress + adjustment disorder in the working environment with anxio-depressive mood. Recommend change in position and environment (plant) [translation].\n[96] Dr. Morin's diagnosis referred to acute stress.In Dr. Payne's interpretation, acute stress is something that happens within a short period of time and brings on an emotional affect. Dr. Payne stated that, in his examination of Beauregard the day after his appointment with Dr. Morin, he did not note any acute stress. Dr. Gagnon stated that it was difficult to support a diagnosis of acute stress because the primary element is missing: a reaction to an event. An acute stress reaction is equivalent to a state of post-traumatic stress, but does not last very long. In Beauregard's case, there had never been a traumatic event.\n[97] Dr. Payne stated that, during the appointment on November 19, 1998, Beauregard was a bit agitated. He remained standing for the entire interview. However, Dr. Payne stated that he did not ask the patient any questions since Dr. Morin had seen him the previous day. The appointment lasted 2 to 5 minutes. In this short time, Dr. Payne completed a medical report and the final report. He acknowledged that in the final report he checked off yes to all the questions in the section entitled, permanent physical or psychological injury and functional limitations [translation]. He said, though, that he mistakenly checked off yes to the question if yes, did this limitations aggravate previous functional limitations [translation] since this question usually applies to individuals who have had an earlier occupational injury. He said that this mistake could be due to lack of attention because he had to be quick, but that it could also be explained by the fact that, at that time, he was not as familiar with the administrative workings.\n[98] In the final report, he also checked off yes to the question did you prepare the assessment report in accordance with the scale of bodily injuries [translation] but admitted that this report was never prepared.\n[99] As previously mentioned, during the November 19th appointment, Dr. Payne again diagnosed situational depression. According to Dr. Gagnon, such a diagnosis on that date \u00e6 Beauregard had not been working since October 1 \u00e6 is surprising to say the least because, according to him, a person suffering from adjustment disorder or reactive or situational depression will improve as soon as he\/she is out of the situation causing the disorder since the stressor no longer exists. He added that it is difficult to believe that a person's depression could persist for several weeks without the attending physician taking any medical steps to treat it.\n[100] On November 26, 1998, Dr. Payne prepared another medical report. Preparation of the report did not involve a clinical consultation or examination. According to Dr. Payne, the document was an administrative certificate that restated the existing recommendations. In the diagnosis, we read, consolidated on 19-11-98, sick leave in accordance with paragraph 54.02(b), outside the 2 plants etc., until application in accordance with 08665 [translation]. What this document means, according to Dr. Payne, is that until what he describes as the Complainant's permanent limitations are made effective, the Complainant will remain on sick leave.\n[101] A medical report was prepared on December 15, 1998. The diagnosis in this document indicated, work outside the plant is mandatory in accordance with section 54. Known depression [translation]. Dr. Payne said that he wrote mandatory because it was obvious that there were problems with the administrative management of the Complainant's file and that, in his view, working outside the plant was the solution.\n[102] In his notes for December 15, 1998, Dr. Payne wrote, relapse, aggravation because he was put back in the plant [translation]. According to him, Beauregard re-entered a more difficult psychological state because he was put back in the plant. In cross-examination, he explained that it was a mistake to consider it a relapse and that he should have indicated instead that it was a continuation of the same problem.\nC. The appointment with Dr. Marc Gu\u00e9rin [103] Dr. Marc Gu\u00e9rin is a psychiatrist. His experience falls into three main fields: psychiatric and psychoanalytical practice in hospitals and in private; the teaching of psychiatry at McGill University and psychoanalysis at the Canadian Institute of Psychoanalysis; and forensic assessment, which has been his sole field of activity since the end of 1996. Dr. Gu\u00e9rin said he has twenty years' experience in interviews and assessments of the kind he had with Beauregard. He added that in his professional life he has interviewed at least 10,000 patients, which is nearly 500 per year.\n[104] Dr. Gu\u00e9rin qualifies as an expert in psychiatry.\n[105] On November 6, 1998, Dr. Gu\u00e9rin met with Beauregard to perform an assessment at the request of the Respondent. The interview was very short. It did not last longer than 15 or 20 minutes because Beauregard refused to cooperate and answer the doctor's questions. Dr. Gu\u00e9rin did not see the point in persisting and he ended the interview. Beauregard explained that his reluctance was due to not being prepared and informed about what a psychiatric assessment is all about. He said that he understands better now what was expected of him and that it was the reason why he asked to see Dr. Gu\u00e9rin again and stated that he was prepared to cooperate with him 100%. The Respondent did not follow up on this request, which in my view is unfortunate, but immaterial for the final disposition of this case.\n[106] Dr. Gu\u00e9rin conducted the assessment using the method he said he uses in all his cases. He starts by identifying himself. He then informs the patient of his purpose. He explains what questions he will be asking. He said that he wants to ensure that the person knows who referred him. He also explained that he prepares a report after the examination. He then issues a form on which he gives the contact information of the person to whom he will send the report. Finally, he proceeds with his questions. He begins by gathering factual data: age, date of birth, etc. He then questions the patient about his\/her medical and psychiatric history and about the problem that brought the patient to him.\n[107] He said that this was the exact process he followed with Beauregard but that Beauregard did not want to answer his questions. All Beauregard said to him was that he could not work at the automated plants and that there was a conflict, but did not elaborate on the nature of the conflict.\n[108] When he questioned him about his symptoms, the Complainant responded, that he could not tell me about it further until he could see his doctor [translation]. According to Dr. Gu\u00e9rin, this is a very unusual response. He acknowledged that people coming to him for an assessment do not do so willingly; they are always sent by someone. They are therefore a little apprehensive when they arrive and are somewhat reluctant. But he added that when he explains his purpose and role to them, they generally cooperate well. He said that occasionally there are people who do not cooperate as well. However, it is very rare that people are uncooperative to the point where they cannot go ahead with the questions and a thorough or satisfactory examination. He said that, in his 20-year practice, this has happened only a few times.\n[109] Dr. Gu\u00e9rin mentioned that the people who usually come to see him are sent because they have a problem, and his job is to identify the problem and, where appropriate, offer treatment suggestions. People know, even those who are somewhat reluctant upon arrival, that they are with a doctor who is going to try to help them as much as possible. Therefore, despite their initial hesitation, it is in their best interest to cooperate and talk about their symptoms.\n[110] Dr. Gu\u00e9rin testified that he was unable to determine any psychiatric pathology in Beauregard during the examination. He said that what he could tell from the discussion with Beauregard is that he was unhappy at work and that he seemed to have some sort of conflict. Beauregard did not report any psychiatric symptoms to Dr. Gu\u00e9rin. The doctor observed that there were no obvious signs of psychiatric pathology: his speech was coherent; he was alert and well-oriented; and throughout the interview he did not exhibit any problems concentrating or any pathologies [translation].\n[111] In his report, Dr. Gu\u00e9rin acknowledged that Beauregard was obviously unhappy at work and that he did not want to work in his position at the automated plant. He added that he mentioned that he had to leave work due to internal stress and pressure at the automated plants. However, he did not want to elaborate on these issues and when Dr. Gu\u00e9rin questioned him about the symptoms, he answered that he had to see his doctor again and that then he would know what to say.\n[112] During the brief interview, Dr. Gu\u00e9rin was able to observe that Beauregard looked well and seemed to be in good health. His sensorium, in other words his temporal orientation, seemed clear. He did not note any anomalies in cognitive functioning, in other words his ability to concentrate, his memory and his comprehension. There was no agitation or psychomotor retardation, which are the signs observed in a person with, for example, a relatively serious case of anxio-depressive syndrome. In these instances, there is either motor restlessness and psychological agitation caused by anxiety or slowness in the case of deep depression. Beauregard exhibited none of these.\n[113] His mood was normal; he did not seem sad. His affect was, in Dr. Gu\u00e9rin's words, mobilizable [translation]. He concluded that there was no evidence of a pathology that could be described as a mood disorder of the depressive or manic type. During the examination, Beauregard did not appear anxious. His thinking was normal and his speech was coherent. However, it was impossible for Dr. Gu\u00e9rin to get a good idea of the psychological content since he refused to answer questions. But he added that he was clearly not delusional and did not present any suicidal thoughts.\n[114] Since he did not observe any obvious pathologies, Dr. Gu\u00e9rin stated that he was unable to issue any restrictions or treatment recommendations. There was no evidence of disability and no evidence of psychiatric limitations with respect to his work. According to Dr. Gu\u00e9rin, if there was indeed a problem, it was administrative and should therefore be addressed from an administrative perspective, which does not involve the medical field. This partly coincides with Dr. Payne's conclusions.\n[115] If this were a medical issue, Dr. Gu\u00e9rin indicated that, for anxio-depressive symptoms, the two most common forms of treatment are psychotherapy and drug therapy. There are drugs, either tranquillizers or antidepressants, that may be prescribed if the symptoms are serious enough to warrant it. These drugs all have side affects, so they are not prescribed if the person is not sufficiently disturbed. In this case, the total lack of treatment leads one to believe that, according to Dr. Gu\u00e9rin, there is slight impairment, if anything.\n[116] Beauregard did not inform Dr. Gu\u00e9rin that he had seen a psychologist on November 2, 1998, just four days before the appointment with him. Neither did he indicate that he was going to see Dr. Morin on November 18, 1998. There was also nothing in Dr. Morin's notes indicating that Beauregard had informed him about having seen Dr. Gu\u00e9rin on November 6, 1998.\n[117] In his report, Dr. Gu\u00e9rin concluded that the brief examination did not allow him to arrive at a psychiatric diagnosis. As a result, he indicated that his opinion was based on the short interview with Beauregard and that his opinion should be taken with some reserve because it may be that Beauregard had specific problems that he did not talk to him about.\nD. Dr. Andr\u00e9 Gamache's assessment [118] Dr. Andr\u00e9 Gamache is a psychiatrist. The Commission and the Complainant called on him to testify as a witness. However, neither the Commission nor the Complainant thought it appropriate to consider him an expert witness. Therefore, without challenging his competence as a psychiatrist, I must take Dr. Gamache's opinions in his testimony with some reserve.\n[119] In 1999, Dr. Gamache was working as an emergency psychiatrist at Louis-H. Lafontaine Hospital in Montreal. From 1999 to 2001, he also was working at the Medical Review Board (MRB) one day a week on average, where he conducted assessments. The MRB is a government organization. Physicians in different specialties work there as arbitrators in disputes relating to CSST cases. It is an arbitration board called upon when medical reports differ. A joint employer\/employee committee appoints physicians to the MRB. These physicians are independent and are not hired by the employees, the employers or the unions. They must carry out non-partisan examinations to settle disputes. They must eventually say which of the two physicians is correct. In this case, Dr. Gamache had to decide between Dr. Payne's and Dr. Gu\u00e9rin's assessments.\n[120] The procedure provides that the MRB physician may be called upon to decide several issues that are subject to the Act respecting industrial accidents and occupational diseases14. In Beauregard's case, Dr. Gamache was asked five questions. They dealt with the diagnosis, consolidation date, care or treatment, permanent injury and functional limitations.\n[121] In the section of his report from February 26, 1999 entitled, History of the problem [translation], Dr. Gamache said,\nOn September 14, he [Beauregard] was ordered to return to work at the automated plants as a letter clerk. He said that was when he felt that the employer was using pressure tactics. Today he gave me some examples, such as his employer would stand behind him and watch over him. They would also check to see if he was taking too much time in the bathroom or on breaks. He also mentioned to me that he was not allowed to talk to his neighbours, even to ask for information pertaining to his work. He told me about an example where he had a parcel and did not know how to sort it, so he asked his neighbour what to do in those situations. They forbade him from doing that and told him to ask his supervisor instead. He mentioned to me that he was even told, with supporting evidence, that his supervisor told him that if he did not do it that way (his work), they would `kick his ass' out the door. (My underlining) [Translation]]\n[122] Thus, according to the history that Beauregard related to Dr. Gamache, September 14 was when the employer started using pressure tactics. He then mentioned a series of events that could not have occurred on September 14 or after, since he left work on September 15 and did not return again except for part of the day on October 7. Moreover, in his letter to France Villeneuve of the CSST dated December 9, 1998, in which he gave three pages of examples with names and dates of events, no events were identified for September 14 or 15, 1998. Finally, a supervisor's remarks about him, reproduced in the last sentence of that section in Dr. Gamache's report, were not said directly to him. According to R\u00e9al Caron's and Richard Gagnon's testimonies, the remarks were made on October 7 when Caron, Gagnon and D'Amours were waiting for him and he did not show up. In addition, Caron, without denying that he had used those words, stated that he said them to his colleague D'Amours, not to Gagnon, and definitely not to Beauregard, who was not present.\n[123] In his report, Dr. Gamache also noted that the attending physician mentioned workplace adjustment disorder with anxio-depressive mood...permanent psychological injury: 5% [translation]. This means that, when Dr. Payne examined him, he was exhibiting the psychological after-effects of his adjustment disorder. At 5%, he agreed that this is mild neurosis.\n[124] In the Progress of the Problem [translation], Dr. Gamache indicated It was relatively difficult at first with Mr. Beauregard to determine exactly what he was suffering from on October 1, 1998. I should mention that, at the beginning of the interview, he was a little wary, but that his wariness subsequently dissipated [translation]. He added that this difficulty seemed normal at the beginning, but once he explained the MRB's role, his wariness dissipated. In cross-examination, Dr. Gamache acknowledged that he only notes a patient's wariness in cases where he considers it significant.\n[125] Dr. Gamache indicated that a psychiatrist must ask certain questions when assessing a patient. However, he admitted that he did not ask any questions about Beauregard's psychosocial behaviour, such as the type of person he is, how he conducts himself in society, what his personality traits are, or what his main psychological or personality characteristics are. He acknowledged that, given the problem, these questions would have enabled him to determine how Beauregard reacts to authority in a supervised work environment and to instructions and orders, information that could have been used in the diagnosis.\n[126] Dr. Gamache added in his report, he mentioned that his attending physician had written a paper about this, in which he discussed anxio-depressive reaction to work-related stress. I told him, however, that Dr. Payne had not mentioned any symptoms and that I would like to explore that with him [translation]. (My underlining.) Dr. Gamache therefore could not identify any symptoms in Dr. Payne's medical reports.\n[127] Dr. Gamache admitted that, during the examination, he did not observe any of the symptoms required for diagnosing adjustment disorder and, since there were no symptoms in Dr. Payne's report to use to reach the conclusion that Beauregard was suffering from adjustment disorder, he said he left it to Beauregard to describe his symptoms to him.\n[128] In his diagnosis, Dr. Gamache concluded, in my opinion, Mr. Beauregard exhibited adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, code 309.21 [translation]. Code 309.21 refers to the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders) which contains the nomenclature for mental illnesses and diagnoses. The DSM-IV is used in clinics, assessments and medical reports. Dr. Gamache said he came to the conclusion he did because Beauregard told him that, as of October 1, 1998, he was having sleep problems, would wake up frequently and that he felt exhausted, tired and anxious. In addition, he added that at the automated plants, he did not feel like he was being treated like a human first, that he could not see outside at all, that there were no windows, that there was a lot of dust, that they were watched constantly, in short just robots. For him it was an untenable situation and he asked several times for an assignment under, as he said, section 54 of the collective agreement. He told me that he did indeed want to work but not in a place where he did not feel well psychologically, that his employer always denied him job redeployment [translation].\n[129] The symptoms then, according to Dr. Gamache, were tiredness, exhaustion and anxiety. The doctor added that it can be concluded that someone in a stress situation who, because of the stress, develops these symptoms in the weeks, days and months that follow, is suffering from adjustment disorder with anxio-depressive mood.\n[130] In the reasoned opinion in his report, Dr. Gamache concluded that he agrees with Dr. Payne's diagnosis of the case. However, he gives as a diagnosis adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood and does not maintain the situational or reactive depression, which is not a diagnosis in the DSM-IV. According to him, the symptoms more closely match the code for adjustment disorder with anxio-depressive mood. Again, the symptoms that led him to this conclusion came from Beauregard.\n[131] According to Dr. Gamache, adjustment disorder is characterized by symptoms of anxiety or depression or both following stress experienced by the individual. He added that, in psychiatry, there is no objective examination, like a blood test for example, for making a diagnosis. Psychiatrists must trust what their patients tell them and what they know about human nature. According to Dr. Gamache, it is highly likely that Beauregard did exhibit adjustment disorder following the events he experienced.\n[132] When Dr. Gamache performed his assessment of Beauregard on February 25, 1999, Beauregard was not having nightmares, his mood was good, he was sleeping well and his appetite was good. He therefore had no psychological problems at that point and he had no after-effects, which confirmed, in his opinion, that once the stress was removed, the symptoms disappeared. However, he added that if the stress reappears, there is the chance that the symptoms will return. He testified, According to what I read in my assessment, Mr. Beauregard mentioned that, at the automated plants where he was working at the time, if I recall correctly, it was primarily his employer's attitude, who as I mentioned was watching over him: `Did you take 15 minutes to go to the bathroom' and things like that. So, obviously, that was very difficult for him to deal with. So it was stressful for him and in addition he was working nights, if I understand correctly, he was working at the automated plants, there was no light, and it was dusty. I don't remember if he was working nights, days or evenings, but for him that was stressful too. Therefore, many factors contributed to his experiencing a stressful situation at the automated plants where he was working and the fact of removing him from that, the fact of removing him, then at that time there were no longer any symptoms. But if they put him back, there is the chance of reappearance of... I don't know if that's clear [translation]. (My underlining.)\n[133] According to Dr. Gamache, there is no treatment, psychotherapy or drug therapy for this situation. Even if he were prescribed tranquillizers or antidepressants, it would not change anything. Only time can rectify things and remove the stress. When a person has adjustment disorder and the stress is removed, the symptoms disappear. However, in November 1998, Beauregard had been away from the automated plant since mid-September 1998, and Dr. Payne's diagnosis was still adjustment disorder.\n[134] When he examined Beauregard, Dr. Gamache said that he had no injury and that his mental state was normal. He did not see any after-effects or functional limitations because he did not have sleep, attention, concentration or mood problems. He was normal and was prepared to work, just not in the same work as before, according to Dr. Gamache.\n[135] In the section of his report entitled Nature, necessity, sufficiency or duration of care [translation], Dr. Gamache indicated nil because the stress was gone. He added that a doctor cannot suggest treatment when there are no symptoms.\n[136] A little further on in the section entitled, Existence or percentage of the worker's permanent psychological injury [translation], Dr. Gamache indicated none. In Dr. Payne's medical report from January 1, 1999, however, he had indicated that Beauregard had a 5% permanent injury. On February 26, 1999, Dr. Gamache indicated that there was none. Dr. Gamache said that he did not remember why Dr. Payne had determined that percentage. However, he added that, even if there were no permanent injury, that did not mean that Beauregard could return to the automated plants because there was still the chance of a relapse.\n[137] In cross-examination, Dr. Gamache admitted that a permanent injury is not something that goes away in a few weeks. Thus, since Dr. Payne determined that Beauregard had a permanent psychological injury and that Dr. Gamache, a month later, said that there was no permanent injury, it is obvious that either Dr. Payne was wrong or Dr. Gamache was wrong. I tend to favour Dr. Gamache's diagnosis on this point.\n[138] Then in Existence or assessment of the worker's functional limitations [translation], he concluded that the Complainant had no functional limitations from a psychiatric perspective. When Dr. Gamache examined him, his was sleeping well, his appetite was good, he was not anxious, he was well-oriented, and his affect was mobilizable. His mental examination was normal. He said that he was ready to go back to work tomorrow, he said, but at a different location [translation]. He had no symptoms.\n[139] Dr. Gamache mentioned ...it would be good if there were an administrative agreement with his employer for a change of position and work location as stipulated by his attending physician... [translation]. But he took care to add, However, I'll say it again that, from a psychological perspective, his mental state is normal and he has no functional limitations [translation]. He stated that, by administrative agreement\", he did not mean that the problem was solely administrative. What he was suggesting was a dialogue between Beauregard, his employer and his union to determine the possibility of finding him a position elsewhere, due to his adjustment disorder.\nE. Dr. G\u00e9rard Cournoyer's examination [140] Dr. G\u00e9rard Cournoyer has been a psychiatrist at Louis-H. Lafontaine Hospital for 20 years. He was not considered an expert witness and his testimony, with respect to his opinions, should be taken with reserve.\n[141] According to Dr. Cournoyer, several times in his career, he has agreed to perform psychiatric assessments. It was in this capacity that he met with Beauregard on September 25, 2000, at the request of Ms. Marie-Christine Dufour, counsel for the postal workers' union. The examination lasted two hours.\n[142] Dr. Cournoyer's task required him to issue an opinion on Beauregard's ability to return to work, taking into consideration the presence or absence of functional limitations. On September 28, 2000, he submitted his psychiatric assessment report.\n[143] The fact that Beauregard had made 240 transfer requests made a strong impression with Dr. Cournoyer. When he questioned Beauregard about this, Beauregard explained that there was nothing in the collective agreement limiting the number of transfer requests that an employee can submit. He told him that he was completely free to go anywhere because he had no spouse or children.\n[144] In cross-examination, Dr. Cournoyer stated that he had questioned him on his real reasons regarding the transfer requests.\nQ. You noted in your examination that this person's 240 transfer requests were for the purpose of going anywhere in Quebec. He told you that?\nA. Yes, because I had asked him that question since I considered it to be a lot of requests. What I wanted to find out was whether he put in those requests just for the sake of it or if it was actually possible for him to accept a job anywhere in Quebec, in French or English. He told me, `Yes. I have no preference. All I want is a full-time position and I am not married, I have no children and I am available to go.' [Translation]\n[145] However, we have seen that Beauregard spoke of changes in his personal life as justification for refusing to go to Matane. It is surprising then that he did not mention this fact to Dr. Cournoyer.\n[146] Dr. Cournoyer continued,\nIf memory serves me correctly, I don't know how... I think his bosses asked him the same question. It seems to make perfect sense to me, if someone puts in so many requests, to say `What are you doing? Are you serious? You could go anywhere?' If the person says, `Yes I am serious. I can go anywhere,' then I think they would take his requests more seriously and not think he was just putting in requests for the sake of it.\n[...]\nQ. In your opinion, in evaluating the situation that day, did you believe Mr. Beauregard when he told you, `I am available to go anywhere'? Did you believe it was in good faith?\nA. I believed him. He convinced me of that when he told me that he did not have a wife or children, which, for most people are factors limiting their choice of work (My underlining.) [Translation]\n[147] Beauregard explained to Dr. Cournoyer that, at the automated plant in St. Laurent, there were very noisy areas and that, in general, employees prefer not to work at this plant. They prefer to work elsewhere, either on the road, as a letter carrier, on the trucks, in the postal stations or even in the post offices.\n[148] However, Dr. Cournoyer did not believe that working in an environment such as the Complainant described could cause adjustment disorder, since many people work in very noisy locations and if everybody had adjustment disorder... I am not saying that it can't happen to some people, but in general, no. In my mind, noise is certainly not pleasant, but it's more likely the climate of conflict, which was the original stressor I identified, than the noise [translation]. (My underlining.)\n[149] Dr. Cournoyer's diagnosis is [that in] September 1998, Mr. Beauregard was suffering from adjustment disorder and the disorder persisted as long as he was faced with the possibility of returning to work at the automated plant [translation]. To arrive at this diagnosis, he said he used the history that Beauregard related to him and his emotional symptoms documented by Dr. Payne.\n[150] Dr. Cournoyer indicated that, in this case, there was an identifiable stressor, namely the difficult situation that the Complainant was experiencing at work. He noted that Dr. Luc Morin diagnosed an acute stress reaction and that Beauregard had anxiety symptoms and a depressed mood. According to Dr. Cournoyer these symptoms were consistent with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder.\n[151] The most significant symptom of a state of major psychological distress, according to Dr. Cournoyer, is seen in the Complainant's statement that he could no longer function normally. In his report, he wrote, on October 6, 1998, when I consulted with Dr. Allen Payne, he was not functioning normally [translation]. According to him, this is a symptom consistent with major psychological distress. If a person is sleeping poorly, does not get restorative sleep, loses his\/her appetite, has low morale, then the person is relatively depressed. If, two hours after getting up, that same person states he\/she feels so tired and feels the need to lie down again, then that, according to Dr. Cournoyer, is rather significant because the situation is preventing him\/her from functioning normally during the day. Add to that that there are stressors because this same person feels anxious at the thought of being at work, and has a slowing down of the thinking process and headaches. According to Dr. Cournoyer, Dr. Payne put Beauregard on sick leave because he could no longer function normally. He added that the severity of the clinical symptoms and the change in the person's overall functioning were the reason for the sick leave.\n[152] According to Dr. Cournoyer, describing the stress as acute refers to the fact that the symptoms manifested quickly. The symptoms recorded in the doctor's file and the facts as reported by Beauregard are, in his opinion, consistent with a diagnosis of acute stress.\n[153] Dr. Cournoyer is of the view that the Complainant had a functional limitation preventing him from working at the automated plant even though, at the time of his examination, he admitted there were no symptoms. His psychological analysis is based in the conflict situation that Beauregard said he was experiencing at work and which was making him psychologically unable to return. For Dr. Cournoyer, the stressor is the work conflict.\n[154] Dr. Cournoyer added that it is possible for people to experience conflict situations that are significant enough to cause them psychological problems and that the only way to resolve the problem is to remove them from the conflict situation. He considers it wishful thinking to believe that, from a psychological perspective, Beauregard could return to the same location with the same people, where there is a complex and unpleasant history for everyone [translation].\n[155] In his report, he said that he observed [w]hen I brought up the possibility of his returning to work one day at the automated plant, he appeared tense, anxious and he said he was getting a headache just at the thought of it [translation].\n[156] The conflict, which was the stressor according to Dr. Cournoyer, originated from the fact that Beauregard wanted a full-time position. According to the facts he related to Dr. Cournoyer, he obtained a full-time position in 1995 or 1996, but after three weeks, he was informed that, due to an administrative error, he was being transferred to another position and lost his full-time status. In the summer of 1998, he was working as a clerk in a postal station replacing employees away on vacation. When he returned to the automated plant on September 14, 1998, he said that he was not put back into the position he had before the summer in the parcel area. Instead he ended up in the letter area. However, he did not inform Dr. Cournoyer that this was a temporary position and that his assignment was to end September 5, 1998, at the latest. Since he was not happy with the work environment and preferred very much to leave the automated plant, he said that he started to fill out the transfer requests. However, Dr. Cournoyer is of the view that these facts alone are not enough to arrive at a diagnosis of adjustment disorder.\n[157] As another item in the work conflict, Dr. Cournoyer mentioned a call that the Complainant made to the Respondent's Vice-President15, which, according to Beauregard, created tension between him and his superiors. From then on, he told Dr. Cournoyer, he was targeted [translation] in his work environment by his supervisors. In addition, in September 1998, he did not feel good returning to the automated plant, in a position he did not like and where he once again had to face managers that he was already in conflict with.\n[158] Dr. Cournoyer concluded, It seems wishful thinking to me to think that this man could work normally, given the psychological stress that can result from the exceptional circumstances he was in [translation]. By exceptional circumstances\", he said he was referring to the work conflict. For an employee experiencing a conflict to call the Vice-President of the Corporation is exceptional, in Dr. Cournoyer's view; this same person putting in 240 transfer requests is also exceptional. However, there is nothing exceptional about being at an automated plant and having supervisors. There is nothing exceptional about having grievances against one's employer or personal dissatisfaction. What is exceptional here, according to Dr. Cournoyer, is the accumulation of facts in the conflict's history. The accumulation gives the impression that there was adversity in the workplace.\n[159] The adversity was caused by people, according to Dr. Cournoyer. Therefore, since we have a dilemma here and it is psychologically unbearable, and that there are people who can no longer tolerate each other, the solution is to separate the protagonists, but medically, it's not a reason for saying, `to avoid arguments, we'll call it functional limitation'. It's not right to say that [translation]. (My underlining.)\n[160] However, in his conclusion, Dr. Cournoyer added, In my opinion, Mr. Beauregard has a functional limitation for working at the automated plant [translation]. In cross-examination, in response to the question whether Beauregard could work at a another automated plant, Dr. Cournoyer answered that this question never came to mind, but that if he had asked him that question, he probably would have said that he could since, according to him, everything that had happened involved people working at a specific automated plant. Dr. Cournoyer did not seem aware of the existence of another automated plant downtown. However, Beauregard stated that he had talked to him about everything and explained that it could be that he did not specifically mention the automated plant downtown, but that he was sure he had indicated to Dr. Cournoyer that there were other automated plants in Ottawa, Quebec and Trois-Rivi\u00e8res!\n[161] Dr. Cournoyer's conclusion that the stress resulted from a work conflict is inconsistent with Beauregard's testimony, which identified the workplace as the stressor and not his supervisor(s). Since the doctor's conclusion was based on facts that Beauregard related to him, to me it appears inconsistent with the facts presented at the hearing and does not identify a conflict situation between Beauregard and his superintendent or supervisor as of September 14, 1998. It could very well be that the facts retained by Dr. Cournoyer could lead to the identification of adjustment disorder symptoms, but they still have to be consistent with what actually took place. However, I am not putting the blame for this situation on Dr. Cournoyer who, in good faith, trusted what Beauregard told him.\nF. Dr. Jacques Gagnon's assessment [162] Dr. Jacques Gagnon has been practising medicine since 1965: from 1965 to 1970 as a physician and since 1970 as a psychiatric specialist. He currently spends two thirds of his time in psychiatry. He is involved with a day hospital (HMR) where he mainly sees people with mood disorders. He has also had a career in teaching (over 25 years). He is an assistant professor of the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al clinic. He teaches to residents in psychiatry and to residents and non-residents in family medicine. He has also done administrative medicine at the Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, which is a teaching hospital. Since 1995, he has performed over a hundred assessments per year, while still maintaining a clinical component.\n[163] Dr. Gagnon qualifies as an expert witness in psychiatry.\n[164] Dr. Gagnon examined Beauregard on November 17, 2000 as part of an assessment for the Respondent. The main question Dr. Gagnon was asked was whether Beauregard had any functional limitations of a permanent psychological nature, as Dr. Cournoyer indicated. That was the first time he had met him.\n[165] Dr. Gagnon said he remembered that appointment, even though it had taken place three years earlier, since he had been one of the most difficult patients I have ever had to interview in my entire practice [translation]. Beauregard was reticent. He refused to sign the authorization for communicating the information but still agreed to have Dr. Gagnon proceed with the examination and prepare a report.\n[166] Dr. Gagnon explained that patients are sometimes reticent, but once he has explained to them the reasons for the examination and once the initial reservation passes, people usually cooperate. Dr. Gagnon said that, with Beauregard, he got the impression of treading on sensitive ground and having to make him feel as comfortable as possible and handling him very delicately in order to obtain his cooperation [translation]. Despite that, however, he managed to make the interview last almost an hour.\n[167] In the report prepared following that examination, Dr. Gagnon noted on the employee's application16, it mentioned situational depression ...and that this disorder persisted as long as he faced the possibility of returning to work at the automated plant [translation]. A little further, ...Mr. Beauregard exhibited adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood [translation]. Dr. Gagnon acknowledged that he was unable, with the information in his possession, to make a diagnosis on the Complainant's health in 1998.\n[168] However, Dr. Gagnon added that, according to him, what was causing his problem was clearly his perception of his work environment. Many of his complaints were due to the fact that he felt he was being watched by his superiors. From that he deduced that it was a harassment strategy on the part of the employer. For Dr. Gagnon, however, there was nothing unusual about the facts he related.\n[169] When Dr. Gagnon asked him what was troubling him, he answered that he had situational depression. According to Dr. Gagnon, this was obviously a learned response because the average person does not state that as a problem. Instead, people usually say they are sad or anxious or nervous, that they are sleeping poorly or have no appetite. However, it must be remembered that the Complainant had known for over a year that this was Dr. Payne's and Dr. Morin's diagnosis and he was simply repeating the information he had received from his doctors, which seems perfectly normal under the circumstances.\n[170] Dr. Gagnon said that Beauregard's answers to his questions were vague and very laconic throughout the examination.\n[171] After going over the list of symptoms identified by Dr. Payne, he mentioned that it is not enough for a person to simply state that he\/she has insomnia. It must be determined whether it is initial or terminal insomnia because they mean different things. He added that a person waking up in the night but going back to sleep afterwards is normal. Thus, to determine if someone truly has insomnia, several questions must be asked; the doctor cannot just settle for the patient saying he\/she has difficulty sleeping.\n[172] When asked about his sleeping and appetite problems, Beauregard explained that he would sometimes wake up at night and that his appetite was up and down. As for his weight, he indicated that he does not weigh himself but that he noticed that his waist was smaller by one belt hole [translation]. Regarding his mood, he talked primarily about his irritability at work, an aggressiveness that he said was controllable. He did not cry and did not appear particularly sad.\n[173] Dr. Gagnon felt that those are the questions that must be asked when looking for depression. Significant mood disturbance must be identified, either sadness or irritability. He added that if someone does not cry and does not appear sad, that greatly reduces the likelihood of it being true depression.\n[174] Dr. Gagnon said he had asked him questions about his concentration. He answered that, outside the automated plant, he was fine. According to Dr. Gagnon, people who are significantly depressed have concentration problems. If a person says that outside work he\/she can concentrate, then the lack of concentration at work does not necessarily lead to a diagnosis of depression. Other factors could explain the lack of concentration.\n[175] Dr. Gagnon also questioned him about whether he had thoughts of persecution because it may happen that a person feels watched over in the pathological sense. The person may think certain people are conspiring against him\/her, that they have something against him\/her, that they are following him\/her everywhere. That is not the case here.\n[176] He has no hallucinations or obsessions either. Dr. Gagnon indicated that people with anxiety problems sometimes have obsessive-compulsive disorder. He mentioned that these are routine questions in this type of examination.\n[177] He said that he noticed Beauregard was preoccupied with his work environment, which he considered unworthy. Which is not, according to Dr. Gagnon, an obsession in the medical sense.\n[178] Dr. Gagnon also questioned him about phobias because there are people who experience partial or total disability as a result of major phobias: specific exaggerated fears. For example, people with a phobia of heights should not be placed in a work environment where they have to work high up. In Beauregard's case, there are no phobias.\n[179] He observed that Beauregard had no delusional thoughts and no delusions of persecution. He did not have what Dr. Gagnon described as Schneiderian symptoms, in other words psychotic symptoms; no hallucinations, no obsessions and no phobias.\n[180] According to Dr. Gagnon, he was very alert. He was attentive and able to concentrate. His memory was functional, which means that, throughout the entire interview, he was in perfect command of what he was saying. The examination of his higher mental faculties showed them to be within the normal range.\n[181] Dr. Gagnon felt that his questioning was quite thorough, but that, even so, it could have been more satisfactory. It was unsatisfactory because of Beauregard's distrust and mental rigidity during the examination.\n[182] Dr. Gagnon acknowledged that anxiety attacks, thoughts of persecution, hallucinations, phobias or even obsession are not essential for a diagnosis of adjustment disorder. He added, however, that when a mental examination is performed, those questions must be asked to determine if the anxiety is the result of a more serious illness. Therefore, for an accurate adjustment disorder assessment, the more serious illnesses must be ruled out, including major depression, severe anxiety disorder, panic disorder, phobic disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders or psychoses.\n[183] For Dr. Gagnon, a person with major personality disorder is someone who, throughout their adult life, has had adjustment difficulties because of the way he\/she interacts with others. There are several prototypes of major personality disorder. Dr. Gagnon stated that, during his examination, he did not detect major personality disorder. However, he did observe some items about the Complainant's personality: coldness, distrust, and rigidity in his thinking.\n[184] He said that he questioned him about the treatment he had received. He found that he had not been prescribed any medication (Beauregard mentioned that he was against taking medication) or psychotherapy17. According to Dr. Gagnon, the accepted treatment for major depression is antidepressants, which have an anxiolytic effect. In this case, with the reported symptoms, there was no reason, according to Dr. Gagnon, to prescribe medication or any other treatment. The lack of a prescription is indicative, according to him, of the scope of the illness. If a person's illness is severe or long-lasting, it is normally expected that they will receive appropriate medical treatment.\n[185] According to Dr. Gagnon, one aspect that was a bit unusual in his examination of Beauregard was his distrustful attitude, but everything else was within the normal range.\n[186] Dr. Gagnon's examination did not reveal any active pathologies, but he still believed that there was probably a personality problem that could explain the extent of the conflict. He indicated that he said probably because he did not have all the information at hand for deciding the matter. He said that, by personality problem, he was referring to a conflict that was still unresolved. However, he indicated that he did not mean personality disorder when he spoke of personality problem.\n[187] Dr. Gagnon concluded that Beauregard did not have an active psychiatric pathology. He was in good health. It could be that he was experiencing minor adjustment difficulties, but according to Dr. Gagnon, these difficulties do not constitute illness.\n[188] Dr. Gagnon added that, when someone is cold or distrustful, it could be said that, at a minimum, they have some maladaptive traits. He added, however, that it could not necessarily be concluded that he\/she has a major personality disorder. It has to be qualified. With reserve, he believes that Beauregard exhibited some traits of a paranoid personality, which is based on distrust. People with paranoid personality disorder are afraid that people are doing things behind their back, are afraid that others are against them. However, he added that a paranoid personality does not become psychotic, in other words they are not delusional, but are very reserved, very distrusting. He said, however, that Beauregard's lack of cooperation during the examination required him to issue this opinion with reserve.\n[189] Dr. Gagnon also found that Beauregard was not open about his personal life. The only thing he brought up of any significance, according to the physician, was his feeling of indignity in his work environment. In his report, he explained that, he talked about noise-related stress, stress due to unworthy work and the aggressiveness between employees and the union [translation]. The only stressor that he brought up was his difficulty dealing with the work environment. Therefore, as soon as he would be removed from his work environment, it could be expected that his anxiety would disappear in the ensuing days and weeks.\n[190] Dr. Gagnon stated that he had difficulty with the opinion of the physicians who gave a diagnosis of adjustment disorder. They should have indicated instead that he had, at most, anticipation anxiety, anxiety related to his perception of his work environment. People generally learn to manage this anxiety, which is not an illness. With a diagnosis of chronic adjustment disorder, it is understood that the individual has ongoing disruption of his\/her sleep, appetite or functioning, which none of the physicians who examined Beauregard mentioned.\n[191] He added that when someone has anticipation anxiety, it can be due to personal preferences or difficulty managing a conflict. If there is a conflict at work, the employer should try to resolve it. However, for it to be an illness, it should be based on symptoms that would lead to such a conclusion.\n[192] According to Dr. Gagnon, the Complainant's actions should be interpreted in this case as a strong desire to go somewhere else [translation], but he added that there are mechanisms in the collective agreement that provide for these situations. This situation is not of medical competence. If a physician determines that the problem is administrative, he\/she should indicate this to the employer or the interested party, thereby turning the problem back to the company's management. It is not for the physician to decide whether someone should or should not work at a particular plant or location unless it can be demonstrated that there is a pathology.\n[193] He went on to say that in the case of an illness, if the person wishes to return to his\/her work environment, he\/she can take medication, to calm anxiety for example, or can learn from a psychologist how to handle the situation. However, if the employee does not want to return to work, it is difficult to offer the treatment and support he\/she needs.\nIII. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS REGARDING MICHEL BEAUREGARD'S CREDIBILITY AS A WITNESS [194] For much of the evidence, I had to choose between Beauregard's testimony and those of the other witnesses. I must now explain why, where the evidence conflicted, I chose the other witnesses' testimonies over Beauregard's. Without challenging his honesty in other respects, Beauregard did not seem to me at the hearing to be a credible witness. Several examples support this conclusion.\n[195] First consider the reason he gave for choosing Dr. Allen Payne as the attending physician. When counsel for the Commission interrogated him about this, the Complainant seemed to attribute his choice to chance. He was taking a family member to the Papineau subway station and said that he had noticed in his union booklet that the Polyclinique was not far. He forgot to add, however, that Dr. Payne had already treated him in 1997 for epicondylitis in his right elbow and for situational depression. When counsel for the Respondent questioned him about this, he said that he did not remember that.\n[196] He also testified that the first time he heard about situational depression was in October 1998. However, we have just seen that this is the diagnosis Dr. Payne made in 1997 as well.\n[197] Another example: on November 25, 1998, the Respondent offered him an assignment to Matane. He first stated that he had never filled out a transfer request for Matane. When informed that he had indeed filled out such a request on May 16, 1997, he responded that it was no longer valid because, according to the collective agreement, a transfer request is valid for only one year. He then added that, at that time, there were changes in his personal life and he therefore did not want to accept a transfer outside of Montreal. He also mentioned that several other factors have to be considered before accepting a transfer and that he was not actually required to accept any.\n[198] This response is surprising to say the least, given his statements to Dr. G\u00e9rard Cournoyer that he was free to go where he wanted since he had no wife or children, that he was prepared to go anywhere to get away from the automated plant. If that was the case, then why did he turn down the offer of an assignment to Matane? Why did he not refer to this offer during his visit with Dr. Cournoyer? Why did he not tell Dr. Cournoyer about the changes in his personal life?\n[199] As to the 240 transfer requests, he first said that he had forgotten about these transfer requests because they were only good for a year and had not kept them. He then added that he could not say whether the figure 240 was right or whether it was he or Dr. Cournoyer who came up with that figure.\n[200] In reaction to Dr. Cournoyer's statement in his testimony that he was not aware of another plant downtown, he first stated that he had talked to him about it. He then added that he may not have specifically mentioned the automated plant downtown, but that he was sure he had indicated to Dr. Cournoyer that there were other automated plants in Ottawa, Quebec and Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.\n[201] There are inconsistencies with several other points in his testimony, but I will not go through a detailed list. I will also pass over the continuing confusion regarding the dates of receipt of the mail that the Respondent sent to him. I do wish to make one comment, however, namely that I was surprised by the Complainant's attitude. Although it was true, according to the regulations, that he had fifteen days to pick up the letters, was it not in his best interest to do so as soon as possible and to cooperate with the Respondent so that the situation could be dealt with as quickly as possible?\nIV. THE LAW [202] Before dealing with the issues raised by the Act, I would like to address a preliminary issue submitted by counsel for the Respondent that the grievance arbitrator, Mr. R. Blouin, had already inquired into the same issue. As a result, the Respondent submitted that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction for deciding this case. A close reading of the two decisions rendered by arbitrator Blouin shows that the grievances he was asked to decide do not raise issues of discrimination or allegations of human rights violations, and the arbitrator did not in fact deal with issues of this type. The issues submitted to the arbitrator and those that I am called upon to decide in this case are very different. I consequently dismiss the Respondent's preliminary issue without further ado.\n[203] Mr. Beauregard's complaint was submitted pursuant to section 7 of the Act, which stipulates that it is a discriminatory practice to differentiate adversely in the course of a person's employment on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[204] According to section 3 of the Act, disability is a prohibited ground. Section 25 indicates that disability includes mental disability. The first issue I will respond to, then, is whether Beauregard had, at the relevant time in this case, a mental disability, and therefore a disability within the meaning of the Act.\n[205] In a case of this nature, it is the Complainant's responsibility to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.18 If a prima facie case is established, the onus shifts to the Respondent to provide a reasonable explanation for the conduct in issue.19\n[206] A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made, and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in favour of the Complainant in the absence of an answer from the Respondent.20 The allegations made by the Complainant must be credible to justify the claim that a prima facie case has been established.21\nV. ANALYSIS [207] In this case, the Commission and the Complainant have not successfully established a prima facie case of discrimination because I am not satisfied that they have established that the Complainant has a disability.\n[208] The conclusion I have reached in this case does not question the possibility that an adjustment disorder can, in the right circumstances, be a sufficient disability within the meaning of the Act22. The Act does not contain a list of acceptable and unacceptable mental disabilities. It is not just the most serious or most severe mental disabilities that are entitled to remedy under the Act. Additionally, it is not solely those that result in a permanent injury that must be considered. Where appropriate, even mental disabilities described as minor with no permanent injuries could be entitled to remedy under the Act. However, sufficient evidence still needs to be presented to support the existence of the disability.\n[209] In most cases, the issue of whether there is a disability is not disputed. In this case, however, the Respondent submitted that the Complainant does not have a disability.\n[210] Beauregard claimed that, on September 14, 1998, he sustained an injury while at work.23 He said that, as a result, he was off work from October 1, 1998 until December 17, 1998. His attending physician for a CSST claim diagnosed situational depression that left him with permanent functional limitations, specifically that he could no longer work on the night shift at either of the Respondent's two plants in Montreal: the one downtown and the one in St. Laurent. As far as the Commission and the Complainant are concerned, this condition constitutes a disability within the meaning of the Act.\n[211] The Complainant also claimed that by ordering him to return to work on December 9, 1998, and terminating his employment on December 16, 1998 for refusing to return to work, the Respondent is in violation of section 7 of the Act.\n[212] The Respondent submitted that the Complainant does not have a disability within the meaning of the Act and that it therefore did not engage in a discriminatory practice towards him.\n[213] There is no doubt that adjustment disorder with anxio-depressive mood or even situational or reactive depression are psychological pathologies that can result in a disability within the meaning of the Act.\n[214] However, I agree with the Respondent's statement that it is not enough for a physician to state that a person has this condition to acknowledge automatically that it exists. Evidence still needs to be presented to the Tribunal in support of the traits specific to this pathology and that leads to the conclusion that the illness exists.\n[215] What, according to the evidence submitted to the Tribunal, are the traits specific to adjustment disorder with anxio-depressive mood? To answer this question, we must first acknowledge that any pathology has symptoms and a cause.\n[216] The evidence presented at the hearing showed that the following are symptoms of adjustment disorder with anxio-depressive mood24: loss of appetite, weight loss, loss of sleep, sad mood, loss of concentration, and stress.\n[217] Only Dr. Payne, Dr. Morin and Dr. Gu\u00e9rin examined the Complainant at a time contemporaneous with the events. In his medical reports, Dr. Payne did not mention any symptoms. Moreover, he acknowledged that the Complainant had come to see him for a sinus problem and that he had said By the way, Doctor, I don't feel well, etc. [translation]. He added that the sinus problem was not connected with the Complainant's psychological state. In a note written on June 8, 1999, he noticed in his entry for October 6, 1998, wakefulness at night, no recovery, poor appetite, low morale ... since his transfer to the plant on 14-09-98 [translation]. However, he does not give any details about the symptoms. Dr. Gamache, who saw the Complainant after the events, stated that he was unable to identify any symptoms in Dr. Payne's reports. In his short note, Dr. Morin did not identify any symptoms either. And Dr. Gu\u00e9rin, after conducting his examination, concluded that, in the Complainant's case, there were no active pathologies.\n[218] None of them reported any sadness in the Complainant. As to the loss of sleep, there was very little detail, if any. Dr. Payne stated that the Complainant's thoughts seemed slow, whereas Dr. Gu\u00e9rin stated that he found him normal in this respect. There was no evidence of loss of concentration.\n[219] All the experts and psychiatrists testified that adjustment disorder symptoms usually disappear when the stressor disappears. Yet Dr. Payne indicated that the Complainant still showed signs of anxio-depressive mood in November 1998, more than a month after he stopped working. If that is case, the situation seems to me to be more serious than first diagnosed and should require a more aggressive medical treatment, yet no treatment was prescribed. Moreover, Dr. Payne's conclusion in November is surprising to say the least since, at the Complainant's first visit, the alleged depression was so minor, according to his testimony, that he prescribed a return to work the next day.\n[220] In Chamberlin quoted by the Commission, the Complainant in that case had also been diagnosed by his physician as having adjustment disorder. The symptoms and causes are described in paragraph 11 and 12 of that decision. In that case, where the facts appear to describe a more severe situation than the one in this instance, the attending physician had prescribed two to four weeks leave and a reassessment at the end of that period to determine whether the Complainant was fit to return to work. We can conclude from this that if the situation had been serious, Dr. Payne would have prescribed a longer leave and that since he considered that one day was sufficient, he must have considered the depression minor, if anything.\n[221] Dr. Payne's diagnoses must be taken with some reserve, from a facts perspective. By his own admission, the Complainant's examinations at the Polyclinique had to be done rather quickly because there were many patients waiting. The Polyclinique handles an industrial quantity [translation] of CSST cases, to use Dr. Payne's expression. None of the appointments with the Complainant exceeded 10 or 15 minutes. Some lasted only 2 to 5 minutes and a medical report was issued without an examination. Dr. Payne admitted that some of the comments in his diagnoses were suggested to him by the Complainant, including the outside of the two plants [translation] restriction, the reference to a section in the collective agreement, and the night shift restriction. I also notice that there remains the unexplained issue regarding the annotation on the employer and employee copies of the medical report from October 6, 1998 that does not appear on the physician's copy. He acknowledged that he made some mistakes on other medical reports. Finally, he admitted that the Complainant's problem is primarily administrative and somewhat medical [translation].\n[222] I conclude from this that, in the fall of 1998, there was no evidence that the Complainant had symptoms of adjustment disorder with anxio-depressive mood or any other psychiatric symptoms and as such there is no disability within the meaning of the Act.\n[223] Nevertheless, I will now discuss the evidence presented that would explain the causes of the Complainant's alleged condition, in case my conclusion regarding the symptoms proves to be incorrect. There are many causes of adjustment disorder with anxio-depressive mood.25 The expert witnesses all testified that, for adjustment disorder to be triggered, there needs to be a stressor.\n[224] Dr. Cournoyer testified that the Complainant's workplace can not be considered a stressor. Dr. Gu\u00e9rin agreed when he indicated that the type of location where the Complainant works cannot in itself create the type of pathology that is alleged here.\n[225] What Dr. Cournoyer considered as the stressor was the work conflict. However, upon reading the history of the conflict, as related by Dr. Cournoyer in his report, we cannot help but notice that he used a version of the facts that diverges on several points from the version the Tribunal heard. In this case, either Dr. Cournoyer was misled or the Tribunal was misled.\n[226] Dr. Cournoyer, in good faith, developed his medical opinion using those facts. Among other things, he was convinced that, when the Complainant left his position on September 15, 1998, he was surrounded by supervisors that were harassing and watching over him. However, the evidence, uncontradicted at the hearing, showed that, before September 15, R\u00e9al Caron did not know the Complainant and that he had never had to work with him. In addition, no evidence was submitted describing the events from September 14, 1998 onwards, which would lead me to the same conclusions as Dr. Cournoyer's in this regard.\n[227] In addition, the Complainant did not explain to Dr. Cournoyer why, on September 14, 1998, he had to report to the LPP on the night shift and not the BPP, creating the impression that the employer was being arbitrary in its treatment of him, whereas the facts show that his temporary assignment at the BPP had ended.\n[228] Neither did the Complainant consider it necessary to inform Dr. Cournoyer of the second Montreal plant like the one in St. Laurent. When informed of this situation at the hearing, Dr. Cournoyer acknowledged that the Complainant could work at the other plant because there was no reason to believe that the conflict with the supervisors at the St. Laurent plant - the stressor - would move to the other plant.\n[229] Dr. Gamache, who stated that he found no adjustment disorder symptoms in Dr. Payne's medical reports, said that, for his examination, he relied on the facts as told to him by the Complainant and concluded that the stressor was a labour relations problem. In his report, he wrote that the problems began on September 14, 1998, when the Respondent ordered the Complainant to return to work at the automated plants as a letter clerk. Once again, the Complainant did not explain the circumstances surrounding this situation as they were related to the Tribunal. Dr. Gamache then produced examples the Complainant had given him of situations which, as of that date, demonstrated that the employer was using pressure tactics on him. Only one of these examples was produced at the hearing. In addition, the evidence showed that only one of these events could have occurred after September 14, 1998. Only one, the last event that Dr. Gamache mentioned, occurred after September 14, 1998: he was even told, he mentioned to me, with supporting evidence, that his supervisor told him that if he did not do it that way (his work), they would `kick his ass' out the door [translation]. R\u00e9al Caron did not deny using the words they would kick his ass out the door\", but states that he said it to Ren\u00e9e D'Amours, on October 7, 1998, in the evening when he was waiting to meet with the Complainant to discuss the medical report the employer had just received. In addition, it should be remembered that Gagnon, the union representative, had heard these remarks, which he surprisingly wrote at the bottom of his minutes from the meeting of December 1, 1998. In any event, the remarks were never said directly to the Complainant who, moreover, was not at the October 7 meeting.\n[230] In Dr. Gamache's view, then, the problems started on September 14, and it was from the facts as related to him by the Complainant that he had, in good faith, prepared his medical report.\n[231] Therefore, Dr. Payne, Dr. Cournoyer and Dr. Gamache all had the impression that, in September 1998, there was a work conflict between the Complainant and his supervisor(s), which was the event - the stressor - that justified a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with anxio-depressive mood.\n[232] The Complainant himself testified that his problems started at the LPP in St. Laurent on September 14, 1998. Yet in a letter to France Villeneuve of the CSST on December 9, 1998, in which he said he detailed the facts about what caused his situational depression, there was no significant facts for the period between September 15 and October 1 and definitely no facts demonstrating that there was a conflict with his supervisor(s) at the LPP. In addition, the names of R\u00e9al Caron, his superintendent, and Ren\u00e9e D'Amours, his supervisor, did not appear in this period.\n[233] In assessing the evidence presented to me, I have to conclude that the alleged stressor or alleged cause of the pathology is a work conflict at the LPP in St. Laurent. However, there is no evidence before me that enables me to determine whether the work conflict is real or perceived. The evidence does not enable me to conclude that the alleged stressor exists to warrant psychological stress and therefore a disability within the meaning of the Act.\n[234] I am convinced that the Complainant is unhappy at a job he does not like and that he finds degrading [translation], to use his own expression. For him the plant is a source of frustration and job dissatisfaction. However, that does not justify the conclusion of a disability within the meaning of the Act.\nVI. DISPOSITION [235] As a result of the foregoing, Michel Beauregard's complaint under section 7 of the Act is dismissed.\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nJanuary 28, 2004\n1The St. Laurent plant is physically divided into three units: the administrative unit; the West depot, which is a letter carrier depot, and inside the plant is another unit with two functions, one for processing letters (LPP) and the other for processing parcels (BPP, known today as the PPP).\n1The LPP is organized into several work areas: the manual area, the automated area, the shipping area and the international area. At the BPP, there is the admail area, the receiving and distribution area and the oversized area. For parcels, there is also an area called priority courier which was set up in 1997.\n1The BPP and the LPP are physically separated by a cement wall that has about five doors. The LPP is about 500 feet by 672 feet, and the BPP is about 800 feet by 672 feet. There are conveyors and a parcel-sorting machine in the BPP. The noise is louder there. There is automation in the LPP as well, but it is different than in the BPP.\n1As to the organization of work, LPP employees look after mail that is collected from mailboxes and mail dropped off right at the plant. The employees essentially prepare and process the mail for delivery. Some employees manually process letters; others, the coders, are trained to process mail using machines. There are also multi-line optical character readers or bar code sorting machines that speed up mail processing.\n1As to the bulk or parcel processing plant (BPP), trucks transport the parcels, which are then processed for shipping. The work is less automated. The employees' work is more physical. There are also clerks in the oversize parcel area who process over-sized parcels. At the loading docks, shippers load and unload the trucks.\n1The work at the BPP and the LPP is organized into three shifts: the day shift from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.; the evening shift from 3:30 to 11:30 p.m. and the night shift from 11:30 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. The evening shift has between 125 and 150 employees. Each shift has superintendents. There are also supervisors under the superintendents. Superintendents and supervisors are assigned either to the LPP or the BPP. Above the superintendents in the hierarchy are managers: two at the LPP and two at the BPP. At the top of the hierarchy is the director.\n2 For a letter sent by priority post with signature, the letter carrier must go to the recipient's home and obtain his\/her signature before handing him\/her the letter. If the recipient is not at home, a card is left in his\/her mailbox stating where the letter can be picked up.\n3Canada Post's items delivered bill indicated that Beauregard took delivery of this letter on October 29th, not the 28th. Beauregard stated that the date on the bill was incorrect. However, Danielle Billod, the employee at the Canada Post retail outlet at the Bachir convenience store in Anjou, where Beauregard would pick up his mail, testified that he insisted that she fill out the document in front of him so he could ensure there were no mistakes. The complainant stated that, when he went to pick up the letter at the retail postal outlet, he did not remember if there was another letter there for him. Ms. Billod stated that when he would come to pick up his mail, the complainant did not necessarily take all the mail that was addressed to him; he would just take the information, saying he would come by again later. It would sometimes happen that he would take some envelopes and leave others.\n3\n4Regarding the ways the employer could contact him, Beauregard testified that he did not want anyone calling him at home because the number belonged to his father and that the latter did not like to receive calls. He also added that he uses his cell phone for personal calls but had not authorized the employer to contact him at that number. He added that if the employer wanted to reach him, it should do so in writing. According to him, the best way to contact him was by priority post without signature. In this case, the letter was delivered the next day to the mailbox at his home.\n4\n5However, according to Canada Post's priority courier tracking and tracing system\", this letter was delivered on October 26, 1998.\n6Beauregard's testimony is vague, to say the least, with respect to the number of transfer requests he prepared. On one hand, he stated that he might have put in between 20 and 40 transfer requests per year. In cross-examination, he said he no longer knew whether it was he or Dr. Cournoyer who spoke of 240 transfer requests. He stated that he did not have the transfer requests with him at the time of that visit, only a blank form as an example. A little further on, he said that he filled out these requests about 40 per week, over a period of 6 weeks. On the other hand, he talks about 40 requests per day, in 6 days. If we look at the impressive number of transfer requests presented as evidence during the hearing, they are all dated May 16, 1997.\n7No evidence of this appointment was presented at the hearing other than Beauregard's conclusion that Ms. Daigle had arrived at the same diagnosis as Dr. Payne did, namely that there should be a change in workplace.\n7\n854.02 Work Reintegration for Employees in Groups 1, 3, 4, and 5. Where an employee has become physically handicapped because of:\n8(a) a compensable injury; or\n8(b) non-compensable health reasons, and the need for assignment is supported by a certificate issued by a qualified medical doctor, upon written application he or she may be assigned to any vacant position in his or her group. Where such a position is described by the provisions of section 43, the first assignment shall be made only for the period required for applying that section. However, if the employee accepts appointments in the assigned classification, he or she shall be deemed to belong to the assigned classification and the normal rules of seniority shall apply.\n8\n9Canadian Union of Postal Workers v. Canada Post Corporation (Beauregard's grievance, STTP 350-95-18617, Blouin, arbitrator), [2001] D.A.T.C. no. 645.\n10On December 29, 1998, the CSST informed him that it could not accept his claim because it did not involve an occupational injury. According to the CSST, the case did not lead to the conclusion that there had been an unforeseen and sudden event. As a result, compensation would not be paid. In a letter dated March 10, 1999, France Villeneuve of the CSST stated that the diagnosis was adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, code 309.21. According to the CSST, this did not result in a permanent injury. A little further on, it found that, given the date of consolidation of the injury and the lack of functional limitations, Beauregard was able to perform his duties.\n11The disciplinary action that the Respondent took against Beauregard and the discharge were the subject of two labour arbitration rulings. In an initial decision on July 21, 2000, (Canadian Union of Postal Workers v. Canada Post Corporation (Beauregard's grievance, STTP 350-95-18617, Blouin, arbitrator), [2000] D.A.T.C. no. 467), the grievance arbitrator, R. Blouin, ruled that the discharge and disciplinary action against him were unjust. He ordered that he be reinstated and that the disciplinary letters be deleted from his record. However, the arbitrator indicated that he would retain jurisdiction on any problems that may arise from the enforcement of his decision. In a second decision dated September 7, 2001 (Canadian Union of Postal Workers v. Canada Post Corporation (Beauregard's grievance, STTP 350-95-18617, Blouin, arbitrator), [2001] D.A.T.C. no. 645) dealing with the redeployment request and the issue of the quantum of damages, the arbitrator ruled, on the first issue, that the stressor was the work conflict at the automated plant and that it could be a personality conflict. He added that he did not have evidence of a work conflict. He noted that the issue was that Beauregard felt he was being watched over, but he stated that there was no evidence for verifying whether this was perceived or real. In the end, he found that the evidence did not lead him to the conclusion that the existence of the alleged stressor justified psychological stress. Therefore, the request for redeployment under section 54 was not justified. The application for the quantum of damages is also closely linked with the redeployment issue and since the latter was unjustified, the arbitrator found that Beauregard could not justify a monetary claim on it. In addition, since the employer considered him to be on unpaid sick leave and since he had no more sick leave credits, he could not claim for this item either.\n12The initial medical certificate is a CSST document in quintuplicate. Copies 1 and 2 go to the CSST, copy 3 is the physician's copy, copy 4 is for the worker, and copy 5 goes to the employer. The worker gives copy 5 to the employer.\n13During this visit, Dr. Payne prescribed Flonase for him, a sinus medication. The Complainant was not opposed to the prescription, but he appears not to have taken the medication, nor to have gone for the X-ray. The sinus problem seems to have improved on its own.\n14R.S.Q., c. S-2.1.\n15On April 28, 1998, Beauregard telephoned Mr. Blanchette, the Respondent's Vice-President, to inform him of some grievances.\n16He acknowledged that this was poorly worded. Instead he should have said the employee's form.\n17He did not mention his appointment with the psychologist.\n18Ontario Human Rights Commission v.

Expenses\nD. Interest\n[1] The Complainant, Maurice Bressette, alleges that the Respondent, the Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, did not hire him because he was not related to the Band's Chief. He claims that this refusal constitutes discrimination on the basis of his family status, in contravention of s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] The complaint was filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) on March 30, 2002. On January 15, 2004, the Tribunal granted the Complainant's motion to amend his complaint to include an additional allegation of retaliation under s. 14.1 of the Act. He asserts that he was the victim of numerous incidents of reprisal on the part of the Respondent following the filing of his complaint.\n[3] The Complainant acted on his own behalf at the hearing. The Respondent was represented by legal counsel. The Commission opted to not appear at the hearing.\nI. FACTS A. Facts Relating to the Section 7 Allegations [4] The Complainant is a member of the Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council (Band). The Band's reserve is located northeast of Sarnia, Ontario. Many members of this community have the same family names although they are only distantly related to each other, if at all. In the case at hand, the Complainant and the Chief, Tom Bressette, bear identical last names but they are not related to one another.\n[5] The Complainant holds a Certificate from Lambton College's Human Services Foundation Program, which he completed in 1997. As part of his training, the Complainant was assigned to work within the Band's social services department for about six months. His functions included assisting the Band's social services administrator, performing clerical duties, and meeting with the department's clients.\n[6] In April 2000, the Complainant followed up his certificate with a Diploma from the same college in its Social Service Worker Program. The training for this program also provided for a six-month co-operative work assignment, which he completed within the Band. The Complainant was posted to the Family and Community Development Program operating within the Band's health centre. His duties included making observations regarding the centre's clients, preparing their case files, and providing them with referrals. In addition, he helped set up a drop-in centre for people with substance abuse problems.\n[7] In October 2000, the Band hired the Complainant as a casual employee assigned to work within the Children's and Family Services Program. He assisted in the preparation of case files and in the organization of events such as Christmas festivities, community dinners and fundraising activities. He joined the Band's youth worker on home visits to children who were on supervised care with family members. He also occasionally accompanied the program's workers when they were required to attend court hearings. Whenever time allowed, the Complainant took the opportunity to review some of the material available at the office regarding Ontario's Child and Family Services Act. His term was scheduled to conclude at the end of December 2000 but it was renewed for two more months. A second renewal was not offered and his employment came to a close at the end of February 2001.\n[8] In July 2001, the Respondent announced a competition for the full-time position of family caseworker\", under the auspices of the Children's and Family Services Program. The job's duties included the development of an individualized casework plan to assist children and families in receipt of family support services that are delivered in the home. The successful applicant was required to have a good familiarity with the culture and attitudes of native people, as well as knowledge and experience in administrative procedures and report writing. Excellent interpersonal and communication skills were also called for, in addition to an understanding of all applicable legislation. The successful candidate had to possess a valid driver's licence and a vehicle. All applicants were required to provide criminal reference checks.\n[9] The Complainant sent in his letter of application for the position on July 20, 2001. He was one of five candidates who were invited shortly thereafter to an interview conducted by Laura Wilde (a Band elder), Sharon Henry (the coordinator of the Children's and Family Services Program) and Robert Bressette (a member of the Band Council). The interviewers were provided with a set of questions and possible answers, which had been prepared in advance. The candidates were asked to explain, amongst other things, the level of their involvement within the community, their opinion on the role of the Children's & Family Services Program in the community, and the obligation of a family caseworker in law to report child abuse.\n[10] The Complainant was not given any news about the outcome of the competition for several months following the interview. In November 2001, Stan Sabourin, the Band administrator at the time, told the Complainant that the Band's Finance Committee and the Council were still dealing with the matter. In February 2002, the Complainant finally learned that he had not been selected. Some weeks later, he came to know that Eva Bressette, Chief Tom Bressette's sister, had been transferred internally into the position.\n[11] Eva Bressette had worked for the Band since 1994. Most recently, she had been officially employed as the Band Representative. Her duties consisted of representing the Band's interests in child welfare proceedings before the courts. Her office was located within the Children's & Family Services Building in which the Complainant had also worked as a casual employee.\n[12] The Complainant believed that Ms. Bressette lacked the proper qualifications for the position. He found out, for instance, that at the time of her transfer, Ms. Bressette's driver's licence had been suspended and that she did not possess a vehicle. Yet, according to the statement of qualifications for the position, both were required.\n[13] The Complainant suspected that Ms. Bressette was hired because she was the Chief's sister, prompting him to file the complaint that is before this Tribunal. It appears that when the Complainant signed his complaint, he was of the belief that Ms. Bressette had participated in the same competition. However, the evidence at the hearing revealed that this was not the case - she had not applied for the position in connection with this competition.\n[14] Of those individuals who had in fact applied, five were screened into the interview phase of assessment, including the Complainant. The interview panel ultimately decided to recommend Deborah Herman as its first choice to the Band Council, and Dorothy French as an alternate. Neither candidate was related to Chief Bressette nor, for that matter, to any of the interview panel members. When the panel's recommendation came before the Band Council some time later, however, it was rejected. The Band Council determined that neither Ms. Herman nor Ms. French possessed the requisite background and qualifications for the caseworker position. As a result, the post remained vacant.\n[15] During the same period, the Band's Finance Committee realized that some serious problems had developed regarding the Band's finances. The Band was facing a fairly large accumulated deficit combined with a significant diminishment in its cash flow. The Finance Committee sought to develop a deficit reduction strategy that would at the same time eliminate the cash flow problem. It was in the context of dealing with this financial predicament that Mr. Sabourin raised the possibility of transferring employees internally to maximize the utilization of available government funding.\n[16] He had observed that the funding for the Band Representative's position came from the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada and was intended to compensate a workload of up to 20 hours per week. Ms. Bressette was in fact working well beyond this level. Aside from her Band Representative duties, which themselves exceeded 20 hours per week, she performed several tasks within the Children's and Family Services Department, including many that were ordinarily executed by a caseworker, for which she was being paid from the Band's general funds. The Band had also engaged the full-time services of in-house general counsel, Jonathon George. He was being paid from the Band's general funds as well. Meanwhile, the funding from the Ontario Government for the family caseworker's position was being left untapped due to the job's ongoing vacancy.\n[17] Typically, both Mr. George and Ms. Bressette were in attendance at all court proceedings relating to child and family services, each in their respective capacities as Band counsel and Band Representative. Mr. Sabourin proposed that Mr. George assume both functions. A portion of Mr. George's salary as in-house legal counsel would thus be paid from the Federal Government's funding of the Band Representative's position. Ms. Bressette, in turn, would be transferred internally to the vacant caseworker's post. In this way, her entire full-time salary would be paid from the provincial funding scheme. Her work would include many of the functions that she had already been performing, for which she was previously being paid from the Band's own funds, as well as any additional tasks arising from the formal caseworker's position. Thus, the Band could maintain the services of in-house legal counsel and a Band Representative, while gaining the services of a family caseworker and reducing overall spending from its general funds.\n[18] The Band's Finance Committee agreed with the recommendation when the matter came before it at a meeting held on February 6, 2002. The Complainant raised some concerns at the hearing about this Finance Committee meeting. Chief Bressette was not formally a member of this committee. However, the minutes document his arrival just after the meeting was called to order and the agenda approved. It is noted that Chief Bressette provided the committee with an update on several matters. There is no specific mention of his having left the session prior to the question of his sister's internal transfer coming up for discussion later that evening. The Complainant contends that the Chief remained present and influenced the decision taken by the Committee. He also points out that the Committee may have lacked quorum when the decision regarding the caseworker position was taken.\n[19] The Finance Committee's recommendation came before a meeting of the Band Council on March 21, 2002. The Band Council approved the transfer, effective the same day, the minutes noting that the position was budgeted for. Chief Bressette was not present at this session as he was away on business. In accordance with the Band's decision, Ms. Bressette assumed the functions of the family caseworker position and Mr. George took over her duties as Band Representative.\nB. Facts Relating to the Allegation of Retaliation (s. 14.1 of the Act) [20] The Complainant filed his human rights complaint on March 30, 2002. In June of the same year, he was elected as a member of the Band Council. He alleges that since his election, he has been singled out and treated in a differential manner by the Band Council, and Chief Bressette in particular, in retaliation for his having filed the human rights complaint.\n[21] On July 8, 2002, the Band Council conducted its first meeting following the election. Councillors were required to take an oath of confidentiality according to which they undertook to not disclose any information gained by reason of their official duties. The Complainant declined to take his oath claiming that he wanted to study its terms and consider its implications before doing so. He eventually swore his oath one month later. The Complainant claims that his initial refusal provoked a negative reaction from the Chief during the meeting. In criticizing the Complainant, Chief Bressette berated him for having brought a lawsuit against his sister, Eva Bressette. An argument ensued in public until the Chief decided to call an in camera session, during which he continued accusing the Complainant of bringing lawsuits against the Band. It is important to mention here that at the time, there existed an outstanding complaint filed by the Complainant's spouse against the Band under the Canada Labour Code regarding her employment as a teacher in the Band's school. Beginning in mid-2001, the Complainant had sent numerous letters of complaint to the Band Council regarding her claim, and he had circulated several notices within the community criticizing the Band about this matter.\n[22] The Complainant takes issue with the criticism he faced for having initially resisted taking the oath of confidentiality. Another Band Council member, Ron George, had still not taken his oath by the time he testified at the hearing into this complaint, in April 2004. Mr. George explained that his frequent business travel resulted in his being absent on the occasions when the Justice of the Peace was available to administer the oath. Nevertheless, it is common ground that Mr. George has never been criticized for having failed to take his oath and he has been allowed to participate in in camera sessions of Council meetings.\n[23] In September 2002, the Band Council held a post-election orientation workshop during which councillors identified the committees in which they would prefer to participate. The Complainant and two other councillors requested membership on the Finance and Personnel Committee. At the next Band Council meeting, however, the Complainant was removed from the list and only the other two individuals were retained. The Complainant contends that the removal was made in retaliation for his having filed his human rights complaint against the Band. On the other hand, Lorraine George testified that only two councillors could be designated to sit on this committee, according to the committee's terms of reference. The other two nominees were chosen because of their prior experience on the committee. Ms. George maintained that the Complainant's human rights complaint against the Band had no bearing whatsoever on Council's decision.\n[24] The Complainant alleges that in February 2003, he was unjustifiably denied a copy of the Ron Commons Report\", a study commissioned by Council into the activities of the Band's board of education. Council took the position that the Complainant could not view the document because it contained confidential information about the Band's position regarding his spouse's Canada Labour Code claim. The Complainant objected to this stance arguing that as he had by then taken his oath of confidentiality, he could be entrusted with the information contained in the document. The Band Council maintained its position and the document was never communicated to the Complainant.\n[25] During the Band Council meeting of June 28, 2003, an in camera session was called to discuss the Complainant's human rights complaint. He was asked to step out of the meeting for reasons of conflict of interest, and he willingly complied. However, he objected to the fact that Chief Bressette and several other relatives of Eva Bressette were allowed to remain. The Complainant contends that since his complaint centres around Ms. Bressette's appointment, all of her relatives sitting on the Band Council were in conflict of interest and should have been asked to withdraw from the room, not just he.\n[26] The Complainant invokes a series of events, which commenced at the Band Council meeting of November 24, 2003, as additional indicia of the retaliatory treatment to which he was being subjected. Shortly after the meeting was called to order, Chief Bressette brought forth an issue regarding the confidentiality of some Council proceedings. He explained that certain information that had come before Council in confidence had somehow been released to persons outside Council. It was clear that Chief Bressette was pointing to the Complainant as being the source of the leak. The Chief then left the meeting room to allow debate on the matter to occur. In the ensuing discussion, the Complainant engaged in what the minutes describe as a belligerent exchange with other Councillors, to the point that the Chairperson advised him that if he did not immediately correct his behaviour, the police would be called to escort him out of the room. Things apparently calmed down thereafter and Chief Bressette returned to the meeting. The minutes record that after some further discussion, all parties agreed (including the Complainant and Chief Bressette) that an independent inquiry, headed possibly by the local Justice of the Peace, be established to look into the charges.\n[27] Council apparently also decided at this time to arrange for a special meeting in the following days to discuss how the inquiry would be conducted. According to Faye Jackson, who recorded the minutes, and Lorraine George, the Band Administrator, it was understood by all that the Complainant and Chief Bressette would not be invited to this organizational meeting, although no mention of this was entered in the minutes. The Complainant denies ever having agreed to not being present. In any event, Ms. George set November 26th as the date for this second meeting, to which Ms. Jackson called and invited all of the Councillors except the Complainant. The Chief was telephoned and informed of the date of the meeting but he was told that he was not to attend. The Complainant did not receive a similar call and he only learned of the meeting from other sources. He was incensed at not being invited and presented himself at the November 26th meeting nonetheless. The minutes record that he showed up with angry feelings at not having been invited, but that Band Council decided at this point to let him sit in on the meeting. The Band Council later formally apologized to both Chief Bressette and the Complainant for not having properly informed them that the meeting was to take place without their presence.\n[28] One of the conclusions reached during the November 26th meeting, according to the minutes, was that Council would no longer tolerate listening to the discord between Chief Bressette and the Complainant, and that attempts should be made to resolve the conflict. The Complainant contends that Council mistreated him over the course of these two late-November meetings and that this mistreatment came about at least in part because of his human rights complaint.\n[29] On November 27th, six Councillors signed a letter addressed to the Complainant informing him of their disapproval of his conduct, noting specifically certain comments made by him about Chief Bressette and another Council member during the November 24th meeting.\n[30] In early December 2003, the Band Council released an open notice to the community. The communiqu\u00e9 was said to be in answer to a letter and a bulletin that had recently been distributed throughout the community, criticizing Council for its secrecy regarding two pending legal actions against the Band, including one that had been taken by the Complainant's brother, Miles Bressette. The Band Council explained in its reply notice that details about both claims were being kept confidential so as not to prejudice the Band's position. However, the document also stated that Maurice Bressette, who is an elected member of Council and who authored at least one of the referenced letters released to the community, also has a Human Rights Claim against the First Nation. The notice went on to say that this fact, together with the Complainant's ongoing interest in obtaining more details about the other legal claims against the Band, were hampering the Council's ability to conduct business in an open, transparent manner. The Complainant claims that this charge was made in retaliation to his human rights complaint.\n[31] The Complainant alleges other incidents of differential and retaliatory treatment on account of his human rights complaint. At the same November 24th Band Council meeting referred to above, a motion was passed designating him and Peter B. Cloud as delegates to the Southern First Nations Secretariat's Annual General Assembly to be held a few days later in London, Ontario. Yet, in a follow-up letter sent to the Secretariat by the Band Council's Executive Assistant, Faye Jackson, the Complainant is not identified as a representative to the General Assembly, his name having been replaced by that of another councillor. Ms. Jackson testified that while she had no specific recollection of how this change came about, ordinarily Council resolutions could only be modified in either of two ways: by a subsequent resolution, which had not occurred in the present instance, or as a result of a specific direction from the Chief.\n[32] On March 11, 2004, the Band Council convened a special Task Force meeting to deal with certain comments made to the media by a councillor regarding an important community issue. It appears that all but two members of Council were invited to this meeting - Ron George and the Complainant. Ms. Jackson testified that she would have called Mr. George but did not do so because she knew he was away on business. Thus, it was only the Complainant who was not specifically invited. He contends that he was again being singled out due to his having filed a human rights complaint against the Band. For her part, Ms. Jackson explained that the decision not to call the Complainant was hers alone. Chief Bressette had simply instructed her to notify all senior Council members about this meeting. Since the Complainant was in his initial term as a councillor, having been first elected in 2002, she did not include him in this list. However, another councillor, Maynard (Sam) D. George, who was also not a sitting member of Council when he was elected in 2002, was invited. Ms. Jackson testified that what distinguished Mr. George from the Complainant was that he had served on Council in a previous term several years prior and as such, she perceived him as being a senior member.\nII. LEGAL FRAMEWORK [33] It is a discriminatory practice under s. 7 of the Act to refuse to employ an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination. For the purposes of the Act, a person's family status constitutes a prohibited ground of discrimination (s. 3). It is also a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the complainant (s. 14.1).\n[34] The burden of proof is on a complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination - in other words, a case at first glance. According to the Supreme Court of Canada, in Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at para. 28, a prima facie case in this context is one that covers the allegations made and which, if the allegations are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour, in the absence of an answer from the respondent. Once the prima facie case is established, the onus then shifts to the respondent to provide a reasonable explanation for the otherwise discriminatory behaviour. If a reasonable explanation is given, it is up to the complainant to demonstrate that the explanation is merely a pretext for discrimination (see Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (No. 1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 at para. 38474 (C.H.R.T.); Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204 at paras. 17-23).\n[35] The Federal Court of Appeal noted, in Holden v. Canadian National Railway Company (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 at para. 7, that discriminatory considerations need not be the sole reason for the actions at issue in order for the complaint to be substantiated. It is sufficient that the discrimination be one of the factors in the employer's decision.\n[36] In relation to employment, two tests have emerged to assist a tribunal in the determination of whether a prima facie case of discrimination has been established. The first was articulated in the case of Shakes v. Rex Pak Ltd., (1981), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001 at para. 8918 (Ont. Bd. Inq.). The Ontario Board of Inquiry held that a prima facie case could be established by proving:\nthat the complainant was qualified for the particular employment; that the complainant was not hired; and that someone no better qualified but lacking the distinguishing feature, which is the gravamen of the human rights complaint, subsequently obtained the position.\n[37] In Israeli v. Canadian Human Rights Commission, ((1983), 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1616 at 1618 (C.H.R.T.), aff'd (1984), 5 C.H.R.R. D\/2147 (C.H.R.T.- Rev. Trib.)), the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal developed a second test to address situations where the complainant is qualified but is not hired, and the employer then continues to look for a suitable candidate. In such cases, a prima facie case may be established by demonstrating:\nthat the complainant belongs to one of the designated groups under the Act; that the complainant applied and was qualified for a job that the employer wished to fill; that, although qualified, the complainant was rejected; and that, thereafter, the employer continued to seek applicants with the complainant's qualifications.\n[38] While the Shakes and Israeli tests serve as useful guides, neither test should be automatically applied in a rigid or arbitrary fashion in every hiring case (see Singh v. Canada (Statistics Canada) (1998), 34 C.H.R.R. D\/203 at para. 161 (C.H.R.T.), aff'd [2000] F.C.J. No. 417 (F.C.T.D.) (QL); Premakumar v. Air Canada, [2002] C.H.R.D. at para 77 (C.H.R.T.) (QL)). The circumstances of each case should be considered to determine if the application of either of the tests, in whole or in part, is appropriate.\nIII. ANALYSIS A. Section 7 complaint (i) Prima facie case [39] Depending on one's interpretation of the facts in this case, either of the above noted tests might apply. On the one hand, based on the description set out in the complaint, the Shakes test would seem appropriate. The Complainant claims that he was qualified for the position, that he was not hired and that Eva Bressette, the Chief's sister, obtained the position even though she was no better qualified, if not entirely lacking in some of the qualifications required for the job.\n[40] On the other hand, the evidence is that no one was hired into the position at the close of the competition process. The candidates recommended by the interview panel to Band Council (Deborah Herman and Dorothy French) were not hired because they were not deemed to be fully qualified. The position remained vacant for a time, until the decision was made to hire Eva Bressette, who had not participated in the initial competition. It can thus be said that the employer continued to seek applicants, as contemplated by the Israeli test.\n[41] I am not persuaded that the Complainant has made out a prima facie case of discrimination under either test. Both approaches require the Complainant to demonstrate that he was qualified for the family caseworker position. The evidence indicates that he was not.\n[42] The Complainant alleged in his complaint that he met all of the posted requirements of the position. It is true that he apparently satisfied all the necessary criteria to be screened into the interview stage of the assessment process. After interviewing him, however, the interview panel determined that he was not sufficiently qualified to justify referring his candidacy to the Band Council. As events would unfold, even the two candidates whose names were put forward were ultimately deemed unqualified by Council. No evidence was introduced to indicate that the panel's decision was biased or influenced by Chief Bressette, nor that either of the candidates recommended ahead of him were related to the Chief.\n[43] If one were even to assume that the Complainant was qualified for the job, the decision to not hire him was not made by the Respondent. It was made by the interview panel, a decision that, as I just stated, was not affected or influenced by the Complainant's family status. It cannot be said that someone lacking the distinguishing feature was selected instead of the Complainant, for in fact both of the recommended candidates, Deborah Herman and Dorothy French, possessed the same distinguishing feature as the Complainant - they were not related to Chief Bressette.\n[44] Even when the Shakes\/Israeli tests are not relied upon, I am not persuaded that a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of the Complainant's family status can be made out. Quite frankly, there is no evidence to support, even at first glance, the contention that the Complainant was discriminated against. The Band Council appointed Eva Bressette months after the interview panel determined that the Complainant's candidacy was simply not strong enough to even forward his name to Band Council for consideration. Indeed, if the decision to appoint Ms. Bressette was in any way influenced by her relationship to the Chief, the appropriate persons to file a complaint would have been Deborah Herman or Dorothy French, for it was their candidacies that were rejected by the Band Council, not the Complainant's.\n[45] Were I to have concluded that the Complainant had made out a prima facie case, his complaint would still not be substantiated. Transfering Eva Bressette into the then still vacant caseworker position was a sound financial and human resource management decision. The explanation provided was reasonable and no evidence was tendered to bring that into doubt.\n[46] I do not find the question raised by the Complaint about Ms. Bressette's qualifications (namely, her failure to possess a vehicle and a valid driver's licence at the time of her transfer) to be indicative of a pretextual explanation. The evidence is that existing employees who held valid licences when they were first hired were not asked to show proof that they had maintained their licences thereafter, it was simply assumed. Only new employees were required to show proof thereof. Lorraine George, the Band Administrator, testified that as soon as she learned of Ms. Bressette's lapsed licence, in November 2002, the employee was instructed to rectify the situation forthwith, failing which disciplinary measures would be taken. Ms. Bressette complied with the order immediately and produced evidence of her renewed licence to the employer. As for the question of the vehicle, it appears that on the occasions when Ms. Bressette was required to travel outside the office, she had made arrangements with other employees for transportation. In other words, she was able to fulfill all of her employment duties despite her suspended licence and lack of a personal vehicle. In any event, it appears that she has since acquired a vehicle of her own. Neither of these issues have convinced me that the explanation given for opting to transfer Ms. Bressette into the caseworker position was pretextual.\n[47] For all these reasons, I find that the s. 7 portion of the complaint is not substantiated.\nB. Section 14.1 complaint [48] Section 14.1 of the Act makes it a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a human rights complaint has been filed to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the person who filed the complaint. The parties did not refer me to any authorities specifically related to this issue. The matter was, however, dealt with at length by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in the case of Wong v. Royal Bank of Canada, [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 11 at paras. 213-229 (QL). The Tribunal stated that s. 14.1 should not be interpreted as requiring a complainant to prove an intention to retaliate, nor should the provision be viewed as different in operation from those sections in the Act that confer rights. The Tribunal noted that this is in keeping with the Supreme Court's statement in Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84, that the Act is remedial in nature, not punitive, and that therefore, the motives or intention of those who discriminate are not central to the concerns of the Act.\n[49] The decision in Wong is consistent with the conclusions of the Ontario Board of Inquiry in Entrop v. Imperial Oil Ltd. (No. 7), (1995) 23 C.H.R.R. D\/213, regarding a similarly worded provision prohibiting reprisals under Ontario's Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990, c. H-19. The Board held that even if a complainant reasonably perceived the impugned conduct by the respondent to be in retaliation to the human rights complaint, this could also amount to retaliation, quite apart from any proven intention of the respondent. However, as noted in Wong, the reasonableness of the complainant's perception must be measured. Respondents should not be held accountable for any unreasonable anxiety or undue reaction of complainants.\n[50] In the present case, I have determined that at least some of the incidents raised by the Complainant were retaliatory and prohibited under s. 14.1 of the Act.\n[51] There is no doubt that there exists a long-standing animosity between the Complainant and his family on the one hand, and the Chief and Council on the other. The Complainant's spouse had filed an employment-related complaint that had put her at odds with Council, which had still not been resolved when the Complainant was elected to Council. The Complainant's brother had also been in litigation with the Band. The Complainant had advocated on their behalf within the community in a vocal and, at least in the eyes of the Chief and some councillors, abrasive manner. Politically, the Complainant stood unquestionably in opposition to the Chief and other members of Council.\n[52] In this context, it can be difficult to discern whether certain incidents regarding the Complainant arose simply as a result of this ongoing conflict, or whether they were linked to his human rights complaint. Even so, I am prepared to accept that a prima facie case of retaliation was established in relation to each occasion on which the Complainant was treated differently than the other councillors. Without any explanation, it would be reasonable to perceive the human rights complaint as at least one of the factors in the differential treatment.\n[53] The Respondent provided several explanations, most of which were rooted in the acrimony and political disagreements that prevailed between the Complainant and the Chief. For instance, the Band contends that the issues raised relating to the meetings of November 24 and 26, 2003, in Council chambers, were of the Complainant's own doing, namely, the release by him of confidential information and his belligerent attitude during the meeting. This explanation is consistent with the evidence of several witnesses who were present, some of whom later wrote him a letter expressing their disapproval of his conduct. In fact, even members of the Band Council's staff found it necessary, on December 3, 2003, to file a report about the Complainant's aggressive behaviour, alleging in particular that he had been very confrontational when attending the Band's offices.\n[54] In all of the circumstances, I do not believe that the Complainant's human rights complaint was a factor in his not being invited to the November 26th follow-up meeting. It is significant that the Chief was not invited either. I am convinced that there was some misunderstanding regarding who was to be present at the second meeting, a misunderstanding for which the Band Council ultimately apologized to both the Complainant and Chief Bressette.\n[55] I am equally not persuaded that retaliation was a factor in denying the Complainant access to the Ron Commons Report. Whether or not he had taken his oath of confidentiality, I find it perfectly reasonable for Council to have felt it inappropriate for him to be made aware of Band strategy regarding its pending litigation against his own spouse. Similarly, I find the Respondent's explanation for not excluding the Chief from the June 28, 2003, in camera meeting that dealt with the Complainant's human rights complaint, to be reasonable. The complaint named the Band Council as Respondent, not the Chief. Although he was identified at the source of the alleged discrimination, it seems logical and fair for the Respondent to be able to consult with him about the allegations. After all, the Band Council was not acting as a neutral arbitrator in the matter, it was a named respondent to the complaint and it had no duty to deal at arm's length with both the Complainant and the Chief. I see no reason to consider any of these explanations as mere pretexts for otherwise discriminatory conduct.\n[56] I also accept as reasonable and not pretextual the explanation given regarding the allegedly disparate treatment afforded to Ron George and the Complainant, regarding the oath of confidentiality. There is a clear and justifiable distinction to be drawn between the two councillors. The Complainant initially refused to take the oath outright, whereas Mr. George was simply unavailable to take the oath. The respective situations are therefore quite different.\n[57] I also see no reason to dismiss Lorraine George's explanation regarding the composition of the Finance and Personnel Committee. It was perfectly reasonable for Council to appoint councillors who were more experienced than the Complainant to sit on one of its most important committees.\n[58] This all having been said, there were other alleged incidents of retaliation where I am not convinced of the reasonableness of the explanations advanced by the Respondent. At the first Council meeting of the new session, held on July 8, 2002, Chief Bressette's concern regarding the Complainant's failure to swear an oath of confidentiality may have been well founded. But, rather than deal exclusively with this problem, he reacted by also singling out the Complainant for having filed a human rights complaint against the Band. No evidence was adduced to contradict the Complainant's version of events at this first meeting. The notice that the Band Council circulated in December 2003 raises a similar issue. Council was clearly upset with the letter and bulletin that had just been distributed throughout the community, criticizing its activities. I am satisfied on the evidence that the Complainant was likely involved in the preparation and distribution of at least one of these documents. A reply by Band Council was certainly justified, but Council chose to go beyond merely setting out its position on the questions raised. It asserted that the reason why Council was no longer able to function in an open manner was in part because the Complainant had filed a human rights complaint - in effect, putting the blame on his shoulders, merely because he had exercised his right to file a complaint under the Act.\n[59] It is reasonable to perceive such differential treatment as being in retaliation for having filed a human rights complaint. Complainants who find themselves singled out in this manner may develop an unwillingness to proceed with their complaints. This is precisely the mischief that s. 14.1 seeks to cure or prevent. It is important for complainants to remain confident that they can exercise and enforce their human rights without fear of suffering any prejudicial consequences thereafter.\n[60] At roughly the same time that Council was publishing these remarks about the Complainant, his designation as a delegate to the Southern First Nations Secretariat's Annual General Assembly was mysteriously revoked. The Respondent provided no explanation, but the clear implication from Ms. Jackson's testimony was that this reversal could only have come about through some intervention by the Chief. When the Task Force meeting was convened about four months later, in March 2004, the Complainant was the only councillor not invited. The explanation given was that the meeting was organized for senior Council members only, and it was Ms. Jackson who determined which members met this criterion. I do not doubt that she followed these instructions dutifully and in good faith. Indeed, her assessment that the Complainant was effectively the only non-senior member appears sound. It is precisely because of this fact that one may wonder whether the instructions provided to her were intended to have the effect of excluding the Complainant. In any event, whether or not such intent actually existed, a reasonable person would perceive this exclusion as well as the decision to revoke his delegate status as forms of reprisal against him. The reprisals may be linked to the many conflicts that existed between the Complainant and the Chief and Council, but one of those disagreements related to the filing of his human rights complaint. In light of the other comments made by the Chief and Band Council with regard to the complaint, it would be reasonable to perceive that the pending human rights claim was at least one of the factors in these particular acts of retaliation.\n[61] In sum, I am satisfied that the Complainant's perceptions of retaliation were reasonable, as they relate to the particular incidents referenced above. Considering the acrimonious relations that prevailed between the Complainant and Chief Bressette on a whole range of issues unrelated to the complaint, I am not persuaded that the Respondent intended to retaliate against the Complainant because of the human rights complaint. After all, the Complainant had filed a complaint against a public institution that is accountable to its constituents, the members of the Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council. It is understandable for Chief and Council to openly discuss any legal actions pending against the Band. But the manner with which the Chief and Council raised the issue in some instances created a reasonable perception of retaliation. The Complainant's claim under s.14.1 of the Act has therefore been substantiated.\nIV. REMEDY A. Compensation for pain and suffering (s. 53(2) e)) [62] The Complainant seeks compensation for the pain and suffering he experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice (s. 53(2) e)). The Complainant testified about the stress he has endured since the competition for the caseworker position. The Complainant associates most of this stress with the lost employment opportunity and the ensuing loss of a good steady income. This put a financial strain on him and his family. However, I have already determined that discrimination was not a factor in his failure to secure the caseworker's position. Consequently, no compensation is to be awarded for any pain and suffering regarding this stress.\n[63] Most of the pain and suffering that the Complainant attributes to acts of retaliation is in fact related to incidents that I have concluded are not associated with any form of retaliation, such as the disruptions that occurred during the November 24th Council Meeting.\n[64] In my view, the few specific incidents that I have determined to be retaliatory have had but a modest effect on the Complainant. In these circumstances, an award to the Complainant of $2,000.00 for pain and suffering is justified (s. 53(2) e)).\nB. Special Compensation (s. 53(3)) [65] Section 53(3) of the Act provides that the Tribunal can award special compensation to the victim where a respondent has engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly. I have not found evidence to support the claim that the Respondent intended to retaliate against the Complainant for filing his complaint. I have merely concluded that it was reasonable for the Complainant to perceive certain aspects of the Respondent's conduct as retaliatory. It has not been established therefore that the Respondent wilfully discriminated against the Complainant.\n[66] Did the Respondent act recklessly? That is, did the Chief and Council know of the risk that their conduct would be perceived as retaliatory, and yet choose to proceed nonetheless? In my view, the evidence does not support this proposition. The Respondent's decision to deal with the Complainant's active political opposition by openly referring to his human rights complaint and by resorting to treating him differently from other councillors may have been ill-advised, but not reckless as contemplated in s. 53(3).\n[67] The Complainant's claim for special compensation under s. 53(3) of the Act is therefore denied.\nC. Expenses [68] The Complainant seeks compensation for the following expenses incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice (s. 53(2) c)):\na) Witness fees: Many of the witnesses summoned by the Complainant to testify at the hearing were Band employees or councillors, or were otherwise closely associated with Band Council. At the request of Respondent Counsel, I issued an order obliging the Complainant to pay conduct fees at a specified rate to any witness who so requested. Since only the s. 14.1 portion of his complaint has been substantiated, I order the Respondent to reimburse the Complainant any fees paid to the following witnesses, whose evidence had some bearing on the issue of retaliation:\nFaye Jackson Chief Tom Bressette Ron George David Henry Robert Bressette Peter Cloud Lorraine George\nb) Photocopying and other stationery costs: Under the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure, parties are required to disclose material facts and documents to one another in advance of the hearing, and to produce in multiple copies all exhibits entered into evidence. The Complainant testified that he had to rely on the services of an office supplies retailer located in Sarnia to prepare this documentation, at a total cost of $300. He also alleges that his numerous visits to the retailer cost him about $300 in travelling costs. Unfortunately, the Complainant was unable to produce receipts in support of this claim but the extensive use of photocopying services is apparent from the record and it is common ground that his residence, situated on the Band's reserve, is about 50 km from Sarnia. I therefore accept the Complainant's evidence that his total expenses in this regard were about $600. However, considering that only the s. 14.1 aspect of his complaint has been substantiated, I order the Respondent to pay the Complainant one half of these expenses, ie. $300.\nc) Time spent: The Complainant is claiming $8,000 in compensation for the time he put into the endeavour of preparing his case. A similar claim was dealt with by the Federal Court - Trial Division in Attorney General of Canada v. Lambie (1996), 29 C.H.R.R. D\/483. The complainant in that case was seeking a sum for leave and time spent to develop and prepare his complaint. The Court rejected the claim, noting that the word expense is not broad enough to cover such claims and that in any event, these expenses are to be compensated only in exceptional circumstances. There were no exceptional circumstances present here, particularly in connection with the case of retaliation, which was the only portion of the complaint to be substantiated. The claim is therefore dismissed.\nD. Interest [69] Simple interest shall be paid on all monetary awards made in this decision. The interest shall be calculated on a yearly basis at a rate equivalent to the Bank Rate (Monthly Series) set by the Bank of Canada, and shall be payable from the date when the complaint was amended to add the allegation of retaliation, January 15, 2004.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

INTRODUCTION [1] The Complainant is a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. On March 14, 2001 she filed a complaint with the Human Rights Commission alleging that the force had discriminated against her under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act on the basis of sex and family status, by treating me differently with respect to the terms and conditions of my employment. The allegation arose out of the Complainant's application for a promotion. The complaint was later amended to include an allegation under section 10.\n[2] A hearing was held in Vancouver in August and September 2003. The Commission did not participate in the hearing, other than to provide a general sketch of the existing law. It will be apparent that I have consulted its statement of key principles, along with the written submissions for the Complainant and Respondent, in preparing the following reasons.\nII. FACTS [3] Corporal Brown is a member of the RCMP. She is married to Corporal Colin Brown, another member of the force. She submits that she was passed over in favor of other candidates because of her sex and marital status. The Respondent does not dispute the fundamental allegation and merely argues that it was reasonable to consider her marital status in the promotional process. It states that sex was not a consideration.\nA. The promotional process [4] It may be helpful to review the promotional process in the RCMP before dealing with the specific facts of the present case. Staff Sergeant Mitchell, the special advisor to the Career Management Unit advised the Tribunal that the RCMP has used three different systems of promotion. The original system of promotions was based on a review of personnel files. An officer seeking a promotion would apply to a promotion board, which dealt with applications on an individual basis.\n[5] This system was replaced with the cycle system, which was based on the publication of lists of available postings. These lists were sent to interested members, who would apply for a promotion by submitting a list of their preferred postings. The third system, predictably, was a synthesis of the two previous systems.\n[6] Staff Sergeant Wills was the Staff Relations Representative. This was an elected full time position. He testified that members who criticized the first system would have called it an old boys network. By the mid-eighties, there were complaints that the system was unfair. It was generally agreed that the process should shift its focus from managerial supervision to core competencies. The idea was to rid the system of any biases.\n[7] The cycle system was implemented in 1994. The word cycle refers to a distinct process of promotional offers that takes place every two years. There were 4 cycles. There were problems however, maintaining the schedule set by the cycle system. The third cycle should have ended on March 31, 2000 and was well behind. Apparently there was a computer problem. Cycle 4 had already started and was also behind schedule. It was a frantic time.\n[8] There were additional concerns. The promotional cycles that were held in the spring of 2000 were the last cycles before the implementation of a new promotions system. This was a pressing concern because the rules for the new system had not been established and the next round of promotions would not be completed for some time. The Career Management Unit was looking at a void.\n[9] It follows that there was a lot of pressure on Staffing and Personnel. Inspector Donovan testified that the Career Management Unit was over budget and had to obtain permission to go with the last lists. Transfers presented an additional problem. Each move cost the RCMP an average of 36 thousand dollars and there wasn't enough money to pay for all the moves. Staff Sgt. Mitchell's instructions were to go ahead with the promotions, but in a financially responsible manner.\n[10] There were other pressures. The promotional process in the RCMP is handled on a divisional basis. The British Columbia Command is known as E Division. The Division was seriously understaffed and was trying to keep as many members working as possible at the time. There was also a problem recruiting members for promotions in the lower mainland. This was apparently a reflection of the cost of living in the area.\nB. The Offering in March 2000 [11] The promotional offering for E Division in March 2000 was sent to 200 officers. There were approximately 60 corporal's positions. The members applying for a position were placed on a promotion list. This list ranked the candidates on the basis of a combine score calculated on the basis of the candidate's performance report, a test, and the candidate's seniority. There was a second round of promotions because a number of corporals were promoted to sergeant, leaving vacancies at the corporal's rank. The candidates were advised that a member who refused a posting that she had requested would be struck from the promotion's list.\n[12] The Career Management Unit in E Division was run by Superintendent Schlecker. There were two inspectors under him. One of them was Inspector Donovan, who was in charge of the promotional process. Staff Sgt. Mitchell reported to Insp. Donovan and had immediate custody of the process. It was Staff Sgt. Mitchell's responsibility to vet the lists and make recommendations to his superiors. These recommendations were reviewed by Insp. Donovan and approved by Supt. Schlecker. The Superintendent had the final say in the matter.\n[13] Staff Sgt. Mitchell testified that he started with the most highly ranked candidate, placed that candidate and moved down the list. Some positions required specific qualifications. Once a candidate met the qualifications however, that there was no reason not to appoint them. After the list of promotions had been approved by his superiors, he would contact each member's supervisor, to see if there was any reason not to give her the selected posting.\nC. Cpl. Brown's Application [14] The Complainant had written the Corporal's exam in 1997. She scored in the top 10 percent but did not apply for a promotion. She had other matters to deal with and in 1999, her father became terminally ill. She requested a compassionate transfer to Saskatchewan, so that she could be close to her father. Although she was placed on a humanitarian list, she was denied the transfer.\n[15] Corporal Brown's Career Management Officer was Sergeant Kimoto. He had been in Staffing and Personnel since 1993. He advised Cpl. Brown to participate in the promotional cycle for 2000, since it was probably the last. Cpl. Brown accordingly applied for a number of postings within driving range of Calgary, where her father was occasionally hospitalized. Although this has little bearing on the legalities of the situation, it explains a good deal of her response to subsequent events.\n[16] Cpl. Brown was ranked 47 on the list of candidates and applied for 37 postions, in order of preference. Her first five preferences were Columbia Valley, Whistler, Gibson's Landing, Prince George, and a detective's position in Coquitlam. She wanted the position in the Columbia Valley because it was 4 hours from Calgary. She listed a general duty posting in Coquitlam as her 17th choice. I am inclined to think that the senior managers in Staffing and Personnel felt that she was ranked too highly, since that would go a long ways in explaining what followed.\n[17] There is no doubt that Cpl. Brown made a mistake in applying for too many positions, some of which were of little interest to her. I think this showed a lack of confidence that inevitably became a factor in the decisions made by the Career Management Unit. There is some truth to the suggestion that she did not seem to know what she wanted. Sgt. Kimoto thought she was wide open for positions in the lower mainland.\n[18] Cpl. Brown and her husband, Colin Brown, were nevertheless concerned that management would simply leave her in Coquitlam, if she included it in her preferences. They accordingly spoke to Sgt. Chris Deevy, officer in the Career Management Unit, who assured them that there wouldn't be any leap-frogging. Colin Brown checked this with Staff Sgt. Mitchell and felt confident that a lower ranking officer would not be given a position ahead of his wife.\n[19] Sgt. Deevy testified that Cpl. Brown phoned him on May 3, 2000 and asked him a question of the following nature: If I'm the first qualified candidate for a position, would I receive that position? He simply said yes. This became a pivotal event in what followed. The reality is that Cpl. Brown relied far too heavily on the advice of Sgt. Deevy and Constable Lou, another Staffing officer, who simply encouraged Cpl. Brown to put down as many postions as possible. It is notable that Sgt. Deevy would not provide the same advice today.\n[20] Much of the evidence at the hearing focused on the ranking of candidates. Staff Sgt. Kimoto believed that the person who was ranked higher would normally be given the posting, as long as that person met the required qualifications. He nevertheless acknowledged that the Career Management Unit had discretion under 134(4)(d)(1) of the Career Manual to award a posting to another applicant. He stated that this section had been invoked from time to time, prior to the Brown case.\nD. The First Round of Promotions [21] Insp. Donovan and Staff Sgt. Mitchell described the first round of promotions. Staff Sgt. Mitchell provided Insp. Donovan with a list of the candidates, in the order they were ranked matching each candidate with the promotion that he was proposing. They went through the list together. When they got to Corporal Brown, who was 47th on the list, they worked through her choices, one by one. Although the Complainant was the highest-ranking candidate for at least five of her earlier preferences, Staff Sgt. Mitchell recommended that she be given a general duty posting in Coquitlam, her 17th choice. Insp. Donovan had no difficulty with the recommendation, which was later confirmed by Supt. Schlecker.\n[22] Columbia Valley was the Complainant's second choice. Staff Sgt. Mitchell and Insp. Donovan both gave evidence that the posting was given to someone else because it was not possible to find a position for her husband. There was an issue of cost transfers. When a transfer of over 40 kilometers is made, it triggers the relocation process, which costs something in the range of 28 to 40 thousand dollars. The problem with moving someone with a spouse is that management would have to move them a second time, if no posting for the spouse became available. It was the second cost transfer that concerned the Management Unit.\n[23] The Management Unit was concerned that they would not be able to find a position for Cpl. Brown's husband, if his wife was transferred to a small detachment. This was a general staffing problem in small detachments, where the rules apparently prevent the force from posting family members together. At the back of this reasoning, there was the fact that it was far more convenient to leave both of the Browns in the lower mainland.\n[24] The requests for a posting in Columbia, Gibson's Landing, Whistler and Prince George were rejected for much the same reasons. There was no specific strategy to limit the cost transfers. It was simply done on a case-by-case basis. If it was possible to keep someone where they were, they would keep them there. The evidence was that the Management Unit was working within dire financial constraints at the time. They were under orders to keep costs to a minimum.\n[25] Staff Sgt. Mitchell candidly acknowledged that Cpl. Brown had listed too many choices. If she would have only listed the Columbia Valley posting, he testified that she would have been awarded that position. This is because the Career Management Unit would have had no choice in the matter. She was entitled to a promotion. It was only because she had listed her other preferences that she was awarded another posting.\n[26] On March 14, Staff Sgt. Mitchell sent an email to the Complainant advising her of the recommendation that she be promoted on site to Coquitlam. This would leave her husband where he was. Cpl. Brown was surprised, since she felt that she was entitled to a posting if she was the highest ranking candidate who had applied for it.\nE. Intervening Events [27] Cpl. Brown and her husband met with Staff Sgt. Mitchell the following day. He confirmed that she had been ranked number one for the Invermere posting. He also informed them that they were concerned about finding another posting for her husband. They then spoke to Supt. Schlecker. They wanted to resolve the matter before the official list went out and it was too late to change things.\n[28] Supt. Schlecker gave them a number of reasons for the decision to leave Cpl. Brown in Coquitlam. One was cost. Another was their spousal situation. He stated that it was prudent to leave them in Coquitlam. Cpl. Brown's husband responded by requesting leave without pay. Supt. Schlecker was unwilling to consider it. The meeting lasted for about an hour. Supt. Schlecker agreed to discuss the matter with his staff but was firmly of the view that Coquitlam was a good place to work.\n[29] After the meeting with Cpl. Brown and her husband Supt. Schlecker met with Staff Sgt. Mitchell and Insp. Donovan. Sgt. Kimoto may have been present. Supt. Schlecker told them that Cpl. Brown and her husband were unhappy. They discussed the matter and decided that it wasn't feasible to change the decision. The most fundamental issue was the Complainant's husband. There were no other corporal's positions in the area and it didn't make sense to give her the Columbia Valley posting, since that only meant that they would have to relocate her husband at a later date. This would require another cost transfer.\n[30] I do not believe that gender entered into the discussion. There was a discussion about giving the Complainant's husband leave without pay. The problem was that this would merely delay the problem of finding a position for her husband and present transfer costs at a later date. I feel obliged to add that this kind of ad hoc solution to the problem, which circumvents the formal staffing process, would have been inappropriate.\n[31] I think it is clear from the circumstances that there was another consideration that entered into the matter. The consensus was that the decision had already been made and there was no going back. It would have had an impact on too many other decisions. There was an email waiting for the Browns when they returned to Coquitlam, saying that the Complainant would be posted on site. Cpl. Brown and her husband were angry and disappointed. They felt that the process had betrayed them.\nF. Staff Sgt. Wills [32] The exact chronology of events is not completely clear to me. Cpl. Brown and her husband also discussed the matter with Staff Sgt. Wills, their Staff Representative. Staff Sgt. Wills told them that there were positions for the Complainant's husband sufficiently close to Whistler, Gibson's and Prince George to give her any of these posting. He testified that there were five Corporal's postings within a one hour drive from Invermere.\n[33] Staff Sgt. Wills knew Sgt. Kallin, the Commander in charge of the Columbia Valley detachment. He accordingly phoned Sgt. Kallin to find out what the responsibilities would be. Sgt. Kallin said that he didn't want any more females. Staff Sgt. Wills said: Ed, you can't talk like that. Sgt. Kallin said that he didn't care. He had already had two maternity leaves, which left him under-staffed, and he didn't want any more. He didn't want to work any more nights. The problem was that there was no mechanism in place at the time to replace a member on maternity leave. This left many detachments understaffed.\n[34] Staff Sgt. Wills recounted the conversation with Sgt. Kallin to Cpl. Brown, who naturally came to the conclusion that this explained what had happened. As I understand it, this conversation was also relayed to Staff Sgt. Mitchell, who mentioned it to his superiors. The evidence is nonetheless clear that the Management Unit had no contact with anyone at Columbia Valley and I do not accept that Sgt. Kallin's views entered into the matter. Sgt. Kimoto testified that the receiving detachment commander has very little say in determining who would be promoted into a detachment.\n[35] Staff Sgt. Wills met with Staff Sgt. Mitchell to discuss the situation. The two men went through Cpl. Brown's preferences one by one. Staff Sgt. Wills stated that Columbia Valley was available. Staff Sgt. Mitchell replied that there were issues because of her husband. There was only one Corporal's position. Staff Sgt. Wills told Staff Sgt. Mitchell that he didn't think Cpl. Brown was welcome in Columbia Valley. This was a reference to Sgt. Kallin's comments.\n[36] There was a discussion of the detective's position in Coquitlam. That posting was available, Staff Sgt. Wills said, and Cpl. Brown was qualified for the position. Why couldn't she have that? Staff Sgt. Mitchell said that she wasn't GI material. Staff Sgt. Wills demurred stating that she had experience in the investigation of serious offences of the person. Her performance evaluations were satisfactory. There was a similar discussion of the other postings.\n[37] They discussed cost transfers. Staff Sgt. Wills pointed out that the person who got the Ridge Meadows position was a cost transfer. The person who got Coquitlam GIS was a cost transfer. This was also true of Columbia Valley. Staff Sgt. Wills accepted that there was a spousal issue with respect to Columbia Valley. But this was not properly explored, in his view, and could have been dealt with in a number of ways. One of the possibilities was to give the Complainant's husband leave.\n[38] It was a wide-ranging discussion. The two men disagreed about whether it was difficult to accommodate Cpl. Brown's husband in Whistler. Staff Sgt. Wills felt that she could have been given one of the Prince George postings. It was a huge detachment. There would have been something like 15 Corporals in the detachment, plus the Corporals in the district headquarters. So why couldn't her husband have been accommodated there?\n[39] Staff Sgt. Wills was unhappy with the answers he was getting. By his count, Cpl. Brown was passed over 7 times. The two men discussed her qualifications. Staff Sgt. Mitchell agreed that she was a hard-working, competent young officer. So Staff Sgt. Wills wanted to know why they weren't willing to accommodate her? Staff Sgt. Mitchell said something like: She is all over the map. She hasn't got a clue what she's doing. Staff Sgt. Wills stated that he was taking the matter over Staff Sgt. Mitchell's head.\n[40] Staff Sgt. Wills met with Supt. Schlecker about a week later. He wanted a rationale for what happened, something that makes sense of it all. Supt. Schlecker simply kept saying that he had to make the hard choices. When pressed, he relied on section 134(4)(d)(1) of the Career Management Manual. Staff Sgt. Wills testified that he has not seen another case where this section was relied upon.\nG. The Second Round of Promotions [41] Nothing came of the efforts made by Staff Sgt. Wills. Cpl. Brown refused to accept the Coquitlam GD position and withdrew her name from the promotional process. Management took the position that she was refusing a promotion. They then relented and allowed her to participate in the second round of promotions, which was needed to fill the vacancies created by any Corporals who had been promoted to Sergeant. This can be taken as some recognition by the Career Management Unit that the original process had gone awry.\n[42] I do not feel that this round of promotions has much bearing on the case before me. Cpl. Brown feels that she should have been given a posting in drugs. Her previous career was in traffic, community policing and community development however. Constable Lou was familiar with her personnel file and had no recollection of anything that would indicate she had the necessary investigative experience for GIS or drugs. Sgt. Kimoto could not recall her having major investigative experience and did not feel that her experience in the area of drug offences was significant.\n[43] The decision that Cpl. Brown did not have the qualifications for a drug posting is reasonable and is certainly sufficient to withstand scrutiny. I see nothing unfair in the manner that the competition was conducted and I suspect that the allegations that arose in this context reflect the continuing deterioration in the relations between the parties. The real problem in my view is that there were not enough vacancies to provide Cpl. Brown with a satisfactory posting.\nH. Sick Leave [44] At the end of the second round of promotions, Cpl. Brown was offered a Corporal's position in the Burnaby detachment. She was formally promoted on the day she arrived at the detachment and signed her A22A transfer report. This was on April 12th, 2001. The following day, she reported sick. The Respondent suggested that this was deliberate. If she had taken sick leave on April 6 rather than April 13, she would have received a Constable's salary.\n[45] I would prefer to think that Cpl. Brown had come into the new position with mixed feelings and discovered that she could not face her responsibilities. On the stand, Cpl. Brown testified that she went to her doctor, Susan Buchan, and told her that she couldn't go back to work unless things changed. She was experiencing migraines and having dizzy spells. She was also concerned about her father. Dr. Bowman, the regional psychologist from the force, subsequently contacted her. He referred Cpl. Brown to Dr. Hannah, another psychologist. Dr. Hannah thought it was a good idea that she visit her father. So she spent the summer in Saskatchewan on sick leave.\n[46] I do not propose to go into the medical evidence at any length, which is sufficient to establish that Cpl. Brown was in considerable distress. Corporal Brown had a lengthy history of migraines and some previous psychological problems. Some of her depression had to do with her father's illness. I nevertheless believe that Cpl. Brown's feelings with respect to her employment were very simple. She found herself unable to return to work without an acknowledgement from the force that she had been treated unfairly.\n[47] On the stand, Cpl. Brown took the position that she made a mistake in seeing a psychologist appointed by the force. Her husband appeared to agree. I am not that sympathetic with them on this point. There is evidence on the other side that she was avoiding treatment. She stated that she refused to take the medication that had been prescribed because she was worried about side effects. That maybe so, but I think it is clear that Cpl. Brown was stalling. She had grieved the original promotion and was hoping for a decision in her favor before she returned to work. This came to naught when the grievance was denied.\n[48] Insp. Donovan eventually contacted Cpl. Brown, in an effort to resolve the situation. He testified that it is important to get people back to work as soon as possible. There was at least some evidence of rumors and innuendo among the other members of the force. I accept his view that the real solution to these kinds of social issues is to get the member back in a healthy work environment. I accept that Insp. Donovan made real efforts to place Cpl. Brown and her husband in a posting that met their satisfaction. He obtained the authority, for example, to offer them two corporal's positions with the photo radar program in Kamloops before these postings were offered to the rest of the force. Cpl. Brown and her husband declined this posting because they did not believe the photo radar program would survive the next election.\n[49] Insp. Donovan also offered Cpl. Brown a posting in Castlegar. She and her husband were prepared to take this posting, on the understanding that the Complainant's husband would take leave without pay until such time as a posting became available. This appeared to be the answer, until Cpl. Brown realized that she was required to sign off on her grievance. This was too much for her and the offer fell apart.\n[50] Cpl. Brown felt that there was something sinister in the fact that she was required to forgo her grievance. I do not share her feelings. There was nothing improper in the RCMP trying to settle the matter on this basis. This does not affect the situation. Cpl. Brown wanted an open admission that she had been discriminated against and she was entitled to insist on it. Although one has to wonder whether Cpl. Brown made the right decision, she was entitled to reject the agreement on the basis that it did not include such an admission.\n[51] Cpl. Brown's refusal to sign the agreement brought the negotiations with Insp. Donovan to a close. There is no doubt that the Inspector was upset and felt she was being unreasonable. But that was the end of it. Insp. Donovan advised her that she would be receiving an order to return to work. Dr. Buchan had reached the opinion that Cpl. Brown was fit for work but did not want to return until her dispute with the force had been resolved. I think there is a certain moral truth in this. It is evident that there was considerable obstinacy on both sides.\n[52] When the negotiations with the Insp. Donovan collapsed, the dialogue between Cpl. Brown and her employer collapsed with it. I think it is fair to say that by this point, the Complainant's lack of trust in her employer had progressed to the point where she was suspicious of any efforts to resolve the situation. When Dr. Hannah advised her that she was fit for a desk job, she felt that Dr. Hannah had been pressured. I see no reason to question the good faith of any of the medical or psychological practitioners.\n[53] In a last effort to resolve the matter, Colin Brown contacted Sgt. Haggymasy, an assistant to the commanding officer in human resources. The three of them had a meeting, in which the Complainant made it clear that she wanted to continue with her human rights complaint. They then discussed her qualifications. Sgt. Haggymasy discovered that Cpl. Brown had a business diploma and suggested a position at the Integrated Proceeds of Crime Unit. This was a coveted posting. Cpl. Brown was eventually awarded the position and has been complimented for her service there. Sgt. Haggymasy was also good enough to find a position for her husband.\nIII. LAW [54] There are four points that might be made in discussing the legal issues in the case. The first point is merely that there is no obligation on the complainant to prove a specific intent to discriminate. This is trite law, which was established in O'Malley v. Simpson Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536.\n[55] The second point relates to the allegation that Corporal Brown was discriminated against on the basis of family status under s.7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Commission has provided me with B. v. Ontario (Human Rights Comm.) (2002), 44 C.H.R.R. D\/1 (SCC), where Justices Iacobucci and Bastarache held that family status and marital status are not restricted to the mere fact that one is married or enjoys some other family attribute. These terms include the particular status that one enjoys by virtue of being married to specific individual.\n[56] The third point is also uncontroversial. The Commission has cited Holden v. Canadian National Railway (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (FCA), at D\/15, for the proposition that discrimination need not be the sole factor in the Respondent's treatment of the Complainant. This is important, if only because it simplifies the present case. If the Complainant's family status was one of the factors in the decision to deny her a specific promotion, that is sufficient to establish discrimination for the purposes of the Act.\n[57] This takes me to the more fundamental legal issue in the case which relates to the complainant's obligation to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. In Basi v. Canadian National Railway Co. (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029, for example, this Tribunal held:\nThe burden, and order, of proof in discrimination cases involving refusal of employment appears clear and constant through all Canadian jurisdictions: a complainant must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination; once that is done, the burden shifts to the respondent to provide a reasonable explanation for the otherwise discriminatory behaviour.\nThereafter, assuming the employer has provided an explanation, the complainant has the eventual burden of showing that the explanation provided was merely a pretext and that the true motivation behind the employer's actions was in fact discriminatory.\nThis analysis provides a pragmatic means of determining whether discrimination occurred in a particular situation. It should not be applied in a rigid or mechanical manner.\n[58] The decision of an Ontario Board of Inquiry in Shakes v. Rex Pak Ltd. (1982), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001, at D\/1002, sets out a standard precis of what usually required to establish a prima facie case.\nIn an employment complaint, the Commission usually establishes a prima facie case by proving:\nthat the complainant was qualified for the particular employment; that the complainant was not hired; and, that someone no better qualified but lacking the distinguishing feature which is the gravamen of the human rights complaint subsequently obtained the position.\nIf these elements are proved, there is an evidentiary onus on the Respondent to provide an explanation ... for what occurred.\nThe point of cases like Shakes is that there is no need to prove anything more than the fact that someone no better qualified than the Complainant was hired or promoted.\n[59] The situation is simpler where someone less qualified was hired. The usual rationale for the prima facie test does not seem of much assistance in this context. In Basi, for example, at paragraph 38481, the Tribunal held that:\n...the complainant would have a herculean task were it necessary for him to prove, by direct evidence, that discrimination was the motivating factor. Discrimination is not a practice which one would expect to see displayed overtly. In fact, rarely are there cases where one can show by direct evidence that discrimination is purposely practiced.\nThis overlooks the fact that there is no obligation on a Complainant to establish that discrimination was a conscious factor in the decision to hire someone else. Although the animus of an alleged discriminator may be significant in certain aspects of the process, there is no need to prove a mental state in substantiating a complaint of discrimination.\n[60] The older case law speaks of indirect or adverse effect discrimination. In Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143 at p. 173, for example, the court asked:\nWhat does discrimination mean? The question has arisen most commonly in a consideration of the Human Rights Acts and the general concept of discrimination under those enactments has been fairly well settled. There is little difficulty, drawing upon the cases in this Court, in isolating an acceptable definition. In Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at p. 551, discrimination (in the case of adverse effect discrimination) was described in these terms: It arises where an employer . . . adopts a rule or standard . . . which has a discriminatory effect upon a prohibited ground on one employee or group of employees in that it imposes, because of some special characteristic of the employee or group, obligations, penalties, or restrictive conditions not imposed on other members of the work force. It was held in that case, as well, that no intent was required as an element of discrimination, for it is in essence the impact of the discriminatory act or provision upon the person affected which is decisive in considering any complaint.\nThe probative side of the human rights inquiry has always focused on the effect of an employer's actions. The same approach can be seen in CNR v. Canada (Human Rights Commission) (1987) 1 C.H.R.R. D\/1014, at paragraph 30.\n[61] The more recent case law has reinforced this approach. In British Columbia v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3, usually referred to as the Meiorin decision, the Supreme Court held that there was no reason to distinguish between the concepts of direct and adverse affect discrimination. This was true under both the Charter of Rights and human rights legislation. At paragraph 47, the court wrote that: ... the distinction between direct and adverse effect discrimination may have some analytical significance but, because the principal concern is the effect of the impugned law, it has little legal importance. At paragraph 48, it continued:\n...this Court long ago held that the fact that a discriminatory effect was unintended is not determinative of its general Charter analysis and certainly does not determine the available remedy. Law, supra, at para. 80, per Iacobucci J.; Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143, at pp. 174-75, per McIntyre J.; Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 624, at para. 62, per La Forest J. In cases such as O'Malley, supra, and Bhinder v. Canadian National Railway Co., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 561, this Court endeavoured to entrench the same principle in its analysis of human rights legislation. (30)\nThis is a consistent theme in the case law. If the doctrine of discriminatory effect applies, evidence of improper motives is an adjunct of discrimination, rather than a defining feature.\n[62] It seems to me that this should be the real focus of the process. The initial task of a Tribunal in examining the kind of case before me is to determine whether there is credible evidence that the actions of the Respondent had the requisite effect upon the Complainant. The reality is that discrimination is often a notional act, which exists at least legally in the consequences that flow from it. As I understand the case law, all the Complainant is obliged to do is establish that she suffered the necessary effect. The inference of discrimination already exists in the substantive law and nothing more is needed. The inference of discrimination already exists in the substantive law and nothing more is needed.\n[63] There is nothing very difficult in such a proposition. This is much like saying that the Complainant is obliged to lead evidence that she was discriminated against. Nor does it affect the standard analysis, since the doctrine of discriminatory effect and the prima facie test introduce the same principle of strict liability into the human rights process. If there is a reasonable explanation for what appears on its face to be discriminatory conduct, it is for the Respondent to establish that explanation. There is no need, however, to see the evidence of such conduct as circumstantial evidence of some corrupt intent.\n[64] There is a more general sense in which any person making a legal claim has an obligation to establish the elements of the case that it wishes to advance. It is for the Respondent to reply. This is often referred to as a prima facie case, but does not require any significant weighing of the evidence. I do not believe that this affects the primary burden in the case, which remains on the complainant throughout the process. If the Complainant does not establish at the end of the day that she has suffered some discriminatory effect, on a balance of probabilities, the complaint should be dismissed.\n[65] This is fundamental law, which derives from the simple proposition that the prosecuting party must prove its case. The case law suggests that the situation is different when the Respondent raises a statutory defence. All I can say is that this is not the situation before me and requires further analysis. I cannot see that there is anything for a Tribunal to do in a case like the one before me other than to weigh the evidence on both sides and determine whether the Complainant has made out her case on a balance the probabilities. This is a compelling and reliable means of deciding the proper outcome in the case, which keeps extraneous considerations out of the process. The general jurisprudence recognizes that it is preferable to keep the tasks of evaluating evidence as simple as possible.\n[66] The legal dynamics of the case before me are extremely simple. The testimony establishes that the Complainant was passed over in the promotion process because she was married to another member. The Complainant had no difficulty establishing a credible case in the matter before me. The probative issue is accordingly whether the Respondent was able to provide a reasonable explanation of what occurred and deprive the Complainant of the legal preponderance in the evidence. The failure of the Respondent to provide such an explanation merely leaves the case for the Complainant intact.\nIV. ANALYSIS [67] The purpose of the Canadian Human Rights Act is to rectify the problem of discrimination. The Complainant is obliged to establish that she was treated differently than the other candidates on the basis of her sex or marital status. She must also establish that this worked to her disadvantage. The case before me is remarkably simple. Corporal Brown was ranked 47th in the list of candidates and the Respondent has not challenged her ranking. The evidence on all sides was that the Career Management Unit had an obligation to place the higher candidates in the list before placing the candidates below them. The assignment of positions was strictly hierarchical.\n[68] I am willing to accede that management was entitled to some discretion in awarding positions. There are global factors that come into play in the promotional process, which extend beyond the circumstances of individual candidates. This is borne out by section 134(4)(d)(1) of the Career Management Manual. The prerogatives of management only extend so far, however, and the qualifications of the candidates must take precedence over other considerations. In my view, this is the positive side of the law of human rights. It is not simply that employers are prohibited from discriminating against their employees in awarding promotions. It is that they are obliged to respect the merit principle.\n[69] There were a number of factors that the Career Management Unit was entitled to consider in deciding whether to give Cpl. Brown a particular posting. One of these factors was that Corporal Brown was married to another member of the force. This had a number of implications for the force. It is also apparent that the exact qualifications and circumstances of other candidates needed to be considered. There was evidence for example that members in limited duration posts were entitled to a transfer. I think it was reasonable for the Career Management Unit to consider moving costs, the need to accommodate her spouse and the special circumstance of other candidates, in exercising its prerogatives.\n[70] It follows that the Career Management Unit was entitled to award a posting to a lower ranked candidate, if it had valid reasons for doing so. This must not be taken too far however. It may have been reasonable to pass over Cpl. Brown's initial choices. The force of such an argument however dissipates as one works one's way through the list. At some point in the process, it can no longer be sustained.\n[71] It is apparent that the strength of a candidate's case increases as one goes through her list of preferences. The second time one passes over a candidate, management should take note of that fact. The third time calls for serious reflection. The ranking system must be respected. The Career Management Unit simply failed to meet its legal obligations in this regard. The best illustration of this is probably the fourteenth choice of Cpl. Brown, which was awarded to a candidate who had ranked 96 in the scoring, almost 50 positions below her. This is unfathomable. The prerogative of management to deny Cpl. Brown one of the requested promotions was exhausted long before it reached her 17th choice.\n[72] One of the problems with the argument that the Respondent has the right to appoint lower ranking candidates is that this logic cannot be reserved for other candidates. It also applies to Corporal Brown. If a lower ranked candidate was occasionally entitled to a promotion, over and above a candidate that ranked higher in the scoring, this only means that the Respondent had ample latitude to give Cpl. Brown one of her higher preferences.\n[73] It is clear that Cpl. Brown's list of preferences demonstrated a certain indecisiveness. I have already suggested that her lack of confidence had a part to play in this. Her choices were all over the place. It does not matter. The preferences were hers to make and it is not for anyone, least of all me, to question why she chose to list certain positions over others. There is no evidence before me to suggest that other candidates were given their seventeenth choice. The evidence is quite to the contrary. The case is anomalous.\n[74] Staff Sgt. Mitchell candidly acknowledged that Cpl. Brown would have been awarded a higher preference if she had limited her choices. At the end of the day, it was the lower choices on her own list of preferences that defeated her. This was a travesty of the process. Corporal Brown did not list her additional preferences, so that her employer could pass her by, in awarding the postings that she wanted to candidates who were ranked below her.\n[75] I am satisfied that the decision to give Cpl. Brown the posting in Coquitlam was driven more by costs and the needs of the force than the legitimate concerns of the promotional process. It was convenient to leave Cpl. Brown and her husband in the lower mainland, where management had difficulty retaining officers. This was contrary to the spirit of the promotions process, which was supposed to be based on the preferences of individual members. The Respondent has not provided me with any other examples of a well qualified candidate who was awarded such a low ranking preference.\n[76] I cannot say whether Supt. Schlecker and his staff deliberately treated Cpl. Brown unfairly. This is a common theme in cases of discrimination however. The face of discrimination has an invisible side, which does nothing to mitigate its effect. It is enough to say that the decision to promote Cpl. Brown on site was manifestly unfair. It is equally apparent that her marital status was the major factor in such a decision. This brings the Canadian Human Rights Act into play, and is more than sufficient to substantiate the complaint.\nV. CONCLUSIONS A. Section 10 [77] I do not believe that the present case raises significant policy issues. The evidence established that there was a personal rather than a systemic unfairness in the process. The decisions in the promotional process were made on a case-by-case basis. Any policy concerns are peripheral and merely provide the context in which the personal complaint was laid. The allegations under section 10 have not been substantiated.\nB. Section 7 [78] This takes me to the complaint under section 7, which alleges that Cpl. Brown was unfairly treated in the promotional process because of her sex and family status. The former allegation was never substantiated. There was evidence that the RCMP is still experiencing some difficulties in integrating women, if only because members of the other gender have felt that they receive preferential treatment. This was very much in the background however.\n[79] Staff Sgt. Mitchell acknowledged that there was some banter regarding Sgt. Kallin's comments, but that banter was at his expense. It would be overstating Sgt. Kallin's importance in the narrative to think his views mattered to Staff Sgt. Mitchell, who was under far too much pressure to concern himself with the individual preferences of detachment commanders. The idea that Supt. Schlecker and Insp. Donovan were attentive to Sgt. Kallin's views in dealing with a complex set of promotional requests does not bear up under analysis.\n[80] I believe that the staff in the Career Management Unit were aware of their responsibility to make decisions regarding promotion without discriminating against female members. There may have been remnants of an historical bias against female members, particularly at the lower levels. But there is no convincing evidence before me that this affected the competition for promotions. I accept Staff Sgt. Mitchell's evidence that gender was off the table and was not considered in the promotional process.\n[81] This leaves the allegation that Cpl. Brown was discriminated against on the basis of family status. I am satisfied that this aspect of the case has been substantiated. The witnesses openly acknowledged that marital status was the major factor in the decision and no real explanation was provided by the Respondent, other than to establish that there were significant expenses associated with moving a member to another posting. The Career Management Unit, was under strict orders not to spend money. This was a misplaced concern however and there is nothing in the evidence that would legally justify the decision to leave the Complainant in the lower mainland.\n[82] I am not convinced that I have the entire story. Sgt. Deevy still has difficulty explaining what occurred. Staff Sgt. Wills and testified that he had never heard a satisfactory account of what had happened. There is no doubt that Staff Sgt. Wills may have developed a certain mistrust of management as a result of his role as a member representative. Even after this is taken into account however, it is evident that the situation cries out for an explanation.\n[83] They were probably a variety of factors, legitimate and illegitimate, that contributed to the decision making process. The reality however is that less qualified candidates were given promotions ahead of Cpl. Brown. The unfairness in the process was flagrant. There is no doubt that the Complainant has established a prima facie case. She has established a good deal more. The case before me is a case that requires an answer, which was never supplied by the Respondent.\n[84] I might say in passing that the promotional process was poorly designed at the outset. This will come as no surprise to the officers in the Career Management Unit. Everyone was under enormous pressure and there were too many demands on the process. In the end, it was simply easier to leave the situation as it was and walk away. I accept the laconic remark of Staff Sgt. Wills who simply said that the amount of effort that would have been required to stop the process and rectify the mistake would have been huge. The evidence of the other witnesses bears out this observation.\nC. Remedy (i) Apology [85] The employer's efforts to accommodate the Complainant and redress the initial injustice were substantial. The problem is that it made these efforts without acknowledging that Corporal Brown had been unfairly treated. I believe that this has become the most prominent issue between the parties. When Colin Brown was asked why his wife wouldn't accept the Castlegar posting, he stated that it was all about regaining her dignity. She needed some admission that she had been wronged.\n[86] I am concerned that Cpl. Brown has become more interested in proving a moral point than in resolving the substantive issues before me. There was real stubbornness displayed on both sides of the case. This does not affect my view of the situation. It does not matter whether the discrimination was intended or a product of some conspiracy of circumstances. The fact is that Cpl. Brown was treated unfairly in the promotional process.\n[87] Although this is exactly the kind of case that would seem to call for a corporate apology, the decision of the Federal Court in Attorney General (Canada) v. Stevenson 2003 FCT 341 (FCTD) prevents me from ordering an apology. This does not exhaust the issue, since it does not prevent the Respondent from making such a gesture. The parties are welcome to make submissions as to whether the conduct of the Respondent in this regard has any bearing on the compensation to which the Complainant may be entitled under section 53.\n[88] I expressed some frustration during the hearing that the parties were unable to resolve the complaint among themselves. I am still of the view that it should have been possible to settle the matter, though it may be that the admission Cpl. Brown has been seeking is simply not available. If that is the case, my ruling will have to suffice. It constitutes finding in law that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police discriminated against Corporal Brown.\n[89] It is my hope that the force will make what amends it can by negotiating a final resolution of the matter, in a spirit of reconciliation. I am also of the view that Corporal Brown needs to put the matter behind her. Corporal Brown and her husband are dedicated officers and there is no reason why they should not enjoy satisfying professional careers with the force.\n(ii) Cost Transfer [90] Corporal Brown is entitled to the cost transfer that she was denied in the promotional process. I am accordingly ordering that the RCMP provide her with another posting, preferably with the detachment in Saskatoon or Calgary. I gather that either of these locations would be satisfactory. I am reluctant to enter any further into the specifics of the matter, which remains within the reasonable discretion of management.\n[91] I was nevertheless asked to retain jurisdiction on this aspect of the case. If the parties are unable to agree on an appropriate posting within 4 months, I am accordingly prepared to revisit the issue, at the request of either side. As a matter of good faith, I would ask the Respondent to provide reasonable prospects for Corporal Brown's husband. The evidence establishes that there should be no difficulty in providing positions for both of them in a larger centre.\n(iii) Compensation [92] I think it is necessary to hear further submissions as to the appropriate quantum of damages and costs. I would prefer to deal with these matters at the same time. It may nevertheless be helpful to provide some commentary on this aspect of the case.\n[93] There were a number of submissions. The Complainant relies on the fact that she was on sick leave for over a year. The Respondent replies that she left on medical leave the day after she returned to work and remained on salary until the day that she returned. There was accordingly no wage loss. It is a strange situation in many respects. The RCMP refused to openly acknowledge that it had discriminated against Cpl. Brown. But it was happy to pay her sick leave, which can be traced directly to the distress that she suffered as a result of the discrimination.\n[94] The Complainant is entitled to compensation for pain and suffering. She had difficulty testifying and still feels an enormous sense of betrayal. Her emotional, psychological and physical well-being have been affected by the dispute. She has had a loss of confidence and suffered from depression. Her marriage and family has suffered. I would like to hear the parties views as to the significance of these factors in assessing damages.\n[95] There are issues on the other side. I believe that the RCMP was within its rights in insisting that Cpl. Brown return to work. I do not think that it was reasonable for her to demand that the complaint be resolved before she returned to her duties. Any institutional process takes time, and an employee cannot expect to be paid indefinitely, when she essentially refuses to work.\n[96] I accept Insp. Donovan's observation that the most important thing in rebuilding the relationship between an employer and an employee is to bring the employee back to work. Time runs against the resumption of a harmonious working relationship. It is clear from the evidence of Corporal Brown that she has done well in her new position and this process has at least begun.\n[97] The Complainant also submits that her prospects in the force have diminished as a result of raising her hand in protest. I am not prepared to assume that the force will act in bad faith however, and I accept the Respondent's submission that she has been given a desirable position.\n[98] There is an additional suggestion that Corporal Brown was the victim of gossip in the workplace. That is inevitable and the evidence is that the RCMP discourages any public discussion of matters relating to an officer's personnel file. It is not responsible for the illicit gossip of other officers and staff.\n(iv) Costs [99] In a normal set of circumstances, I would have been inclined to award the Complainant her reasonable costs. The Respondent has asked me to reserve my decision on the question however, apparently on the basis that the Complainant rejected a reasonable offer of settlement before the hearing. I have some concern that the facts relevant to such an inquiry may be in dispute. There may also be issues of confidentiality or privilege that need to be addressed. I would accordingly ask the parties to determine whether evidence will be required before proceeding further.\n[100] There may be other issues that require attention. Cpl. Brown has asked me, for example, to order that the RCMP to place a copy of my decision on her personnel file. I believe that it is better to deal with such a request after I have heard from the parties on the outstanding issues with\nrespect to remedy. I would accordingly invite the parties to advise the Tribunal how they wish to proceed. I will retain the jurisdiction to deal with any matters arising out of this decision.\nsigned by\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nFebruary 4, 2004\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: T769\/1903\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Jacqueline Brown v.

INTRODUCTION [1] The Complainant alleges in her complaint that the Respondent refused to employ her because she is a transsexual person. She claims that in so doing, the Respondent discriminated against her on the ground of sex.\n[2] The Canadian Human Rights Act (Act) provides that it is a discriminatory practice to refuse to employ an individual on the prohibited ground of sex (ss. 3 & 7). The Complainant's birth certificate identifies her sex as being male. According to the complaint form that the Complainant filed in September 2001, she declares herself to be a transsexual person who dresses as a woman and who was, at that time, in the period of transition to become a woman. The Respondent is not contesting the Complainant's contention that discrimination on the basis of a person's transgendered status constitutes sex discrimination under the Act.\n[3] However, at the opening of the hearing into the complaint, Counsel for the Respondent noted that in a recent Court of Appeal of Quebec judgment regarding the Complainant,1 she apparently acknowledged before the Court that she no longer intends to undergo the surgical operations to modify her sexual organs. Consequently, Respondent Counsel reserved himself the right to submit, in final argument, that this apparent variation from her allegations in the complaint may raise questions as to her credibility.\nA. References to the Complainant in this Decision [4] The Complainant has acted as a party to proceedings before several courts, including the Federal Court, the Superior Court of Quebec, and the Court of Appeal of Quebec, on matters relating to the name by which she may be permitted to identify herself. In the judgments rendered in these cases, the Complainant has been referred to either by the female or the male gender, depending on the decision-maker. For instance, in the case of Montreuil v. Directeur de l'\u00e9tat civil2, Madam Justice Rousseau-Houle applied the female gender, whereas Mr. Justice Morin, noting that the Complainant is still physically a man, used the male gender in his dissenting reasons.\n[5] In relation to this topic of gender identity, I find of particular interest the discussion in Sheridan v. Sanctuary Investments Ltd. No. 3,3 a case regarding a complaint filed by a transgendered person. The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal noted that there exists in some individuals a lack of congruence between the various indicators of sex. With respect to transsexuals, there can exist a complete dissociation between their physical sex and their subjective experience of their masculinity or femininity.\n[6] The Respondent did not present any position, one way or the other, regarding this question. The Complainant, on the other hand, explained that she wishes to be referred to by the female gender. Under the circumstances, I see no reason to deny the Complainant's request. The Complainant is therefore referred to by the female gender throughout this decision.\nB. The Role of the Canadian Human Rights Commission at the Hearing [7] The Commission limited its participation to the delivery of a statement at the opening of the hearing, in which it set out what it perceived to be the principles that are key to the inquiry into the complaint. Commission counsel left the hearing room shortly after reading the statement and did not attend for the remainder of the hearing.\nII. FACTS A. Complainant's Employment Application [8] The Complainant's academic and professional background is broad and varied. She is a member of the Bar of Quebec, and has earned a Master's degree in business administration from Laval University, as well as a Dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es in human resources, administration and organization from the University of Paris - Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne. In 1981, she successfully completed the securities course offered by the Canadian Securities Institute (CSI). Aside from the practice of law, she has worked as a management consultant and has taught numerous courses in law, economics, finance and management at the University of Quebec and at several colleges (CEGEPs). In the 1970's, she owned and operated a restaurant in Quebec City. She is the author of numerous publications including several articles involving the banking industry. The Complainant has even served in the Canadian military. Suffice it to say that the Complainant has benefited from a wealth of experience in her lifetime.\n[9] The Complainant lived most of her public life as a man, under the name of Pierre Montreuil, while at the same time concealing her existence as Micheline. The Complainant contends that in 1997, the Quebec City CEGEP at which she was then employed as an instructor, dismissed her for having been observed in public at a local shopping centre, dressed as a woman. She decided at this point to cease hiding her true identity and to proceed with the development of her new life as Micheline. She disposed of her men's clothing and set about changing her life completely, which included reorienting her professional career. She was by now certain that her dismissal had effectively barred any future teaching opportunities within the CEGEP system.\n[10] The Complainant felt compelled to move from Quebec City to a larger city like Montreal. She viewed Quebec City as being an insular place that was not open to individuals like her. She perceived Montreal, on the other hand, as a diverse and large community in which she could live her life more anonymously without drawing the same negative attention. She testified that it is normal for persons who are in the process of changing their sex to radically turn their backs on the past and make new lives for themselves by, for instance, moving to a different place.\n[11] The Complainant therefore decided to seek employment, now openly as a woman, in a completely new environment. She came across an employment advertisement placed by the Respondent in the La Presse newspaper of May 2, 1998. The notice stated that the Respondent was recruiting persons to work in its call centre (known as TelNat) on a part-time basis (20 to 35 hours per five day week) with the eventual possibility of full-time work. The stated salary was a minimum of ten dollars per hour. The job's duties consisted of providing customer service and selling banking products. Candidates were required to possess at least a Diploma of Collegiate Studies, be bilingual, and have experience in customer service or sales. The advertisement noted that the Respondent was offering an opportunity for a career path commensurate with the employee's skills, as well as ongoing training, a nice working environment and a competitive wage scale. The indicated place of work for these positions was Montreal. The Respondent ended its advertisement by urging those who are willing to take up a challenge and interested in pursuing a career within a large-scale enterprise, to apply. Although not stated in the ad, a condition of employment for all new TelNat agents was that they would be subject to a six-month probationary period during which the Respondent maintained the right to dismiss an employee at its discretion.\n[12] The Complainant responded to the ad by telephone, following which she also sent in a one-page version of her curriculum vitae and photocopies of her passport, driver's licence and Social Insurance Card. The name appearing on these latter documents is Micheline Montreuil or, in the case of the passport, Micheline Pierre Montreuil. In the accompanying photographs, she bears an appearance that is usually associated with that of a woman. However, her sex is identified on the driver's licence and the passport as being male.\n[13] The Complainant had already applied to other banking institutions for different positions but the jobs being offered by the Respondent were particularly attractive to her. As stated in the advertisement, the Respondent employed 16,000 employees and offered the opportunity for a rising career within the company. She knew that there was a relatively high rate of turnover amongst call centre employees. She believed that as a lawyer, with qualifications in the banking and securities field, she would be able to advance fairly quickly within the bank, perhaps becoming a member of the litigation branch after a few years.\nB. First Interview [14] The Respondent invited the Complainant to its offices on Metcalfe Street in Montreal, to proceed through a pre-selection or screening process. The Complainant and about thirty other candidates were convened on May 22, 1998. Upon her arrival, the Complainant was asked to complete an application form. She explained on the form that her reason for leaving her previous employment at the CEGEP was her desire to completely change her life and re-orient her professional career. In the space on the form earmarked for the addition of other information that would be helpful in the assessment of her candidacy, the Complainant wrote that she had made a big change in her life and that she hoped that the Respondent would help her to realize [ concr\u00e9tiser , in French] this change. She added that she must start at the bottom of the ladder in order to climb. In accordance with the Respondent's employment equity policy, a self-identification questionnaire was provided to the Complainant to complete. Although not identifying herself as being a member of any of the designated groups listed (aboriginal, visible minority or disabled), she wrote in, under the heading other, that she was transgendered.\n[15] After the form was completed, the Respondent conducted what it described as an exploratory interview of the Complainant. The interviewer's report indicated that her candidacy was accepted, meaning that it would now proceed to the next stage of assessment. It was noted in the report that the Complainant was a special case [ cas particulier ] and that she had exceptional motivation. After the interview, the Complainant had to complete a series of tests: a scenario-type test, a numerical reasoning test and a personality test. The first two exams were passed with success. The Complainant contends that she passed the personality test at this stage as well, but I am not persuaded of this fact. The briefing card [ fiche synth\u00e8se ] prepared following this phase of her assessment noted that several elements arising from her personality testing needed to be verified more thoroughly during the subsequent final interview that was to be conducted with the managers at TelNat. It was stipulated, however, that these elements could not form the sole basis for the elimination of a candidacy. The elements were identified as her emotionalism (empathy and sense of urgency) [ emotivit\u00e9 (empathie et sens de l'urgence) ] and her social desirability [ d\u00e9sirabilit\u00e9 sociale ].\nC. Second Interview [16] Once a candidate passes the pre-selection process, it is ordinarily the Respondent's policy to invite her back for a final interview, which is conducted by the manager in charge of the department that is recruiting the candidates. However, in the present case, the Complainant was asked by the Director of the Respondent's human resources department, Suzanne Girard, to return to the Metcalfe Street offices for an intermediate or second interview, before proceeding to the final interview. At Ms. Girard's request, Lisette Cloutier, who was in charge of human resources within TelNat, also attended the interview, which took place on July 8, 1998. Ms. Cloutier testified that on certain occasions, such intermediate interviews were conducted, particularly where the profile of the candidate called for additional verifications for reasons such as the level of the candidate's education, her years of experience or even her personal situation. Ms. Cloutier could not identify the specific reason for which Ms. Girard decided to interview the Complainant, and Ms. Girard was not called as a witness during the course of the hearing to provide any additional explanation.\n[17] The interview lasted for about two hours. By the accounts of both Ms. Cloutier and the Complainant, the interview went well overall. Ms. Cloutier found the Complainant to be courteous and articulate. She did not find the candidate's attitude during the course of the interview to be arrogant. There was some discussion about the Complainant's academic background and professional experience, and the interviewers asked why she was interested in such a low level position, considering her extensive qualifications. The Complainant replied that she viewed the TelNat job as an opportunity to gain entry into the company, with the hope of advancing through the ranks over time. Ms. Cloutier testified that she considered this reply to be acceptable [ correct ]. She advised the Complainant that in order to advance within the bank, she must be willing to remain in her entry level position for up to two or three years. The Complainant answered that she was prepared to accept this condition and to even work extended hours, if necessary.\n[18] According to the Complainant, it was obvious from her physical appearance that she was a transgendered person, and, to ensure that the there would be no misunderstanding, she asked in a frank manner whether her status created a problem for the employer. Ms. Cloutier explained that she was responsible for dealing with special cases, and she assured the Complainant that the Respondent maintained a non-discrimination policy with respect to its hiring practices. The Complainant thought it appropriate at this point to hand over to her interviewers a one-page document entitled Firms that officially accept Transgendered\", the text of which set out a list of large American-based multinational companies that had adopted liberal and open policies vis \u00e0 vis transgendered persons. Amongst the businesses listed was the Chase Bank. The Complainant had received this list by e-mail from an acquaintance in the United States who has worked for the advancement of transgendered rights. The Complainant claims that the reason she delivered the document to Ms. Cloutier and Ms. Girard was so as to reassure the Respondent that it would not be alone amongst large corporations in adopting an open policy towards transgendered persons.\n[19] Ms. Cloutier interpreted the Complainant's gesture differently. She wondered to herself whether the Complainant genuinely wanted to work as a call centre employee or whether her true intention instead was to get herself hired and then set about promoting the integration of transgendered persons within the organization. However, at no time did Ms. Cloutier, or Ms. Girard for that matter, ever question the Complainant openly about these concerns. The interviewers ultimately concluded that the Complainant met all the basic criteria and that her application for employment should be advanced to the next and final stage of assessment. About two weeks later, Ms. Cloutier called the Complainant and notified her that she had passed the second interview.\nD. Third Interview [20] On August 12, 1998, Lise Roy, who was the supervisor of the quality control section at TelNat, telephoned the Complainant to invite her to the third and final interview. During the call, Ms. Roy discussed with the Complainant some of the conditions of employment including salary, work hours, as well as the required training and probation periods. According to Ms. Roy, such matters are usually discussed with all candidates during these calls. The Complainant recalls explaining to Ms. Roy that, if offered a position with the Respondent, she would move from Quebec City to Montreal.\n[21] The interview was conducted on August 20, 1998, at the TelNat offices situated within the Respondent's head office, at 500 Place d'Armes in Old Montreal. The Complainant met with Ms. Roy and with Jos\u00e9e Lecompte, who was a team supervisor at TelNat. The interview followed a typical pattern, according to Ms. Roy. During the first portion, which she described as the formal part, questions were posed to the Complainant to determine her interest in and suitability for the job. This was followed by an informal discussion, during which the Complainant was asked if she had any questions to put to her interviewers. This second phase was meant to create a more relaxed atmosphere by engaging the candidate in some light talk. Interviewees were not obliged to ask any questions and indeed, some chose not to do so. It appears that candidates could be hired even where the informal conversations did not ensue. In the Complainant's case, however, the informal exchange took place, and it evolved into what Ms. Roy described as a blah-blah-blah between women.\n[22] The Complainant recalls the interview as having been very positive. It was explained to her that the initial functions of the position (within TelNat's Express Line service) involved providing basic information over the telephone to the Respondent's clients, such as their account balances. After acquiring more experience, employees were assigned to receive calls of a more complex nature. According to the Complainant, after her interviewers had noted that she held an MBA degree and that she had completed her CSI securities course, they informed her that there was a possibility of advancement to the loans and investments branch of the customer service department. At the close of the interview, the Complainant was told that she would be receiving a reply from the Respondent within two to three weeks. She asserts that she was shown the TelNat work area and was told that this was where she would be working. She left the meeting feeling certain that she would be hired for the job.\n[23] Ms. Roy and Ms. Lecompte deny having indicated where the Complainant would be working or having intimated that she would be hired at all. They testified that immediately after the Complainant's departure, they sat down to discuss her candidacy. They agreed to recommend to the human resources department that it would be risky to hire the Complainant. It was decided that Ms. Lecompte, who had been taking notes during the interview, would prepare a typed report setting out the reasons for their decision. It was not the normal practice to prepare such reports but they felt compelled to do so in this case, due to certain specific remarks made by the Complainant. I have reproduced the report in its entirety below, without any alteration to the emphasis and underlining of the original text:\n[TRANSLATION]\nMS. MICHELINE MONTREUIL\nSeptember 1, 1998\nRe:\nReport of the interview held on August 25, 1998 at the Telnat Call Centre, in the presence of Jos\u00e9e Lecompte and Lise G. Roy. There were two parts to the interview.\nq \"Formal part of the interview\nDuring this interview, Ms. Montreuil showed that she was willing and able to take our training and hold the position of Telnat customer service representative.\nIn our opinion, the candidate was overqualified for the Express Line representative position. Because of her skills, knowledge and experience, she seemed to us to be a suitable candidate for a position in the financial services sector. However, we detected a condescending, even self-important, tone when she mentioned, \"If the Bank does not recognize my abilities, a competitor will seek me out.\"\nq Informal discussion part of the interview\nWe wanted to make Ms. Montreuil aware of her overqualification, in light of her experience, and to explain that the position may not be suitable for her.\nIt was then that she launched into a description of the different stages that financial institutions have gone through over the last forty years and mentioned racism, sexism, and other types of discrimination.\nShe claimed that she herself was the ambassador of her type in the banking industry and said, \"In the 1950s, women, with some difficulty, entered the workforce. Subsequent to that, in the 1960s, companies hired on Italians and Greeks. In the 1970s, Blacks and Chinese made their entrance. Then in the 1980s, Gays were accepted. Now it's my turn, just like Martians who, in 2010, will pay everyone a surprise visit with their little antennae and their green bodies.\"\nIn a joking manner, she added the following:\n\"Not only can I open doors, but I can also break them down.\"\nShe also informed us about her time with the Canadian Forces and showed us a photo in which she was dressed as a soldier before she underwent her physical transformation.\nThe discussion continued and Ms. Montreuil asked us where the courthouse was because she had to go plead her case regarding the name change she requested (i.e. from Michel Montreuil to Micheline Montreuil).\nOn this topic, she said the following:\n\"I'll get my way by wearing them down; I'm persistent.\"\nThe interview ended on a humorous note from Ms. Montreuil.\nKnowing that Jos\u00e9e Lecompte had also been a member of the Canadian Forces, she finished with, You could say that the Army turns out beautiful, great women!\nIn light of Ms. Montreuil's remarks, we believe it would be risky to offer her a position as a customer service representative.\nLise Roy, Team Leader Jos\u00e9e Lecompte, Team Leader\nMs. Roy and Ms. Lecompte testified that in describing the making of a job offer to the Complainant as being risky, they were in effect recommending that she not be hired.\n[24] The Complainant takes issue with the manner with which her alleged remarks were presented in the report. She identifies several errors in the text, which call into question its reliability in recounting the events and statements contained therein. For instance, while it is possible that the Complainant spoke to the interviewers about her pending litigation regarding her petition to have her name officially changed, she denies ever having asked them for directions to the Montreal Courthouse. The Complainant points out that she has attended the Montreal Courthouse countless times during her legal career and knows its location very well. Moreover, her petition had been filed and presented before the Superior Court in Quebec City, not Montreal. She also notes that she was not seeking to have her name changed from Michel, as set out in the report, but rather from Pierre. The Complainant alludes to these errors as evidence that the report does not reliably reflect her comments during the interview, suggesting that her words were presented out of context.\n[25] Similarly, the Complainant presents a somewhat different version of the comment that she allegedly made with respect to the hiring of various minority groups within the banking industry. She claims that this part of the conversation was far more detailed than as put forward in the report and consisted of her pointing out that over the last forty years, one minority group after another has managed to be integrated into the industry, in spite of initial resistance attributable to misconceived notions and prejudice. She contends that the remark about how Martians may one day also seek integration was intended to illustrate with some humour, how firms are continuously adapting to accommodate the needs of various groups within society. The Complainant underscores the fact that this conversation took place during the informal portion of the meeting that Ms. Roy herself described as a blah, blah, blah between women.\n[26] This report was never shown to the Complainant prior to the hearing and in fact, the Respondent only disclosed it to her part way through her testimony.\nE. Notification to Complainant of Refusal to Hire [27] By September 10, 1998, exactly three weeks after the Complainant's third interview, the Respondent had still not informed her of whether she had been hired. On the same day, however, a very significant event occurred in the Complainant's life. The Superior Court of Quebec issued a judgment confirming the decision by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'assurance automobile du Qu\u00e9bec (SAAQ) to delete the name Micheline from her driver's licence. Unbeknownst to the Complainant, and in fact, even before she herself had learned of the Court's ruling, two Quebec City newspapers published articles about the judgment, that very morning. Over the course of the day, other newspapers as well as numerous radio stations and television networks from across the province contacted her. She agreed to participate in interviews with all media outlets. She felt it important to present her side of the story, ever mindful of the fact that her status as a transgendered person, who also happens to be a lawyer by profession, lent itself easily to sensationalism. She also points out that the first newspaper articles were printed without putting forward her perspective on the questions raised, and contained several important errors.\n[28] According to the Complainant, she had never contacted the press in the past about any of the legal proceedings regarding her name, and in particular, she did not solicit any of the coverage that followed the judgment's release on September 10th. She acknowledges, however, that she did not turn down interviews whenever they were sought by the media. The articles about her continued into the month of October 1998, and on October 7, 1998, her story was featured on the front pages of the Journal de Montr\u00e9al and the Journal de Qu\u00e9bec. She was interviewed on popular television programs such as Point J and JE en direct.\n[29] Over this entire period, the Complainant had still not received any word from the Respondent about her job application. On October 14th, she went to the Respondent's Place d'Armes head offices, where her third interview had been conducted, and asked to speak to Ms. Roy. The Complainant was told that Ms. Roy was unavailable but that a reply would be received by the Complainant in the mail, on or before October 19th. Despite these assurances, the Complainant did not receive any correspondence from the Respondent throughout the month of October. In the meantime, she noticed that the Respondent was continuing to place the same advertisement in the La Presse newspaper that she had first seen back in May, for the recruitment of new employees to work at the TelNat call centre.\n[30] On November 10, 1998, the Complainant attended at the Respondent's recruitment centre in its offices on Metcalfe Street, where her first two interviews had taken place. She was given an appointment to meet with Ms. Girard later that week. In the meantime, the Complainant prepared and handed over to the Respondent a three-page letter setting out in detail each of her interactions with the Respondent since applying for the job. The Complainant concluded her letter by requesting that she be provided with some information as to the status of her application for employment. The Complainant stated, in unambiguous terms, that she wanted to work for the Respondent. She affirmed her willingness to work in any posting that the Respondent felt was best suited to her qualifications, adding that she understood that most non-entry level vacancies are filled internally. She noted that it was precisely for that reason that she wanted to join the Respondent's workforce at the entry level, irrespective of how low the wage scale was.\n[31] When the Complainant arrived for her appointment with Ms. Girard on November 13th, the latter told the Complainant that a decision had been made and a written reply would be forthcoming shortly. Indeed, the Complainant did receive a letter at her home, from the Respondent, dated November 6, 1998, but she insists that it was not delivered until November 18th or 19th. The letter explains, in two short paragraphs, that after having interviewed the Complainant, the Respondent unfortunately could not retain her candidacy, as her qualifications did not meet the requirements of the position. Interestingly, the letter is addressed to Mister Pierre Montreuil, not Micheline Montreuil.\n[32] The Complainant took great offence to the usage of this name, arguing at the hearing that it demonstrates how the Respondent's decision was influenced by the media coverage she had received. In all of the documents that she had submitted to the Respondent, she had never referred to herself as Pierre, only as Micheline. The evidence, however, shows that a background check conducted of her by the Respondent when she first applied for the job yielded a report that identified her name at birth as being Pierre Montreuil. The Respondent claims that it simply thought it appropriate to address the Complainant by her official name, as it was recorded at that time. I am not persuaded that the usage of Pierre in the letter is indicative of a desire by the Respondent to insult the Complainant nor that it demonstrates that its decision not to hire her came about as a result of the publicity she was then attracting.\n[33] By March 4, 1999, the Complainant had written no fewer than three letters to the Respondent, requesting information about the status of her job application. She did not acknowledge, in any of these letters, that she had received the Respondent's refusal letter of November 6th, 1998. The Complainant testified that since the letter was addressed to Mister Pierre Montreuil, she never treated it as having been sent to her. On March 16, 1999, the Complainant received another letter from the Respondent, signed by its Vice-President (Human Resources), Santo Alborino. This letter, which was now addressed specifically to Ms. Micheline Montreuil, noted that a response had already been sent to her (the November 6th letter) and that consequently, the Respondent considered the file closed.\n[34] On April 13, 1999, the Complainant filed the first version of her complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. The Commission initially decided that her complaint was inadmissible because it was not filed under her legal name, as it was registered at that time. The Complainant sought judicial review of this decision before the Federal Court and was successful. The Court ordered the Commission to accept the Complainant's complaint and further ordered that it be drafted setting out her name as being Joseph Yves Pierre Papineau Montreuil, known under the name of Micheline Montreuil. The complaint that is now before me, drafted pursuant to the order, was signed and filed with the Commission on September 4, 2001. On April 15, 2003, the Tribunal granted the Complainant's request to modify the style of cause of the case and identify her only by the name of Micheline Montreuil.\n[35] Since June 3, 2002, the Complainant has been employed as a tax collection agent within the call centre of the Minist\u00e8re du revenu du Qu\u00e9bec. Her functions consist of calling taxpayers who are in default and making arrangements for the payment of the sums that are due. I was not provided with any details about what employment the Complainant may have had prior to this date.\nIII. LEGAL FRAMEWORK [36] It is a discriminatory practice under the Act to refuse to hire a person on the basis of sex (ss. 3 and 7). In Kavanagh v. Attorney-General of Canada,4 a case involving a post-operative transsexual, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decided that discrimination on the basis of transsexualism constitutes sex discrimination. A similar finding was reached in the British Columbia case of Sheridan,5 which related to a pre-operative transsexual. As I have already indicated, the Respondent is not contesting the notion that a refusal to hire based on a person's transgendered status constitutes sex discrimination.\n[37] The burden is said to be on a complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.6 A prima facie case, in this context, is one that covers the allegations made and that, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour, in the absence of an answer from the respondent. Once the prima facie case is established, the onus then shifts to the respondent to provide a reasonable explanation for the otherwise discriminatory behaviour. If a reasonable explanation is put forward, the complainant must demonstrate that the explanation is merely a pretext and that the true motivation behind the employer's actions was in fact discriminatory.7\n[38] It is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions at issue in order for the complaint to be substantiated. It is sufficient that the discrimination be one of the factors in the employer's decision.8 The standard of proof in discrimination cases is the balance of probabilities.\n[39] In Basi,9 the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal stated that discrimination is not a practice that one would expect to see displayed overtly. The Tribunal went on to say that in fact, rarely are there cases where one can show by direct evidence that discrimination is purposely practiced. A tribunal should therefore consider all circumstances to determine if there exists a subtle scent of discrimination.\n[40] In the employment context, two tests have been developed in the jurisprudence to assist a tribunal in the determination of whether a prima facie case of discrimination has been established.10 The first was articulated in the case of Shakes v. Rex Pak Ltd.11 The Ontario Board of Inquiry held, in that case, that a prima facie case could be established by proving:\nthat the complainant was qualified for the particular employment; that the complainant was not hired; and that someone no better qualified but lacking the distinguishing feature, which is the gravamen of the human rights complaint, subsequently obtained the position.\n[41] The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal developed a second test, in Israeli v. Canadian Human Rights Commission,12 to address situations where the complainant is qualified but is not hired, and the employer continues to look for a suitable candidate. In such cases, a prima facie case may be established by demonstrating:\nthat the complainant belongs to one of the designated groups under the Act; that the complainant applied and was qualified for a job that the employer wished to fill; that, although qualified, the complainant was rejected; and that, thereafter, the employer continued to seek applicants with the complainant's qualifications.\n[42] In several subsequent decisions of this Tribunal, it has been observed that while the Shakes and Israeli tests serve as useful guides, neither test should be automatically applied in a rigid or arbitrary fashion in every hiring case.13 The circumstances of each case should be considered to determine if the application of either of the tests, in whole or in part, is appropriate.\nIV. ANALYSIS A. Prima Facie case [43] The Complainant applied for the position in May 1998 and had she been hired, she would have begun work with a group of numerous other new recruits, who were to be trained in September for about a week, and then begin answering calls shortly thereafter. There do not appear to have been a finite number of job openings available. On the contrary, the Respondent was advertising on a regular basis for the recruitment of new TelNat employees. TelNat had an annual turnover rate that fell between 20% and 30%, and this necessitated an ongoing search on the Respondent's part to fill positions and ensure that the service was being provided to its customers. Moreover, TelNat was in the process of expanding at that time, which in turn, presumably, required the presence of a growing number of customer service representatives. Thus, while there were individuals from the Complainant's cohort of job applicants who were eventually hired, the Respondent continued to seek other applicants thereafter.\n[44] The Shakes test appears to contemplate circumstances where a complainant participates in a job competition against others for one or several specific positions. The test does not appear appropriate, however, in ongoing recruitment-type situations because, irrespective of whether the persons hired at a given moment lack the distinguishing feature of the complainant, other employment positions into which the complainant could potentially be hired continue to remain available. The Israeli test, on the other hand, by virtue of its fourth component, encompasses situations where an employer continues to seek job applicants. As such, the Israeli test is better suited to the facts that are before me, and my analysis, therefore, follows the stages advanced therein.\nB. The Complainant Belongs to One of the Designated Groups [45] As I have already mentioned, it is not in dispute in the present case that as a pre-operative transgendered person, the Complainant belonged to the group of persons who cannot be discriminated against on the basis of sex, under the Act.\nC. The Complainant Applied and Was Qualified for a Job the Employer Wished to Fill [46] The Complainant applied for a job that the Respondent undoubtedly wished to fill. The Respondent was engaged in an ongoing campaign for the recruitment of TelNat agents, and the Complainant sought to be one of those hired. Was she qualified for the job?\n[47] The Complainant had successfully passed through the first stage of the selection process. Although her briefing card stated that her emotionalism and social desirability remained to be addressed in the final interview, it was also specified that a candidacy could not be eliminated solely on account of these elements. The Complainant was later requested to submit, by exception, to a second, intermediate level interview. She passed this stage as well.\n[48] The Respondent suggested at the hearing that the Complainant lacked experience in customer sales and service, which was a required qualification according to the Respondent's newspaper advertisement. The facts do not support this submission. Her knowledge in sales consisted of her business experience, derived principally from the operation of a restaurant. This information was provided in the first two copies of her curriculum vitae that she sent to the Respondent by mail in early May 1998, and was repeated in the more complete version of the document that she gave to the Respondent during the second interview in July. Moreover, none of the documents spelling out the Respondent's assessment of the Complainant make mention of any weakness in this area. On the contrary, one finds in Ms. Cloutier's handwritten notes from the second interview, the following entry: sales = OK. The Respondent's records confirm that the Complainant also met the other two minimum requirements set out in the job ad, namely, possessing a Diploma of Collegiate Studies and being bilingual.\n[49] In the report prepared after the third interview, Ms. Lecompte and Ms. Roy noted that the Complainant had shown that she was in a position to take the Respondent's training and to hold the position of TelNat customer service representative. According to Ms. Roy, the job called for persons who could follow all the necessary training, and who would thereafter be able to appropriately answer customer inquiries. Ms. Roy testified that without any doubt, the Complainant possessed the abilities to perform all of these tasks. Ms. Roy's and Ms. Lecompte's stated concern with respect to the Complainant's candidacy lay, instead, with her being overqualified for the position. In their opinion, overqualified employees are more likely to lose their motivation to work, which in turn leads to poor performance or a premature departure from their job.\n[50] If a complainant is overqualified, does it mean that he or she is not qualified for the purposes of satisfying the second component of the Israeli test? I do not believe so. It seems counterintuitive to expect a complainant, who bears the burden of demonstrating that she was qualified for the position at issue, to exercise a certain self-restraint in leading evidence about her qualifications, for fear of crossing some imaginary Rubicon beyond which she will suddenly be deemed to have been overqualified and thereby, not qualified at all.\n[51] In my opinion, once a complainant has established that she was qualified for a position, and assuming that a prima facie case has been proven in all other requisite respects, it should then fall to the employer, in its explanation, to demonstrate that the complainant was overqualified for the job and that the refusal to hire her was justified as a result. Besides, from a practical perspective, an employer would certainly be better placed to demonstrate in what manner a complainant is overqualified for the position, than a complainant herself is able to demonstrate that she is not overqualified. For instance, in the present case, the evidence is that a majority of TelNat employees are university students. A number of the agents hold Bachelor level degrees, and there is definitely at least one Master's graduate who has been employed within the call centre. Mr. Alborino stated in his testimony that he imagines it is possible that persons with doctoral degrees have been hired at TelNat in the past. How then can the Complainant be expected to demonstrate that she is not overqualified when, based on these facts, there is no readily apparent point beyond which a job applicant ends up becoming overqualified for a TelNat position?\n[52] Thus, in answer to the second question of the Israeli test, I find that the Complainant applied and was qualified for a job that the Respondent wished to fill.\nD. Although Qualified, the Complainant's Candidacy was Rejected [53] The Respondent rejected the Complainant's candidacy although it took several months before she was formally advised of its decision.\nE. The Employer Continued to Seek Applicants with the Complainant's Qualifications [54] The Respondent continued its advertisements for the hiring of TelNat customer service representatives throughout 1998 and into 1999. The annual turnover rate of between 20% and 30% necessitated an ongoing renewal of staff. The Respondent's newspaper ads were all virtually identical and no changes were stipulated in the required job qualifications. I am, therefore, satisfied that the Respondent continued to seek applicants with the same qualifications as the complainant.\n[55] Each of the components of the Israeli test has been made out and consequently, the Complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination.\nF. Respondent's Explanation [56] The Respondent put forth essentially three explanations for not having hired the Complainant:\nthe Complainant was overqualified for the position; the Complainant's attitude during the final interview was not that of a person who wishes to serve the public, but was rather one of a person who is self-centred and condescending; the Complainant's real motive for applying was to use the position to promote the rights of transgendered persons.\n[57] The Respondent contends that it would not, under any circumstances, have hired the Complainant because she was overqualified. Employees, it is argued, whose skills and knowledge exceed the requirements of their position are more likely to lose interest in their jobs and perform inadequately, or even worse, quit their jobs altogether. The Respondent could not afford to allow such situations to develop since there is a cost involved in training a TelNat call centre employee, not to mention the operational difficulties that would result from an unexpected loss of personnel.\n[58] This explanation appears reasonable but I find, for the following reasons, that it is in fact, pretextual. During all of the Complainant's interviews, she dealt directly with the Respondent's concerns regarding her stability at this job. The Complainant stated repeatedly that she was seeking to make a change in her life and to that end she declared that she would move to Montreal and stay in the position for as long as required of her (perhaps as many as two to three years), before seeking a promotion. The Respondent acknowledged that, in fact, many TelNat employees seek and successfully end up gaining promotions within the Bank.\n[59] Furthermore, if indeed the Complainant were at risk of leaving her job prematurely, as alleged by the Respondent, it would not have been an extraordinary occurrence. Most TelNat call centre agents are students, and a good number of them typically do not remain in their positions for as long as two years. In fact, the 20% to 30% annual turnover rate suggests that many, if not the majority, of all employees do not stay in their jobs for a prolonged duration. Ms. Roy testified that twenty-four months is considered to be a long stay for a call centre employee.\n[60] The Complainant was fully aware of the tasks associated with frontline call centre work, no matter how menial. It was obvious that she nonetheless was deliberately seeking this employment in order to make a change in her life, and with the hope, or even the expectation, that a person with her talents would eventually rise up through the ranks of the company. After all, the Respondent's print ads for the job stated explicitly that employees would be offered the opportunity for a career plan that would be commensurate with their skills. Mr. Alborino testified that the majority of staffing actions, other than those at the lowest entry levels, are initially posted internally within the company. If this search does not prove fruitful, an external recruitment is organized. I accept the Complainant's evidence that she was mindful of this prospect of eventual advancement and that this topic formed part of her conversation with the interviewers.\n[61] So then, in light of her declared commitment to stay in the job in accordance with, if not beyond, all of the employer's expectations, why did the Respondent not take the Complainant at her word?\n[62] The answer lies in the Respondent's third explanation for not having hired the Complainant. It is clear from the evidence of Ms. Roy, Ms. Lecompte, and Ms. Cloutier that they had some difficulty understanding why a person with the Complainant's credentials would choose to work at an entry-level position. As Ms. Lecompte put it, she was perplexed by the Complainant's decision. The Complainant must have had some other motive. Ms. Roy and Ms. Lecompte believed to have found their answer during the informal conversation at the close of the interview. In hearing the Complainant's comments about the progress of minority groups over the last century and her statement that she is a persistent person who is prepared to break down doors, Ms. Roy and Ms. Lecompte concluded that her genuine motive for applying was to promote the rights of transgendered persons. It is noteworthy that the interviewers chose to end their report by advising that it would be risky to hire the Complainant in light of her remarks, not her qualifications.\n[63] Indeed, Ms. Roy testified that after hearing these comments, she concluded that the Complainant's real reason for seeking an entry-level position must be to become a pioneer who will make her condition publicly known. Ms. Roy added that the Respondent does not recruit employees in order to give them an opportunity to make their crusade. Yet, both interviewers acknowledged that the Complainant never said that she intended to do anything of the sort. In their report, it is stated that the Complainant told them she considered herself to be an ambassador of her `type', but at the hearing, Ms. Lecompte admitted that she had formulated this term herself and that the Complainant never actually made such an assertion.\n[64] Moreover, their concern was never put directly to the Complainant for an answer. She was never asked about her true motives or whether she intended to use her position as a promotional tool. I accept the Complainant's explanation with respect to her comments about the progress of various minority groups within society. In the context of the light conversation, or blah-blah-blah, the Complainant sought to make the point, in the same tone, that it was proper for the Respondent to allow transgendered persons to join its workforce, just as the door had been opened to others in the past.\n[65] Mr. Alborino, in his capacity as the Respondent's Vice President (Human Resources), endorsed the findings of Ms. Roy and Ms. Lecompte. He believed that the Complainant was seeking a sort of platform to advance a personal interest and he affirmed, in his testimony, that there was no place for such activity within the bank. When pressed, however, neither he nor any of the other witnesses were able to satisfactorily explain how a call centre agent, whose tasks consist of answering calls from bank customers about branch locations, account balances and the like, would use this position as a platform for the rights of the transgendered. No one suggested, for instance, that the Complainant would somehow engage customers in conversations about transgendered rights. The Respondent's concerns appeared to basically centre on her motivation for the job; while the interest of other TelNat employees, such as university students, supposedly lay in performing the job's tasks and receiving a salary in return, the Complainant's interests would somehow lie elsewhere.\n[66] I find this contention troubling. If indeed the Complainant attaches some importance to the fact that she may be the first openly transgendered person to be hired by the Respondent, or any other Canadian bank for that matter, does this imply that her dedication to the job should be put in question, that her sincerity should be doubted? The advancement of human rights has been achieved over time through the actions of many individuals who have made great efforts and sacrifices in order to break through barriers, whether, for instance, to gain access to certain schools or to acquire the right to sit at the front of a bus. Their principal motivation may have been to bring an end to discrimination, but does this necessarily imply that they were not equally interested in earning an education or travelling to the other end of town?\n[67] In reality, the Respondent's rationale means that employment will be denied only to a member of the designated group (transgendered persons, in this case), for it is likely that this same individual would be the one to celebrate his or her achievement, and perhaps make it known to others. In so doing, the Respondent is effectively treating, as a factor in its decision not to hire, the candidate's status as a member of the designated group. It falls to reason that a similar job applicant who lacks the distinguishing feature that is the gravamen of the human rights complaint would not be denied the same employment opportunity on this basis. What is more disturbing in the present case, is that the Respondent's decision was based solely on its perception that the Complainant would act in what it considered to be an unacceptable fashion, without ever testing that perception by questioning the Complainant directly on the topic.\n[68] For all these reasons, I am satisfied that the Complainant's sex was a factor in the decision by the Respondent to refuse to offer her the TelNat position.\n[69] It was argued by the Respondent that the Complainant would not have been hired, in any event, because of her condescending and self-important tone noted by the interviewers during the formal first portion of the meeting. I am not persuaded, however, that this conclusion was drawn solely from observations gleaned during the first part of the interview. Ms. Roy testified that she came to this finding based on, for instance, the Complainant's comments about changes that she had made to her physical appearance and remarks about her prior military service. Ms. Roy also cited as an example, the photo that the Complainant presented of herself as a soldier, before her physical transformation. All of these occurred during the informal latter portion of the interview.\n[70] Ms. Roy explained that the problem with self-centred call centre agents who like to hear themselves talk, is that they occasionally engage customers in unnecessary conversation, which takes up their and the customer's time. It appears, however, that possessing such a tendency has not prevented other persons from being hired at the call centre. Ms. Roy pointed out that she must occasionally work on this aspect with respect to some of her employees. The fact that these persons are nonetheless employed by TelNat brings into question whether this explanation by the Respondent, for not having hired the Complainant, is just a pretext.\n[71] However, whether or not the explanation is deemed pretextual is, in the end, of no significance. I have already found that discrimination was a factor underlying the other two explanations provided. It is of no bearing, if, as the Respondent alleges, the principal reason for refusing to hire the Complainant was her alleged self-centredness. As the Federal Court of Appeal pointed out in Cranston v. Canada,14 the notion of proximate cause has no relevance under the Act. For there to be a finding of discrimination, it is sufficient that the discrimination be a basis for the employer's decision, it need not be the only reason.15\n[72] Although I have determined that the Respondent's conduct was discriminatory, I do not believe that its representatives demonstrated any intent to discriminate against the Complainant. To the contrary, I have no reason to doubt their declared sense of openness with respect to her transgendered status. It is settled law, however, that intent to discriminate is not a pre-condition to a finding of discrimination.16\n[73] To summarize, after having considered all of the evidence, I am satisfied that discrimination based on sex was a basis, at least in part, for the Respondent's decision not to hire the Complainant for the position of call centre agent at TelNat. The complaint is therefore substantiated.\nV. REMEDY [74] During the hearing, the Complainant requested that the Tribunal only determine the question of liability at this time. In the event of a finding of liability, the Tribunal would retain jurisdiction to hear, at a later time, evidence and arguments from the parties on the question of remedy. The Respondent did not object to this request and I therefore granted it. In light of my present finding that the complaint has been substantiated, I am retaining jurisdiction with respect to any remedy to which the Complainant may be entitled under the Act. In the event that the parties do not reach an agreement on this issue, they may contact the Tribunal Registry to arrange for additional hearing dates.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

ORDER\n[1] The Tribunal is called upon to rule on a motion brought by the Respondent whereby the latter seeks to have Mr. Tweten's complaint summarily dismissed before the commencement of the inquiry into his complaint.\nI. BACKGROUND [2] On September 9, 1998, Mr. Tweten filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) in which he alleges that he has reasonable grounds to believe that RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd. (Respondent) discriminated against him on the ground of disability by failing to accommodate him, by treating him differently in the course of employment and by refusing to allow him back to work, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act1. The record shows that the Commission referred Mr. Tweten's human rights complaint to the Tribunal on July 3, 2003 for it to institute an inquiry.\n[3] Following the filing of his human rights complaint with the Commission, Mr. Tweten filed a complaint of unjust dismissal under the Canada Labour Code. That complaint was heard on November 28, 2000.\n[4] In a decision dated December 29, 2000, the Canada Labour Code adjudicator, Ms. Donna C. Read, concluded that there was no evidence for her to find that this was a case of constructive unjust dismissal. Rather, she concluded that Mr. Tweten had quit his job. She thus dismissed Mr. Tweten's complaint.\nII. SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES [5] In its written submissions, the Respondent, relying on the doctrine of issue estoppel, not only argues that the Tribunal is barred from hearing Mr. Tweten's human rights complaint, but also that the complaint should be dismissed because it is frivolous, vexatious or otherwise made in bad faith as per s. 41(1)d) of the Act. The Respondent further argues that the complaint constitutes an abuse of process.\n[6] With respect to the estoppel issue, it appears from Respondent counsel's letter dated November 12, 2003 that the latter concedes that issue estoppel is impossible to apply to matters involving the Commission. That said, the Tribunal intends nonetheless to address this issue in its ruling.\n[7] As for the allegation that the complaint is frivolous, vexatious and made in bad faith, the Respondent refers to the fact that Mr. Tweten did not provide the Respondent, when asked, with relevant information supporting any ongoing limitations or accommodation requirements, that his complaint was investigated by three different investigators on behalf of the Commission over a period of 2 years following the filing of the complaint, that the last investigator recommended that the matter not proceed to the Tribunal, that the Commission nonetheless referred the matter to the Tribunal instead of dismissing the complaint.\n[8] Finally, with respect to the allegation that the complaint constitutes an abuse of process, the Respondent argues that all issues have been dealt with in prior proceedings, that for the Tribunal to proceed with the inquiry would allow for inconsistent findings amongst two federally appointed Tribunals (sic) (Labour Board and the Human Rights Tribunal) which would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Furthermore, the Respondent argues that Mr. Tweten has had his claims against the Respondent heard in two other forums at great expense for the Respondent.\n[9] In support of the above allegations, the Respondent relies mainly on the decisions rendered in Barter v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia2 and Toronto (City) v. Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 79 (C.U.P.E.)3.\n[10] For its part, the Commission contends that the doctrine of issue estoppel has no application to this case. In support of its position, it relies on the ruling of this Tribunal in Desormeaux v. Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission4 as well as on the decision rendered by the Supreme Court of Canada in Angle v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue - M.N.R.)5.\n[11] As for the other two grounds, i.e. that the complaint is frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith and that it constitutes an abuse of process, the Commission submits that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to consider these arguments. In this regard, the Commission relies on the decision rendered by this Tribunal in Roch v. Maltais Transport Lte and Gatan Maltais6.\n[12] On the whole, the Commission argues that the decision to refer a complaint to the Tribunal is solely within the discretion of the Commission pursuant to section 49(1) of the Act and that once a complaint has been referred to the Tribunal, the latter has no discretion but to institute an inquiry as provided by subsection 49(2) of the Act.\nIII. THE LAW A. Issue estoppel [13] As stated previously by this Tribunal in Desormeaux7, Parisien8 and Thompson9, issue estoppel is a public policy doctrine designed to advance the interests of justice. Its object is to prevent parties from relitigating issues that have already been decided in other proceedings. The policy considerations underlying the doctrine include the need to have an end to litigation, as well as the desire to protect individuals from having to defend multiple legal proceedings arising out of the same set of circumstances. It is also meant to reduce the risk of inconsistent results if the same issue is pursued in multiple fora.\n[14] According to the case law10, for issue estoppel to be successfully invoked three preconditions or requirements must be met:\nthe issue must be the same as the one decided in the prior decision; the prior judicial decision must have been final; the parties to both proceedings must be the same or their privies11.\nThus, if one of the three preconditions or requirements is lacking, the doctrine does not apply.\nB. Frivolous, vexatious complaints and complaints made in bad faith [15] Section 41(1)d) of the Act provides that the Commission can dismiss a complaint found to be trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith. It must be noted here that this provision of the Act applies solely to the Commission and not to the Tribunal. Thus, the Tribunal's power to dismiss a frivolous, vexatious complaint or one made in bad faith, cannot be derived from this provision of the Act. This said, section 53(1) of the Act provides however that, at the conclusion of an inquiry, the Tribunal is entitled to dismiss a complaint if it finds that the latter is not substantiated.\n[16] It thus appears that, under the scheme of the Act, once a complaint has been referred to the Tribunal, the only avenue open to it is to hold an inquiry into the complaint unless the delays associated with the human rights process violate section 7 of the Charter12 or if, as will be seen hereafter, there is an abuse of process. In those circumstances, it is open to the Tribunal to forgo holding an inquiry. Short of such findings, the Tribunal has no discretion with respect to holding or not an inquiry into a complaint.\n[17] Furthermore, it must be noted that the Tribunal has no authority under the Act to review a decision of the Commission to refer a complaint to the Tribunal. As stated in Oster13 and restated in many other decisions of this Tribunal14, the Tribunal does not exercise supervisory jurisdiction over the actions and decisions of the Commission. These matters lie within the exclusive purview of the Trial Division of the Federal Court.\n[18] Hence, if a respondent is of the view that the Commission's decision to refer a complaint to the Tribunal is unjustified or ill-founded, the only recourse available to that respondent is to seek the judicial review of the Commission's decision before the Federal Court15.\nC. Abuse of process [19] The doctrine of abuse of process is used in a variety of legal contexts. Among other things, the doctrine is used to deal with the relitigation of issues finally decided in a previous judicial proceeding. As stated by Justice Arbour in Toronto (City) v. Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 79 (C.U.P.E.), Canadian courts have applied the doctrine of abuse of process to preclude relitigation in circumstances where the strict requirements of issue estoppel (typically the privity\/mutuality requirements) are not met, but where allowing the litigation to proceed would nonetheless violate such principles as judicial economy, consistency, finality and the integrity of the administration of justice16. Justice Arbour further adds that the doctrine of abuse of process has been extended beyond the strict parameters of res judicata while borrowing much of its rationales and some of its constraints and that the policy grounds supporting abuse of process by relitigation are the same as the essential policy grounds supporting issue estoppel17.\n[20] For the Tribunal to find that a referral constitutes an abuse of process, the Tribunal must be convinced that the proceedings, if they were to go ahead, would be oppressive or vexatious and would violate the fundamental principles of justice underlying the community's sense of fair play and decency.\nIV. ANALYSIS [21] The Tribunal will now proceed to examine and dispose of each of the arguments raised by the Respondent in its preliminary motion.\nA. Issue estoppel [22] In his letter dated November 12, 2003, Counsel for the Respondent concedes that at least one of the three preconditions for issue estoppel to apply is not met, i.e. identical parties. He further acknowledges that, in the end, it is impossible to apply issue estoppel to matters involving the Commission. The Tribunal agrees.\n[23] As stated by the former chairperson of the Tribunal in Desormeaux18 and Parisien19, as well as in Thompson20, the Commission is not a privy of a complainant and does not represent the complainant. The Commission and the complainant are distinct parties to the inquiry under the Act, each having a specific role, the role of the Commission being that of representing the public interest.\n[24] These views are in keeping with the decision rendered by the Supreme Court of Canada in Toronto (City) v. Canadian Union of Public Employees21 where Justice Arbour, after having carefully reviewed the state of the law on this aspect of the doctrine, stated that she saw no need to reverse or relax the long-standing application of the mutuality requirement (third precondition).\n[25] It thus follows that the parties to the proceedings before the Canada Labour Code adjudicator and the Tribunal are not the same. Hence, the Tribunal concludes that at least one of the three elements required for the doctrine of issue estoppel to apply in the present case is absent.\n[26] Though this finding is in itself sufficient to dispose of the estoppel issue, the Tribunal is also of the view that the issue now before it was never squarely addressed by the Canada Labour Code adjudicator in her decision. This matter will further be dealt with in relation to the issue of abuse of process.\nB. The complaint is frivolous, vexatious or otherwise made in bad faith [27] The fact that, in relation to his labor law complaint, Mr. Tweten did not provide the Respondent with information on his physical limitations or accommodation requirement does not constitute a sufficient reason for the Tribunal to conclude that Mr. Tweten's complaint is frivolous, vexatious or otherwise made in bad faith and to bring about a dismissal of Mr. Tweten's complaint at this stage of the proceedings. Nor does the finding by the Labour Code adjudicator that Mr. Tweten quit his job.\n[28] One must not forget that both the Complainant and the Commission are parties to the present proceedings and that both have a right to be heard on the substantive human rights issues raised by the Complaint. The Complainant's failure to provide pertinent information on his condition as well as the compensation he received for his work injury are all matters that the Respondent will be able to raise in the course of the inquiry as a means of defense to the complaint.\n[29] In another vein, the fact that the complaint was investigated by three different investigators on behalf of the Commission over a period of two years following the filing of the complaint, that the last investigator recommended that the matter not proceed to the Tribunal and that the Commission nevertheless referred the complaint to the Tribunal are all matters that should have been part of a judicial review of the Commission's decision to refer the complaint to the Tribunal.\n[30] In the case at bar, the record shows that the Respondent did not seek judicial review of the Commission's decision to refer Mr. Tweten's complaint to the Tribunal. As stated previously, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to review that decision.\n[31] The Tribunal thus finds that Respondent's second preliminary objection is ill-founded.\nC. The complaint constitutes an abuse of process [32] Abuse of process has, in recent years, been raised several times by respondents to challenge the referral of a complaint by the Commission to the Tribunal22. The grounds for these challenges relate mainly to the alleged misconduct and delay of the Commission in processing and investigating a complaint. Many respondents seem to be offended by the fact that, in some cases, the referral is made even though the investigation report recommends the dismissal of the complaint.\n[33] In the case at bar, with respect to the issue of abuse of process, the Tribunal is called upon to determine if, in the course of the inquiry it is required to hold under the Act once a complaint has been referred to it, the issues litigated before the Labour Code adjudicator will be relitigated before it. The determination of this issue requires that the Tribunal closely examine the content of the decision rendered by Ms. Donna C. Read as was done in Barter23.\n[34] After reviewing the facts of the case, Ms. Donna C. Read framed as follows the issues she had to decide24:\nWas Mr. Tweten out of time in making a complaint under section 240(2) of the Canada Labour Code because he made his complaint more than 90 days from the date on which the person making the complaint was dismissed? If not, was Mr. Tweten unjustly dismissed? If he was unjustly dismissed, what is the appropriate remedy?\n[35] In his human rights complaint, Mr. Tweten alleges that he has reasonable grounds to believe that the Respondent has discriminated against him on the ground of disability by failing to accommodate him, by treating him differently in the course of employment and by refusing to allow him back to work contrary to section 7 of the Act.\n[36] In view of the allegations contained in Mr. Tweten's human rights complaint, the issues now before the Tribunal appear to be the following:\nWas Mr. Tweten discriminated against on the ground of disability contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act? did the Respondent fail to accommodate him? was Mr. Tweten treated differently in the course of employment? did the respondent refuse to allow Mr. Tweten back to work?\n[37] It thus appears that the main issue before Ms. Read was whether Mr. Tweten was dismissed or not from his job and if he was, was the dismissal unjust under the provisions of the Canada Labour Code whereas the main issue that the Tribunal has to decide is whether Mr. Tweten has been the victim of a discriminatory practice within the meaning of the Act in relation to an existing disability. These are two very different issues.\n[38] As to the issue of accommodation, it must be noted here that Ms. Read clearly stated in her decision that the parties never got to the point where the issue of what would be an appropriate accommodation was addressed25. Thus, this issue still remains to be decided.\n[39] Hence, the Tribunal is of the view that the issues that were before Ms. Read don't stand to be relitigated before the Tribunal. There is thus no real risk of having two divergent decisions on the same issues and of having the integrity of the judicial process negatively affected and its credibility undermined by different findings26.\nV.

Introduction [1] This Tribunal rendered a decision on November 23, 2001 [the 2001 decision]. Further to a judicial review of that decision, Mr. Justice No\u00ebl issued a ruling dated May 27, 2003 (2003 FCT 660).\nII. Federal Court Decision [2] In his decision, Mr. Justice No\u00ebl ruled:\nThe Tribunal referred in passing to the universality of service principle as it was in 1996 when the decision to release Mr. Irvine was made. In my opinion, it failed to recognize the existing jurisprudence of that period, confirming that the issue of universality of service is a bona fide occupational requirement. More importantly, the Tribunal dismissed the fact that this jurisprudence was the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation of a statute. The Tribunal had to consider the applicable law in 1996 and determine if there had been direct discrimination against Mr. Irvine, and if so, whether the medical standard required of him was a bona fide occupational requirement by which the CAF would be exempted from the duty to accommodate. [para 25]\nThe Federal Court observed that in 1995 and 1996, when the CAF made the decisions concerning Mr. Irvine\u2019s career in the military, the law was as stated by the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada (Attorney General) v. St. Thomas and Canadian Human Rights Commission[1], Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Armed Forces)[2], and Canada (Attorney General) v. Robinson[3] [respectively St. Thomas, Husband, Robinson] and by the Supreme Court of Canada in Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta (Human Rights Commission) 1990 2 S.C.R. 489 [Central Alberta Dairy Pool].\nFurther to this jurisprudence, at that point in time, there was no duty to accommodate in cases of direct discrimination. In Mr. Irvine\u2019s case, the discrimination constituted direct discrimination. Therefore, further to the jurisprudence of that time period, the CAF had no legal duty to accommodate Mr. Irvine. Furthermore, Mr. Justice No\u00ebl observed that the requirement for a member to be liable to perform combat duty or to be a soldier first was recognized as a statutory obligation in Robinson. Therefore, according to the trilogy of cases which applied in 1996, the universality of service principle required every CAF member to be fit at all times for combat duty. Thereafter, this was recognized by Parliament in its 1998 amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, as amended, with the addition of subsection 15(9). No\u00ebl J. ruled that this Tribunal had correctly applied Meiorin retroactively, but that it failed to analyze it in the context of the universality of service principle. This principle was found by the Federal Court of Appeal to have a statutory source in the National Defence Act R.S.C. 1985, c. N-5. No\u00ebl J. was troubled by the minimal wording used by this Tribunal in discussing universality of service principles and found that this Tribunal insufficiently addressed this issue. The Federal Court concluded that the Tribunal ought to have considered, in its analysis and application of British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3, also known as Meiorin, the intention of Parliament and the Court\u2019s interpretation of the legislation establishing and implementing the universality of service principle at the time of the decision in 1996.\n[3] With respect to alleged errors of fact, Mr. Justice No\u00ebl chose not to address these in light of the above decision. In granting the judicial review application, he ordered that the matter be sent back for re-determination without costs.\nIII. Re-determination [4] This decision constitutes a re-determination of the case further to the said order of the Federal Court of Canada. Oral submissions and written submissions were received from the Commission, Mr. Irvine and the respondent, Canadian Armed Forces (CAF).\nA. Tribunal Decision 2001 \u2013 Re-Determination In Light Of Universality of Service [5] In the 2001 decision, I made findings of fact contained in paragraphs 3 - 102. I had outlined legal principles in paragraphs 103 - 113 and analysis in paragraphs 114 - 163. Within this prior grouping, I had made evidentiary findings in paragraphs 122 - 124. My conclusion and remedial award are found at paragraphs 164 - 165.\n[6] In this re-determination, for the reasons cited below, I place no weight on facts contained in paragraphs 36 - 57 and I find that paragraphs 151 and 154 - 163 of my analysis are no longer pertinent.\n(i) Findings of Fact [7] The Commission submits that the Federal Court did not rule with respect to the facts and that therefore the facts as originally found are to be left undisturbed. The Commission submits that this Tribunal is bound by its previous findings of fact and that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction to disturb them: this would require the Tribunal to sit as an appellate court in review of its own decision. Thus the Commission argues that paragraphs 3 - 102 of the original decision are not to be disturbed. The respondent argues that each of the paragraphs that address and apply universality of service, including paragraphs 36 - 57 and 125 - 163, must be re-considered.\n[8] In dealing with paragraphs 36 - 57 [facts pertaining to General Military Duties and Universality of Service Principles; CAF December 1999 Universality of Service Policies; CAF Pre-December 1999 Accommodation Policies and Post December 1999 Policies; CAF November 2000 Accommodation Policies; CAF General Military Duties and Universality of Service], I note that these paragraphs address post-1996 policies, policies concerning the assignment of occupational factors (the O factor), and post-termination CAF accommodation policies. These facts are based upon the evidence adduced at the hearing, but I place no weight on these in my re-determination of the 2001 decision as only the G factor is at issue in Mr. Irvine\u2019s case, and the post-termination policies, particularly with respect to CAF accommodation are not relevant.\n[9] In dealing with paragraphs 58 - 102 [Mr. Irvine\u2019s Particular Circumstances and Relevant Medical Data], I continue to find that these paragraphs contain the facts of Mr. Irvine\u2019s case.\n(ii) Legal Principles [10] In addressing paragraphs 103 - 113 [Legal Principles], I amend those that address universality of service to include my comments on these principles set out below.\n[11] Regarding paragraphs 114 - 121 [Analysis], I continue to find that the Commission and Mr. Irvine established a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of disability against Mr. Irvine both in its termination of Mr. Irvine, contrary to s. 7 of the Act, and in its policies and procedures as applied to Mr. Irvine, contrary to s. 10 of the Act.\n[12] Regarding paragraphs 122 - 124 [Evidentiary Issues], the Commission argues that I should continue to be bound by the original decision. The Respondent has not taken specific exception to the same. I have reviewed the same and continue to maintain the same findings.\n[13] In dealing with paragraph 125 [Universality of Service], I reconsider it as per my discussions on Universality of Service below.\n[14] In dealing with paragraphs 126 - 132 [Identifying the Standards Leading to Mr. Irvine\u2019s Release], I continue to find that these three dispositive medical assessments of Dr. Kafka, the CAD Committee and the Career Board assessed against the CAF standards being the 1979 CAF Policies and Bridging Policies, and the September 1995 Guidelines, regarding assignment of employment limitations, are at issue in this re-determination.\n[15] In addressing paragraphs 133 - 136 wherein the analysis outlined in Meiorin was conducted [Rational Connection and Was the Standard Adopted in Good Faith], I continue to find that the CAF standards were rationally connected to its goal of requiring that Mr. Irvine be a soldier first. As well, I continue to find that both the standards and the medical \/ career assessments, including the CAD Committee assignment of employment limitations, were made in good faith.\n[16] In addressing paragraphs 137 - 140 [the Reasonable Necessity and Accommodation portion of the Meiorin test], I continue to find that the Bridging Policies were not as accommodating as the September 1995 Guidelines. My findings in these paragraphs remain intact.\n[17] In addressing paragraphs 141 - 148 [Dr. Kafka\u2019s Assessment; CAD Committee and Career Board Assessments], I continue to find that the concerns I expressed in these paragraphs are pertinent to the re-determination. In accordance with Meiorin, the standards for assessing universality of service must be as accommodating as possible, or in other words, individualized. Having found as such, a discussion of the crux of Mr. Irvine\u2019s case and my reasons are reiterated below.\n[18] With respect to paragraphs 149 - 150 [Proportionate and Measured Expectations of Those With Disabilities], I continue to find that CAF\u2019s individual testing of Mr. Irvine was applied more vigorously to exclude him from service when he was disabled than other testing was applied to able bodied members. I continue to find that the CAF should have provided Mr Irvine with further opportunity to take another EXPRES test, to the extent that such testing would have assisted with prediction of mortality and morbidity.\n[19] With respect to paragraph 151 of the 2001 decision, I find that it is superfluous because it deals only with the occupational factor (O factor) which was not determinative in Mr. Irvine\u2019s release.\n[20] With respect to paragraphs 152 - 153 [Subjective Nature of Assignment of Limitations and Category], I continue to find that the inexact nature of category assignment by the CAF is a factor that further casts doubt upon the validity of the CAF\u2019s category assignment of Mr. Irvine (further elaborated upon below).\n[21] With respect to paragraph 154 [Imposition of Medical Conditions], I do not find it necessary to maintain this concern in disposing of Mr. Irvine\u2019s complaint, as Mr. Irvine\u2019s access to medical information about his condition was not determinative in this case.\n[22] With respect to paragraphs 155 - 163 [dealing with accommodation of unfit members, deployability, retention, and costs of accommodation], I find that these paragraphs cannot be sustained in light of universality of service principles.\n[23] With respect to paragraphs 164 - 165 [Conclusion and Remedies], I maintain my original ruling as set out below.\n[24] The prior analysis is made with the express acknowledgement that a member of the CAF is liable for combat duty. I have reconsidered each paragraph of the 2001 decision in light of universality of service principles more thoroughly canvassed below.\nB. Reasons (i) Party Submissions Regarding Direction of the Federal Court [25] The Commission and Mr. Irvine submit that the Federal Court\u2019s decision herein is based upon a narrow and discreet issue of law: the Court has asked the Tribunal to reconsider its decision having regard to the principle of universality of service. Given that the Federal Court has directed the Tribunal to re-consider its decision in accordance with the principles of universality of service, the Commission argues that the Court has also conversely confirmed that the Tribunal has correctly applied Meiorin retroactively. The Commission submits that the only issue for the Tribunal to decide is whether the CAF has met the third part of the Meiorin test.\n[26] With respect to the CAF\u2019s duty to accommodate, the Commission submits that the exemption which the CAF enjoys pursuant to universality of service is as follows: once a CAF member is found not to meet the medical standards, and thereby does not satisfy the principles of universality of service, the CAF is not under an obligation to prove that it would suffer an undue hardship if it was required to accommodate the member through whatever means available. The Commission submits, however, that in all other respects the Meiorin test applies. In other words, the CAF still bears the onus of showing that its medical standards are reasonably necessary for the achievement of their general purpose. In this respect, the medical standards themselves must allow for individual assessment and be applied in a procedurally fair manner.\n[27] Conversely, the respondent argues that the medical limitation at issue, being G4 physician services required was reasonably necessary to protect the complainant and the CAF from the risks of heart failure and to preserve the principle of universality of service. It argues that the medical standard at issue constitutes a BFOR because the complainant was at a serious risk of another cardiac event. Thus, the CAF was not required to accommodate the complainant following his diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) with significant risk of another event.\n[28] Secondly, the CAF further argues that the individual assessment conducted by the CAF\u2019s medical officers for the purpose of diagnosing the complainant\u2019s medical condition and estimating the risk of event recurrence is not reviewable by this Tribunal. It cites the decision of Canada (Attorney General) v. Anvari [1993] F.C.J. No. 317 (C.A.) [Anvari] as authority for this argument.\n[29] I will now address these arguments in re-determining this case.\nC. Universality of Service [30] Universality of service in the Canadian Armed Forces requires every member to be fit to be a soldier first. Universality of service is the term given to a set of principles which govern the service of members in the CAF. The Federal Court of Appeal articulated the principles in three cases decided in the early 1990s, St. Thomas, Husband and Robinson. Each of these cases turned on the issue of whether a military employment standard constituted a Bona Fide Occupational Requirement (BFOR).\n[31] Universality of service is comprised of three essential principles:\nWhatever their trade or profession might be, members of the CAF are soldiers first and foremost. The duty of a soldier is to be ready to serve at all times in any place and under any conditions. The duty is universal in that it applies to all members of the CAF.\n[32] In each of these trilogy cases, the Court of Appeal held that the medical standards at issue were reasonably necessary to assure the efficient and economical performance of universal military duties. As such, they were BFORs. These cases were adjudicated under the pre-Meiorin, bifurcated analysis of direct versus indirect discrimination arising out of Central Alberta Dairy Pool. In these cases, because the discrimination was direct discrimination, once a BFOR was established, the CAF was not obliged to accommodate the particular employees. The CAF had no duty to accommodate persons who did not comply with the principles of universal service.\n(i) The Duties of a Soldier [33] Regarding the second principle, the respondent submits that, as soldiers, members of the CAF play a unique role in Canadian society. I agree. Sections 31 and 33 of the National Defence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-5, provide that any member of the Canadian Forces may be placed on active service by reason of emergency for the defence of Canada, and is at all times liable to perform any lawful duty.\n[34] The Federal Court of Appeal emphasized the importance of this military context in St. Thomas at p. 677:\nIn my view, examination of this issue must take account of a contextual element to which the Tribunal did not give sufficient consideration. It is that we are here considering the case of a soldier. As a member of the Canadian Forces, the respondent, St. Thomas, was first and foremost a soldier. As such, he was expected to live and work under conditions unknown in civilian life and to be able to function, on short-notice, in conditions of extreme physical and emotional stress and in locations where medical facilities for the treatment of his condition might not be available or, if available, might not be adequate. This, it seems to me, is the context in which the conduct of the Canadian Forces in this case should be evaluated.\n(ii) The Duties Are Universal [35] The duties of a soldier are universal in the sense that every member of the CAF must be able to perform them. In Robinson, the Court of Appeal quashed a Tribunal decision that a seizure-free medical policy could not be justified because the Forces had not shown that it was likely that the complainant would be assigned to a combat position. The Court of Appeal held, at p. 238, that the Tribunal had erred in requiring such proof:\n\u2026[T]he tribunal erred in the way it dealt with the applicant\u2019s argument. That argument was neither hypothetical nor specious. The statute rendered Mr. Robinson liable for combat duty. It is an obligation well understood within the Armed Forces. Those serving in support roles are not exempt. Performance of the obligation depends neither on a transfer to a combat role nor on remustering. The Tribunal\u2019s view to the contrary led to the rejection of the applicant\u2019s argument and to the conclusion, erroneous in my view, that somehow the applicant was required to adduce additional evidence showing the number of non-combat personnel transferred to combat functions over a period of time. That view simply ignores that the obligation is one that is imposed by statute. Administrative practice cannot work a modification. The statute binds.\nThe Court of Appeal went on to hold that the CAF was not obliged to show that the complainant was likely to be deployed to a combat role.\n[36] I find that the CAF was entitled to require that every member of the CAF meet these principles of universality of service. This conclusion is underscored by the stated jurisprudence, the prior human rights jurisprudence of direct discrimination relevant to the actions of the CAF in 1995 and 1996, and the direction of Mr. Justice No\u00ebl. In other words, once the CAF established a BFOR in the context of combat duty, the CAF is exempted from its duty to accommodate Mr. Irvine in non-combat duties.\nD. Meiorin [37] However, this finding does not end the inquiry into Mr. Irvine\u2019s case. While the CAF is entitled to require that every member be a soldier first, it must still demonstrate, in accordance with Meiorin, that the standards that it has developed to assess universality of service allow for individual testing. I have already found, in my original decision, that the CAF has met the first two criteria of the Meiorin tests in that the 1979 Policies, the Bridging Policies and the September 1995 Guidelines were rationally connected to the CAF\u2019s goal of requiring that Mr. Irvine be able to safely and efficiently perform his duties as a soldier, and that these standards were adopted in good faith.\n[38] The third portion of the Meiorin analysis requires that the impugned standards be reasonably necessary for the employer to accomplish its purpose; i.e. the safe and efficient performance of the job. The CAF must establish that it cannot accommodate the complainant and others adversely affected by the standard without experiencing undue hardship. The CAF must ensure that the procedure, if any, to assess the issue of accommodation, addressed the possibility that it may discriminate unnecessarily on a prohibited ground. Second, the substantive content of either a more accommodating standard which was offered by the CAF, or alternatively the CAF\u2019s reasons for not offering any such standard must be assessed. As I have already found at paragraph 139 of the 2001 decision, the September 1995 guidelines, to the extent that they allowed for individual assessment, were reasonably necessary to accomplish the CAF\u2019s goal of ensuring that members meet universality of service. Thus they evidenced a more accommodating standard in assessing members suffering from CAD than the prior 1979 standards and bridging policies. Yet the CAF failed to use a more individualized accommodating standard, such as that found in the September 1995 guidelines, in assessing Mr. Irvine, (further elaborated upon below).\nE. Anvari [39] The respondent submits that as per Anvari, the diagnostic testing of the CAF is beyond the expertise and jurisdiction of this Tribunal. This point of law is not cited by No\u00ebl J. as a basis for the judicial review of the original decision. For that matter, it was not argued before me at the original hearing. Thus, I do not believe that this argument is properly before me. Even if I am wrong on this point, I find that Anvari must be read in the context of the totality of the jurisprudence of the Federal Court in this area.\n(i) The Direction in Anvari [40] I have carefully reviewed Anvari, a case dealing with the medical inadmissibility of a potential immigrant further to the federal Immigration Act. In this case, the complaint was framed on the basis of s. 5, being the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public. The Court ruled that a Tribunal cannot require as a part of the bona fide justified defence that the respondent demonstrate that the standard had been applied in a reasonable fashion, or that its application was justified in the particular case.\n[41] Anvari must be read in conjunction with other Federal Court jurisprudence in the area. For example, in A.G. v. Levac [1992] 3 F.C.463 (F.C.A.), a case dealing with s. 7(a) discrimination wherein the CAF tried to establish a BFOR, Mr. Justice D\u00e9cary, ruled that the Tribunal had not committed a reviewable error in its assessment of the medical evidence, nor reached a conclusion that it could not reasonably reach in preferring the evidence of the complainant\u2019s physician, who had examined him, to that of the CAF\u2019s physician, whose evidence had been based upon a review of his medical record, rather than upon an examination. D\u00e9cary J.A. expressly upheld the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the CAF\u2019s medical assessment. In Canada (A.G.) v. Beaulieu [1993] F.C.J. No.174, 103 D.L.R. (4th) 217 (C.A.), another case dealing with the CAF\u2019s BFOR defence in the context of both a complaint based upon sections 7(a) and 10 of the Act, the Federal Court of Appeal held that a Tribunal could not find a complaint of discrimination invalid merely because it was persuaded that a diagnosis of disability was incorrect. Yet, the Tribunal could have been further satisfied that, either, the diagnosis was arrived at imprudently, in which case it could perhaps have spoken of a disguised discrimination and a false and hasty perception, or that the requirement was not a BFOR. For that matter, Anvari speaks of the ability of the Tribunal to deal with the discriminatory application of a standard or practice. Mahoney J.A. writes:\n\u2026For jurisdiction to arise under the CHRA, the provision must have been applied in a discriminatory fashion. Unless a prima facie case of a discriminatory practice on the part of the medical officers in reaching their opinion were established, there was no onus on them to show that their opinion was bona fide justified. It may have been reached wrongly as a matter of law or it may have been reached in the teeth of the evidence and, if it was, a remedy exists elsewhere but, unless a discriminatory practice is established in the application of subsection 19(1)(a), no remedy exits under the CHRA. Put another way, the discriminatory practice mandated by subsection 19(1)(a) being bona fide justified, the question for decision under the CHRA was not whether their opinion was probably right but whether, in carrying out their duties, the medical officers engaged in a discriminatory practice that is not likewise bona fide justified.\nIn other words, analogizing this ruling to Mr. Irvine\u2019s case, medical officers and committees must carry out their duties in a non-discriminatory fashion. In Mr. Irvine\u2019s case, as set out below, the officers and committees in favour of assigning him a G4 category, failed to provide Mr. Irvine with an individual assessment consistent with the most accommodating policies of the CAF. Their individual assessments did not adhere to the letter or the spirit of the individualized approach mandated by the CAF September 1995 guidelines. Their pattern of decision making and their decisions regarding employment limitations discriminated against him on the basis of disability and are caught within the purview of both sections 7 and 10 of the Act.\n[42] In a subsequent decision concerning s. 7 of the Act, the Federal Court Trial Division in VIA Rail Canada v. Mills [1997] F.C.J. No. 1089, in distinguishing Beaulieu, upheld the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to find that the respondent had not performed an adequate and comprehensive investigation into the medical evidence. Mr. Justice Teitelbaum wrote:\nThere is also no suggestion in the Tribunal\u2019s decision that it did not have regard to the material before it. The Tribunal carefully examined Mr. Mills' rather involved medical history and did not confine its discussion of the varied consultations and medical opinions to the primary August 1991 incident. The Tribunal analyzed and sifted through a diversity of relevant medical opinions, including those expressed before, during and after the August 1991 injury and abortive return to work in October 1991....\nThe Tribunal's finding that VIA had not performed an adequate and comprehensive investigation into the medical evidence does not therefore warrant judicial review.\nHere, the Court held that it was open to the Tribunal to give more weight to the opinion of a particular physician over that of another, and to prefer the evidence of physicians who had examined the complainant over that of those physicians who had conducted only a paper review.\n[43] Based upon the totality of the jurisprudence, and the statutory provisions of s.7 and s. 10 of the Act, it appears that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to deal with both discriminatory, and arbitrary, hasty, imprudent or inadequate medical assessments in the application of standards proffered as BFORs. To state otherwise, would be to undermine the entire purpose of human rights legislation. For example, a respondent could establish that a standard constitutes a BFOR, and then despite discriminatory, hasty or deliberate misapplication of the standard to the complainant, justify the complainant\u2019s dismissal. In other words, the respondent would accomplish indirectly, what it is prohibited from doing directly.\n(ii) Application to Mr. Irvine\u2019s Case [44] In Mr. Irvine\u2019s case, the issue of attacking the diagnosis of CAD does not arise. The diagnosis is not in dispute. Rather, the issue remains that of whether the CAF conducted a non-discriminatory, adequate and comprehensive investigation into the medical evidence sufficient to justify its G4 employment limitation categorization and its prima facie discriminatory discharge of Mr. Irvine on the ground of disability. Did the CAF\u2019s individual assessment of Mr. Irvine, categorizing him as G4 (subject to discharge) versus G3 (retainable for service as a soldier), meet the requirement of individual testing consistent with the most accommodating standard available as per Meiorin and the stated Federal Court jurisprudence?\n[45] In Mr. Irvine\u2019s case, as per my findings of fact outlined in the 2001 decision at paragraphs 69 - 80, the CAF\u2019s physicians recommended contradictory employment limitation categories for Mr. Irvine. Some recommended G3O3, while others, including the CAD Committee, recommended G4O3. This difference in geographic factor between G3 versus G4 was the determinative factor in Mr. Irvine\u2019s release. For example, the CAF\u2019s consultant and Chief of Medicine, Dr. Buchholtz, examined Mr. Irvine in November 1994. Thereafter Mr. Irvine performed exceedingly well on a treadmill test. Mr. Irvine exhibited no chest discomfort or ischemia, had lost 35 pounds, and was completely asymptomatic. Dr. Buchholtz was tempted to recommend a G3O3 category which he believed was justified in the long term [para 70-71]. However, Dr. Buchholtz wrote that Mr. Irvine\u2019s cholesterol level was normal, when in fact in October 1994, a laboratory report confirmed that it was still high. Then on January 16, 1995, the CAF\u2019s Dr. MacKinnon, a base examining physician, recommended a G3O3 for Mr. Irvine, finding him fit for promotion. Thus at this point, Mr. Irvine was categorized by the CAF\u2019s physician as fit for retention and promotion.\n[46] However, Mr. Irvine\u2019s case was brought to the attention of Dr. Kafka, the base surgeon. On February 7, 1995, Dr. Kafka, the base surgeon, reviewed Mr. Irvine\u2019s chart from the perspective of risk factor control. Dr. Kafka expressed concerns about the G3 portion of the assessment. Dr. Kafka noted that Mr. Irvine was a former smoker; that in spite of significant weight reduction after the heart attack he was still heavier than he had been in 1990; and that his more recent cholesterol test showed higher cholesterol levels than those reviewed by Dr. Buchholtz in December 1994. Dr. Kafka confirmed that he had recommended a G3 category for a:\nsmall group of patients who, post bypass surgery, have no evidence of ischemia, have limited disease and have excellent control of their risk factors. W.O. Irvine will need to better control his diet and with the use of medication get his cholesterol down lower.\nDr. Kafka felt that if Mr. Irvine could reach a targeted LDL level (2.6), then a G3 category would not be unreasonable subject to the provision that Mr. Irvine was to be assessed with an exercise Mibi and that Mr. Irvine be given an angiography in another year. So even at this point, Dr. Kafka was prepared to recognize a conditional G3 category. While it was conditional upon Mr. Irvine\u2019s LDL level, his performance on another type of treadmill test (being an exercise Mibi), and an angiography, this was the view of the CAF\u2019s own physician. This view contemplated Mr. Irvine\u2019s retention.\n[47] Then, on July 4, 1995, Dr. Buchholtz again observed that Mr. Irvine had achieved an excellent exercise program and had been seen by the Dietary unit. Mr. Irvine\u2019s total cholesterol was lowered, although his LDL, being a specific type of cholesterol, was still above the target of 2.6. Dr. Buchholtz acknowledged Dr. Kafka\u2019s view and agreed that if risk factors were not modified, a G4 would be warranted. However, he noted that Mr. Irvine was exercising and following his diet. He felt that as long as he continued with his exercise program and risk modification, he would be fit for all activities, and a G3 would reflect his posting ability to both isolated and foreign duty. Thus, at this point, Dr. Buchholtz, with the benefit of Dr. Kafka\u2019s view, and the benefit of accurate medical data, contemplated a G3 category for Mr. Irvine based on his current exercise and diet program. Indeed, on July 11, 1995, Mr. Irvine was geographically upgraded to G3O3 with the notation medical condition requiring closer medical supervision.\n[48] Thus, the CAF\u2019s consultant and Chief of Medicine, Dr. Buchholtz, contemplated a G3O3 category for Mr. Irvine and Mr. Irvine was assigned this category. With this category, Mr. Irvine was entitled to retention in the CAF and met CAF Universality of Service criteria.\n[49] However, immediately thereafter, Mr. Irvine\u2019s career officer brought his file to the attention of other CAF staff, and his medical category was placed on hold pending a review of his file by the CAD Committee at DHTS. A new change of category form was issued with a G3O3 rating, but which indicated that the category was to be reviewed by the CAD Committee.\n[50] On August 30, 1995, a CAD Committee reviewed Mr. Irvine\u2019s medical file and noted that the consultant had recommended a G4O3, but if lipids come down, G3, and that a base surgeon had recommended G3O3 - closer medical supervision. Thus, the CAD Committee had two potentially conflicting employment limitation category assignments before it: one made by Dr. Buchholtz, Chief of Medicine, who had examined Mr. Irvine, and one made by Dr. Kafka, who had conducted a paper review of Mr. Irvine\u2019s file. There is little or no evidence that the CAD Committee carefully considered that Dr. Kafka was prepared to recommend a G3 category on the basis of better LDL levels, a new exercise Mibi and an angiography. There is little or no evidence that the CAD Committee carefully considered the extent of the congruence of the two opinions and their respective bases. There is little or no evidence that the CAD Committee chose to take measures to explore whether Mr. Irvine could have met the G3 rating, contemplated by its own physicians. Rather, the CAD Committee summarily and arbitrarily assessed him as unfit for two or more specific military environments and recommended a permanent medical category of G4.\n[51] Further, as per the 2001 decision, this CAD decision was made in accordance with the 1979 Policies for category assignment of the CAF [para 13 - 19] and \/ or the Bridging Policies [paragraph 18]. These 1979 standards and bridging policies, dealing with evaluation of medical condition and assignment of employment categories, did not provide for the individualized approach contemplated by the September 1995 Guidelines [para 20 -26, 138, 139]. The September 1995 Guidelines contemplated consultation amongst CAF staff in category assignment. Specifically in relation to CAD cases, they provided that NOT all members with coronary atherosclerosis were to be released. Thus, the CAF expressly, through its physicians and its policies, contemplated that a group of CAD patients was eligible for retention and could meet Universality of Service. As well, those September 1995 Guidelines contemplated, in cases of CAD, that many factors were to be used to identify the extent of disease and the functional capacity of the member, including the seven factors set out at paragraph 25 of my initial decision. I found that the respondent did not proffer sufficient evidence of the careful consideration of at least those seven factors, by the CAD Committee, in particular, the factors that Mr. Irvine did not have ischemia; that Mr. Irvine had performed well on prior treadmill testing and ought to have been given an opportunity to perform another one pre-release, in accordance with Dr. Kafka\u2019s early conditional assessment; that while Mr. Irvine exhibited a number of risk factors, he did not possess others such as hypertension or diabetes. Nor, is there sufficient evidence that the Committee obtained and considered carefully Mr. Irvine\u2019s ejection fraction which would have been helpful in determining both his functional capacity and the likelihood of another event, particularly if considered in conjunction with the results of an exercise Mibi [paragraphs 93 - 95, 144 - 146]. Thus, I had already found that the respondent led insufficient evidence that the CAD Committee, in its August 30, 1995 decision, and thereafter, adhered to the most accommodating and individualized standard available in assessing persons with CAD, such as that found in the September 1995 Guidelines. As per Meiorin the CAF had the duty of applying a more accommodating standard and \/ or had the onus of explaining satisfactorily its failure to use such an individualized approach.\n[52] In contrast, Dr. Buchholtz, who after examination and follow-up of Mr. Irvine, contemplated a G3 based on his individual and careful assessment of Mr. Irvine\u2019s condition. The CAD Committee decision struck me as having been made in a mechanical and impressionistic manner. I maintain my initial views expressed at paragraphs 143 - 150 of the 2001 decision to the extent that they relate to the geographic factor. Based on the views of Dr. Buchholtz and for all the reasons set out above, I continue to find the CAD Committee\u2019s decision discriminatory and based upon a hasty and inadequate consideration of Mr. Irvine\u2019s file.\n[53] As I have already ruled, the April 1996 Career Board review of Mr. Irvine\u2019s file did not correct these problems. Again, this Board simply accepted the CAD Committee recommendation in mechanical fashion and assigned Mr. Irvine the permanent medical category of G4O3. It failed, as did the CAD Committee, to provide for a current individualized assessment even though the September 1995 Guidelines were in force [para 143 - 148].\n[54] The respondent argues that neither further testing, nor additional time, nor different testing would have reduced or eliminated the risks posed by Mr. Irvine\u2019s cardiac condition. In so far as this argument addresses the liability of the CAF for discrimination, it fails to acknowledge that the CAF retained a group of cardiac patients post event as being capable of fulfilling combat duties. The CAF was required to take all steps possible pre-release to ensure that Mr. Irvine\u2019s ability to fall within this group was fully considered. The CAD Committee had to make thorough and careful consideration of at least the seven factors outlined in the September 1995 Guidelines, including current ejection fraction reading, assessment of the same in conjunction with an exercise Mibi, and thorough consultation with its own physicians including Dr. Buchholtz. The CAF\u2019s evidence itself established that additional testing would have been helpful to the CAD Committee; i.e. exercise Mibi and angiogram as per Dr. Kafka. In Mr Irvine\u2019s case, there was a very thin wedge between the assignment to him of a G3and a G4 rating. The CAF had to take all possible measures to fairly assess his ability to obtain a G3 pre-release and meet universality of service principles. The CAF had the onus of demonstrating that more probably than not Mr. Irvine would have received a G4 rating had such measures been attended to. Based on the facts of this case, I do not accept that the CAF met this onus.\nIV. Conclusion [55] For all of the reasons cited I continue to find that the CAF adversely differentiated against Mr. Irvine during Mr. Irvine\u2019s employ, on the basis of his disability, in the stated identified policies governing Mr. Irvine as a member with coronary artery disease and in its medical assessments of his condition and in its assignments of employment limitations to him. The CAF was entitled to require that Mr. Irvine meet universality of service principles: indeed each of its standards were based on the requirement that members be fit to be soldiers first. However, the CAF failed to establish that it applied those very standards to him in a discriminatory free manner. It thus failed to establish on a balance of probabilities a BFOR with respect to either the section 7 or section 10 complaints.\nV. Remedies [56] Again, as per the 2001 decision, I decline to address the issue of damages at the request of the parties but retain jurisdiction to hear evidence on the same if the parties cannot reach consensus.\nSigned by\nShirish P.

INSTRUCTION\nII. COMP\u00c9TENCE DU TRIBUNAL POUR ENTENDRE LA REQU\u00caTE DE L'INTIM\u00c9E\nIII. COMP\u00c9TENCE EXCLUSIVE DE L'ARBITRE\nIV. CONCLUSION\nI. INSTRUCTION [1] Le Tribunal est saisi de deux objections pr\u00e9liminaires, l'une soulev\u00e9e par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personnes (la Commission) et l'autre par Purolator Courrier Limit\u00e9e (l'intim\u00e9e) relativement \u00e0 une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 13 septembre 2000 par Robert Coulter (le plaignant).\n[2] Dans sa plainte, le plaignant all\u00e8gue que l'intim\u00e9e a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 son endroit en ne le traitant pas diff\u00e9remment, en refusant de [l'] accommoder et en [le] cong\u00e9diant, en raison de [sa] d\u00e9ficience, myopathie de Steinert contrairement \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi ).\n[3] Dans son objection pr\u00e9liminaire, l'intim\u00e9e soutient que le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour entendre la plainte puisque la question soulev\u00e9e dans celle-ci fait l'objet de griefs et qu'en cons\u00e9quence l'arbitre de grief est le tribunal comp\u00e9tent pour entendre et disposer de toute violation all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\n[4] Pour sa part la Commission soutient que le Tribunal n'est pas l'institution indiqu\u00e9e pour examiner l'objection pr\u00e9liminaire de l'intim\u00e9e et qu'il revient \u00e0 la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada d'effectuer le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer l'affaire au Tribunal.\n[5] J'aborderai en premier lieu l'objection soulev\u00e9e par la Commission.\nII. COMP\u00c9TENCE DU TRIBUNAL POUR ENTENDRE LA REQU\u00caTE DE L'INTIM\u00c9E [6] Pour contester la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d'entendre la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e, la Commission se fonde notamment sur la d\u00e9cision du juge Gibson dans l'affaire Oster c. Section locale 400 (Section des services maritimes), International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union 1.\n[7] Bien qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement \u00e9tabli dans la d\u00e9cision Oster que le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour surveiller les mesures et les d\u00e9cisions prises par la Commission, ce qui revient exclusivement \u00e0 la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, je ne crois pas que la d\u00e9cision Oster appuie la position de la Commission en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[8] Selon la Commission, la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e constitue une contestation post facto de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission d'enqu\u00eater et de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer la plainte au Tribunal. Cette requ\u00eate serait en fait une contestation par l'intim\u00e9e de l'exercice par la Commission de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par l'article 41 de la Loi et plus sp\u00e9cifiquement en l'esp\u00e8ce par l'alin\u00e9a (1)a) 2 de cet article. Si tel \u00e9tait le cas, une telle contestation aurait d\u00fb effectivement \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale comme le pr\u00e9voit la d\u00e9cision dans l'arr\u00eat Oster.\n[9] Toutefois, la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e ne constitue pas une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire par le Tribunal de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer le cas du plaignant au Tribunal. Au contraire, l'intim\u00e9e conteste la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d'instruire la plainte puisque qu'elle soutient que la question soulev\u00e9e dans celle-ci fait l'objet de griefs et qu'en cons\u00e9quence l'arbitre de grief est le seul tribunal comp\u00e9tent pour entendre et disposer de celle-ci.\n[10] Comme le souligne la pr\u00e9sidente Mactavish (tel \u00e9tait alors son titre):\nBien que le Tribunal ne puisse r\u00e9examiner les d\u00e9cisions de la Commission, il ne s'ensuit pas de la d\u00e9cision Oster qu'une fois que la Commission a rendu une d\u00e9ci-sion discr\u00e9tionnaire, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 41 ou 44 de la Loi, le Tribunal n'a pas du tout comp\u00e9tence pour examiner les faits sous-jacents \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision.\n[]\nIl convient de tenir compte des pouvoirs qu'exerce la Commission au stade de l'en-qu\u00eate. La Commission est un organisme d'examen et non un organisme d\u00e9cisionnel et, \u00e0 l'encontre du Tribunal, n'est pas habilit\u00e9e \u00e0 rendre des d\u00e9cisions touchant des questions de droit g\u00e9n\u00e9rales. 3\n[11] En effet, en vertu du paragraphe 50(2) de la Loi, le Tribunal tranche les questions de droit et de fait dans les affaires dont il est saisi. La question soulev\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e, en l'esp\u00e8ce, est une question de droit dont peut \u00eatre saisi le Tribunal. Il revient clairement au Tribunal de d\u00e9terminer les limites de sa propre comp\u00e9tence. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis satisfait que j'aie comp\u00e9tence pour entendre la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e.\nIII. COMP\u00c9TENCE EXCLUSIVE DE L'ARBITRE [12] Selon les faits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9e dans sa requ\u00eate, au moment o\u00f9 sont survenus les faits ayant donn\u00e9 naissance au pr\u00e9sent diff\u00e9rend, le plaignant \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 syndiqu\u00e9, assujetti \u00e0 une convention collective de travail conclue entre le Conseil canadien des Teamsters et l'intim\u00e9e. Il appert que le plaignant a log\u00e9 au moins trois griefs contestant les mesures prises par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 son endroit. Ces griefs portent notamment sur les refus all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9e d'accommoder le plaignant. \u00c0 l'heure actuelle, ces griefs sont toujours pendants.\n[13] L'intim\u00e9e soutient qu'elle est consciente de l'existence d'un courant jurisprudentiel qui tend \u00e0 conf\u00e9rer au Tribunal la comp\u00e9tence requise pour trancher au m\u00e9rite le pr\u00e9sent litige. Cependant, elle ajoute que ce courant jurisprudentiel doit maintenant \u00eatre revu \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada dans l'arr\u00eat Parry Sound (District) Social Services Administration Board c. S.E.E.F.P.O., section locale 324 ( Parry Sound ).4\n[14] Dans Parry Sound, la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, avait \u00e0 se prononcer sur l'application des lois ayant trait aux droits de la personne et des autres lois ayant trait \u00e0 l'emploi dans le cadre de la convention collective. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle devait d\u00e9cider si l'arbitre des griefs est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 faire respecter les droits et les obligations pr\u00e9vus par ces lois.\n[15] Dans cette affaire Madame O'Brien, une employ\u00e9e \u00e0 l'essai, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e par son employeur peu de temps apr\u00e8s son retour d'un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Convaincue d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e sans motif, de mani\u00e8re arbitraire, discriminatoire et injuste, elle avait aussit\u00f4t r\u00e9agi en logeant un grief contre son ancien employeur. Devant le Conseil d'arbitrage \u00e9tabli en vertu de la Loi sur les relations de travail 5 , l'employeur a fait valoir que le Conseil n'avait pas comp\u00e9tence sur la question faisant l'objet du grief puisque l'article 8.06a) de la convention collective pr\u00e9voyait que l'employeur peut, \u00e0 son enti\u00e8re discr\u00e9tion, cong\u00e9dier un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 l'essai pour tout motif qu'il juge acceptable et une telle mesure ne peut faire l'objet d'un grief ni \u00eatre soumise \u00e0 l'arbitrage et ne constitue pas un diff\u00e9rend entre les parties.\n[16] En d\u00e9pit du libell\u00e9 de la convention collective, le Conseil a conclu que le grief \u00e9tait arbitrable au motif que les droits substantiels reconnus par le Code des droits de la personne 6 , \u00e9taient import\u00e9s dans la convention collective relevant de la comp\u00e9tence de l'arbitre de grief. C'est cette d\u00e9cision qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e jusqu'en Cour supr\u00eame du Canada.\n[17] La Cour supr\u00eame, dans une d\u00e9cision majoritaire, a reconnu que l'arbitre des griefs a le pouvoir et la responsabilit\u00e9 de faire respecter les droits et obligations substantiels pr\u00e9vus par les lois ayant trait aux droits de la personne et les lois ayant trait \u00e0 l'emploi comme s'il faisaient partie de la convention collective. Ainsi, le grief d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par Madame O'Brien est arbitrable et ce ind\u00e9pendamment de l'intention contraire exprim\u00e9e par les parties \u00e0 l'article 8.06a) de la convention collective.\n[18] Dans son argumentation \u00e9crite, l'intim\u00e9e s'attarde essentiellement sur l'analyse que la Cour supr\u00eame fait de l'article 48 de la Loi de 1995 sur les relations de travail 7 , notamment sur son alin\u00e9a 48(12)j), et ses similitudes avec l'alin\u00e9a 60(1)a.1) du Code canadien du travail 8 . Selon l'intim\u00e9e, ces dispositions conf\u00e8rent \u00e0 l'arbitre du grief ou, selon le cas, au conseil d'arbitrage le pouvoir d'interpr\u00e9ter et d'appliquer les lois relatives \u00e0 l'emploi et de rendre les ordonnances qu'elles pr\u00e9voient.\n[19] Elle en conclut donc que la d\u00e9cision dans l'arr\u00eat Parry Sound confirme le pouvoir d\u00e9volu aux arbitres de grief et aux conseils d'arbitrage d'interpr\u00e9ter et d'appliquer les lois relatives aux droits de la personne telle la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce constat, elle s'interroge ensuite de qui, de l'arbitre de grief ou du Tribunal, est comp\u00e9tent pour trancher le diff\u00e9rend opposant en l'esp\u00e8ce le plaignant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e.\n[20] \u00c0 cette question, je suis d'avis que le juge Iacobucci, au nom de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour, r\u00e9pond clairement dans Parry Sound :\nJe souligne en outre que la Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne est intervenue en l'esp\u00e8ce afin de s'assurer que sa comp\u00e9tence ne soit pas \u00e9cart\u00e9e parce que l'employ\u00e9e l\u00e9s\u00e9e est assujetti \u00e0 une convention collective \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de laquelle le Conseil a comp\u00e9tence. Elle fait valoir que, si la Cour conclut que le grief est ar-bitrable, le Conseil et elle-m\u00eame ont comp\u00e9tence concurrente. \u00c0 mon sens, il est in-utile de trancher cette question pour le moment. Par cons\u00e9quent, en concluant que l'arbitre des griefs a le pouvoir et la responsabilit\u00e9 de faire respecter les droits et obligations substantiels pr\u00e9vus par le Code des droits de la personne en l'esp\u00e8ce, je ne statue par sur la question de savoir si la comp\u00e9tence de la Commission des droits de la personne est \u00e9cart\u00e9e par celle du Conseil. 9 (C'est moi qui souligne.)\n[21] En cons\u00e9quence, je suis d'avis que la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat Parry Sound n'a rien chang\u00e9 au courrant jurisprudentiel qui jusqu'\u00e0 aujourd'hui a r\u00e9gi cette question. Je vais donc r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e en m'appuyant sur cette jurisprudence.\n[22] Dans l'affaire Weber c. Ontario Hydro 10 ( Weber ), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada \u00e9tait invit\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9cider dans quels cas une loi sur les relations du travail qui pr\u00e9voit une clause d'arbitrage ex\u00e9cutoire emp\u00eache les employeurs et les employ\u00e9s d'intenter une action en justice l'un contre l'autre. Monsieur Weber, un employ\u00e9 d'Ontario Hydro souffrant de probl\u00e8mes de dos, avait d'abord d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief contre son employeur \u00e0 qui il reprochait d'avoir contrevenu \u00e0 la convention collective en embauchant des d\u00e9tectives priv\u00e9s pour enqu\u00eater sur le caract\u00e8re s\u00e9rieux de sa maladie. Il avait ensuite intent\u00e9 une action en justice fond\u00e9e sur la responsabilit\u00e9 civile d\u00e9lictuelle et sur la violation de ses droits sous la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s.\n[23] Dans Weber, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que lorsqu'un diff\u00e9rend d\u00e9coule essentiellement d'une convention collective, le plaignant doit s'en remettre au processus d'arbitrage. Les cours ne sont pas habilit\u00e9es \u00e0 entendre un recours civil \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un tel diff\u00e9rend.\n[24] L'application de l'arr\u00eat Weber \u00e0 des proc\u00e9dures intent\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e dans plusieurs d\u00e9cisions subs\u00e9quentes. Dans l'arr\u00eat Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada c. Paul 11 , la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a trait\u00e9 de la situation o\u00f9 une employ\u00e9e a choisi de d\u00e9poser une plainte relative aux droits de la personne aupr\u00e8s de la Commission plut\u00f4t que de d\u00e9poser un grief aupr\u00e8s de son syndicat. La Cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il y a avait lieu d'\u00e9tablir une distinction avec l'affaire Weber dans la mesure o\u00f9 ce jugement ne s'appliquait pas \u00e0 la situation o\u00f9 le l\u00e9gislateur avait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 une entit\u00e9 une comp\u00e9tence concurrente. La Cour a \u00e9galement analys\u00e9 la relation entre le Code canadien du travail et la Loi et a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le fait d'accorder une comp\u00e9tence exclusive \u00e0 un arbitre \u00e9quivaudrait, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, \u00e0 suspendre le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de traiter une plainte que conf\u00e8re express\u00e9ment l'article 41 de la Loi \u00e0 la Commission. La Cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par cons\u00e9quent que la Commission conserve sa comp\u00e9tence au regard des pratiques discriminatoires dans les lieux de travail syndiqu\u00e9s.\n[25] Dans l'affaire Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada c. Syndicat des Communications de Radio-Canada (FCN-CSN), la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les modifications au Code canadien du travail, adopt\u00e9es apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision Paul, dont notamment l'amendement au Code \u00e0 l'article 60, n'avaient pas pour effet de supprimer la comp\u00e9tence concurrente de la Commission.\nJe ne peux malheureusement partager l'opinion de la demanderesse car je crois que si le l\u00e9gislateur avait voulu exclure la comp\u00e9tence de la Commission, il l'aurait fait de fa\u00e7on explicite et l'aurait indiqu\u00e9 dans son amendement \u00e0 l'article 60 du Code. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, je ne peux pas tirer cette conclusion car l'amendement \u00e0 l'article 60 du Code ne fait aucunement mention du retrait de juridiction de la Commission.12\n[26] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale souscrit donc, dans cette affaire, \u00e0 la conclusion formul\u00e9e dans l'arr\u00eat Paul selon laquelle il faut une disposition l\u00e9gislative claire et sans \u00e9quivoque pour priver la Commission de sa comp\u00e9tence concurrente aux termes de l'alin\u00e9a 41(1)a) de la Loi.\n[27] La Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l'arr\u00eat Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes c. Barrette, affaire portant sur une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne d'enqu\u00eater sur les plaintes de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant, un employ\u00e9 syndiqu\u00e9, pr\u00e9cisait :\nCes d\u00e9cisions [entre autre la d\u00e9cision Weber] ne me paraissent pas utiles pour trancher la question dont je suis saisi. Bien qu'elles refl\u00e8tent ind\u00e9niablement le sou-ci des cours de justice d'\u00e9viter les \u00e9cueils d'un chevauchement des comp\u00e9tences et de poursuite successives, elles se rapportent \u00e0 un chevauchement possible entre la comp\u00e9tence d'une cour de justice et celle d'un organisme administratif, tandis que l'esp\u00e8ce concerne deux organismes administratifs. L'arr\u00eat Weber n'a \u00e9videmment pas pour effet d'emp\u00eacher une cour de justice de se prononcer sur une question relative \u00e0 la Charte, mais seulement de faire en sorte que l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 cette cour se fasse en passant par l'arbitre, en l'occurrence au moyen du contr\u00f4le de la d\u00e9cision de ce dernier selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte. Toutefois, l'application de l'arr\u00eat Weber par analogie aux pr\u00e9sentes affaires aurait pour effet d'emp\u00eacher \u00e0 jamais la Commission d'enqu\u00eater sur une plainte ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par un arbitre et de ren-voyer cette plainte \u00e0 un tribunal pour qu'il statue sur celle-ci. Un tel r\u00e9sultat sem-blerait aller \u00e0 l'encontre du texte l\u00e9gislatif, notamment parce que la Commission poss\u00e8de des pouvoirs d'enqu\u00eate et une exp\u00e9rience dans le domaine des droits de la personne que les arbitres n'ont pas, de m\u00eame que le mandat quasi constitutionnel d'origine l\u00e9gislative de promouvoir l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans sa lutte contre la discrimi-nation.13\n[28] Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement eu l'occasion d'aborder cette question. Dans l'affaire Eyerley 14 , le plaignant \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 dans un milieu de travail syndiqu\u00e9. Il avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser une plainte relative aux droits de la personne alors que son syndicat avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief en son nom. Le Tribunal en est venu \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion que dans l'arr\u00eat Paul selon laquelle il y avait lieu d'\u00e9tablir une distinction avec l'affaire Weber en ce qui a trait aux plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi. Le Tribunal, par cons\u00e9quent, a conserv\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence concurrente \u00e0 entendre la plainte. Des conclusions semblables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9es dans des d\u00e9cisions subs\u00e9quentes du Tribunal dans les affaires Quigley, Parisien, Desormeaux, Leonardis et Thompson.15\n[29] L'intim\u00e9e se fonde \u00e9galement sur l'arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Regina Police Association Inc. c. Regina (Ville) Board of Police Commissioners 16 , ( Regina Police ) pour soutenir que le crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Weber s'applique lorsqu'il s'agit de d\u00e9terminer, dans les cas o\u00f9 il existe deux r\u00e9gimes concurrents pr\u00e9vus par une loi, celui qui devrait r\u00e9gir un diff\u00e9rend.\n[30] L'arr\u00eat Regina Police a trait au refus d'un chef de police d'accepter le retrait par un agent de sa d\u00e9mission. L'agent avait d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 afin d'\u00e9viter d'\u00eatre accus\u00e9 de mauvaise conduite en vertu des Municipal Police Discipline Regulations, 1991 et d'\u00eatre \u00e9ventuellement cong\u00e9di\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Police Act, 1990 17 . Suite au refus du chef de police d'accepter que l'agent retire sa d\u00e9mission, le syndicat a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief. L'arbitre a fait remarquer que la convention collective pr\u00e9voyait que la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement des griefs ne pouvait s'appliquer dans les cas o\u00f9 les dispositions de la Police Act et de ses r\u00e8glements d'application s'appliquent. La Police Act et ses r\u00e8glements d'application pr\u00e9voient une proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement des plaintes \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de mesures disciplinaires et d'un cong\u00e9diement pour manquement \u00e0 la discipline. L'arbitre a conclu que l'intention de l'Assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative \u00e9tait que les mesures disciplinaires (y compris le cong\u00e9diement) prises pour un motif valable \u00e0 l'endroit d'un agent \u00e9taient r\u00e9gies par les proc\u00e9dures d\u00e9crites dans la Police Act et ses r\u00e8glements d'application, et que les dispositions de la convention collective relatives aux griefs ne s'appliquaient pas.\n[31] Dans Regina Police, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a fait remarquer que le raisonnement qui sous-tend l'adoption du mod\u00e8le de comp\u00e9tence exclusive dans l'arr\u00eat Weber visait \u00e0 s'assurer que le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif en cause n'\u00e9tait pas annul\u00e9 par l'octroi \u00e0 un organisme d'arbitrage, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un diff\u00e9rend, d'une comp\u00e9tence que l'Assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative n'avait pas l'intention de lui donner. Ayant d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le diff\u00e9rend entre l'agent et son employeur \u00e9tait essentiellement \u00e0 caract\u00e8re disciplinaire, la cour a conclu que l'intention de l'Assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative \u00e9tait de faire en sorte que les mesures disciplinaires (y compris le cong\u00e9diement) prises contre un agent de police pour un motif valable soient soumises aux proc\u00e9dures \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la Police Act et ses r\u00e8glements d'application. En cons\u00e9quence, l'arbitre n'avait pas le pouvoir d'entendre et de r\u00e9gler la question.\n[32] \u00c0 mon avis, il est facile de distinguer la situation dans l'arr\u00eat Regina Police de la situation actuelle. Les r\u00e9gimes l\u00e9gislatifs concurrents dont il s'agissait dans cette affaire portaient, semble-t-il, sur des questions arbitrables ou susceptibles d'\u00eatre soumises \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure disciplinaire pr\u00e9vue par la loi. Il semble que l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00e9tait de faire en sorte que les deux proc\u00e9dures soient mutuellement exclusives : en fait, la convention collective litigieuse excluait express\u00e9ment les questions de discipline de son champ d'application. En l'occurrence, l'examen de la Loi r\u00e9v\u00e8le clairement que le Parlement avait l'intention d'habiliter la Commission et le Tribunal \u00e0 r\u00e9gler les plaintes de discrimination dans un lieu de travail, nonobstant l'existence d'une convention collective. Cette intention est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e par deux dispositions de la Loi. Les alin\u00e9as 41(1)a) et 44 (2) a) de la Loi refl\u00e8te l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur de faire en sorte que la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne coexiste avec la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement des griefs.18\n[33] Pour les motifs, ci-dessus exprim\u00e9s, le Tribunal en vient donc \u00e0 la conclusion que les arguments de l'intim\u00e9 quant \u00e0 son objection pr\u00e9liminaire ne sont pas fond\u00e9s.\nIV. CONCLUSION [34] L'objection pr\u00e9liminaire de l'intim\u00e9e ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e, l'instruction de la plainte proc\u00e9dera donc comme pr\u00e9vu les 12 au 15 janvier et les 19 au 22 janvier 2004, \u00e0 Laval (Qu\u00e9bec).\nSign\u00e9e par\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 6 janvier 2004\nTRIBUNAL CANADIEN DES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE\nPARTIES INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL : T768\/1803\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE : Robert Coulter c.

CONTEXTE\nII. POSITION DES PARTIES\nIII. LE DROIT\nIV. ANALYSE\nV. D\u00c9CISION\nI. CONTEXTE [1] Le 11 avril 2002, M. Roger Virk a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne une plainte contre Bell Canada. Dans cette plainte, M. Virk all\u00e8gue que Bell Canada l'a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 en cours d'emploi en raison de son origine nationale ou ethnique en le r\u00e9trogradant, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[2] Le 17 septembre 2003, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte de M. Virk au Tribunal afin qu'elle soit instruite et tranch\u00e9e. M. Virk demande maintenant au Tribunal de modifier sa plainte initiale afin d'y ajouter des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles contre lui de la part de l'intim\u00e9e, aux termes de l'article 14.1 de la Loi. Dans une lettre en date du 13 janvier 2004, la Commission a fait savoir au Tribunal qu'elle ne prendrait pas position \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la question pr\u00e9liminaire des repr\u00e9sailles invoqu\u00e9e par M. Virk et qu'elle ne pr\u00e9senterait pas d'observations \u00e9crites.\nII. POSITION DES PARTIES [3] Dans sa plainte initiale, M. Virk affirme qu'il est d'ascendance sud-asiatique, qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 vers octobre 2001 \u00e0 un nouveau projet \u00e0 titre de gestionnaire int\u00e9rimaire, et qu'on lui a dit le 30 novembre 2001 qu'il serait r\u00e9trograd\u00e9 et affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste d'adjoint principal dans le cadre du m\u00eame projet. M. Virk pr\u00e9cise \u00e9galement qu'on lui a dit \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque qu'on ne nommerait plus de gestionnaires int\u00e9rimaires ou de nouveaux gestionnaires au sein du service et qu'il serait remplac\u00e9 par un employ\u00e9 d'une autre section qui \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 gestionnaire. Sa r\u00e9trogradation devait prendre effet le 1er janvier 2002. Selon M. Virk, deux nouvelles affectations \u00e0 titre de gestionnaires int\u00e9rimaires sont entr\u00e9es en vigueur dans son service le 2 janvier 2002.\n[4] Dans sa demande de modification, M. Virk all\u00e8gue qu'\u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte, Bell Canada a exerc\u00e9 de s\u00e9v\u00e8res repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 son endroit en l'informant que la compagnie mettait fin \u00e0 son emploi parce qu'elle mettait un terme au projet Globe and Mail auquel il \u00e9tait affect\u00e9. M. Virk all\u00e8gue que Bell a profit\u00e9 de cette situation, c'est-\u00e0-dire la fin du projet Globe and Mail, pour camoufler les repr\u00e9sailles dont il \u00e9tait l'objet en raison du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte devant la Commission. M. Virk soutient que le projet a simplement \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en veilleuse et reprendrait selon toute vraisemblance en 2004.\n[5] Pour sa part, Bell pr\u00e9tend qu'elle n'a \u00e0 aucun moment exerc\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sailles contre M. Virk parce qu'il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte devant la Commission. Bell soutient que la cessation d'emploi de M. Virk, qui a pris effet le 11 janvier 2004, s'inscrivait dans le cadre d'une restructuration du service et que le groupe dont M. Virk faisait partie avait alors \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9. Selon Bell, M. Virk \u00e9tait bien au fait de son droit de supplantation mais a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas l'exercer. S'il s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9valu de ce droit, il aurait pu \u00e0 tout le moins prolonger sa p\u00e9riode d'emploi, ce qui lui aurait donn\u00e9 plus de temps pour d\u00e9nicher un autre emploi au sein de la compagnie.\n[6] En r\u00e9plique aux arguments de Bell, M. Virk affirme que la compagnie a omis de l'informer du changement de situation concernant le poste d'agent de ressources associ\u00e9, l'emp\u00eachant ainsi d'exercer son droit de supplantation en novembre 2003. M. Virk estime que l'omission de Bell de l'informer de ce changement crucial constitue une autre mesure de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 son endroit.\nIII. LE DROIT [7] Il est d\u00e9sormais incontestable que ce Tribunal est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 modifier une plainte afin d'y ajouter une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles1. De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, on devrait autoriser une modification, \u00e0 moins qu'il soit manifeste et \u00e9vident que les all\u00e9gations faisant l'objet de la demande de modification ne sauraient \u00eatre jug\u00e9es fond\u00e9es2. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, le Tribunal ne devrait pas s'engager dans un examen approfondi du bien-fond\u00e9 d'une modification. Un tel examen devrait \u00eatre fait uniquement au regard de l'ensemble de la preuve, au terme d'une audience en bonne et due forme3. Par cons\u00e9quent, le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 appliquer consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles sont, de par leur nature, li\u00e9es, du moins par le plaignant, aux all\u00e9gations qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte initiale et peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme soutenables4.\n[8] Cela dit, le Tribunal a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de modifier une plainte pour tenir compte d'all\u00e9gations suppl\u00e9mentaires. Le Tribunal doit en tout temps veiller \u00e0 donner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e un pr\u00e9avis suffisant afin de ne pas lui causer pr\u00e9judice et de lui permettre de se d\u00e9fendre ad\u00e9quatement.\nIV. ANALYSE [9] Apr\u00e8s avoir soigneusement examin\u00e9 la teneur des documents que M. Virk a d\u00e9pos\u00e9s devant le Tribunal \u00e0 l'appui de sa demande de modification, le Tribunal conclut que les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es au sujet de la question des repr\u00e9sailles sont, en d\u00e9finitive, li\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte initiale et peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme soutenables. Ce faisant, le Tribunal ne se prononce aucunement sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de la modification. Ce n'est que lors de l'audience que le Tribunal d\u00e9terminera la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations quant \u00e0 l'existence de repr\u00e9sailles. L'intim\u00e9e aura alors amplement l'occasion de r\u00e9pliquer \u00e0 ces all\u00e9gations.\n[10] De plus, le Tribunal est d'avis que le fait de faire droit \u00e0 la demande de modification ne cause aucunement pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e. Dans les documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au Tribunal, le plaignant a clairement identifi\u00e9 les faits sur lesquels il fonde ses all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles contre l'intim\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal est d'avis que l'intim\u00e9e est bien inform\u00e9e des arguments qu'il devra r\u00e9futer relativement aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles, qu'il b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d'un pr\u00e9avis suffisant \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard et qu'il pourra se d\u00e9fendre ad\u00e9quatement contre ces all\u00e9gations.\nV. D\u00c9CISION [11] Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-dessus, la requ\u00eate du plaignant visant \u00e0 modifier sa plainte initiale pour y ajouter des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles aux termes de l'article 14.1 de la Loi est accueillie. Le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 la Commission d'aider le plaignant \u00e0 modifier sa plainte et \u00e0 produire une plainte amend\u00e9e.\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 27 f\u00e9vrier 2004\n1 Schnell c.

Les faits\nII. La demande d'ajournement\nI. Les faits [1] Le 21 janvier 2004, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada, l'intim\u00e9e, a demand\u00e9 l'ajournement des pr\u00e9sentes proc\u00e9dures jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada ait pu rendre une d\u00e9cision disposant de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire qu'elle avait formul\u00e9e \u00e0 l'encontre d'une d\u00e9cision sur une objection pr\u00e9liminaire rendue par le Tribunal le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2003.\n[2] Les faits entourant la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure sont les suivants. Francine Laurendeau (la plaignante), a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'emploi de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada (l' intim\u00e9e) \u00e0 compter de l'ann\u00e9e 1973, d'abord \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9alisatrice et \u00e0 compter de 1989, \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9alisatrice et d'animatrice \u00e0 la cha\u00eene culturelle de l'intim\u00e9e.\n[3] Le 12 juillet 2001, l'intim\u00e9e met la plaignante \u00e0 la retraite. Cette d\u00e9cision fut prise en vertu d'une politique appliqu\u00e9e chez l'intim\u00e9e depuis 1978 et intitul\u00e9e Politique des ressources humaines n\u00b010.0, laquelle pr\u00e9cise : Le moment de la retraite s'\u00e9tablit en fonction de l'\u00e2ge et est fix\u00e9 au dernier jour ouvrable du mois o\u00f9 l'employ\u00e9(e) atteint 65 ans.\n[4] En anticipation de cette mise \u00e0 la retraite, la plaignante d\u00e9posait le 6 juin 2001 une plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) afin de contester la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e. Dans sa plainte, elle all\u00e8gue que l'intim\u00e9e a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers [elle] en maintenant une politique de retraite obligatoire, en raison de [son] \u00e2ge (65 ans), contrairement aux articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[5] Le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2003, la Commission demandait \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte parce qu'elle est convaincue que, compte tenu des circonstances, l'instruction de celle-ci est justifi\u00e9e.\n[6] Le 1er avril 2003, le registraire du Tribunal informait les parties de leur droit en vertu du paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi, de pr\u00e9senter au Tribunal des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations juridiques \u00e0 l'appui de leur position dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier. En conformit\u00e9 avec les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal, celui-ci demandait \u00e9galement aux parties de soumettre de brefs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e9crits dans le but d'\u00e9num\u00e9rer les questions en litige, ainsi que la preuve qui sera soumise au Tribunal.\n[7] Dans sa divulgation de la preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 20 ao\u00fbt 2003, la plaignante a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 les questions en litige comme suit :\nLa SRC a-t-elle exerc\u00e9 un acte discriminatoire sur la base de l'\u00e2ge en violation de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne en mettant fin \u00e0 l'emploi de Mme Laurendeau sur la seule et unique base qu'elle avait atteint l'\u00e2ge de 65 ans? Subsidiairement et dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 le Tribunal en venait \u00e0 la conclusion que l'acte discriminatoire de la SRC tombait sous l'exception de l'article 15(1)c), cet article de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne est-il inconstitutionnel parce que contraire \u00e0 l'article 15 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s?\n[8] Le 27 ao\u00fbt 2003, l'intim\u00e9e faisait savoir au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) qu'elle entendait soulever une objection pr\u00e9liminaire et faire valoir que le Tribunal n'a pas la comp\u00e9tence pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question soulev\u00e9e par la plaignante \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la Loi.\n[9] Le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2003, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les parties, le Tribunal rend une d\u00e9cision rejetant l'objection pr\u00e9liminaire de l'intim\u00e9e. Dans sa d\u00e9cision le Tribunal indique qu'il consid\u00e8re avoir la comp\u00e9tence pour poursuivre l'instruction de tous les aspects de l'affaire, y inclus la question quant \u00e0 la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l'article 15 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s.\n[10] Le 7 janvier 2004, l'intim\u00e9e obtient l'\u00e9mission par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada, d'un avis de demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire afin d'obtenir une r\u00e9vision de la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal.\n[11] Lors d'une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique tenue le 21 janvier 2004, le Tribunal \u00e9tablit, entre autres, l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier suivant relativement \u00e0 la poursuite des proc\u00e9dures :\ndivulgation de la plaignante : au plus tard le 6 f\u00e9vrier 2004.\ndivulgation de l'intim\u00e9e: au plus tard le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2004.\n[12] \u00c0 la demande de l'intim\u00e9e, le Tribunal a accept\u00e9 de repousser au 26 mars 2004, la divulgation de l'intim\u00e9e.\n[13] Compte tenu des disponibilit\u00e9s des parties et du Tribunal, les dates d'audition ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9es pour les 14 au 17 et les 21 et 22 septembre 2004.\nII. La demande d'ajournement [14] La demande de l'intim\u00e9e vise \u00e0 obtenir l'ajournement des proc\u00e9dures dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ait dispos\u00e9 de la demande en r\u00e9vision judiciaire. Pour obtenir un tel ajournement, l'intim\u00e9e doit d\u00e9montrer que sa demande rencontre les trois crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis dans les affaires Manitoba (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral c. Metropolitan Stores Ltd.1 et dans RJR-MacDonald Inc. c. Canada (P.G.) 2 soit :\n\u00c0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape, l'intim\u00e9e doit \u00e9tablir l'existence d'une question s\u00e9rieuse \u00e0 juger. \u00c0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, l'intim\u00e9e doit convaincre le Tribunal qu'elle subira un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable en cas de refus du redressement. Le terme irr\u00e9parable a trait \u00e0 la nature du pr\u00e9judice subi plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 son \u00e9tendue. La troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, celle de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients, consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer laquelle des deux parties subira le plus grand pr\u00e9judice selon que l'on accorde ou refuse l'ajournement.\n[15] En l'esp\u00e8ce, il ne fait aucun doute que l'intim\u00e9e a rencontr\u00e9 le premier crit\u00e8re quant \u00e0 l'existence d'une question s\u00e9rieuse.\n[16] Toutefois, je ne suis pas convaincu que l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 rencontr\u00e9 le deuxi\u00e8me crit\u00e8re quant au pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable. Le pr\u00e9judice est irr\u00e9parable s'il ne peut \u00eatre rem\u00e9di\u00e9 ou s'il ne peut pas \u00eatre quantifi\u00e9 du point de vue mon\u00e9taire.3\n[17] Tel qu'indiqu\u00e9 par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d'appel dans Nature Co. c. Sci-Tech Educational4, la preuve n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9tablir un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable doit \u00eatre cat\u00e9gorique et non pas conjecturale. Nous ne savons pas aujourd'hui si la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale maintiendra la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal ou si elle la rejettera. \u00c0 mon avis, la preuve qui m'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e ne me convainc pas que l'intim\u00e9e a satisfait au fardeau qui est le sien d'\u00e9tablir qu'elle subira un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable si l'ajournement n'est pas accord\u00e9.\n[18] La preuve de l'intim\u00e9e sur la question de pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable porte essentiellement sur les co\u00fbts et les efforts que les parties auront \u00e0 encourir si l'ajournement n'est pas accord\u00e9. Ainsi, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada argumente que dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale devait lui donner raison dans sa requ\u00eate en r\u00e9vision judiciaire, l'ensemble du temps et des sommes qu'elle aura investis dans la pr\u00e9paration du pr\u00e9sent dossier auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s et d\u00e9pens\u00e9s en vain. Elle poursuit en soumettant qu'il serait contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice de faire encourir aux parties de telles d\u00e9penses avant qu'une r\u00e9ponse d\u00e9finitive n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[19] Le Tribunal tient \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que m\u00eame si du temps et de l'argent auront \u00e9t\u00e9 gaspill\u00e9s si la proc\u00e9dure suit son cours et qu'il est par la suite d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence, il s'agit plus d'une question de d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ment que d'un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable.5 L'intim\u00e9e n'a cit\u00e9 aucune jurisprudence pour appuyer ses pr\u00e9tentions \u00e0 l'effet que les d\u00e9penses de temps et d'argent pour pr\u00e9parer une audition devant le Tribunal constituent un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable. Au contraire, il existe une jurisprudence constante qui affirme l'oppos\u00e9.6\n[20] Finalement, en ce qui concerne la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients, le Tribunal peut tenir compte, \u00e0 ce stade, de la consid\u00e9ration des d\u00e9penses qui pourraient \u00eatre gaspill\u00e9es par les parties dans la pr\u00e9paration de l'audience si l'ajournement n'est pas accord\u00e9 et qu'\u00e9ventuellement la demande en r\u00e9vision judiciaire est accept\u00e9e. Le Tribunal se doit \u00e9galement de tenir compte de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public qui est mieux servi par la r\u00e9solution exp\u00e9ditive des plaintes reli\u00e9es aux droits de la personne.7 En l'esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal est d'avis que la consid\u00e9ration de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public l'emporte sur les consid\u00e9rations mon\u00e9taires soulev\u00e9es par les parties.\n[21] La demande d'ajournement est en cons\u00e9quence rejet\u00e9e puisque l'intim\u00e9e n'a pu satisfaire le Tribunal qu'elle a rencontr\u00e9 les crit\u00e8res du pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable et de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients. Les parties sont donc enjointes de se conformer \u00e0 l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier \u00e9tabli lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 21 janvier 2004.\n[22] Le Tribunal est conscient que la pr\u00e9sente demande pourrait \u00eatre pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e en raison du grand d\u00e9lai qui existe avant que l'audience ne d\u00e9bute. Il se peut fort bien que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ait d'ici septembre 2004 rendu sa d\u00e9cision concernant la demande en r\u00e9vision judiciaire. Toutefois, en raison des longs d\u00e9lais d\u00e9j\u00e0 encourus dans cette affaire et de la difficult\u00e9 que les parties ont eue \u00e0 trouver des dates disponibles pour l'audience, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de trancher imm\u00e9diatement la question de l'ajournement afin que tous sachent \u00e0 quoi s'en tenir et qu'ils puissent proc\u00e9der \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer leur affaire en cons\u00e9quence.\nsign\u00e9 par\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 3 mars 2004\n1 [1987] 1 R.C.S. 110.\n2 [1994] 1 R.C.S. 312.\n3 Territoires du Nord-Ouest c.

Mombourquette, le nouvel avocat du plaignant, a transmis au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne une demande d'ajournement de l'audience en l'esp\u00e8ce. Malheureusement, pour une raison inexpliqu\u00e9e, le Tribunal n'a pas re\u00e7u sa lettre. Une copie de la lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise par courrier \u00e9lectronique au Tribunal \u00e0 la suite d'une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence tenue le 2 mars 2004.\n[2] L'audience dans cette affaire devait se d\u00e9rouler du 8 au 12 mars 2004, \u00e0 Halifax, en Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse. Les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9es de ces dates le 29 septembre 2003. Le 19 f\u00e9vrier 2004, le Tribunal a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 un membre pour instruire la plainte et a inform\u00e9 les parties que l'audience d\u00e9buterait le 10 mars 2004 et que de nouvelles dates seraient fix\u00e9es \u00e0 ce momentl\u00e0.\n[3] Dans sa lettre du 27 f\u00e9vrier 2004, Me Mombourquette informait le Tribunal que le plaignant avait retenu ses services en l'esp\u00e8ce. Il indiquait que l'avocate pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente du plaignant, Rebecca Saturley, du cabinet Steward McKelvey Stirling Scales, avait communiqu\u00e9 avec lui plus t\u00f4t cette semaine-l\u00e0 afin de lui demander s'il pourrait repr\u00e9senter le plaignant. Il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure, pr\u00e9cisait-il, de s'entretenir le jeudi 26 f\u00e9vrier 2004 avec le plaignant, qui avait alors d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de retenir ses services. La d\u00e9cision de changer d'avocat \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape tr\u00e8s tardive de la proc\u00e9dure n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par le plaignant, mais plut\u00f4t par son ex-avocate, Me Saturley.\n[4] En ce qui concerne le motif de cette d\u00e9cision, il semble que, \u00e0 la suite de la divulgation du 12 f\u00e9vrier 2004 de l'intim\u00e9e, Me Saturley ait conclu qu'il pourrait y avoir un conflit entre le fait qu'elle repr\u00e9sentait le plaignant en l'esp\u00e8ce et la relation de longue date de sa firme avec la Halifax Employers Association. Aucun d\u00e9tail suppl\u00e9mentaire n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni quant aux raisons qui pourraient expliquer comment il se fait que ce n'est qu'\u00e0 cette \u00e9tape tr\u00e8s tardive de la proc\u00e9dure qu'on soit parvenu \u00e0 ce constat.\n[5] Point n'est besoin de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter qu'un conflit d'int\u00e9r\u00eats est une situation susceptible de teinter le jugement de l'avocat ou les avis donn\u00e9s \u00e0 un client actuel ou \u00e9ventuel, ou d'influer sur sa loyaut\u00e9 professionnelle. S'il surgit dans une affaire un diff\u00e9rend qui ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9solu, l'avocat ne peut, de toute \u00e9vidence, continuer de repr\u00e9senter l'un ou l'autre des clients et doit se retirer de l'affaire. L'avocat doit s'abstenir de repr\u00e9senter plus d'un client lorsqu'il est raisonnablement \u00e9vident qu'il peut surgir un litige ou que leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats, leurs droits ou leurs obligations divergeront au fur et \u00e0 mesure que l'affaire de d\u00e9nouera.\n[6] Il semble que Me Saturley soit parvenue \u00e0 cette conclusion apr\u00e8s avoir pris connaissance de la divulgation du 12 f\u00e9vrier 2004 de l'intim\u00e9e, bien que le Tribunal ne voie pas quels nouveaux renseignements n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 l'avocate. Le Tribunal s'inscrit par ailleurs en faux contre le retard de Me Saturley \u00e0 agir. Selon la lettre de Me Mombourquette, c'est seulement dans la semaine du 23 f\u00e9vrier 2004, soit une dizaine de jours apr\u00e8s la divulgation de l'intim\u00e9e, qu'on a communiqu\u00e9 avec lui pour lui demander s'il pourrait repr\u00e9senter le plaignant. Il est \u00e9vident qu'il conviendrait en l'esp\u00e8ce d'ordonner de mettre les d\u00e9pens \u00e0 la charge de l'ex-avocate du plaignant, si le Tribunal avait ce pouvoir en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, pouvoir que je ne poss\u00e8de malheureusement pas.\n[7] Je renvoie les parties au Legal Ethics and Professional Conduct Handbook de la Nova Scotia Barristers' Society, qui pr\u00e9cise qu'un avocat doit avoir des motifs valables de se d\u00e9sister et doit dans un tel cas donner \u00e0 son client un pr\u00e9avis suffisant. Le client peut mettre fin \u00e0 sa relation avec l'avocat \u00e0 sa guise, mais ce dernier ne jouit pas de la m\u00eame latitude. Une fois qu'il a accept\u00e9 un mandat, l'avocat doit s'en acquitter de son mieux, \u00e0 moins d'avoir une justification suffisante pour mettre fin \u00e0 la relation. L'avocat qui se retire d'un mandat se doit de r\u00e9duire au minimum les frais et d'\u00e9viter de causer un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 son client, tout en faisant tout ce qui est raisonnablement possible pour faciliter le transfert exp\u00e9ditif et ordonn\u00e9 du dossier \u00e0 son successeur.\n[8] Dans le cas qui nous occupe, Me Mombourquette a demand\u00e9 cet ajournement afin de pouvoir se familiariser avec la plainte avant l'audience. Il a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas disponible aux dates fix\u00e9es en raison d'un engagement ant\u00e9rieur aupr\u00e8s de la commission des relations de travail de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse. Lors de la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence tenue le 2 mars 2004 pour discuter de cette demande, il a indiqu\u00e9 qu'aucun de ses coll\u00e8gues au sein de son cabinet n'\u00e9tait en mesure de prendre en charge ce dossier aux dates fix\u00e9es pour l'audience.\n[9] L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e s'est vivement oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 cette demande. Dans une lettre en date du 1er mars 2004 adress\u00e9e au Tribunal, Me Ronald A. Pink, \u00e9voquant le conflit d'int\u00e9r\u00eats possible de Me Saturley, affirme que ledit conflit d'int\u00e9r\u00eats n'est en aucune fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rent de ce qu'il \u00e9tait lorsque cette derni\u00e8re a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter le plaignant ou lorsqu'elle a agi comme sa repr\u00e9sentante aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal lors du processus de m\u00e9diation en octobre 2003. Le Tribunal pourrait \u00eatre enclin \u00e0 souscrire aux conclusions de l'avocat \u00e0 ce sujet, mais il n'en demeure pas moins que le plaignant a retenu les services d'un nouvel avocat et que je suis confront\u00e9 \u00e0 cette situation dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente demande d'ajournement.\n[10] Dans sa lettre, Me Pink fait valoir qu'un ajournement \u00e0 une \u00e9tape aussi tardive de la proc\u00e9dure serait co\u00fbteux pour son client et exigerait de se refamiliariser compl\u00e8tement avec le dossier \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure. Il ajoute qu'il en est ainsi parce que Me Saturley a dirig\u00e9 son ancien client vers un avocat qui n'est pas disponible aux dates pr\u00e9vues de l'audience.\n[11] Bien que je comprenne la frustration de l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e qui est pr\u00eat \u00e0 aller de l'avant dans ce dossier, je dois \u00e9galement tenir compte du fait que le plaignant n'y est absolument pour rien dans tout cela. D'apr\u00e8s ce que je crois comprendre de la lettre de Me Mombourquette, ce n'est que le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2004 que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment nouveau. Jusqu'\u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, il avait l'impression qu'il \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par Me Saturley et que le dossier suivait son cours.\n[12] Dans les circonstances, j'estime qu'en refusant l'ajournement, le Tribunal punirait injustement le plaignant, qui ne saurait \u00eatre tenu responsable de cette situation.\n[13] C'est \u00e0 contrecur que j'accueille la demande d'ajournement aux conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es ci-apr\u00e8s.\nSi le plaignant a gain de cause \u00e0 l'audience, son droit \u00e0 r\u00e9parations se limitera aux dommages subis avant le 10 mars 2004 tout au plus. L'avocat du plaignant informera sans tarder le Tribunal des dates auxquelles il est disponible pour la tenue d'une audience de cinq jours en mars, avril, mai ou juin 2004. Une fois saisi de ces dates, le Tribunal consultera l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e et fixera les dates auxquelles l'audience d\u00e9butera. Si l'avocat du plaignant n'est pas en mesure d'indiquer des dates o\u00f9 il est disponible ces mois-l\u00e0, alors le Tribunal, en consultation avec l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e, fixera des dates et en informera l'avocat du plaignant afin que lui-m\u00eame ou un de ses coll\u00e8gues au sein de son cabinet puisse se lib\u00e9rer \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0; L'avocat du plaignant pr\u00e9sentera avant le 12 mars 2004 la liste d\u00e9finitive des t\u00e9moins ainsi qu'un sommaire des t\u00e9moignages qu'ils pr\u00e9senteront \u00e0 l'audience. Un exemplaire de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance doit \u00eatre envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ancienne avocate du plaignant.\nSign\u00e9 par\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 5 mars 2004\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT845\/9503\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nJohn Charlton c.

Grant Sinclair\n2004 TCDP 13\n2004\/04\/27\n(TRADUCTION)\n[1] La plaignante, Tiina Baumbach, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Deer Lake Education Authority, le 15 septembre 2000. Mme Baumbach \u00e9tait employ\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 titre d\u2019enseignante du niveau \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire. Dans sa plainte, elle all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d\u2019emploi et a refus\u00e9 de continuer de l\u2019employer, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[2] Le Tribunal a fix\u00e9 des dates d\u2019audience, mais les parties n\u2019ont pu s\u2019entendre sur le lieu de l\u2019audience. La plaignante a demand\u00e9 que l\u2019audience se tienne \u00e0 Ottawa. Pour sa part, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 que l\u2019audience se d\u00e9roule \u00e0 Deer Lake, lieu de ses bureaux et lieu o\u00f9 le pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 acte discriminatoire est survenu.\n[3] La plaignante souffre d\u2019une invalidit\u00e9 grave et prolong\u00e9e qui lui cause de s\u00e9rieux probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9dicaux qui surviennent de fa\u00e7on impr\u00e9visible et qui peuvent durer tr\u00e8s longtemps. Elle a beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 se d\u00e9placer et le m\u00e9decin sp\u00e9cialiste qu\u2019il l\u2019a trait\u00e9e lui a recommand\u00e9 de s\u2019abstenir totalement de voyager.\n[4] La plaignante a signal\u00e9 que Deer Lake ne dispose ni de salles ni d\u2019installations d\u2019alimentation ou d\u2019h\u00e9bergement n\u00e9cessaires au d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019audience du Tribunal. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ne conteste pas cette all\u00e9gation et a propos\u00e9 une solution qui consisterait \u00e0 faire la navette en avion chaque jour entre Deer Lake et Red Lake, des localit\u00e9s situ\u00e9es \u00e0 une courte distance de vol l\u2019une de l\u2019autre. En guise de compromis, l\u2019audience pourrait aussi, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, se tenir \u00e0 Winnipeg ou \u00e0 Thunder Bay \u2013 deux villes que les membres du conseil de l\u2019intim\u00e9e connaissent bien.\n[5] Dans ses observations, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait remarquer que cinq membres du conseil de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et le directeur de l\u2019\u00e9ducation participeront aux audiences. Des audiences d\u2019une dur\u00e9e de deux semaines \u00e0 Ottawa entra\u00eeneraient des d\u00e9penses consid\u00e9rables pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e. De plus, l\u2019anglais n\u2019est pas la langue maternelle des membres du conseil de l\u2019intim\u00e9e; certains d\u2019entre eux parlent couramment l\u2019anglais et l\u2019oji\u2011cri, mais ce n\u2019est pas le cas de certains autres membres. Il est probable qu\u2019il faille recourir aux services d\u2019un interpr\u00e8te de la r\u00e9gion qui parle le dialecte des membres du conseil. Par ailleurs, l\u2019intim\u00e9e souligne qu\u2019il ne serait pas facile pour les membres du conseil, particuli\u00e8rement pour ceux qui ne parlent pas anglais, de se d\u00e9placer jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Ottawa \u00e0 partir de leur collectivit\u00e9 \u00e9loign\u00e9e du nord de l\u2019Ontario.\n[6] En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le Tribunal tient ses audiences aux endroits o\u00f9 sont survenus les actes discriminatoires. Cependant, ce n\u2019est pas une r\u00e8gle stricte et le Tribunal s\u2019efforce de tenir compte des besoins des parties, s\u2019il y a lieu. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il faut tenir compte des besoins des deux parties Le compromis demand\u00e9 par la plaignante, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la tenue de l\u2019audience \u00e0 Ottawa, ne convient pas \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. De m\u00eame, le compromis demand\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, soit la tenue des audiences \u00e0 Thunder Bay ou \u00e0 Winnipeg, ne convient pas \u00e0 la plaignante.\n[7] Le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 les observations des deux parties. Comme il est impossible dans les circonstances de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins exprim\u00e9s par les parties, il faut trouver une autre solution.\n[8] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a pris la d\u00e9cision suivante :\nLa plaignante et tous les t\u00e9moins appel\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u00e9poser en sa faveur rendront t\u00e9moignage lors d\u2019une audience qui se tiendra dans les bureaux du Tribunal \u00e0 Ottawa. Les t\u00e9moins pourront \u00eatre contre-interrog\u00e9s par l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui assistera en personne \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Les membres du conseil de l\u2019intim\u00e9e participeront \u00e0 l\u2019audience de Thunder Bay gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un service de vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence. Il y aura des appareils t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques dans les salles de vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence \u00e0 Ottawa et Thunder Bay afin de permettre \u00e0 l\u2019avocat et aux membres du conseil de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de communiquer entre eux, au besoin. L\u2019intim\u00e9e et ses t\u00e9moins rendront t\u00e9moignage lors d\u2019une audience qui se tiendra \u00e0 Thunder Bay. Les t\u00e9moins pourront \u00eatre contre-interrog\u00e9s par l\u2019avocat de la plaignante qui assistera en personne \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u00e0 Thunder Bay. La plaignante participera \u00e0 cette audience des bureaux du Tribunal \u00e0 Ottawa, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un service de vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence. Il y aura des appareils t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques dans les bureaux du Tribunal \u00e0 Ottawa ainsi que dans la salle de vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence \u00e0 Thunder Bay afin de permettre \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 son avocat de communiquer entre eux, au besoin. Les plaidoiries, y compris la jurisprudence, seront pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par \u00e9crit ou par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence. Dans le deuxi\u00e8me cas, l\u2019avocat de la plaignante assistera aux plaidoiries \u00e0 partir de la salle de vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence dans les bureaux du Tribunal \u00e0 Ottawa et celui de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 partir de la salle de vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence \u00e0 Thunder Bay. La m\u00e9thode de pr\u00e9sentation des plaidoiries sera d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par le membre instructeur \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les avocats. Le co\u00fbt des services de vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence sera assum\u00e9 par le Tribunal.\nJ.

Grant Sinclair\n2004 TCDP 14 2004\/04\/29\n[1] Dans les ann\u00e9es 90, le plaignant en l'esp\u00e8ce, William Baltruweit, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne un certain nombre de plaintes contre l'intim\u00e9, le Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (SCRS). La plainte pertinente aux fins de cette requ\u00eate porte la date du 4 novembre 1998. Dans cette plainte, le plaignant all\u00e8gue que le SCRS l'a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 en cours d'emploi, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[2] La Commission a rejet\u00e9 la plainte. Saisie d'une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la part du plaignant, la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait droit \u00e0 celle-ci et a renvoy\u00e9 l'affaire \u00e0 la Commission pour r\u00e9examen. La Commission et le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en ont tous deux appel\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9cision devant la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[3] Apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9examin\u00e9 l'affaire, la Commission a inform\u00e9 le SCRS, le 1er octobre 2003, qu'elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de nommer un conciliateur pour tenter d'en arriver \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement et que, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'un r\u00e8glement dans les 60 jours, elle renverrait la plainte au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne.\n[4] Le 30 octobre 2003, le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, au nom du SCRS, une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission. Dans sa requ\u00eate, le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral n'a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de surseoir \u00e0 l'instance du Tribunal en attendant l'issue de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. La plainte n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e et, le 6 janvier 2004, la Commission l'a renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction.\n[5] Le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en date du 9 f\u00e9vrier 2004 priant le Tribunal de suspendre sa proc\u00e9dure jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la d\u00e9cision finale ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire du 30 octobre 2003.\n[6] Le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral soutient que le Tribunal devrait trancher la requ\u00eate en se fondant sur le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 trois volets \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat RJR-Macdonald Inc. c. Canada, [1994] 1 R.C.S. 311, p. 334. Il fait valoir qu'on a satisfait \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re en faveur du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n[7] Je ne suis pas d'avis que le Tribunal devrait appliquer le crit\u00e8re RJR-Macdonald dans une affaire comme celle-ci. Selon moi, le Tribunal devrait plut\u00f4t suivre l'approche qu'il a expos\u00e9e dans L\u00e9ger c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [1999] D\u00e9cision no 1, Dossier TCDP T527\/2299 (26 nov. 1999) et qui est d\u00e9crite plus en d\u00e9tail dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[8] Cette conclusion est fond\u00e9e sur l'analyse ci-apr\u00e8s. Dans RJR-Macdonald, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada \u00e9tait saisie d'une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 suspendre \u00e0 la mise en uvre du r\u00e8glement d'application de la Loi r\u00e9glementant les produits du tabac, en attendant l'issue de l'appel interjet\u00e9 par la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec relativement \u00e0 la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de cette loi. En ce qui concerne la question pr\u00e9liminaire, \u00e0 savoir sa comp\u00e9tence pour entendre la requ\u00eate, la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu qu'elle \u00e9tait investie de la comp\u00e9tence n\u00e9cessaire en vertu de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame et des R\u00e8gles de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada. Apr\u00e8s avoir tranch\u00e9 cette question, la Cour supr\u00eame a affirm\u00e9 que, pour obtenir le rem\u00e8de demand\u00e9, les demandeurs devaient satisfaire au crit\u00e8re \u00e0 trois volets \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Manitoba (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Metropolitan Stores (MTS) Ltd., [1987] 1 R.C.S. 110. Finalement, la Cour a rejet\u00e9 les requ\u00eates.\n[9] Dans Metropolitan Stores, la Manitoba Food and Commercial Workers Union avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission du travail du Manitoba de rendre, en vertu de la Loi sur les relations du travail du Manitoba, une ordonnance imposant une premi\u00e8re convention collective \u00e0 l'employeur, Metropolitan Stores, et au syndicat. Metropolitan Stores a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 devant la Cour du Banc de la Reine du Manitoba un avis de requ\u00eate introductif d'instance visant \u00e0 faire d\u00e9clarer inconstitutionnelles les dispositions pertinentes de la Loi sur les relations du travail et \u00e0 obtenir une ordonnance enjoignant la Commission du travail de surseoir \u00e0 sa proc\u00e9dure en attendant que la question constitutionnelle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e. La requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par la cour de premi\u00e8re instance. La d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e en appel devant la Cour d'appel du Manitoba, qui a accueilli la demande de suspension d'instance. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a renvers\u00e9 ce jugement. Ce faisant, la Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 les principes - le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 trois volets - qui r\u00e9gissent l'exercice par un juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de suspendre une instance.\n[10] Je me suis r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on assez d\u00e9taill\u00e9e aux arr\u00eats RJR-Macdonald et Metropolitan Stores, car il est important \u00e0 mon avis de comprendre que le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 trois volets a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 dans une situation diff\u00e9rente de celle devant laquelle nous nous trouvons en l'esp\u00e8ce, alors qu'un tribunal de contr\u00f4le est pri\u00e9 de surseoir \u00e0 l'instance d'un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur en attendant l'issue d'un appel ou d'une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[11] Dans l'un et l'autre cas, la cour de r\u00e9vision, \u00e0 l'instar de la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e par la loi \u00e0 suspendre une proc\u00e9dure. En vertu de l'article 18.2 de la Loi sur la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, cette derni\u00e8re peut surseoir \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure d'un tribunal f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en attendant l'issue d'une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[12] Aucune disposition de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne conf\u00e8re au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne le pouvoir de surseoir \u00e0 une instance en attendant le r\u00e9sultat d'une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. \u00c0 mon avis, le r\u00e9gime de la loi ne donne pas \u00e0 croire non plus qu'il poss\u00e8de un tel pouvoir.\n[13] L'examen des dispositions pertinentes de la Loi incite \u00e0 croire le contraire. L'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances et la protection contre la discrimination sont les objectifs de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u00e9clar\u00e9s de la Loi (art. 2). Ces objectifs doivent \u00eatre atteints gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'activit\u00e9 de la Commission, qui re\u00e7oit les plaintes et qui, apr\u00e8s avoir fait enqu\u00eate, peut d\u00e9cider de les renvoyer au Tribunal si elle juge qu'une instruction est justifi\u00e9e. S'il conclut, au terme d'une audience en bonne et due forme, qu'il a bel et bien eu discrimination, le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'accorder une r\u00e9paration qui rev\u00eat un caract\u00e8re correctif plut\u00f4t que punitif, une r\u00e9paration destin\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00e9liminer la discrimination.\n[14] La Loi exige que l'instruction des plaintes par le Tribunal se fasse sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive et que ce mandat du Tribunal soit exerc\u00e9 dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle (par. 48.9(1)). Cette derni\u00e8re exigence est soulign\u00e9e au paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi, qui exige de donner \u00e0 toutes les parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et leurs observations.\n[15] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que les tribunaux administratifs sont ma\u00eetres de leur proc\u00e9dure. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils disposent d'importants pouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires lorsqu'il s'agit de se prononcer sur des demandes d'ajournement. Ce principe est analys\u00e9 plus en d\u00e9tail par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l'arr\u00eat Prassad c. Ministre de l'Emploi et de l'Immigration, [1989] 1. R.C.S. 560. Dans cette affaire, l'appelant avait demand\u00e9 l'ajournement de son enqu\u00eate d'immigration en attendant que le Ministre rende sa d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa demande visant \u00e0 lui permettre de demeurer au Canada. L'arbitre a rejet\u00e9 la demande d'ajournement.\n[16] Dans son jugement, la Cour supr\u00eame a affirm\u00e9 que les tribunaux administratifs, en l'absence de r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9cises \u00e9tablies par loi ou r\u00e8glement, sont ma\u00eetres chez eux et fixent leur propre proc\u00e9dure. Cependant, dans l'exercice de fonctions judiciaires ou quasi judiciaires, ces tribunaux sont tenus de respecter les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle. [Voir aussi Re Cedarvale Tree Services Ltd. and Labourers' International Union of North America, (1971), 22 D.L.R. (3d) 40, 50 (C.A. Ont.), Pierre c. Ministre de la Main-d'uvre et de l'Immigration, [1978] 2 C.F. 849, 851 (C.F., 1re inst.)].\n[17] Par cons\u00e9quent, il est \u00e9vident que ce Tribunal doit, dans l'exercice de ses pouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires, tenir compte des r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle. Ainsi, le Tribunal pourrait devoir tenir compte des r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle dans le cas de la non-disponibilit\u00e9 d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'ajourner une instance pour obtenir les services d'un avocat ou d'une divulgation tardive par la partie adverse.\n[18] Essentiellement, il semble, d'apr\u00e8s les observations qu'il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au sujet de cette requ\u00eate, que le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral estime :\nque le renvoi fait par la Commission au Tribunal est nul et que, par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour instruire la plainte; que, si le Tribunal instruit la plainte et qu'il y a ult\u00e9rieurement annulation du renvoi, toute r\u00e9paration accord\u00e9e dans le cadre des proc\u00e9dures en suspens deviendra inutile et th\u00e9orique; que, si le Tribunal instruit la plainte et que le renvoi est ult\u00e9rieurement annul\u00e9, on se sera expos\u00e9 inutilement \u00e0 des risques pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Cette affirmation n'est pas fond\u00e9e sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments prouv\u00e9s et ne saurait en aucune circonstance \u00eatre examin\u00e9e par le Tribunal \u00e0 l'audience tenue aux termes de l'article 52 de la Loi; qu'on a int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 maintenir le statu quo en attendant que les questions dont la Cour est saisie aient \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es; que la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients favorise la suspension de la proc\u00e9dure afin de ne pas gaspiller les ressources judiciaires; que la bonne administration de la Loi par la Commission est une question d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public qui, peut-on pr\u00e9sumer, l'emporte sur l'importance que le Tribunal tienne une audience exp\u00e9ditive.\n[19] Je ne vois rien dans ces arguments qui concerne la capacit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9, le SCRS, de se d\u00e9fendre devant le Tribunal. Aucune question n'est soulev\u00e9e quant \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, de retenir les services d'un avocat ou de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation du plaignant. De surcro\u00eet, aucune pr\u00e9occupation n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e quant \u00e0 l'impartialit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal en suspens. Enfin, dans ces observations, on n'a soulev\u00e9 aucune pr\u00e9occupation en mati\u00e8re de justice naturelle qui pourrait att\u00e9nuer le d\u00e9sir exprim\u00e9 au paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi selon lequel le processus de r\u00e8glement de la plainte, par le Tribunal devrait \u00eatre le plus exp\u00e9ditif possible.\n[20] \u00c0 mon avis, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est la tribune o\u00f9 il faut s'adresser pour demander la suspension d'une proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. C'est l'instance qui s'occupe des demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est express\u00e9ment autoris\u00e9e par la loi \u00e0 accueillir ou \u00e0 rejeter une demande de suspension. \u00c0 mon avis, il ne s'agit pas d'un cas de fongibilit\u00e9 entre institutions.\n[21] Par cons\u00e9quent, pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, la requ\u00eate du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nJ.

Hadjis\n2004 TCDP 15 2004\/05\/04\n[1] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue dans ses plaintes que les intim\u00e9s ont exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience (scl\u00e9rose en plaques et \u00e9pilepsie). Il d\u00e9sire citer son m\u00e9decin \u00e0 compara\u00eetre comme t\u00e9moin expert \u00e0 l'audience. Il all\u00e8gue que le t\u00e9moignage du m\u00e9decin est dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public et dans son propre int\u00e9r\u00eat. Le m\u00e9decin a demand\u00e9 des honoraires pour \u00e9tablir son rapport d'expert (600 $) et pour son t\u00e9moignage (200 $ l'heure). Le plaignant est actuellement sans emploi et touche des prestations d'aide sociale en vertu du Programme ontarien de soutien aux personnes handicap\u00e9es. Il pr\u00e9tend donc ne pas \u00eatre capable de payer les honoraires que demande le m\u00e9decin et ne pas \u00eatre en mesure, de ce fait, de faire t\u00e9moigner son expert.\n[2] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a renvoy\u00e9 les plaintes au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne le 6 janvier 2004. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, la Commission a indiqu\u00e9 que, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'art. 49 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, elle \u00e9tait convaincue, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 [la plainte], que l'instruction [\u00e9tait] justifi\u00e9e. Cependant, dans une lettre en date du 5 f\u00e9vrier 2004, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a inform\u00e9 les parties et le Tribunal qu'elle ne participerait pas \u00e0 l'audition de ces plaintes, laissant au plaignant le soin de plaider sa cause sans l'aide d'un conseiller juridique. La Commission a fait savoir qu'elle n'assumerait pas les co\u00fbts li\u00e9s au t\u00e9moignage du m\u00e9decin expert.\n[3] Le plaignant a cons\u00e9quemment pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 obtenir du Tribunal une ordonnance enjoignant au m\u00e9decin de t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 titre de t\u00e9moin expert. Il incomberait au Tribunal de payer ses honoraires, peut-on pr\u00e9sumer. L'avocat de la Commission a laiss\u00e9 entendre \u00e0 une r\u00e9cente conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire que le Tribunal avait peut-\u00eatre le pouvoir de citer de son propre chef un t\u00e9moin expert. La Commission a fourni au Tribunal des copies de plusieurs jugements traitant de cette question. Pour leur part, les intim\u00e9s ont fait valoir que le Tribunal ne peut citer un t\u00e9moin que les parties elles-m\u00eames n'ont pas l'intention d'appeler, pas plus qu'il ne peut retenir les services d'un expert dont le t\u00e9moignage aiderait manifestement la cause d'une seule des parties.\n[4] Je me suis pench\u00e9 sur les textes faisant autorit\u00e9 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9s et j'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que la position des intim\u00e9s est bien fond\u00e9e. Tel qu'indiqu\u00e9 dans l'ouvrage du juge Sopinka intitul\u00e9 The Law of Evidence in Canada, [J. Sopinka, S.N. Lederman, A.W. Bryant, 2e \u00e9d. (Toronto : Butterworths, 1999), \u00e0 la p. 901], le juge de premi\u00e8re instruction n'a pas le pouvoir, dans une affaire au civil, de citer un t\u00e9moin qui n'a pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9. Au criminel, le pouvoir du juge de citer un t\u00e9moin non appel\u00e9 par les parties et sans leur consentement est restreint, situation qui est justifi\u00e9e du fait que la libert\u00e9 de l'accus\u00e9 est en jeu et que la proc\u00e9dure vise \u00e0 ce que justice soit faite. Toutefois, ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire est exerc\u00e9 rarement et avec beaucoup de circonspection afin de ne pas causer pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l'accus\u00e9 ou de ne pas usurper le r\u00f4le du conseil.\n[5] L'avocat de la Commission a fait remarquer qu'on pourrait, en raison du caract\u00e8re quasi constitutionnel de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne, pr\u00e9tendre que les principes applicables au droit criminel puissent s'\u00e9tendre par analogie \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Cependant, m\u00eame si c'\u00e9tait le cas, les faits entourant les pr\u00e9sentes plaintes ne justifient pas l'exercice par le Tribunal d'un tel pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire. Sans minimiser en aucune fa\u00e7on l'importance des all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es par le plaignant dans ses plaintes, je ne peux pas dire que la libert\u00e9 corporelle de quelqu'un soit en jeu en l'esp\u00e8ce, comme c'est le cas dans une instance criminelle.\n[6] En outre, on constate que dans la plupart des cas o\u00f9 un tribunal a exerc\u00e9 pareil pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, le juge a cit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins qu'aucune des parties n'entendaient elles-m\u00eames appeler. En l'esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant souhaite en fait que son m\u00e9decin vienne t\u00e9moigner mais est confront\u00e9 \u00e0 l'obstacle d'avoir \u00e0 lui verser des honoraires. Certes, les honoraires demand\u00e9s sont tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9s pour quelqu'un qui, comme le plaignant, a des moyens financiers modestes. Cependant, il est loisible au plaignant de demander le remboursement de ces frais par les intim\u00e9s \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire (alin\u00e9a 53(2) d) de la Loi). Bien s\u00fbr, cette indemnisation serait conditionnelle \u00e0 ce que le Tribunal conclue que les plaintes sont fond\u00e9es et que le plaignant a droit \u00e0 cette mesure de redressement. Le plaignant a indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal lors de la conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 courir le risque de ne pas \u00eatre rembours\u00e9.\n[7] De plus, m\u00eame si on devait conclure qu'un tribunal des droits de la personne, en tant que ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure, a le pouvoir de citer ses propres t\u00e9moins, l'exercice d'un tel pouvoir de la mani\u00e8re propos\u00e9e aiderait la cause d'une seule des parties - le plaignant. Cette situation cr\u00e9erait une injustice inacceptable pour les autres parties. M\u00eame s'il est \u00e9vident que le plaignant, en tant que personne handicap\u00e9e qui a de modestes moyens financiers, a beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 plaider sa cause sans l'aide d'un conseil, le fait demeure que la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal doit demeurer neutre et fondamentalement accusatoire. Le Tribunal ne saurait \u00eatre m\u00eal\u00e9 \u00e0 la controverse juridique et aider une seule des parties \u00e0 plaider sa cause, simplement parce que la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne plus participer. Malheureusement, il se peut que cette situation emp\u00eache la pr\u00e9sentation d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve importants et que l'instruction de la plainte soit, de ce fait, incompl\u00e8te. Qu'il en soit ainsi. Le Tribunal ne saurait en aucune circonstance permettre que sa proc\u00e9dure devienne in\u00e9quitable.\n[8] Durant la conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire, on a discut\u00e9 du paragraphe 48.8 (2) de la Loi, qui pr\u00e9cise que le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal peut engager des experts pour aider et conseiller les membres. Je crois comprendre que le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal n'a pas encore exerc\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 maintenant le pouvoir \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans cet article de la Loi. J'imagine que cette disposition pourrait s'appliquer dans des cas o\u00f9 des t\u00e9moins experts cit\u00e9s par des parties pr\u00e9senteraient des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve rev\u00eatant un caract\u00e8re hautement technique ou causant peut-\u00eatre de la confusion. Dans de tels cas, le Tribunal pourrait aux termes du paragraphe 48.8 (2) retenir les services d'autres experts et chercher \u00e0 obtenir de plus amples pr\u00e9cisions. Toutefois, ce n'est pas la situation dans laquelle le Tribunal se retrouve en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[9] Pour tous les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-dessus, je ne rendrai pas d'ordonnance enjoignant au m\u00e9decin du plaignant de venir t\u00e9moigner devant le Tribunal comme t\u00e9moin expert. Le plaignant a toujours le loisir de citer lui-m\u00eame son m\u00e9decin comme t\u00e9moin. Si le t\u00e9moin doit t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 titre d'expert, le plaignant doit se conformer aux r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal relatives aux t\u00e9moignages d'experts. Le Tribunal d\u00e9livrera un subpna pour assigner ce t\u00e9moin \u00e0 compara\u00eetre \u00e0 l'audience, si le plaignant lui en fait la demande.\nAthanasios D.

INTRODUCTION [1] Pierre Bergeron a d\u00e9pos\u00e9, le 10 octobre 2000, une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) contre son employeur, T\u00e9l\u00e9bec Limit\u00e9e (T\u00e9l\u00e9bec). Il all\u00e8gue que son employeur a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 son endroit en le traitant de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9favorable en emploi et en refusant de lui offrir un milieu de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience (d\u00e9pression) contrairement aux articles 7 et 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi).\n[2] Pierre Bergeron a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte, le 10 octobre 2000, devant la Commission dans laquelle il all\u00e8gue que Alain Rivard, \u00e0 l'emploi de T\u00e9l\u00e9bec, a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 son endroit en le harcelant en cours d'emploi en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience (d\u00e9pression) contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l'article 14 de la Loi.\n[3] Au d\u00e9but de l'audience, la Commission a annonc\u00e9 que les faits \u00e0 l'origine des plaintes justifiaient leur examen par un Tribunal des droits de la personne. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son r\u00f4le \u00e0 l'audience se limiterait \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration d'ouverture o\u00f9 elle a rappel\u00e9 les principes qui doivent guider le Tribunal dans toute affaire qui traite des droits de la personne et plus particuli\u00e8rement en mati\u00e8re de discrimination.\nII. LA PREUVE A. Preuve du plaignant (i) Pierre Bergeron [4] Pierre Bergeron a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 chez T\u00e9l\u00e9bec comme installateur-r\u00e9parateur le 7 mai 1987. Il poss\u00e9dait un DEC en sciences humaines et un DEC en \u00e9lectronique. Il s'agissait d'un poste temporaire pour le secteur de Rouyn-Noranda. Apr\u00e8s avoir travaill\u00e9 trois (3) semaines en compagnonnage avec un employ\u00e9 plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mut\u00e9 \u00e0 Ville-Marie o\u00f9 il exerce seul ses fonctions. En avril 1988, il obtient un poste permanent d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur \u00e0 La Sarre.\n[5] En 1990, le plaignant pose sa candidature au poste d'\u00e9pisseur \u00e0 La Sarre et il obtient ce poste le 23 avril 1990. Le 20 novembre 1995, il est inform\u00e9 de sa mise \u00e0 pied effective le 6 d\u00e9cembre 1995 avec droit de rappel pour une p\u00e9riode de 24 mois.\n[6] Une convention collective r\u00e9git les relations de travail des employ\u00e9s de T\u00e9l\u00e9bec. Le t\u00e9moin reconna\u00eet que son anciennet\u00e9 ne lui permettait pas de conserver son emploi dans sa cat\u00e9gorie d'emploi d'\u00e9pisseur mais qu'elle lui permettait de supplanter dans la cat\u00e9gorie d'emploi d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur parce qu'il \u00e9tait capable de r\u00e9pondre aux exigences du poste qu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 occup\u00e9 pendant trois ans. L'intim\u00e9e lui a refus\u00e9 d'exercer son droit de supplantation. Il d\u00e9pose un grief le 6 d\u00e9cembre 1995 lequel est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l'arbitrage le 25 avril 1996 et l'Union des Routiers retire le grief le 30 avril 1997.\n[7] Pierre Bergeron pr\u00e9tend que s'il avait pu exercer son droit de supplantation, il aurait maintenu un emploi stable mais que ce refus a cr\u00e9\u00e9 chez lui un \u00e9tat d'ins\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui fut \u00e0 l'origine de la d\u00e9pression qu'il a subie en ao\u00fbt 1996.\n[8] Lors d'une rencontre du comit\u00e9 de griefs en mars 1996, il a appris, sans pouvoir identifier la source exacte de cette information, que les employ\u00e9s inscrits sur la liste de rappel ne seraient jamais r\u00e9embauch\u00e9s. Toutefois, il est rappel\u00e9 au travail d\u00e8s le 26 mars 1996 comme monteur de lignes \u00e0 Sainte-Rose, projet Lac Abitibi, d'une dur\u00e9e approximative de deux mois et demi. Ses conditions de travail n'\u00e9taient plus celles pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 la convention collective en vigueur lors de sa mise \u00e0 pied en d\u00e9cembre 1995, notamment le temps de d\u00e9placement n'\u00e9tait plus r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 et l'indemnit\u00e9 de repas avait \u00e9t\u00e9 abolie.\n[9] Le 15 mai 1996, le plaignant \u00e9tait avis\u00e9 de sa mise \u00e0 pied effective le 31 mai 1996 avec un droit de rappel de 24 mois. Toutefois, le 27 mai 1996, Pierre Bergeron est avis\u00e9 que sa mise \u00e0 pied est report\u00e9e \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure. Du 3 au 21 juin 1996, le plaignant obtient une promotion int\u00e9rimaire comme \u00e9pisseur. Le 12 juin 1996, le plaignant est \u00e0 nouveau avis\u00e9 de sa mise \u00e0 pied effective le 12 juillet 1996, laquelle fut report\u00e9e au 2 ao\u00fbt 1996.\n[10] Le t\u00e9moin raconte que, vers le 19 juillet 1996, Claude Mayrand lui a offert un poste permanent d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur \u00e0 Val d'Or \u00e0 compter du 6 ao\u00fbt 1996. Pierre Bergeron avait fait une demande de mutation le 15 mai 1996 comme installateur-r\u00e9parateur \u00e0 Val-d'Or, suite \u00e0 l'affichage de deux postes (Pi\u00e8ce I-14) d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur \u00e0 Val-d'Or ; il a accept\u00e9 le poste. Cette acceptation mettait fin \u00e0 sa promotion int\u00e9rimaire. Elle constituait pour lui une r\u00e9trogradation qui lui convenait en raison du caract\u00e8re permanent du poste. \u00c0 la fin de la p\u00e9riode d'affichage, le plaignant avait appris que l'intim\u00e9e n'avait retenue aucune des candidatures re\u00e7ues. Par cons\u00e9quent, lorsque ce poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offert, il ne s'agissait pas pour lui du poste sur lequel il avait pos\u00e9 sa candidature. Il a plut\u00f4t compris que cette offre \u00e9tait la reconnaissance par l'employeur du droit de supplantation qu'il avait revendiqu\u00e9 par le grief formul\u00e9 suite \u00e0 sa mise \u00e0 pied du 6 d\u00e9cembre 1995. Cependant, il n'a pas retir\u00e9 ce grief car il soup\u00e7onnait son employeur de lui avoir tendu un pi\u00e8ge. Pour lui, T\u00e9l\u00e9bec croyait qu'il ne pourrait remplir les t\u00e2ches d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur et qu'il quitterait son emploi. Il pr\u00e9tend que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus par la suite ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que ses appr\u00e9hensions \u00e9taient bien fond\u00e9es.\n[11] Le mardi 6 ao\u00fbt 1996, il s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Val-d'Or \u00e0 son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat, Claude Mayrand. Ce dernier ne semblait pas \u00eatre au courant de son arriv\u00e9e et il n'avait ni v\u00e9hicule, ni outils \u00e0 lui fournir pour l'ex\u00e9cution de son travail. Le plaignant s'est rendu \u00e0 l'entrep\u00f4t pour rassembler ses outils.\n[12] Le lendemain, on a mis un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 sa disposition dans lequel il a plac\u00e9 ses outils de travail pour travailler ensuite avec un coll\u00e8gue. \u00c0 la fin de la journ\u00e9e, comme il n'avait pas suffisamment d'outils pour r\u00e9aliser un travail ad\u00e9quat, il a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat de prendre cong\u00e9 le jeudi et le vendredi pour reprendre le travail le lundi suivant avec un v\u00e9hicule muni des \u00e9quipements requis et utilis\u00e9 par un \u00e9tudiant dont l'emploi se terminait \u00e0 la fin de la semaine. Son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat a accept\u00e9 sa suggestion. Le plaignant raconte qu'au cours de la fin de semaine, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le 10 ao\u00fbt 1996, il a fait une d\u00e9pression qui s'est traduite par une tentative de suicide.\n[13] Il a consult\u00e9 son m\u00e9decin traitant, le Dr Guy Perrier, le 12 ao\u00fbt 1996, et ce dernier a diagnostiqu\u00e9 une d\u00e9pression majeure ; il lui a recommand\u00e9 une hospitalisation mais il a refus\u00e9. Son m\u00e9decin l'a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 un psychologue et il a pr\u00e9vu un retour au travail \u00e0 temps plein le 16 septembre 1996. Il a revu son m\u00e9decin le 1er octobre 1996 lequel a prolong\u00e9 l'absence du travail jusqu'au 4 novembre 1996 ; il a rencontr\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau son m\u00e9decin le 30 octobre 1996 et il a pr\u00e9vu un retour au travail, sans restriction, \u00e0 temps partiel le 2 d\u00e9cembre 1996.\n[14] Dans la semaine du 12 ao\u00fbt 1996, Claude Mayrand s'est rendu \u00e0 son domicile pour lui remettre la formule m\u00e9dicale BC1935 qu'il devait faire remplir par son m\u00e9decin traitant et acheminer \u00e0 son employeur. Pierre Bergeron pr\u00e9tend que le but de cette visite n'\u00e9tait qu'un pr\u00e9texte car on voulait s'assurer qu'il \u00e9tait vraiment malade. De plus, au cours de sa p\u00e9riode de convalescence qui s'est termin\u00e9e le 2 d\u00e9cembre 1996, il a remarqu\u00e9 que Claude Mayrand est pass\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, au volant de son v\u00e9hicule, devant sa r\u00e9sidence en circulant lentement. Pierre Bergeron estime que son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat agissait de la sorte pour v\u00e9rifier s'il \u00e9tait chez lui et il s'est senti harcel\u00e9.\n[15] Au cours de cette m\u00eame p\u00e9riode de convalescence, ayant obtenu un poste permanent d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur \u00e0 Val-d'Or, le plaignant, r\u00e9sidant \u00e0 La Sarre, a entre-pris des d\u00e9marches pour acqu\u00e9rir une r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de son lieu de travail. Il a sign\u00e9 une offre d'achat d'une r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 Val Senneville le 4 novembre 1996.\n[16] Le 26 novembre 1996, le plaignant a rencontr\u00e9 le Dr Jean-Joseph Cond\u00e9, m\u00e9decin de T\u00e9l\u00e9bec, avec lequel il a convenu d'un retour progressif au travail, sans restriction, \u00e0 raison de deux jours cons\u00e9cutifs dans la semaine du 2 d\u00e9cembre 1996, trois jours par semaine \u00e0 compter du 9 d\u00e9cembre 1996 et \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 compter du 3 janvier 1997. Il s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au travail le 2 d\u00e9cembre 1996. Il raconte qu'\u00e0 la suite de ces deux journ\u00e9es de travail il se sentait \u00e9puis\u00e9. Il a eu l'occasion de rencontrer Claude Mayrand et Alain Rivard. Aux yeux du plaignant, cette rencontre visait \u00e0 lui mettre \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de pression dans le but de l'amener \u00e0 quitter son poste. Alain Rivard lui aurait dit : Tu es mieux d'abandonner avant d'y rester.\n[17] Le lundi 9 d\u00e9cembre 1996, il a rencontr\u00e9, en l'absence du Dr Cond\u00e9, l'infirmi\u00e8re au bureau de ce dernier, pour lui expliquer qu'il avait \u00e9prouv\u00e9 des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 effectuer deux jours cons\u00e9cutifs de travail la semaine pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Il a convenu avec l'infirmi\u00e8re qu'il effectuerait au cours de cette semaine deux jours cons\u00e9cutifs de travail au lieu de trois jours comme pr\u00e9vu.\n[18] Au cours de cette p\u00e9riode de travail, Claude Mayrand et Alain Rivard, ses sup\u00e9rieurs imm\u00e9diats, l'ont amen\u00e9 dans un local pour lui adresser des reproches sur son rendement au travail et ses absences non justifi\u00e9es. Il raconte qu'il s'est mis \u00e0 pleurer suite aux reproches qui lui \u00e9taient adress\u00e9s.\n[19] Dans la semaine du 16 d\u00e9cembre 1996, Pierre Bergeron a travaill\u00e9 les 16, 18 et 20 d\u00e9cembre. Le lundi, 16 d\u00e9cembre 1996, Alain Rivard l'a inform\u00e9 qu'il pr\u00e9voyait, dans les prochains jours, l'installation d'un syst\u00e8me de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone affaires, soit trois lignes t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques avec une possibilit\u00e9 de huit t\u00e9l\u00e9phones. Le plaignant a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Alain Rivard de recevoir une formation pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 l'installation de ce syst\u00e8me de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, plus particuli\u00e8rement quant \u00e0 la programmation. Cette demande de formation lui fut refus\u00e9e par Andr\u00e9 Rivard qui lui aurait mentionn\u00e9 que s'il avait obtenu le poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur c'\u00e9tait parce qu'il devait savoir quoi faire. Au cours de cette journ\u00e9e, il a fait des travaux de filage chez Val-d'Or Performance. Il d\u00e9clare ne pas se souvenir avoir fait une demande \u00e0 Claude Mayrand, au cours de la semaine du 16 d\u00e9cembre 1996, pour prendre cong\u00e9 les 23 et 24 d\u00e9cembre 1996.\n[20] Le 18 d\u00e9cembre 1996, \u00e0 son arriv\u00e9e au travail, le syst\u00e8me de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone affaires devait \u00eatre install\u00e9 et le plaignant s'est rendu chez le client, la Brasserie la P\u00e9pie \u00e0 Val-d'Or. Il a d\u00fb enlever d'abord le syst\u00e8me t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique existant et proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'installation du nouveau syst\u00e8me. Au cours de son travail, le plaignant a constat\u00e9 une erreur d'assignement du central de sorte que les num\u00e9ros de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone n'\u00e9taient pas achemin\u00e9s au bon endroit. Il a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier au probl\u00e8me avec l'aide d'un confr\u00e8re de travail qui faisait une installation dans un commerce \u00e0 proximit\u00e9.\n[21] Le t\u00e9moin raconte que son travail d'installation et de programmation s'est bien d\u00e9roul\u00e9 \u00e0 l'exception d'emp\u00eacher la possibilit\u00e9 d'appels interurbains depuis l'appareil t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique dans la cuisine. Il a fait part au client qu'un confr\u00e8re de travail viendrait compl\u00e9ter le travail.\n[22] Le t\u00e9moin a proc\u00e9d\u00e9, \u00e0 la demande du client, au d\u00e9placement d'un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone public. Comme ce travail n'\u00e9tait pas initialement pr\u00e9vu, il a fait appel \u00e0 un coll\u00e8gue pour obtenir les outils n\u00e9cessaires et il a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 au d\u00e9placement du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone public. Pierre Bergeron \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s satisfait de sa journ\u00e9e de travail et, pour lui, le client \u00e9tait \u00e9galement tr\u00e8s satisfait.\n[23] Comme il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 maladie le jeudi, il est revenu au travail le vendredi matin, 20 d\u00e9cembre 1996. Il fut re\u00e7u \u00e0 nouveau par Claude Mayrand et Alain Rivard. Alain Rivard lui a adress\u00e9 des reproches sur la qualit\u00e9 du travail effectu\u00e9 chez Val-d'Or Performance le lundi pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. Il lui a dit qu'il n'avait pas besoin d'un gars qui n'\u00e9tait pas capable de suivre le groupe. Il lui a m\u00eame conseill\u00e9 d'abandonner avant d'y laisser sa peau.\n[24] Le plaignant r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'il s'est senti \u00e9cras\u00e9, humili\u00e9 et qu'il a \u00e9clat\u00e9 en sanglots, mais il a quand m\u00eame d\u00e9but\u00e9 sa journ\u00e9e de travail chez un client, pour effectuer du pr\u00e9filage. La semaine du 23 d\u00e9cembre 1996, les effectifs \u00e9taient r\u00e9duits pour la p\u00e9riode des F\u00eates et il devait travailler les 23 et 24 d\u00e9cembre 1996 pour r\u00e9pondre aux urgences et il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 par la suite jusqu'au 6 janvier 1997. Vers 15 h 30, il se sentait \u00e0 bout et au bord des larmes. Il est revenu au bureau et a fait le m\u00e9nage de son camion. Le t\u00e9moin a avis\u00e9 son r\u00e9partiteur qu'il quittait le travail et qu'il avertirait la secr\u00e9taire. En arrivant au bureau de la secr\u00e9taire, il s'est mis \u00e0 pleurer et n'a pu lui parler ; il lui a fait signe qu'il partait alors qu'il \u00e9tait 16 h 30 et qu'il devait terminer \u00e0 17 h 00. En sortant du bureau de la secr\u00e9taire, il a crois\u00e9 du regard Claude Mayrand. Il \u00e9tait trop angoiss\u00e9 pour lui parler et il lui a fait un signe de la main. Malgr\u00e9 les sympt\u00f4mes de d\u00e9pression qu'il ressentait, ce n'est que le 13 janvier 1997 qu'il a jug\u00e9 bon de rencontrer son m\u00e9decin.\n[25] Il est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 sa r\u00e9sidence de La Sarre et, au cours de la fin de la semaine, il pense avoir trop festoy\u00e9 ou trop mang\u00e9 de sorte que le lundi matin, 23 d\u00e9cembre 1996, il \u00e9tait toujours \u00e0 sa r\u00e9sidence et malade, souffrant d'une gastro-ent\u00e9rite.\n[26] Avant le d\u00e9but de son quart de travail, il a communiqu\u00e9 avec la secr\u00e9taire pour lui dire qu'il s'absentait parce qu'il \u00e9tait malade et que, s'il n'appelait pas le lendemain, il serait \u00e9galement absent. Il a demand\u00e9 une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de son absence par l'utilisation de cong\u00e9s annuels au lieu de cong\u00e9s maladie.\n[27] Le 6 janvier 1997, le plaignant se pr\u00e9sente au travail. Il pr\u00e9tend que, malgr\u00e9 l'entente avec le Dr Cond\u00e9 pour un retour au travail, sans restriction, \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 compter du 6 janvier 1997, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que sa semaine de travail serait de quatre jours. Il dit en avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 son m\u00e9decin traitant mais aucun document ne le confirme.\n[28] Le plaignant raconte qu'\u00e0 son arriv\u00e9e au travail le lundi 6 janvier 1997, il \u00e9tait attendu par Alain Rivard et Claude Mayrand. Ils lui ont reproch\u00e9 d'avoir quitt\u00e9 son travail le 20 d\u00e9cembre pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent sans avoir avis\u00e9 son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat. Alain Rivard lui a \u00e9galement reproch\u00e9 son absence non motiv\u00e9e du 23 d\u00e9cembre 1996 qui d\u00e9montrait qu'on ne pouvait pas se fier sur lui. Il lui a de nouveau reproch\u00e9 la qualit\u00e9 de son travail, notamment \u00e0 la Brasserie la P\u00e9pie. Alain Rivard aurait ajout\u00e9 qu'une lettre de r\u00e9primande serait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans son dossier et il pr\u00e9tend que ce fut fait. Pierre Bergeron a tent\u00e9 de fournir des explications mais on se refusait de l'\u00e9couter et, de nouveau, il s'est mis \u00e0 pleurer. Appel\u00e9 en contre-interrogatoire \u00e0 fournir des pr\u00e9cisions quant \u00e0 cette lettre de r\u00e9primande qui devait \u00eatre port\u00e9e \u00e0 son dossier, le t\u00e9moin r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 un m\u00e9mo du 23 d\u00e9cembre 1996 transmis par Claude Mayrand \u00e0 Alain Rivard.\n[29] Apr\u00e8s cette rencontre, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 \u00e0 un travail de pr\u00e9filage chez un concessionnaire d'automobiles. Les trois jours suivants, il a accept\u00e9 de travailler de 16 h 00 \u00e0 minuit avec deux coll\u00e8gues de travail. Il faisait du pr\u00e9filage dans un \u00e9difice gouvernemental.\n[30] M\u00eame s'il croyait toujours que sa semaine de travail \u00e9tait de quatre jours et qu'ils \u00e9taient compl\u00e9t\u00e9s, il s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au travail le vendredi 10 janvier 1997. \u00c0 la fin de sa journ\u00e9e de travail, il est convoqu\u00e9 pour une rencontre avec Claude Mayrand en pr\u00e9sence de Jean Levert, d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical. Andr\u00e9 Rivard a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la rencontre par vid\u00e9o conf\u00e9rence. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que depuis qu'il occupait le poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur, Pierre Bergeron n'avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu'il \u00e9tait en mesure d'accomplir les nouvelles t\u00e2ches, conform\u00e9ment aux normes demand\u00e9es et exig\u00e9es pour ce poste.\n[31] Par cons\u00e9quent, il \u00e9tait retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 son poste d'origine comme \u00e9pisseur de c\u00e2bles \u00e0 La Sarre. Toutefois, comme ce poste avait \u00e9t\u00e9 aboli en d\u00e9cembre 1995, il serait en mise \u00e0 pied \u00e0 compter du 24 janvier 1997 avec droit de rappel pour une p\u00e9riode de 24 mois. Claude Mayrand lui a remis un avis \u00e9crit de mise \u00e0 pied dat\u00e9 du 10 janvier 1997 (Pi\u00e8ce-P-21).\n[32] Suite \u00e0 sa mise \u00e0 pied, Pierre Bergeron a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief en date du 26 janvier 1997 lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 par le syndicat le 30 avril 1997. Malgr\u00e9 sa mise \u00e0 pied pr\u00e9vue pour le 24 janvier 1997, T\u00e9l\u00e9bec lui a offert et il a accept\u00e9 un travail d'\u00e9pisseur pour l'ex\u00e9cution d'un projet dans le Parc de la V\u00e9rendrye pour la p\u00e9riode du 27 janvier 1997 au 21 f\u00e9vrier 1997 et ce, en vertu d'une entente avec l'Union des Routiers. Il travaillait avec un autre \u00e9pisseur, Serge Chayer. Toutefois, les conditions de travail normalement pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 la convention collective n'\u00e9taient pas respect\u00e9es. C'est ainsi que les allocations de transport, de logement et de repas \u00e9taient abolies. En outre, le temps de d\u00e9placement de son port d'attache jusqu'au lieu de travail n'\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9. Il n'a toutefois formul\u00e9 aucun grief.\n[33] Au moment de sa mise \u00e0 pied le 21 f\u00e9vrier 1997, le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que Serge Chayer est demeur\u00e9 au travail bien qu'il ait moins d'anciennet\u00e9 que lui. Par contre, le plaignant n'a formul\u00e9 aucun grief.\n[34] Au cours du mois de juillet 1997 Pierre Bergeron a re\u00e7u un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du d\u00e9partement des ressources humaines. On lui offrait un travail au poste d'\u00e9pisseur pour la r\u00e9habilitation du c\u00e2ble alimentant l'a\u00e9roport \u00e0 Chibougamau. Il s'agissait d'une p\u00e9riode de travail de 52 heures au cours de la semaine du 4 ao\u00fbt 1997, ce que le plaignant a accept\u00e9. Les conditions d'emploi lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9es par une lettre de Claude Mayrand dat\u00e9e du 4 ao\u00fbt 1997. Les conditions de travail, convenues par une lettre d'entente avec l'Union des Routiers, n'\u00e9taient pas conformes \u00e0 la convention collective selon les pr\u00e9tentions du plaignant mais il a accept\u00e9 quand m\u00eame de revenir au travail, d'autant plus qu'\u00e0 la fin de cette p\u00e9riode d'emploi il pouvait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier \u00e0 nouveau d'un droit de rappel de 24 mois et il n'a pas fait de grief.\n[35] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le premier lundi du mois d'ao\u00fbt \u00e9tait un jour de cong\u00e9 f\u00e9ri\u00e9, il a obtenu la permission de son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat, Claude Mayrand, de se rendre de La Sarre \u00e0 Chibougamau dans la journ\u00e9e du 4 ao\u00fbt 1997 et de d\u00e9buter le travail le mardi, soit le 5 ao\u00fbt 1997. Son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat, Claude Mayrand, a inform\u00e9 par \u00e9crit, le 16 septembre 1997, Lyne Doroftei que le travail r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par le plaignant \u00e9tait satisfaisant.\n[36] Au cours du mois d'octobre 1997, on lui a offert un travail temporaire d'\u00e9pisseur de c\u00e2ble d'une dur\u00e9e approximative de six semaines \u00e0 compter du 20 octobre 1997 et il a accept\u00e9. Il s'agissait d'un projet \u00e0 Chibougamau d'une dur\u00e9e approximative de six mois. Les travaux r\u00e9alis\u00e9s \u00e9taient confi\u00e9s en sous-traitance \u00e0 l'exception de l'\u00e9pissage qui \u00e9tait confi\u00e9 aux employ\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9e. Une fois de plus, les conditions d'embauche sur ce projet n'\u00e9taient pas conformes \u00e0 la convention collective en raison d'une lettre d'entente intervenue entre l'employeur et l'Union des Routiers.\n[37] Pierre Bergeron estime que les ententes intervenues entre T\u00e9l\u00e9bec et l'Union des Routiers, lesquelles d\u00e9rogeaient aux dispositions de la convention collective, ne s'appliquaient pas \u00e0 lui comme \u00e9pisseur car elles visaient uniquement les techniciens, monteurs de lignes. \u00c0 l'occasion des assignations temporaires qu'il a accept\u00e9es, T\u00e9l\u00e9bec aurait d\u00fb lui consentir tous les avantages pr\u00e9vus dans la convention collective. Par cons\u00e9quent, il croit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'un traitement diff\u00e9rent de la part de l'intim\u00e9e par rapport aux autres employ\u00e9s qui ont b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 des avantages pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 cette convention collective.\n[38] Bien qu'il soit toujours en d\u00e9saccord avec les conditions particuli\u00e8res pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 cette lettre d'entente, il accepte le travail offert et ne fait pas de grief. Son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat est Richard Leblanc. \u00c0 la fin du mois de novembre 1997, son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat l'a avis\u00e9 que le contrat \u00e9tait prolong\u00e9 pour une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Il a compris, des propos de Richard Leblanc, qu'il aurait du travail jusqu'\u00e0 la fin du projet. Cependant, il ne se souvient pas que Richard Leblanc lui ait mentionn\u00e9 que son assignation temporaire se terminerait le 24 d\u00e9cembre 1997.\n[39] Pierre Bergeron raconte qu'au d\u00e9but de d\u00e9cembre 1997 il a eu des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9. Il soutient qu'il anticipait une rechute en d\u00e9pression. Le 8 d\u00e9cembre 1997, il s'est rendu au CLSC de la Radissonnie-Chibougamau o\u00f9 il a rencontr\u00e9 un m\u00e9decin qui lui a prescrit du Paxil. Le t\u00e9moin r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'il a mal r\u00e9agi au Plaxil et qu'il a d\u00fb \u00eatre hospitalis\u00e9 les 9, 10 et 11 d\u00e9cembre 1997 \u00e0 Chibougamau.\n[40] Le 10 d\u00e9cembre 1997, Pierre Bergeron a re\u00e7u la visite d'Alain Rivard qui lui a remis un avis \u00e9crit de la part de son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat, Richard Leblanc, \u00e0 l'effet qu'il \u00e9tait mis \u00e0 pied \u00e0 compter du 24 d\u00e9cembre 1997 avec un droit de rappel pour une p\u00e9riode de 24 mois.\n[41] Le 11 d\u00e9cembre 1997, un m\u00e9decin du CLSC de la Radissonnie \u00e9mettait un certificat m\u00e9dical avec un diagnostic de d\u00e9pression et un arr\u00eat de travail \u00e0 compter du 9 d\u00e9cembre 1997.\n[42] Le plaignant a quitt\u00e9 l'h\u00f4pital de Chibougamau le 11 d\u00e9cembre 1997. Il a voyag\u00e9 de Chibougamau \u00e0 Val-d'Or avec le v\u00e9hicule de son employeur puis avec son propre v\u00e9hicule jusqu'\u00e0 son domicile \u00e0 La Sarre.\n[43] Il a rencontr\u00e9 son m\u00e9decin traitant, le Dr Guy Perrier, le 15 d\u00e9cembre 1997 lequel a recommand\u00e9 un arr\u00eat de travail du 15 au 29 d\u00e9cembre 1997. Il a revu le plaignant le 6 janvier 1998. Dans son rapport. Il fait \u00e9tat d'une d\u00e9pression subie par son patient et il recommande un retour au travail \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 compter du 6 janvier 1998.\n[44] Suite \u00e0 sa mise \u00e0 pied, le plaignant n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 au travail. Entre le 21 mai 1998 et le 10 septembre 1998, il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 10 griefs. Apr\u00e8s analyse, l'Union des Routiers est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la conclusion que ces griefs, \u00e0 l'exception d'un grief visant le paiement d'un montant forfaitaire, n'\u00e9taient pas justifi\u00e9s. Le plaignant a port\u00e9 plainte aupr\u00e8s du Conseil canadien des relations industrielles le 2 octobre 1998 et ce, \u00e0 l'encontre de l'Union des Routiers, pour d\u00e9faut de respecter son devoir de repr\u00e9sentation et il n'a pas obtenu gain de cause.\n[45] Le plaignant a produit un rapport d'appr\u00e9ciation pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par Jean Mercier, directeur de l'entretien r\u00e9seau et travaux pour l'ann\u00e9e 1995. Jean Mercier mentionne que le plaignant rencontre les normes de qualit\u00e9 et de productivit\u00e9 comme \u00e9pisseur de c\u00e2bles a\u00e9riens, souterrains et dans les b\u00e2timents. Il a contribu\u00e9 aux succ\u00e8s de l'\u00e9quipe dans la r\u00e9alisation des projets auxquels il a \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9. De plus, la qualit\u00e9 et la gestion administrative de son travail se sont encore am\u00e9lior\u00e9es et l'employ\u00e9 g\u00e8re bien son mat\u00e9riel de m\u00eame que sa sant\u00e9 et s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail. Son efficacit\u00e9 est \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 celle de ses confr\u00e8res.\n[46] Le t\u00e9moin a \u00e9galement produit un rapport d'appr\u00e9ciation pour l'ann\u00e9e 1996 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par Claude Mayrand et dat\u00e9 du 3 mars 1997. Ce rapport fait \u00e9tat des difficult\u00e9s d`adaptation du plaignant aux changements survenus dans l'entreprise et qui l'ont forc\u00e9 \u00e0 changer pour passer d'un poste d'\u00e9pisseur \u00e0 celui d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur. La productivit\u00e9 et la qualit\u00e9 au travail n'ont pu \u00eatre rencontr\u00e9es. Il n'a pas r\u00e9sist\u00e9 \u00e0 la pression qu'a apport\u00e9e l'ex\u00e9cution d'un nouveau poste.\n[47] Pierre Bergeron a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9crire les t\u00e2ches d'un installateur-r\u00e9parateur au cours des trois ann\u00e9es qui ont suivi son embauche chez T\u00e9l\u00e9bec, soit de 1987 \u00e0 1990. Il fut affect\u00e9 \u00e0 l'installation et \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration de lignes t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques au secteur r\u00e9sidentiel. Le travail \u00e0 effectuer lui \u00e9tait assign\u00e9 \u00e0 partir d'un ordre de travail. L'installation consistait \u00e0 amener un fil depuis la bo\u00eete de jonction du poteau jusqu'\u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence et \u00e0 proc\u00e9der au filage \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de la r\u00e9sidence selon le nombre de prises de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone demand\u00e9es par le client. L'installateur-r\u00e9parateur livrait \u00e9galement l'appareil t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique au client. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, l'appareil t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique ne comportait pas de programmation. Les travaux de r\u00e9parations exigeaient que l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur se rende chez le client pour identifier la source de la d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9. S'il s'agissait de l'appareil t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, il \u00e9tait chang\u00e9. S'il s'agissait du filage ou des raccordements, l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur proc\u00e9dait aux r\u00e9parations. Le travail au secteur r\u00e9sidentiel repr\u00e9sentait environ 80 % de l'emploi du temps du plaignant.\n[48] Il \u00e9tait \u00e9galement appel\u00e9, \u00e0 l'occasion, \u00e0 faire le m\u00eame travail au secteur affaires mais dans une proportion d'environ 20 %. Il a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'installation d'un syst\u00e8me t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique Panth\u00e8re muni de la programmation permettant d'offrir certaines options aux clients tels que la sonnerie, la mise en attente. Pour le plaignant, il \u00e9tait beaucoup plus difficile de programmer un syst\u00e8me de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone en 1987 que de nos jours. Il a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 l'installation d'un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone public mais la programmation n'\u00e9tait pas de son ressort.\n[49] En mars 1988, le plaignant a re\u00e7u une formation de huit heures sur le syst\u00e8me de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone Trillium et, en mars 1989, une formation de huit heures sur le syst\u00e8me t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique Tie . Chacun de ces syst\u00e8mes \u00e9taient utilis\u00e9s dans le secteur affaires. Il reconna\u00eet toutefois que, malgr\u00e9 la formation dispens\u00e9e par son employeur, il n'a pas eu \u00e0 installer ces syst\u00e8mes t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques et faire la programmation. Son travail s'est limit\u00e9 \u00e0 effectuer des r\u00e9parations sur ces syst\u00e8mes.\n[50] Le 7 mai 1996, T\u00e9l\u00e9bec a affich\u00e9 deux postes d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur (96-19NO et 96 20NO) sur l'un desquels Pierre Bergeron a pos\u00e9 sa candidature. Pour obtenir le poste, le candidat devait r\u00e9pondre aux exigences minimales requises. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9, en contre-interrogatoire, \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer s'il pouvait r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 chacune de ces exigences \u00e0 savoir :\nDEC en \u00e9lectronique ou l'\u00e9quivalent de m\u00eame qu'un permis de conduire: Le plaignant d\u00e9clare qu'il r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 ces exigences.\nBilinguisme (fran\u00e7ais, anglais) : un avantage. Le plaignant d\u00e9clare qu'il pouvait \u00e9crire le fran\u00e7ais et l'anglais ; il parlait couramment le fran\u00e7ais mais tr\u00e8s peu l'anglais.\nConnaissance des diff\u00e9rents produits et services de l'entretien (s\u00e9rie Norstar et autres) : un avantage. Le plaignant reconna\u00eet que, comparativement \u00e0 1990 alors qu'il \u00e9tait installateur-r\u00e9parateur, beaucoup plus de services \u00e9taient offerts en 1995 et de nombreux produits s'\u00e9taient ajout\u00e9s, notamment avec l'arriv\u00e9e des ordinateurs. Des appareils t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques plus puissants et plus sophistiqu\u00e9s qu'il ne connaissait pas avaient envahi le march\u00e9.\nAptitude \u00e0 transiger et communiquer avec le client. Le plaignant admet qu'en 1990 son travail consistait \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter un ordre de travail et non pas la vente d'un syst\u00e8me de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Occasionnellement, il pouvait offrir au client de se doter de plus d'un appareil t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique.\nConnaissance des principes de la programmation. N'ayant effectu\u00e9 l'installation de syst\u00e8me t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec programmation qu'\u00e0 une seule reprise, le t\u00e9moin reconna\u00eet qu'il avait peu de connaissance des principes de la programmation.\nConnaissance de base de la transmission de donn\u00e9es. Le plaignant admet qu'il n'avait aucune connaissance de base lui permettant de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette exigence.\n[51] L'affichage du poste comportait \u00e9galement un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de l'emploi, notamment :\nCommuniquer pr\u00e9alablement avec le client. Le t\u00e9moin admet qu'il n'avait pas \u00e0 faire cette d\u00e9marche en 1990 et qu'en 1996 l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur \u00e9tait devenu un vendeur car il conseillait au client les produits en fonction des besoins de ce dernier.\nFournir \u00e0 l'occasion l'estimation du travail \u00e0 effectuer pour les installations affaires. Le t\u00e9moin admet que cette t\u00e2che ne relevait pas de l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur en 1990.\nProc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'inspection sommaire de son v\u00e9hicule, en \u00eatre responsable, le conduire s\u00e9curitairement pour l'ex\u00e9cution de son travail et signaler les difficult\u00e9s m\u00e9caniques. Le t\u00e9moin affirme que ces t\u00e2ches \u00e9taient les m\u00eames en 1990.\nFaire la promotion de la vente des produits\/services et de l'\u00e9quipement de la compagnie. Le plaignant d\u00e9clare que cette t\u00e2che n'\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9volue \u00e0 l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur en 1990 et il affirme ignorer qu'elle existait en 1996.\nRepr\u00e9senter ad\u00e9quatement l'entreprise aupr\u00e8s de la client\u00e8le. Le plaignant d\u00e9clare ignorer si cette t\u00e2che relevait de l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur en 1990.\nEffectuer le travail de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire, avec exactitude, rapidit\u00e9 et courtoisie ; \u00eatre disponible \u00e0 voyager. Ces obligations faisaient \u00e9galement partie des t\u00e2ches de l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur en 1990.\n[52] Pierre Bergeron a \u00e9galement d\u00e9crit le travail d'\u00e9pisseur. Il consiste \u00e0 proc\u00e9der au pointage de fils. Un c\u00e2ble central qui englobe de nombreux c\u00e2bles plus petits sont achemin\u00e9s par des voies souterraines dans diff\u00e9rents secteurs. L'\u00e9pisseur effectue le raccordement des fils. En 1992, la fibre optique a fait son apparition sur le march\u00e9. Le travail de pointage s'effectuait d\u00e8s lors au laser. En plus du pointage de fils, l'\u00e9pisseur faisait \u00e9galement la r\u00e9paration de c\u00e2bles sectionn\u00e9s et le changement de c\u00e2bles us\u00e9s.\n[53] Le plaignant, en juillet 2003, a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un document informatif sur la tenue de la pr\u00e9sente audition o\u00f9 il a inscrit que l'affaire r\u00e9sulte de harc\u00e8lement et discrimination \u00e0 son endroit par T\u00e9l\u00e9bec. Ce document est intitul\u00e9 Bienvenue au proc\u00e8s (Pi\u00e8ce I-2). Le plaignant a plac\u00e9 ce document dans le pare-brise des v\u00e9hicules des employ\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 Val-d'Or et Rouyn Noranda. Il disposait d'une quarantaine de copies de ce document. Il a pris \u00e9galement les dispositions pour que le document soit plac\u00e9 dans les casiers des employ\u00e9s et des cadres \u00e0 Rouyn Noranda. Il explique son geste parce qu'il souhaitait obtenir des encouragements de ses anciens coll\u00e8gues de travail.\nB. Preuve des intim\u00e9s (i) Serge Faubert [54] Jusqu'en 1997, alors qu'il a pris sa retraite apr\u00e8s 30 ans de service, Serge Faubert \u00e9tait directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du r\u00e9seau de services t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de T\u00e9l\u00e9bec pour l'Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue qui comptait environ 125 employ\u00e9s dirig\u00e9s par 10 sup\u00e9rieurs imm\u00e9diats dont Claude Mayrand et Alain Rivard.\n[55] Serge Faubert raconte qu'en 1987, \u00e0 son arriv\u00e9e en poste, le r\u00e9seau t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique Abitibi T\u00e9miscamingue \u00e9tait d\u00e9suet. T\u00e9l\u00e9bec a d\u00fb proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des investissements majeurs pour doter cette r\u00e9gion d'un r\u00e9seau \u00e0 la fine pointe de la haute technologie et comparable aux grands centres urbains. \u00c0 cette fin, une embauche massive d'employ\u00e9s s'est av\u00e9r\u00e9e n\u00e9cessaire. Cependant, \u00e0 mesure que le travail avan\u00e7ait, Serge Faubert indique qu'il avait identifi\u00e9 que des mises \u00e0 pied deviendraient n\u00e9cessaires, lesquelles se sont produites \u00e0 la fin de 1995.\n[56] Les coupures sont survenues chez les cadres et les employ\u00e9s, notamment ceux assign\u00e9s \u00e0 la pose de poteaux et c\u00e2bles de m\u00eame qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9pissage. Le t\u00e9moin pr\u00e9cise que l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 de mises \u00e0 pied a affect\u00e9 grandement le moral des travailleurs qui sont devenus nerveux et anxieux.\n[57] Avant de proc\u00e9der concr\u00e8tement \u00e0 la diminution du personnel, le t\u00e9moin a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 des rencontres avec les dirigeants du d\u00e9partement des ressources humaines et les repr\u00e9sentants syndicaux pour s'assurer que les mises \u00e0 pied se feraient dans le respect des termes de la convention collective.\n[58] Des listes des employ\u00e9s susceptibles d'\u00eatre rappel\u00e9s au travail pour des projets particuliers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 dress\u00e9es et les employ\u00e9s mis \u00e0 pied b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient, selon les termes de la convention collective, d'un droit de rappel au travail de 24 mois. Pour diminuer ses co\u00fbts d'op\u00e9ration, T\u00e9l\u00e9bec entendait faire appel \u00e0 la sous-traitance. Cependant, dans le but de favoriser le rappel au travail des employ\u00e9s sur la liste de rappel, T\u00e9l\u00e9bec a convenu avec l'Union des Routiers, par lettres d'entente, de modifier certaines conditions de travail pr\u00e9vues dans la convention collective.\n[59] C'est ainsi que Pierre Bergeron a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9, le 20 novembre 1995, de sa mise \u00e0 pied \u00e0 compter du 6 d\u00e9cembre 1995 en raison d'une baisse de travail suite \u00e0 une restructuration organisationnelle.\n[60] Serge Faubert raconte qu'\u00e0 la fin de 1996 ou d\u00e9but janvier 1997, il a rencontr\u00e9 Claude Mayrand et Alain Rivard, les sup\u00e9rieurs imm\u00e9diats du plaignant, pour discuter du fait que le plaignant s'\u00e9tait accord\u00e9 des cong\u00e9s alors que sa pr\u00e9sence au travail \u00e9tait requise. Le t\u00e9moin relate que les agissements de Pierre Bergeron auraient m\u00e9rit\u00e9, \u00e0 son avis, une mesure disciplinaire \u00e9crite \u00e0 son dossier.\n[61] Lors de cette rencontre, il fut \u00e9galement question des capacit\u00e9s et des comp\u00e9tences du plaignant \u00e0 accomplir les t\u00e2ches d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur. Ses sup\u00e9rieurs imm\u00e9diats estimaient qu'il n'avait pas les qualifications au niveau technique pour occuper le poste.\n[62] Serge Faubert r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'il comprenait tr\u00e8s bien leur \u00e9valuation. Il explique sa pr\u00e9tention du fait que les t\u00e2ches d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur avaient beaucoup chang\u00e9 au cours des ann\u00e9es. En effet, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 le plaignant avait travaill\u00e9 comme installateur-r\u00e9parateur de 1987 \u00e0 1990 ses t\u00e2ches consistaient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 faire de l'installation et de la r\u00e9paration dans le secteur r\u00e9sidentiel. En 1996, les t\u00e2ches \u00e9taient devenues beaucoup plus complexes puisque le travail s'effectuait dans le secteur affaires car elles exigeaient que l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur, en plus de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'installation, fasse la programmation de syst\u00e8mes plus sophistiqu\u00e9s, donc un travail beaucoup plus sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9, et qu'il fasse une approche avec le client ; il devait promouvoir la vente des \u00e9quipements.\n[63] De plus, Serge Faubert relate qu'il avait rencontr\u00e9 des coll\u00e8gues de travail du plaignant dont le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical Jean Levert qui lui avait fait part que ce dernier n'\u00e9tait pas capable de remplir les t\u00e2ches d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur. Il d\u00e9sirait conna\u00eetre les intentions de T\u00e9l\u00e9bec quant au maintien en emploi de cet employ\u00e9.\n(ii) Claude Mayrand [64] Claude Mayrand est \u00e0 l'emploi de T\u00e9l\u00e9bec depuis 20 ans. \u00c0 son embauche, il d\u00e9tenait un DEC en \u00e9lectrotechnique. Il a d\u00e9but\u00e9 comme installateur-r\u00e9parateur pendant trois ans. Il a travaill\u00e9 par la suite pendant un an et demi dans le groupe travaux qui proc\u00e8de \u00e0 l'implantation des poteaux, la pose de c\u00e2bles et de torons. Par la suite, il fut affect\u00e9 aux travaux de maintenance soit la r\u00e9paration de c\u00e2bles pendant environ deux ans. Claude Mayrand fut assign\u00e9 ensuite pendant deux ans et demi \u00e0 la Baie-James comme installateur-r\u00e9parateur. \u00c0 son retour de la Baie James il a \u00e9t\u00e9 promu directeur PDL (plans et devis de lignes). Deux ans plus tard, il est devenu directeur I & R (installation-r\u00e9paration) de 1995 \u00e0 1998. Par la suite, en 1998, il fut promu directeur gestion de r\u00e9seau jusqu'\u00e0 son retour aux \u00e9tudes en 2000.\n[65] Le t\u00e9moin a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9crire les t\u00e2ches inh\u00e9rentes au poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur qui s'exer\u00e7aient dans le secteur r\u00e9sidentiel et le secteur affaires au cours des ann\u00e9es 1987 \u00e0 1990.\n[66] Dans le secteur r\u00e9sidentiel, le travail de l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur comportait deux \u00e9tapes. Il y avait la partie c\u00e2blage externe qui consiste \u00e0 amener des fils de service depuis le poteau jusqu'\u00e0 un bo\u00eetier \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence du client, puis la partie c\u00e2blage int\u00e9rieur alors que l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur installe les fils dans la maison pour donner acc\u00e8s aux branchements des postes. L'ex\u00e9cution de ces t\u00e2ches exigeait la connaissance d'un code de couleur qui est inh\u00e9rent aux c\u00e2bles pour effectuer les branchements.\n[67] La deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape \u00e9tait la partie r\u00e9paration. Elle consistait \u00e0 d\u00e9brancher la ligne du client pour v\u00e9rifier l'aspect r\u00e9sistif de la ligne t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique et la condition de terre (ground).\n[68] Le t\u00e9moin soutient que, globalement, l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur consacrait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque 95 % de son temps de travail au secteur r\u00e9sidentiel.\n[69] Claude Mayrand affirme que l'intallateur-r\u00e9parateur exer\u00e7ait ses fonctions dans le secteur affaires que tr\u00e8s occasionnellement. Il s'agissait de l'installation de petits syst\u00e8mes t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques appel\u00e9s Trillium et Panth\u00e8re par un travail de c\u00e2blage. Il fallait \u00e9galement faire la programmation \u00e0 partir de registres fixes pr\u00e9-\u00e9tablis. \u00c0 titre d'exemple, le t\u00e9moin cite l'attribution de lignes \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents postes ou encore le type de sonnerie. Le t\u00e9moin estime \u00e0 1 % le travail de programmation requis de l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur.\n[70] En 1992, toujours dans le secteur affaires, le t\u00e9moin explique qu'on a vu appara\u00eetre les microprocesseurs qui ont conduit \u00e0 l'arriv\u00e9e de nombreux syst\u00e8mes t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques. Gr\u00e2ce au microprocesseur, le volet des donn\u00e9es transmises aux diff\u00e9rents postes est devenu plus large. Il a permis d'int\u00e9grer un langage de programmation aux syst\u00e8mes t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques. La disparition de registres fixes a permis d'offrir \u00e0 la client\u00e8le un syst\u00e8me beaucoup mieux adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 ses besoins.\n[71] Claude Mayand croit que par cette nouvelle technologie l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur doit ajouter \u00e0 ses t\u00e2ches habituelles un travail d'analyste. Le t\u00e9moin illustre cette affirmation par l'arriv\u00e9e du syst\u00e8me t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique Norstar qui comportait trois lignes et huit appareils t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques. Ce syst\u00e8me, selon lui, \u00e9tait peu compliqu\u00e9. Puis sont apparus les syst\u00e8mes 032 et SL1 o\u00f9 la programmation exige une compr\u00e9hension de la gestion des registres.\n[72] Par la suite, le t\u00e9moin raconte que la vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence est arriv\u00e9e sur le march\u00e9. L'installateur-r\u00e9parateur devait faire face \u00e0 une nouvelle technologie tout comme ce fut le cas avec l'arriv\u00e9e de l'internet.\n[73] En ce qui a trait au secteur r\u00e9sidentiel en 1996, les t\u00e2ches de l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur ont chang\u00e9, d'une part parce que le r\u00e9seau qui \u00e9tait d\u00e9suet avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9am\u00e9nag\u00e9 et que, d'autre part, les nouvelles installations \u00e9taient moins fr\u00e9quentes tout comme les besoins en r\u00e9paration.\n[74] Il soutient qu'en 1996 le travail de l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur \u00e9tait consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 90 % \u00e0 l'aspect technique, programmation et relations avec les clients et \u00e0 10 % au travail de l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur tel qu'il existait en 1990.\n[75] Le t\u00e9moin a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9crire en quoi les connaissances acquises par celui qui a obtenu un DEC en \u00e9lectronique sont utiles dans l'exercice de ses fonctions d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'avec ce dipl\u00f4me l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur dispose de solides connaissances de base au niveau de certains concepts \u00e9lectroniques tels que les condensateurs, les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes associ\u00e9s \u00e0 l'inducteur, les aspects reli\u00e9s \u00e0 la r\u00e9sistance et ceux reli\u00e9s \u00e0 la programmation.\n[76] Face \u00e0 la nouvelle technologie, le t\u00e9moin raconte que T\u00e9l\u00e9bec avait plac\u00e9 dans les centres de services, tels que ceux de Val-d'Or et Rouyn-Noranda, des syst\u00e8mes t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques \u00e0 la disposition des installateurs-r\u00e9parateurs pour leur permettre de se familiariser avec ces nouveaux \u00e9quipements et am\u00e9liorer leurs habilet\u00e9s. Des s\u00e9ances d'information \u00e9taient \u00e9galement donn\u00e9es par le fabricant des syst\u00e8mes.\n[77] Claude Mayrand \u00e9tait le sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat de Pierre Bergeron lorsqu'il s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au travail \u00e0 Val-d'Or le 6 ao\u00fbt 1996. Il reconna\u00eet qu'il se peut qu'il n'y ait pas eu de v\u00e9hicule disponible pour lui permettre d'ex\u00e9cuter son travail. Il ajoute toutefois que le plaignant \u00e9tait alors assign\u00e9 \u00e0 des travaux en compagnonnage avec un autre installateur-r\u00e9parateur pour effectuer un travail de c\u00e2blage chez Forage Beno\u00eet. Claude Mayrand s'est rendu sur les lieux pour v\u00e9rifier le travail qui \u00e9tait conforme. Il se souvient cependant que le coll\u00e8gue de travail du plaignant lui a mentionn\u00e9 que ce dernier \u00e9tait rouill\u00e9 et que son travail n'\u00e9tait pas tr\u00e8s productif.\n[78] Claude Mayrand se souvient que Pierre Bergeron s'est ensuite absent\u00e9 pour maladie et il est revenu au travail le 2 d\u00e9cembre 1996. \u00c0 ce moment, il n'est plus le sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat du plaignant et c'\u00e9tait Alain Rivard qui assumait cette responsabilit\u00e9. Il agissait \u00e0 titre de sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat de Pierre Bergeron uniquement en l'absence de Alain Rivard.\n[79] Claude Mayrand se souvient que, dans la semaine du 16 d\u00e9cembre 1996, alors qu'Alain Rivard \u00e9tait absent, le plaignant lui a demand\u00e9 la permission de prendre cong\u00e9 les 20 et 23 d\u00e9cembre 1996. Claude Mayrand s'est adress\u00e9 au Centre op\u00e9rationnel du r\u00e9seau (COR) pour conna\u00eetre les charges de travail \u00e0 ces dates ; le t\u00e9moin a refus\u00e9 la demande du plaignant vu que la charge de travail n\u00e9cessitait la pr\u00e9sence de tous les effectifs suivant la r\u00e9ponse transmise par le COR.\n[80] Le 20 d\u00e9cembre 1996, le t\u00e9moin raconte s'\u00eatre rendu au Centre de travail \u00e0 Val-d'Or. Vers 15 h 30, il a rencontr\u00e9 Pierre Bergeron dans le corridor. Il l'a salu\u00e9 et \u00e9chang\u00e9 quelques mots avec lui et le plaignant lui a dit qu'il allait bien. De retour \u00e0 son bureau, Claude Mayrand raconte avoir re\u00e7u un appel du COR l'avisant que le plaignant avait quitt\u00e9 le travail pour cause de maladie \u00e0 15 h 30 alors que son quart de travail se terminait \u00e0 17 h 00. Claude Mayrand a constat\u00e9 que le plaignant avait omis de l'aviser avant de quitter son travail comme il se devait de le faire.\n[81] De plus, le 23 d\u00e9cembre 1996, Claude Mayrand \u00e9tait en poste, en l'absence de Alain Rivard. Il a re\u00e7u un appel, vers 8 h 00, de Chantal B\u00e9dard, secr\u00e9taire, afin de l'aviser que le plaignant avait communiqu\u00e9 avec elle pour l'aviser qu'il ne pouvait pas se pr\u00e9senter au travail pour maladie et d'identifier son absence comme journ\u00e9e de vacances.\n[82] Comme Claude Mayrand savait qu'un employ\u00e9 ne peut prendre de vacances \u00e0 moins qu'elles ne soient pr\u00e9alablement autoris\u00e9es, il a communiqu\u00e9 avec les relations industrielles pour conna\u00eetre la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre. On lui a alors fait part qu'une mesure disciplinaire pourrait \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au dossier de Pierre Bergeron pour absence non justifi\u00e9e. Il a alors identifi\u00e9 l'absence comme une absence pour maladie. Claude Mayrand a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 attendre apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode des F\u00eates, alors que le sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat du plaignant, Alain Rivard, serait de retour au travail, pour prendre une d\u00e9cision. Il a toutefois pris soin d'adresser le jour m\u00eame \u00e0 Alain Rivard une lettre relatant les \u00e9v\u00e9nements et sugg\u00e9rant une rencontre avec le plaignant d\u00e8s le 6 janvier 1997.\n[83] Effectivement, Claude Mayrand a rencontr\u00e9 Alain Rivard le 6 janvier 1997 o\u00f9 il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le plaignant serait rencontr\u00e9 le 7 janvier 1997. Alain Rivard a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Claude Mayrand de l'accompagner vu qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent lors des \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Cette rencontre, au souvenir du t\u00e9moin, s'est tenue dans une salle de r\u00e9union au Centre de travail \u00e0 Val-d'Or vers le milieu de l'apr\u00e8s-midi du 7 janvier 1997. Elle fut d'une dur\u00e9e de 20 \u00e0 30 minutes.\n[84] Claude Mayrand se rappelle avoir d\u00e9but\u00e9 cette rencontre en disant \u00e0 Pierre Bergeron qu'il n'avait pas suivi la proc\u00e9dure en cas de d\u00e9part ou absence du travail et que son absence avait perturb\u00e9 les op\u00e9rations et oblig\u00e9 des coll\u00e8gues de travail \u00e0 faire des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. Le t\u00e9moin se rappelle que le plaignant a accueilli ses remarques d'une mani\u00e8re sto\u00efque. Puis, Alain Rivard a pris la parole en soulignant au plaignant qu'il avait des probl\u00e8mes de productivit\u00e9 et de l'aviser s'il avait des besoins sp\u00e9cifiques pour l'ex\u00e9cution de son travail car il voulait qu'il soit \u00e0 l'aise dans son emploi. Claude Mayrand raconte que le plaignant a mentionn\u00e9 que tout allait bien dans l'ex\u00e9cution de son travail et qu'il pouvait le faire aussi bien que tout autre installateur-r\u00e9parateur. Claude Mayrand se souvient \u00e9galement que le ton de la rencontre \u00e9tait poli et qu'en aucun temps le plaignant n'a pleur\u00e9.\n[85] Une fois cette rencontre termin\u00e9e, Claude Mayrand a poursuivi la discussion avec Alain Rivard. Ils se questionnaient sur les capacit\u00e9s et comp\u00e9tences du plaignant \u00e0 accomplir les t\u00e2ches d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur. Claude Mayrand a exprim\u00e9 \u00e0 Alain Rivard ses craintes sur les capacit\u00e9s techniques du plaignant et ses capacit\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper des habilet\u00e9s de communicateur dans sa t\u00e2che de promotion et vente des \u00e9quipements. De plus, Alain Rivard avait re\u00e7u des commentaires sur la qualit\u00e9 du travail r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par Pierre Bergeron \u00e0 la taverne La P\u00e9pie de la part du d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical, Jean Levert, et compagnon de travail du plaignant, \u00e0 l'effet que ce dernier \u00e9tait lent et qu'il devait faire son travail.\n[86] Une rencontre a \u00e9galement eu lieu avec Serge Faubert, le 8 janvier 1997, Alain Rivard et le t\u00e9moin. Serge Faubert n'\u00e9tait pas satisfait des mesures prises suite aux absences non motiv\u00e9es du plaignant. Il fut \u00e9galement question des capacit\u00e9s de Pierre Bergeron \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter ses fonctions. Le t\u00e9moin a \u00e9mis son opinion mais n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 une prise de d\u00e9cision. Claude Mayrand a fait part \u00e0 Serge Faubert et Alain Rivard que, suivant son exp\u00e9rience, Pierre Bergeron ne poss\u00e9dait pas les habilet\u00e9s et les connaissances requises pour r\u00e9pondre au profil n\u00e9cessaire selon les exigences requises en 1996 d'un installateur-r\u00e9parateur.\n[87] Claude Mayrand se souvient \u00e9galement que le 8 janvier 1997, en matin\u00e9e, Pierre Bergeron s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au bureau de son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat Alain Rivard. Il se trouvait dans le bureau voisin de celui d'Alain Rivard et il a entendu la teneur de la conversation. Pierre Bergeron aurait mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 Alain Rivard qu'il avait des doutes sur ses capacit\u00e9s \u00e0 faire le travail d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur et qu'il s'interrogeait \u00e0 savoir s'il maintiendrait son emploi. Cette rencontre a dur\u00e9 quelques minutes et Pierre Bergeron est retourn\u00e9 au travail.\n[88] Claude Mayrand se souvient que le 10 janvier 1997, en l'absence d'Alain Rivard, le d\u00e9partement des relations industrielles lui a demand\u00e9 de signer et de remettre \u00e0 Pierre Bergeron une lettre l'informant de sa mise \u00e0 pied comme installateur-r\u00e9parateur. Il a convoqu\u00e9 le plaignant dans la m\u00eame salle de r\u00e9union o\u00f9 avait eu lieu la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente rencontre et, en pr\u00e9sence du d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical Jean Levert, il lui a remis le document (Pi\u00e8ce P-21) apr\u00e8s lui en avoir fait la lecture. Pierre Bergeron a \u00e9mis le commentaire \u00e0 l'effet qu'il y aurait une suite \u00e0 cette mise \u00e0 pied. Il ne croit pas qu'Alain Rivard ait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 cette rencontre par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence.\n[89] Dans sa plainte, Pierre Bergeron a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu'au cours de sa p\u00e9riode d'absence pour maladie du 11 ao\u00fbt 1996 au 2 d\u00e9cembre 1996, Claude Mayrand lui rendait visite souvent \u00e0 la maison pour s'assurer qu'il \u00e9tait bel et bien malade. \u00c0 cette all\u00e9gation, le t\u00e9moin a r\u00e9pondu qu'il s'est rendu \u00e0 une seule reprise au domicile du plaignant \u00e0 La Sarre pour lui livrer une formule de rapport m\u00e9dical (1935) \u00e0 faire remplir par son m\u00e9decin traitant. Le t\u00e9moin se souvient qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 bien accueilli par le plaignant. Claude Mayrand affirme que c'est la seule fois qu'il s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au domicile du plaignant. Cependant, il reconna\u00eet qu'il a pu passer au volant de son v\u00e9hicule devant la r\u00e9sidence de ce dernier \u00e0 deux ou trois reprises car il devait le faire pour se rendre \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de son p\u00e8re ou au restaurant o\u00f9 travaillait sa sur.\n[90] Claude Mayrand a mentionn\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 chaque ann\u00e9e les sup\u00e9rieurs imm\u00e9diats doivent pr\u00e9parer une \u00e9valuation des employ\u00e9s appel\u00e9e profil annuel de l'employ\u00e9 . M\u00eame si le sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat de Pierre Bergeron \u00e9tait Alain Rivard, le t\u00e9moin a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 ce profil annuel de ce dernier pour l'ann\u00e9e 1996 parce qu'au cours de la p\u00e9riode d'ao\u00fbt 1996 \u00e0 la fin de d\u00e9cembre 1996, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 le sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat du plaignant en sa qualit\u00e9 d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur et en raison des absences d'Alain Rivard. Le t\u00e9moin a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le profil annuel d'un employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait une \u00e9valuation de son rendement ainsi que des diff\u00e9rentes aptitudes et habilet\u00e9s qu'il avait d\u00e9s au cours d'une ann\u00e9e.\n[91] Pour r\u00e9aliser le profil annuel du plaignant, le t\u00e9moin raconte qu'il a obtenu les commentaires d'Alain Rivard, de Brigitte C\u00f4t\u00e9 du COR, d'Yvan Deault, directeur de l'entrep\u00f4t. Il a \u00e9galement tenu compte des commentaires que lui avaient formul\u00e9s les coll\u00e8gues de travail du plaignant, notamment Jean Levert, d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical.\n[92] Lors de la pr\u00e9paration du profil annuel d'un employ\u00e9, ce dernier est rencontr\u00e9 pour lui permettre de conna\u00eetre ses impressions. Dans le cas de Pierre Bergeron, cette rencontre n'a pas eu lieu parce qu'il \u00e9tait en mise \u00e0 pied lors de la pr\u00e9paration de son \u00e9valuation en mars 1997. Le t\u00e9moin pr\u00e9cise qu'une fois le profil annuel de l'employ\u00e9 termin\u00e9 (Pi\u00e8ce P-43) une copie est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au dossier personnel de l'employ\u00e9. Ce fut d'ailleurs le cas pour Pierre Bergeron.\n[93] Claude Mayrand se souvient que le 16 juillet 1998, Pierre Bergeron a adress\u00e9 une mise en demeure \u00e0 T\u00e9l\u00e9bec (Pi\u00e8ce P-45) dans laquelle il soutenait que son \u00e9valuation pour l'ann\u00e9e 1996 \u00e9tait erron\u00e9e et contenait des affirmations mensong\u00e8res portant atteinte \u00e0 sa r\u00e9putation et susceptibles de mettre en p\u00e9ril son avenir comme employ\u00e9 de T\u00e9l\u00e9bec.\n[94] Claude Mayrand s'est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 au d\u00e9partement des relations industrielles pour conna\u00eetre la position \u00e0 adopter. Il fut convenu que le profil annuel de Pierre Bergeron pour l'ann\u00e9e 1996 serait retir\u00e9 de son dossier personnel, d'une part parce qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rencontr\u00e9 lors de la pr\u00e9paration de l'\u00e9valuation et, d'autre part parce qu'il \u00e9tait fort probable qu'il ne soit pas rappel\u00e9 au travail au poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur suite \u00e0 sa mise \u00e0 pied du 10 janvier 1997. En cons\u00e9quence, le 27 juillet 1998, Claude Mayrand a adress\u00e9 au plaignant une lettre pour l'aviser que son profil annuel pour l'ann\u00e9e 1996 et toute copie de celui-ci seraient d\u00e9truits (Pi\u00e8ce-46).\n[95] Le t\u00e9moin raconte qu'en ao\u00fbt 1997, T\u00e9l\u00e9bec devait proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la r\u00e9fection d'un c\u00e2ble de cuivre qui alimentait l'a\u00e9roport de Chibougamau. Il s'agissait d'un projet n\u00e9cessitant un travail temporaire d'\u00e9pissage d'une dur\u00e9e de 52 heures. Il a achemin\u00e9 une demande de personnel au d\u00e9partement des ressources humaines (Pi\u00e8ce I-16) qui a identifi\u00e9 Pierre Bergeron comme \u00e9tant disponible.\n[96] Claude Mayrand a communiqu\u00e9 avec le plaignant pour lui offrir le travail et l'informer de la dur\u00e9e et des conditions qui s'y rattachaient. Il a accept\u00e9 de faire le travail et le tout lui fut confirm\u00e9 par \u00e9crit (Pi\u00e8ce P-26).\n[97] Une fois le travail termin\u00e9, Alain Rivard a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une v\u00e9rification des travaux. Claude Mayrand a \u00e9mis un m\u00e9mo le 16 septembre 1997 (Pi\u00e8ce P-27) dans lequel il souligne que la r\u00e9habilitation du c\u00e2ble alimentant l'a\u00e9roport de Chibougamau a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment aux normes \u00e9tablies et que le travail de Pierre Bergeron est satisfaisant .\n[98] Claude Mayrand a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 donner sa version relativement au fait qu'il connaissait l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du plaignant. Il affirme qu'il n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 au courant de l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de Pierre Bergeron parce que les informations relatives \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 d'un employ\u00e9 demeurent confidentielles. Claude Mayrand a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gations de Pierre Bergeron \u00e0 l'effet que celui-ci, entre ao\u00fbt 1996 et d\u00e9cembre 1996, l'avait engueul\u00e9 \u00e0 de multiples reprises et de fa\u00e7on injustifi\u00e9e en raison de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9.\n[99] Le t\u00e9moin affirme qu'il n'a jamais eu d'engueulades avec Pierre Bergeron, soit \u00e0 son arriv\u00e9e au travail le 6 ao\u00fbt 1996 ou lorsqu'il lui a rendu visite \u00e0 son domicile en ao\u00fbt 1996. Au cours de la p\u00e9riode d'emploi de d\u00e9cembre 1996 et janvier 1997, il reconna\u00eet avoir eu des \u00e9changes avec le plaignant, le matin avant son d\u00e9part au travail. Ces \u00e9changes se limitaient \u00e0 s'informer et s'assurer que tout allait bien mais rien de plus. Il ajoute que lors des rencontres des 7 et 10 janvier 1997 il n'y a pas eu d'engueulades non plus.\n[100] Claude Mayrand raconte qu'au cours du mois d'ao\u00fbt 2003 il s'est rendu au Centre de service de Rouyn-Noranda. Comme il avait voyag\u00e9 la veille avec le v\u00e9hicule de T\u00e9l\u00e9bec, son v\u00e9hicule personnel se trouvait au Centre de service. \u00c0 son arriv\u00e9e, il a vu un document dans le pare-brise de son v\u00e9hicule. Il s'agissait d'un document intitul\u00e9 : Bienvenue au proc\u00e8s (Pi\u00e8ce I 2). En entrant dans le Centre de service il a retrouv\u00e9 des copies de document dans les casiers des employ\u00e9s. Ce document indiquait la tenue de l'audition de l'affaire Pierre Bergeron contre T\u00e9l\u00e9bec et Alain Rivard \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al du 10 au 19 septembre 2003. On pouvait \u00e9galement y lire : Pour renseignements, contactez M. Pierre Bergeron au 819-847-3479 .\n[101] En contre-interrogatoire, le plaignant a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Claude Mayrand de reconna\u00eetre qu'\u00e0 son arriv\u00e9e au travail \u00e0 Val-d'Or, le 6 ao\u00fbt 1996, il lui avait mentionn\u00e9 : Pierre, on te donne une derni\u00e8re chance , ce que le t\u00e9moin a ni\u00e9 cat\u00e9goriquement. Le t\u00e9moin a \u00e9galement ni\u00e9 avoir dit au plaignant qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas un gars d'\u00e9quipe, qu'il n'avait pas besoin d'un gar comme lui dans son \u00e9quipe et qu'il travaillait trop lentement.\n(iii) Alain Rivard [102] Alain Rivard a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 chez T\u00e9l\u00e9bec en 1977 au poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur et, en 1979, au poste de technicien d'\u00e9quipements centraux et transmission. En 1981, il occupe \u00e0 nouveau le poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur jusqu'en 1984 alors qu'il est promu au poste de r\u00e9partiteur. En 1986, il devient v\u00e9rificateur-analyste puis, en 1988, directeur responsable de la qualit\u00e9 de service des r\u00e9parations et, en 1992, directeur au niveau des immeubles.\n[103] En 1995, il devient directeur service technique pour le secteur Val-d'Or qui comprend toute la r\u00e9gion Abitibi-Est. Il s'est vu confier \u00e9galement la direction service technique pour le secteur Baie-James. Ces deux secteurs forment un territoire de 350 000 kilom\u00e8tres carr\u00e9s. Leur supervision lui exigeait des absences r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es de son bureau situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Val-d'Or.\n[104] Pour l'aider dans l'ex\u00e9cution de son travail, le t\u00e9moin \u00e9tait assist\u00e9 de Claude Mayrand qui assumait les m\u00eames responsabilit\u00e9s pour les villes de Val-d'Or et Rouyn-Noranda ou encore lorsqu'il \u00e9tait retenu \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de son bureau.\n[105] Alain Rivard relate qu'en 1995 le profil de l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur avait beaucoup chang\u00e9 par rapport aux ann\u00e9es 1990, particuli\u00e8rement dans le secteur affaires. De fait, l'avancement rapide de la technologie et l'arriv\u00e9e de nouveaux syst\u00e8mes t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques auxquels s'ajoutaient la promotion et la vente faisaient en sorte que le travail de l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur devenait beaucoup plus sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9.\n[106] Il se souvient que le 2 d\u00e9cembre 1996, Pierre Bergeron s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au travail \u00e0 Val-d'Or. Il s'agissait d'un retour au travail progressif sans restriction m\u00e9dicale. Comme il \u00e9tait absent \u00e0 l'arriv\u00e9e du plaignant, Claude Mayrand l'avait assign\u00e9 \u00e0 un travail de transfert de lignes \u00e0 Senneterre. \u00c0 son arriv\u00e9e, Alain Rivard a rappel\u00e9 Pierre Bergeron \u00e0 Val-d'Or pour effectuer des travaux plus urgents dans le secteur affaires.\n[107] Claude Mayrand lui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 Pierre Bergeron \u00e0 son retour \u00e0 Val-d'Or en d\u00e9but d'apr\u00e8s-midi. Le t\u00e9moin savait que Pierre Bergeron revenait au travail au poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9pisseur pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Par cons\u00e9quent, le t\u00e9moin dit : Il \u00e9tait un peu rouill\u00e9.\n[108] Aussi, il a assign\u00e9 Pierre Bergeron \u00e0 T\u00e9l\u00e9bec Mobilit\u00e9 pour aider un installateur-r\u00e9parateur \u00e0 l'installation d'un syst\u00e8me t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique 032. Au d\u00e9but de la semaine du 9 d\u00e9cembre 1996, il a aussi inform\u00e9 le plaignant qu'il lui confierait au cours de la semaine l'installation d'un syst\u00e8me Norstar 3\/8 (3 lignes - 8 appareils) \u00e0 la Brasserie La P\u00e9pie. Il s'agissait de travail assez simple \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser et qui permettrait au plaignant de se familiariser \u00e0 son nouveau poste. Le t\u00e9moin affirme avoir mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 Pierre Bergeron que s'il \u00e9prouvait des difficult\u00e9s, il devait se sentir bien \u00e0 l'aise de communiquer avec lui en tout temps.\n[109] Au cours de la semaine, le plaignant a effectivement re\u00e7u le mandat d'installation du syst\u00e8me Norstar 3\/8 \u00e0 la Brasserie La P\u00e9pie. L'installateur devait amener deux lignes t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques chez le client depuis le centre t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, installer le syst\u00e8me \u00e0 l'endroit d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le client et y joindre les deux lignes. Il devait ensuite faire la distribution en proc\u00e9dant au filage int\u00e9rieur vers les postes requis. S'ajoutait \u00e9galement la programmation \u00e0 savoir ouvrir les ports d'entr\u00e9e pour les lignes et les attribuer aux diff\u00e9rents postes.\n[110] Le temps normalement pr\u00e9vu pour l'installation d'un tel syst\u00e8me se situe normalement entre huit heures \u00e0 dix heures. Toutefois, comme le plaignant revenait au travail comme installateur-r\u00e9parateur, Alain Rivard avait pr\u00e9vu une p\u00e9riode de 16 heures pour compl\u00e9ter le travail.\n[111] Au cours de l'ex\u00e9cution de ce mandat, le t\u00e9moin raconte qu'il s'est rendu \u00e0 la Brasserie La P\u00e9pie pour v\u00e9rifier l'avancement des travaux. Pierre Bergeron lui a fait part qu'il \u00e9prouvait des difficult\u00e9s avec l'entr\u00e9e des lignes. De plus, il a rencontr\u00e9 la propri\u00e9taire de la Brasserie qui lui a fait part de ses inqui\u00e9tudes. Elle pr\u00e9tendait que l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur avait de la difficult\u00e9 avec la programmation parce qu'il lui avait dit que ce n'\u00e9tait pas son domaine vu qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e9pisseur. Elle craignait que l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier pr\u00e9vu pour la r\u00e9alisation des travaux ne soit pas respect\u00e9.\n[112] Alain Rivard a fait part au plaignant des remarques de la cliente. Pierre Bergeron lui a r\u00e9pondu que ce n'\u00e9tait pas le travail d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur qu'il souhaitait faire mais celui d'\u00e9pisseur. Il a mentionn\u00e9 que le contact avec le client lui d\u00e9plaisait. Alain Rivard lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'il n'avait pas le choix.\n[113] Lors de cette rencontre, le t\u00e9moin affirme qu'il n'a pas mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 Pierre Bergeron qu'il tra\u00eenait de la patte et qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas un gars d'\u00e9quipe. Dans les faits, Alain Rivard a constat\u00e9 que l'installation du syst\u00e8me Norstar 3\/8 par le plaignant a n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 22 \u00e0 24 heures de travail soit six \u00e0 huit heures de plus que le temps qu'il avait allou\u00e9.\n[114] Le travail fait par Pierre Bergeron ne r\u00e9pondait pas du tout \u00e0 ce qu'on attendait de lui, particuli\u00e8rement le contact avec le client laissait grandement \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer de m\u00eame que la r\u00e9alisation de la programmation. En cons\u00e9quence, dans le but de minimiser le contact avec le client, Alain Rivard a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'assigner Pierre Bergeron en compagnie de deux installateurs-r\u00e9parateurs, Jean Levert et Richard Duquette, \u00e0 un travail chez Aub\u00e9 Pontiac Buick \u00e0 Val-d'Or. Richard Duquette avait la responsabilit\u00e9 de transiger avec le client. Il s'agissait de refaire la totalit\u00e9 des c\u00e2blages t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques, de proc\u00e9der au c\u00e2blage au niveau de la r\u00e9seautique.\n[115] Alain Rivard d\u00e9clare avoir mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 Pierre Bergeron qu'il aurait un travail de pr\u00e9filage \u00e0 accomplir. Il lui avait mentionn\u00e9 que, s'il avait des probl\u00e8mes, de se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues de travail. Alain Rivard a eu l'occasion de se rendre sur les lieux de travail. Jean Levert et Richard Duquette lui ont fait part que Pierre Bergeron tra\u00eenait un petit peu de la patte et qu'il ne se r\u00e9f\u00e9rait pas beaucoup \u00e0 eux. Il s'est rendu voir le plaignant et il raconte : (pages 1850-1851)\n\u00ab ... puis j'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Pierre comment \u00e7a allait. \u00c7a allait, mais tu sais \u00e7a allait. J'ai dit : L\u00e0, c'est parce que tes confr\u00e8res me disent que \u00e7a tra\u00eene un peu de la patte, y as-tu de quoi qui va pas l\u00e0 ? Ah bien l\u00e0, c'est pas \u00e7a que je veux faire, j'aime pas \u00e7a plus que \u00e7a, tu le sais, moi, je suis un \u00e9pisseur. Oui, j'ai dit l\u00e0, c'est \u00e7a qu'on a \u00e0 faire, tu sais. \u00c7a fait que j'ai jas\u00e9 un petit peu, puis j'ai dit : C'est important que tu leur parles. Mais en tout cas, \u00e7a a vir\u00e9 un peu comme \u00e7a. L\u00e0, il m'a fait \u00e9tat un peu de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9.\nQ. Qu'est-ce qu'il vous a dit ?\nR. Bien, pour lui, il faisait une d\u00e9pression et que moi, j'\u00e9tais pas m\u00e9decin, mais que dans ce que j'avais dit \u00e0 Pierre, j'ai dit : Moi, ce que j'ai en main l\u00e0, c'est que tu es en progression sans restriction, donc je m'attends \u00e0 un travail comme les autres. L\u00e0, il m'a dit : Oui, mais t'as d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait une d\u00e9pression, toi. J'ai dit : Oui, j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait une d\u00e9pression, c'est pour \u00e7a que je t'en parle l\u00e0. C'est qu'en quelque part, je m'attends \u00e0 un travail comme les autres, mais si t'es pas bien dans \u00e7a, prends les moyens qu'il faut avant d'y laisser ta peau. C'est important, moi, j'ai pass\u00e9 par l\u00e0. Il faut que toi, tu te manifestes dans \u00e7a. Si t'es pas bien, va voir le m\u00e9decin. Moi, ce que j'ai l\u00e0, tu dois faire le travail. C'est tout.\u00bb\n[116] Alain Rivard ajoute qu'il a subi une d\u00e9pression majeure avec infarctus en 1992 et qu'il \u00e9tait sensibilis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'endroit d'une personne qui peut vivre une d\u00e9pression.\n[117] T\u00e9l\u00e9bec avait obtenu un contrat chez Val-d'Or Performance, filiale de Aub\u00e9 Pontiac Buick, pour refaire certains filages avec cache-fils, c'est-\u00e0-dire avec pose de moulures pour cacher les fils qui se trouvaient \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur des murs. Richard Duquette \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 de ce projet. Alain Rivard a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de d\u00e9placer Pierre Bergeron sur ce projet afin de lui faciliter le travail.\n[118] Richard Duquette a fait part \u00e0 Alain Rivard que la qualit\u00e9 du travail du plaignant chez Val d'Or Performance \u00e9tait bonne mais qu'il y avait une faiblesse au niveau de la productivit\u00e9.\n[119] Alain Rivard a obtenu un contrat dans un \u00e9difice gouvernemental, Terres et For\u00eats, avec la particularit\u00e9 qu'il devait \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 entre 15 h 00 et 22 h 30. Le projet a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 \u00e0 l'installateur Yoland Audet qui avait besoin d'un installateur-r\u00e9parateur avec lui. Il fallait ex\u00e9cuter des travaux pour l'installation de syst\u00e8me t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique et de la r\u00e9seautique.\n[120] Alain Rivard a pens\u00e9 que Pierre Bergeron pourrait \u00eatre int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser les travaux de filage sur ce projet et il lui en fait la proposition. Ainsi, il croyait que Pierre Bergeron serait beaucoup plus \u00e0 l'aise dans ce contexte de travail. Effectivement, il a accept\u00e9 l'offre et il semblait satisfait.\n[121] Alain Rivard raconte qu'encore une fois la qualit\u00e9 du travail de Pierre Bergeron \u00e9tait toujours bonne. C'est la productivit\u00e9 qui posait probl\u00e8me. Il a d\u00fb faire appel \u00e0 un installateur-r\u00e9parateur additionnel, Alain Brouillette, afin de s'assurer que le travail soit termin\u00e9 dans le temps de r\u00e9alisation mentionn\u00e9 au client.\n[122] Alain Rivard se souvient qu'au cours de la semaine du 16 d\u00e9cembre 1996, il \u00e9tait probablement en vacances. Toutefois, comme il r\u00e9side \u00e0 Val-d'Or, c'\u00e9tait son habitude de faire une courte visite sur les chantiers, question de v\u00e9rifier comment le tout se d\u00e9roulait.\n[123] \u00c0 son retour au travail, apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode des F\u00eates, soit en janvier 1997, Alain Rivard a pris connaissance du document que lui avait transmis Claude Mayrand concernant le d\u00e9part du travail du plaignant le 20 d\u00e9cembre 1996 et son absence du travail le 23 d\u00e9cembre 1996 (Pi\u00e8ce I-15). Il raconte avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9\u00e7u d'apprendre le comportement de Pierre Bergeron. Alain Rivard explique que si l'absence \u00e9tait caus\u00e9e par la maladie, il pouvait comprendre. Par contre, si le plaignant s'\u00e9tait absent\u00e9 sans raison ni motif valable et malgr\u00e9 le fait que Claude Mayrand lui avait refus\u00e9 la prise de vacances \u00e0 cette p\u00e9riode, la question \u00e9tait beaucoup plus s\u00e9rieuse. Si tel \u00e9tait le cas, Alain Rivard \u00e9tait d\u00e9\u00e7u de constater que Pierre Bergeron ait agi de la sorte apr\u00e8s qu'il ait tent\u00e9 de l'accommoder le plus possible dans l'ex\u00e9cution de son travail.\n[124] Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en courant par Claude Mayrand de tous les faits entourant les \u00e9v\u00e9nements, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rencontrer Pierre Bergeron pour conna\u00eetre sa version des faits, en pr\u00e9sence de Claude Mayrand qui \u00e9tait plus au fait des \u00e9v\u00e9nements, et qu'il puisse r\u00e9pondre aux questions qui pourraient \u00eatre pos\u00e9es.\n[125] Cette rencontre s'est tenue au cours de l'apr\u00e8s-midi du 7 janvier 1997 dans la salle de r\u00e9union. Claude Mayrand a d'abord pris la parole pour relater les faits survenus les 20 et 23 d\u00e9cembre 1996. Il a inform\u00e9 Pierre Bergeron qu'il n'avait pas suivi la proc\u00e9dure lors de son d\u00e9part du travail le 20 d\u00e9cembre 1996 et lors de son absence du 23 d\u00e9cembre 1996, soit d'aviser son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat. Il a ajout\u00e9 que ces absences avaient caus\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes de productivit\u00e9 parce que le travail se faisait avec des effectifs r\u00e9duits au cours de la p\u00e9riode des F\u00eates et qu'on avait d\u00fb faire effectuer des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. Puis, Alain Rivard a encha\u00een\u00e9 en demandant \u00e0 Pierre Bergeron s'il se sentait apte \u00e0 faire le travail d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur. Aux dires du plaignant, il \u00e9tait capable de faire le travail et au niveau de la productivit\u00e9, tout \u00e9tait correct. Alain Rivard lui a rappel\u00e9 toutefois que sa productivit\u00e9 n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisante dans l'ex\u00e9cution des mandats confi\u00e9s avant la p\u00e9riode des F\u00eates. Il soutient qu'il n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 question de sa sant\u00e9 lors de sa rencontre et il affirme que la plaignant n'a jamais pleur\u00e9. La seule remarque que le plaignant a faite fut de mentionner que c'\u00e9tait plus difficile pour lui de faire le travail lorsqu'il sentait de la pression. Le t\u00e9moin lui a r\u00e9pondu que s'il croyait avoir des probl\u00e8mes au niveau de la pression il n'avait qu'\u00e0 l'informer pour qu'il puisse l'aider.\n[126] Suite \u00e0 cette rencontre, Claude Mayrand et Alain Rivard ont discut\u00e9 de la situation et \u00e9chang\u00e9 leur point de vue sur l'\u00e9valuation du travail du plaignant et ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rencontrer le directeur Serge Faubert le lendemain.\n[127] \u00c0 cette occasion, Claude Mayrand a inform\u00e9 Serge Faubert des \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus les 20 et 23 d\u00e9cembre 1996. Serge Faubert a demand\u00e9 si une r\u00e9primande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite au plaignant suite \u00e0 ces agissements. Alain Rivard se rappelle tr\u00e8s bien que Serge Faubert leur a reproch\u00e9 vertement de ne pas l'avoir fait.\n[128] Puis, Alain Rivard a fait part \u00e0 Serge Faubert que la situation de Pierre Bergeron l'inqui\u00e9tait. Il lui a expliqu\u00e9 toutes les difficult\u00e9s qu'avait connues Pierre Bergeron depuis son retour au travail et qu'il envisageait de mettre fin \u00e0 l'emploi du plaignant comme installateur-r\u00e9parateur. Serge Faubert lui a r\u00e9pondu de communiquer avec les relations industrielles. Le t\u00e9moin a communiqu\u00e9 avec les relations industrielles pour faire part de la probl\u00e9matique qu'il vivait et de sa d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 l'emploi du plaignant.\n[129] Le d\u00e9partement des relations industrielles a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un avis de mise \u00e0 pied (Pi\u00e8ce P-21). Comme le t\u00e9moin \u00e9tait absent lors de la r\u00e9ception du document, il fut sign\u00e9 par Claude Mayrand qui l'a remis \u00e0 Pierre Bergeron lors d'une rencontre le 10 janvier 1997. Le t\u00e9moin affirme qu'il n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 cette rencontre et ce, m\u00eame par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence.\n[130] Alain Rivard relate qu'il a revu le plaignant le 12 d\u00e9cembre 1997 lors de circonstances assez particuli\u00e8res. Il \u00e9tait \u00e0 Val-d'Or et s'appr\u00eatait \u00e0 quitter pour Chibougamau lorsque Richard Leblanc lui a demand\u00e9 de profiter de son passage \u00e0 Chibougamau pour livrer un avis de mise \u00e0 pied \u00e0 Pierre Bergeron qui \u00e9tait hospitalis\u00e9 \u00e0 cet endroit. Comme il ne se sentait pas \u00e0 l'aise avec cette demande, il a communiqu\u00e9 avec le d\u00e9partement des relations industrielles qui a donn\u00e9 son approbation.\n[131] Il s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital et le plaignant l'a bien accueilli. Il a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas surpris de sa visite car il s'attendait de recevoir un avis de mise \u00e0 pied. Alain Rivard s'est inform\u00e9 de la cause de son hospitalisation. Le plaignant lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'il faisait une d\u00e9pression. Alain Rivard lui a dit : (page 1904)\n\u00ab Tu sais, c'est important la vie qu'elle soit v\u00e9cue et en sant\u00e9. \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9, j'ai dit : Tu devrais prendre les moyens qu'il faut l\u00e0 pour te prendre en main avant d'y laisser ta peau. Il y a pas d'autre fa\u00e7on de t'en sortir que te faire soigner, changer ton rythme de vie, ta fa\u00e7on de faire. Je te le dis en connaissance de cause l\u00e0, j'ai pass\u00e9 par l\u00e0 puis c'est important. Tu as la chance d'\u00eatre ici l\u00e0, c'est dr\u00f4le \u00e0 dire, mais tu as la chance d'\u00eatre ici \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital pour te faire soigner, profites-en.\u00bb\n[132] Alain Rivard croit que le plaignant \u00e9tait r\u00e9ceptif \u00e0 ses propos. La conversation s'est poursuivie pendant quelques minutes et il est parti.\n[133] Le t\u00e9moin a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 commenter la pr\u00e9tention du plaignant \u00e0 l'effet qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied en raison de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Il r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'il n'a jamais connu l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du plaignant, sauf ce qu'il lui a dit relativement \u00e0 la pression qu'il ressentait \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter son travail.\n[134] Le t\u00e9moin a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 commenter l'all\u00e9gation du plaignant voulant qu'on ne lui donnait pas les m\u00eames chances que les autres employ\u00e9s, notamment la formation, lors de ses p\u00e9riodes d'essai. Le t\u00e9moin nie cette all\u00e9gation. Il soutient qu'au contraire il a donn\u00e9 toutes les chances au plaignant en lui confiant des mandats pour lui permettre de s'adapter au travail d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur. Quant \u00e0 la formation, Alain Rivard affirme que T\u00e9l\u00e9bec ne donne pas de formation \u00e0 un installateur-r\u00e9parateur qui d\u00e9tient un DEC en \u00e9lectronique. Il appartenait \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 de se former lui-m\u00eame pour l'\u00e9tude de la documentation accompagnant les \u00e9quipements mis \u00e0 sa disposition.\n[135] Quant \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation du plaignant \u00e0 l'effet que T\u00e9l\u00e9bec a refus\u00e9 de lui fournir un milieu de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement, Alain Rivard r\u00e9pond que lors des rencontres qu'il a eues avec le plaignant il s'informait si tout allait bien. Il lui faisait part de ce qu'il attendait de lui. Pierre Bergeron \u00e9tait r\u00e9ceptif mais il se disait impuissant \u00e0 prendre la pression. Il affirme qu'il n'a jamais eu d'engueulades avec le plaignant. Au contraire, Alain Rivard est convaincu qu'il a tout fait pour aider le plaignant \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux exigences de travail qu'il avait \u00e0 accomplir.\n[136] Alain Rivard se souvient que vers le 25 juillet 2003, \u00e0 son arriv\u00e9e au travail, il a vu sur son bureau le document intitul\u00e9 Bienvenue au proc\u00e8s (Pi\u00e8ce I-2). Il a appris que des copies de ce document avaient circul\u00e9 parmi les employ\u00e9s. Il d\u00e9clare avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement qui a caus\u00e9 un malaise parmi les employ\u00e9s. Il a fait rapport au d\u00e9partement des relations industrielles.\n(iv) Lyne Doroftei [137] Elle a d\u00e9but\u00e9 son emploi chez T\u00e9l\u00e9bec en 1984. \u00c0 compter de 1990, elle a occup\u00e9 le poste de directrice au sein de l'\u00e9quipe des ressources humaines et, en 1995, elle est devenue directrice des relations de travail. Son travail consistait \u00e0 conseiller les gestionnaires dans l'application de la convention collective et \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter l'entreprise lors de rencontres patronales syndicales pour discuter notamment de l'application de la convention collective, du r\u00e8glement des griefs, de la n\u00e9gociation et de la pr\u00e9paration de lettres d'entente convenues entre les parties.\n[138] En 1995, elle a particip\u00e9 activement \u00e0 la r\u00e9organisation administrative qui a conduit \u00e0 de nombreuses coupures de poste de monteurs de lignes et d'\u00e9pisseurs travaillant dans diverses localit\u00e9s.\n[139] Une liste d'anciennet\u00e9 par poste a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9e. Pour identifier les employ\u00e9s vis\u00e9s par une mise \u00e0 pied, on a appliqu\u00e9 l'anciennet\u00e9 et le droit de supplantation comme le pr\u00e9voyait la convention collective. Les personnes affect\u00e9es par la mise \u00e0 pied sont plac\u00e9es sur une liste de rappel et b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d'un droit de rappel au travail, si besoin il y a, pendant 24 mois, apr\u00e8s quoi elles perdent leur anciennet\u00e9 et leur emploi.\n[140] Lorsqu'un rappel au travail s'impose sur un poste, le service des ressources humaines proc\u00e8de au rappel au travail d'un employ\u00e9 en fonction de l'anciennet\u00e9, de la capacit\u00e9 de remplir les exigences normales du poste et de la disponibilit\u00e9.\n[141] Dans le but de diminuer ses co\u00fbts d'op\u00e9ration et d'augmenter la productivit\u00e9 sur des projets particuliers, l'intim\u00e9e envisageait de faire appel \u00e0 la sous-traitance et ce, au d\u00e9triment des employ\u00e9s en mise \u00e0 pied. L'Union des Routiers souhaitait plut\u00f4t le rappel au travail des employ\u00e9s en mise \u00e0 pied. Ainsi, le 25 mai 1996, les parties signaient une lettre d'entente (Pi\u00e8ce I-4) devant se terminer \u00e0 la fin de mai 1996 pr\u00e9voyant le rappel au travail d'employ\u00e9s sur la liste de rappel pour la r\u00e9alisation des projets de R\u00e9migny et Macamic. Cette entente pr\u00e9voyait des avantages moindres que ceux pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 la convention collective, notamment quant au paiement des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires et des primes ainsi que des frais de logement et de repas.\n[142] Le 27 mai 1996, cette lettre d'entente a fait l'objet d'une prolongation d'une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Elle s'appliquait \u00e9galement \u00e0 tout autre projet que ceux initialement pr\u00e9vus.\n[143] Puis, le 12 novembre 1996, les parties signaient une lettre d'entente valide jusqu'au 20 d\u00e9cembre 1996 pour la r\u00e9alisation du projet Parc La V\u00e9rendrye. Cette lettre d'entente visait de nouveau le rappel au travail des employ\u00e9s sur la liste de rappel avec des conditions de travail modifi\u00e9es comparativement \u00e0 celles apparaissant \u00e0 la convention, particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui avait trait au paiement des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires et des primes de m\u00eame que les frais de logement et de repas.\n[144] Cette lettre d'entente a fait l'objet d'une prolongation le 17 janvier 1997 et le 22 f\u00e9vrier 1997. Cette derni\u00e8re prolongation \u00e9tait d'une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e et s'appliquait \u00e0 tout projet que l'entreprise entendrait r\u00e9aliser.\n[145] Par la suite, les conditions d'embauche, selon le t\u00e9moin, ont fait l'objet de conditions de travail am\u00e9lior\u00e9es apr\u00e8s consultation avec l'Union des Routiers sans toutefois faire l'objet de lettres d'entente \u00e9crites. \u00c0 titre d'exemple, le t\u00e9moin souligne que pour l'ex\u00e9cution du projet \u00e0 Chibougamau, une indemnit\u00e9 journali\u00e8re de 62 $ avait \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9goci\u00e9e pour le co\u00fbt des repas et du logement. Par ailleurs, le 7 juillet 1998 (Pi\u00e8ce I-8), les parties ont sign\u00e9 une lettre d'entente dont le contenu refl\u00e9tait les conditions convenues verbalement depuis la lettre d'entente du 22 f\u00e9vrier 1997. Cette derni\u00e8re lettre d'entente conservait le principe ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e9tabli verbalement que l'employ\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 pouvait refuser le travail propos\u00e9.\n[146] Lyne Doroftei a expliqu\u00e9, suivant les termes de l'article 13.17 de la convention collective (Pi\u00e8ce I-9) en vigueur en 1995, la proc\u00e9dure applicable lors d'une mise \u00e0 pied. Ainsi, l'employ\u00e9 poss\u00e9dant le moins d'anciennet\u00e9 dans une cat\u00e9gorie d'emploi dans l'unit\u00e9 d'anciennet\u00e9 est sujet \u00e0 une mise \u00e0 pied pourvu que les employ\u00e9s ayant plus d'anciennet\u00e9 soient aptes \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter le travail.\n[147] L'employ\u00e9 vis\u00e9 par une mise \u00e0 pied avait le choix entre la mise \u00e0 pied ou une nouvelle affectation sur un autre poste ou une autre classification d'emploi de l'unit\u00e9 d'anciennet\u00e9 pourvu qu'il soit apte \u00e0 accomplir les t\u00e2ches requises dans des d\u00e9lais raisonnables ne d\u00e9passant pas, de toute mani\u00e8re, 10 jours de travail et pourvu que cette affectation n'entra\u00eene pas le d\u00e9placement d'un employ\u00e9 plus ancien ou \u00e0 un emploi de la m\u00eame classification dans une autre unit\u00e9 d'anciennet\u00e9 pourvu que l'employ\u00e9 en cause soit apte \u00e0 accomplir les t\u00e2ches requises et que cette mutation n'entra\u00eene pas le d\u00e9placement d'un employ\u00e9 plus ancien.\n[148] Toute nouvelle affectation d'un employ\u00e9 doit \u00eatre faite par l'employeur conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'ordre ci-dessous. Le droit de supplanter n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti au plaignant parce que l'employeur jugeait qu'il ne pourrait remplir les t\u00e2ches requises au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 10 jours de travail.\n[149] Cette disposition de la convention collective ne semble pas cr\u00e9er l'obligation pour l'employeur de rappeler un employ\u00e9 au travail car la clause 13.18 de la convention collective ne traite que des r\u00e8gles applicables lors d'un rappel au travail. C'est par le truchement des lettres d'entente que l'employeur a accept\u00e9 de rappeler au travail les employ\u00e9s en mise \u00e0 pied avec des conditions d'emploi inf\u00e9rieures \u00e0 celles pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 la convention collective.\n[150] Dans le cadre de la r\u00e9duction de personnel, Pierre Bergeron poss\u00e9dait le moins d'anciennet\u00e9 dans le cat\u00e9gorie d'emploi d'\u00e9pisseur et ce, dans l'unit\u00e9 d'anciennet\u00e9 de La Sarre. Par cons\u00e9quent, il \u00e9tait catalogu\u00e9 comme employ\u00e9 exc\u00e9dentaire avec droit de supplantation. S'il ne peut exercer une supplantation, il est mis \u00e0 pied et plac\u00e9 sur une liste de rappel avec droit de rappel pendant 24 mois.\n[151] Une liste des employ\u00e9s avec droit de supplantation a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9e en date du 17 novembre 1995. Comme il lui \u00e9tait permis de le faire en vertu de l'article 13.17 2) de la convention collective, T\u00e9l\u00e9bec a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas consentir au plaignant une nouvelle affectation.\n[152] Apr\u00e8s avoir identifi\u00e9 les employ\u00e9s sujets \u00e0 une mise \u00e0 pied, les 15 et 31 d\u00e9cembre 1995, le t\u00e9moin raconte qu'une liste de rappel a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9e. L'employ\u00e9 qui y appara\u00eet peut \u00eatre rappel\u00e9 au travail. Selon les dispositions de la clause 13.18 de la convention collective, le rappel au travail se fait dans l'ordre inverse de la mise \u00e0 pied pourvu que l'employ\u00e9 vis\u00e9 soit apte \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter le travail \u00e0 accomplir.\n[153] L'article 13.19 de la convention collective pr\u00e9cise \u00e9galement que le salari\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 au travail et affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un endroit autre que son lieu normal de travail lors de la mise \u00e0 pied peut refuser l'affectation propos\u00e9e et attendre qu'un poste lui soit offert \u00e0 son ancien lieu de travail pourvu que le poste propos\u00e9 puisse \u00eatre combl\u00e9 par un salari\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied ayant moins d'anciennet\u00e9 et qui est apte \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter le travail.\n[154] Le t\u00e9moin a expliqu\u00e9 l'application de cette clause dans le cas du plaignant. Pierre Bergeron \u00e9tait \u00e9pisseur et son lieu normal de travail \u00e9tait La Sarre. S'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 au travail pour une affectation \u00e0 un endroit autre que La Sarre, il aurait pu refuser l'affectation et demeurer sur la liste de rappel. C'est ainsi que, lorsque le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 au travail, le 26 mars 1996, pour le projet R\u00e9migny et Macamic, il aurait pu refuser parce que rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 un endroit autre que son lieu normal de travail \u00e0 la condition qu'un employ\u00e9 moins ancien soit apte \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter le travail. C'\u00e9tait d'ailleurs le cas puisque, le 26 mars 1995, un employ\u00e9 \u00e9galement \u00e9pisseur, Yves H\u00e9roux, et ayant moins d'anciennet\u00e9 que Pierre Bergeron, \u00e9tait disponible (Pi\u00e8ce I 3). Le t\u00e9moin pr\u00e9cise que la situation aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9rente si le rappel au travail du plaignant s'\u00e9tait produit apr\u00e8s le 26 mai 1995 alors que Yves H\u00e9roux n'\u00e9tait plus disponible suite \u00e0 un rappel au travail. Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant n'aurait pu refuser l'affectation puisqu'il n'y avait plus, sur la liste de rappel, un \u00e9pisseur ayant moins d'anciennet\u00e9 que lui.\n[155] Le t\u00e9moin pr\u00e9cise \u00e9galement que la convention est muette quant aux cons\u00e9quences qui en r\u00e9sultent lorsque l'employ\u00e9 refuse une affectation malgr\u00e9 qu'il ait l'obligation de l'accepter. En pareilles circonstances, le t\u00e9moin affirme que l'employ\u00e9 demeure quand m\u00eame sur la liste de rappel jusqu'\u00e0 l'expiration de son droit de rappel de 24 mois.\n[156] Le t\u00e9moin r\u00e9v\u00e8le que l'employ\u00e9 peut \u00e9galement, au cours de sa mise \u00e0 pied, revenir au travail lorsqu'un poste permanent devient vacant ou qu'un nouveau poste permanent est cr\u00e9\u00e9.\n[157] Lyne Doroftei a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 commenter les dispositions de l'article 22 de la convention collective qui traite des mutations temporaires. Cette disposition est appliqu\u00e9e dans le cas o\u00f9 un volume de travail tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9 exige qu'un employ\u00e9 soit d\u00e9plac\u00e9 temporairement dans un autre lieu de travail que son lieu normal de travail. D\u00e8s lors, l'employ\u00e9 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie de certains avantages tels que des frais de d\u00e9placement, des frais raisonnables de logement et des indemnit\u00e9s de repas. Toutefois, le t\u00e9moin souligne que les dispositions de cet article 22 de la convention collective ne s'appliquaient pas lorsque les employ\u00e9s sur la liste de rappel \u00e9taient rappel\u00e9s au travail car leurs conditions d'embauche \u00e9taient r\u00e9gies par les lettres d'entente.\n[158] Lyne Doroftei a fourni des explications relativement \u00e0 l'application de l'article 21 de la convention collective qui traite des mutations permanentes. Cette disposition vise la situation o\u00f9 l'employeur exige le transfert d'un employ\u00e9 de son lieu normal \u00e0 un autre lieu de travail. Le t\u00e9moin souligne que cet article ne trouve aucune application dans le cas d'un affichage de poste. De fait, lors d'un affichage de poste, l'employ\u00e9 d\u00e9cide de poser sa candidature en acceptant les cons\u00e9quences de sa d\u00e9cision tandis que dans le cas d'une mutation permanente il se voit imposer par l'employeur l'obligation d'\u00eatre d\u00e9plac\u00e9 dans un autre lieu de travail.\n[159] Lyne Doroftei est venue faire part de son implication lors de la mise \u00e0 pied de Pierre Bergeron le 10 janvier 1997. Le 9 janvier 1997, le directeur du d\u00e9partement des relations de travail, Reynald Wilson, lui a demand\u00e9 de pr\u00e9parer une lettre (Pi\u00e8ce P-21) destin\u00e9e au plaignant l'avisant que le poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur qu'il occupait prenait fin le 24 janvier 1997 et qu'il retournait sur la liste de rappel pour 24 mois \u00e0 compter de la date de sa mise \u00e0 pied. On l'a inform\u00e9 que Pierre Bergeron avait obtenu, suite \u00e0 un affichage, le poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur et qu'il n'avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 la capacit\u00e9 de remplir ses nouvelles t\u00e2ches conform\u00e9ment aux normes exig\u00e9es pour ce poste.\n[160] Le t\u00e9moin a expliqu\u00e9 que la convention pr\u00e9voit, \u00e0 la clause 13.12, que si un salari\u00e9 n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 sa capacit\u00e9 de remplir sa nouvelle t\u00e2che conform\u00e9ment aux normes de la compagnie dans les 120 jours qui suivent sa promotion ou sa mutation, il devra retourner \u00e0 son poste et localit\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurs...\n[161] Le t\u00e9moin a \u00e9galement racont\u00e9 que le 9 d\u00e9cembre 1997 elle avait re\u00e7u un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de Richard Leblanc, sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat de Pierre Bergeron, qui l'informait que l'emploi de ce dernier devait se terminer le 24 d\u00e9cembre 1997 mais qu'il \u00e9tait absent du travail et hospitalis\u00e9. Il s'interrogeait \u00e0 propos de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'aviser par \u00e9crit le plaignant, vu son absence, de sa mise \u00e0 pied effective le 24 d\u00e9cembre 1997. Richard Leblanc l'a inform\u00e9e que Pierre Bergeron avait \u00e9t\u00e9 temporairement rappel\u00e9 au travail le 20 octobre 1997 pour une dur\u00e9e approximative de six semaines et que son affectation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 verbalement prolong\u00e9e jusqu'au 24 d\u00e9cembre 1997. Le 10 d\u00e9cembre 1997, Richard Leblanc a confirm\u00e9 au t\u00e9moin, par courriel, les informations qu'il lui avait fournies la veille (Pi\u00e8ce I-12).\n[162] Le t\u00e9moin a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un avis de mise \u00e0 pied \u00e0 l'endroit du plaignant effectif \u00e0 compter du 24 d\u00e9cembre 1997 avec droit de rappel pour une p\u00e9riode de 24 mois \u00e0 compter de la date de sa mise \u00e0 pied (Pi\u00e8ce P-30).\n[163] Suite \u00e0 sa mise \u00e0 pied du 10 janvier 1997 (Pi\u00e8ce P-21) le plaignant a formul\u00e9 un grief (Pi\u00e8ce P-23) par lequel il conteste sa mise \u00e0 pied et r\u00e9clame le maintien de son poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur ainsi que tous les avantages perdus.\n[164] Suite au d\u00e9p\u00f4t du grief, le comit\u00e9 de grief s'est r\u00e9uni pour en discuter. \u00c9taient pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 cette rencontre le plaignant, son d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical Jean Levert, son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat, Alain Rivard et le t\u00e9moin Lyne Doroftei du d\u00e9partement des relations de travail. Elle \u00e9tait charg\u00e9e de dresser un compte-rendu de la rencontre (Pi\u00e8ce P-65).\n[165] Lyne Doroftei raconte que la compagnie a voulu rappeler le plaignant au travail le 27 ao\u00fbt 1998 pour un travail temporaire de releveur de poteaux mais qu'il lui fut impossible de le joindre (Pi\u00e8ce I-3). Le t\u00e9moin a reconnu que la convention collective ne pr\u00e9voit pas la fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der lors du rappel au travail d'un employ\u00e9. Elle pr\u00e9cise par ailleurs que la coutume voulait que le rappel au travail se fasse par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone.\n[166] L'impossibilit\u00e9 de joindre le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un refus de rappel au travail et il est demeur\u00e9 sur la liste de rappel jusqu'\u00e0 l'expiration de son droit de rappel au travail le 24 d\u00e9cembre 1999.\n[167] Le t\u00e9moin pr\u00e9cise que lors de l'annonce d'une mise \u00e0 pied \u00e0 un employ\u00e9, on le rencontrait en personne pour l'aviser. Si l'employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait absent, on prenait les dispositions pour qu'un repr\u00e9sentant de l'entreprise aille le rencontrer et lui remettre un avis \u00e9crit de mise \u00e0 pied.\n[168] Lyne Doroftei a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 commenter la pr\u00e9tention du plaignant voulant que Serge Chayer, poss\u00e9dant moins d'anciennet\u00e9 que lui, ait \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenu en emploi alors qu'il \u00e9tait en mise \u00e0 pied. \u00c0 l'aide de l'historique d'emploi de Serge Chayer (Pi\u00e8ce I-19) Lyne Doroftei a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que Serge Chayer a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 sur la liste de rappel le 7 d\u00e9cembre 1995 alors qu'il avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment occup\u00e9 les postes de monteur de lignes et d'\u00e9pisseur.\n[169] Comme il poss\u00e9dait plus d'anciennet\u00e9 que Serge Chayer, Pierre Bergeron a \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 temporairement au travail \u00e0 titre d'\u00e9pisseur pour la p\u00e9riode du 27 janvier 1997 au 21 f\u00e9vrier 1997. Quant \u00e0 Serge Chayer, il fut rappel\u00e9 temporairement au travail \u00e0 titre d'\u00e9pisseur du 3 f\u00e9vrier 1997 au 17 mars 1997. Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant ne pouvait revendiquer le travail accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Serge Chayer puisqu'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 au travail lors du rappel au travail de ce dernier.\n[170] Le t\u00e9moin raconte que, par la suite, suivant l'historique d'emploi, Serge Chayer a obtenu un emploi temporaire d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur du 17 mars 1997 au 23 novembre 1997. Entretemps, Serge Chayer a pos\u00e9 sa candidature sur un poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue. Depuis le 24 novembre 1997, il occupe un poste permanent d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur. Le t\u00e9moin pr\u00e9cise que le plaignant avait \u00e9chou\u00e9 auparavant dans sa tentative d'obtenir un poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur, ce qui explique que Serge Chayer est demeur\u00e9 au travail plut\u00f4t que le plaignant.\n[171] Lyne Doroftei a comment\u00e9 \u00e9galement l'affirmation de Pierre Bergeron soutenant que Yves Th\u00e9roux, \u00e9pisseur, alors sur la liste de rappel et poss\u00e9dant moins d'anciennet\u00e9 que lui, ait \u00e9t\u00e9 temporairement rappel\u00e9 au travail du 27 mai 1996 au 1er janvier 1999. Le t\u00e9moin a expliqu\u00e9 que lors du rappel au travail de Yves Th\u00e9roux, Pierre Bergeron \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 au travail depuis le 26 mars 1996 et qu'il y est demeur\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 son d\u00e9part en cong\u00e9 maladie en ao\u00fbt 1996. Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne pouvait revendiquer le travail accord\u00e9 alors \u00e0 Yves Th\u00e9roux.\n[172] Lyne Doroftei, contre-interrog\u00e9e par Pierre Bergeron, a d\u00fb expliquer comment il se fait qu'\u00e0 la suite de sa mise \u00e0 pied du 24 d\u00e9cembre 1997 il n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 au travail avant l'expiration de son droit de rappel au travail, soit le 24 d\u00e9cembre 1999. En r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 la liste de rappel (Pi\u00e8ce I-3), Lyne Doroftei a r\u00e9pondu qu'un seul employ\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 temporairement rappel\u00e9 au travail le 14 d\u00e9cembre 1998 et que cet employ\u00e9 poss\u00e9dait plus d'anciennet\u00e9 que le plaignant. Au cours de l'ann\u00e9e 1999, Paul Villeneuve, Roger Morissette, Marc Mercier et Andr\u00e9 Boisvert ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s au travail mais ils poss\u00e9daient tous plus d'anciennet\u00e9 que le plaignant.\n[173] Le t\u00e9moin a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 analyser les lettres d'entente (Pi\u00e8ces I-4, I-5, I-6 et I-7) qui r\u00e9f\u00e9rent \u00e0 la r\u00e9embauche temporaire de techniciens et monteurs de lignes et a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elles se sont appliqu\u00e9es aux autres emplois dont celui d'\u00e9pisseur. Lyne Doroftei a r\u00e9pondu que dans les faits ces lettres d'entente, avec l'accord de l'Union des Routiers, se sont appliqu\u00e9es \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s sur la liste de rappel et que le tout s'est confirm\u00e9 lors de la signature de la lettre d'entente du 7 juillet 1998 (Pi\u00e8ce I-8) visant le r\u00e9embauchage des employ\u00e9s sur la liste de rappel.\n[174] Lyne Doroftei a affirm\u00e9 en contre-interrogatoire que le rapport du m\u00e9decin traitant \u00e0 l'usage du service m\u00e9dical est exig\u00e9 lorsque l'absence du travail d'un employ\u00e9 pour maladie ou accident peut d\u00e9passer une p\u00e9riode de huit jours. Elle a confirm\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Cond\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effet que les repr\u00e9sentants de l'employeur ne sont jamais inform\u00e9s de la nature de la maladie qui peut affecter un employ\u00e9. Les renseignements transmis par le m\u00e9decin de l'employeur se limitent \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode d'invalidit\u00e9, le moment du retour au travail \u00e0 temps plein ou \u00e0 temps partiel avec ou sans restriction.\n(v) Docteur Jean-Joseph Cond\u00e9 [175] Au d\u00e9but du t\u00e9moignage du Dr Cond\u00e9, le plaignant l'a relev\u00e9 de son secret professionnel et consenti \u00e0 ce qu'il d\u00e9voile le contenu de son dossier m\u00e9dical et notes personnelles. De 1992 \u00e0 1997, il \u00e9tait le m\u00e9decin du personnel chez T\u00e9l\u00e9bec. Depuis 1997, il est le m\u00e9decin consultant de l'intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 partir de son cabinet priv\u00e9, pour des probl\u00e8mes d'ordre m\u00e9dico-administratif chez ses employ\u00e9s. Le Dr Cond\u00e9 a expliqu\u00e9 la proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tablie par l'entreprise lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 est en arr\u00eat de travail pour cause de maladie ou accident du travail.\n[176] L'employ\u00e9 doit fournir un rapport de son m\u00e9decin traitant (formulaire 1935) \u00e0 l'usage du service m\u00e9dical, c'est-\u00e0-dire, directement au bureau du Dr Cond\u00e9. Sur r\u00e9ception de ce formulaire 1935 d\u00fbment rempli, il en prend connaissance et il dresse ensuite un rapport (formulaire 1936) administratif qui reprend les renseignements contenus dans le rapport du m\u00e9decin traitant sans d\u00e9voiler toutefois le diagnostic qui est de nature confidentielle. Ce rapport administratif est achemin\u00e9 au directeur et au sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat de l'employ\u00e9. Une partie de ce rapport est \u00e9galement transmise au service des avantages sociaux afin de l'informer de la pertinence de l'arr\u00eat de travail. Une copie est \u00e9galement remise \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9.\n[177] Il arrive que le m\u00e9decin consultant rencontre l'employ\u00e9 lorsqu'il y a lieu de s'assurer si l'employ\u00e9, d\u00e9clar\u00e9 apte \u00e0 reprendre le travail, est pr\u00eat \u00e0 reprendre ou bien lorsque l'arr\u00eat de travail se prolonge ou encore lorsque les traitements paraissent insuffisants ou inad\u00e9quats afin de r\u00e9\u00e9valuer la pertinence de l'arr\u00eat de travail. Un rapport (formulaire 5483) est, par la suite, pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par le m\u00e9decin consultant et transmis aux m\u00eames intervenants chez l'employeur, y compris l'employ\u00e9 concern\u00e9.\n[178] Le t\u00e9moin a rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant le 27 ao\u00fbt 1996 lequel \u00e9tait en arr\u00eat de travail avec un retour au travail pr\u00e9vu par son m\u00e9decin traitant le 2 septembre 1996. Le plaignant a inform\u00e9 le m\u00e9decin qu'il avait fait une d\u00e9pression majeure 11 ans auparavant.\n[179] Selon les notes \u00e9volutives au dossier du Dr Cond\u00e9 (Pi\u00e8ce P-54), celui-ci a constat\u00e9 que le plaignant \u00e9tait en arr\u00eat de travail depuis le 19 ao\u00fbt 1996 pour d\u00e9pression majeure avec facteurs d\u00e9clenchants qu'il identifiait comme \u00e9tant le changement au niveau de l'emploi, la perte d'un \u00eatre cher auquel il \u00e9tait attach\u00e9, soit son chien, et le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement. Il conclut que l'arr\u00eat de travail est justifi\u00e9 et que le retour au travail pr\u00e9vu le 16 septembre 1996 par le m\u00e9decin traitant devra probablement \u00eatre prolong\u00e9. Il recommandait au plaignant de continuer la psychoth\u00e9rapie entreprise depuis le 16 ao\u00fbt 1996 \u00e0 raison d'une fois par semaine et de revoir son m\u00e9decin traitant dans deux semaines.\n[180] Le 1er octobre 1996, le m\u00e9decin traitant du plaignant, le Dr Guy Perrier, transmettait un rapport m\u00e9dical (1935) au service m\u00e9dical o\u00f9 il prononce un diagnostic de d\u00e9pression majeure avec retour au travail normal \u00e0 temps plein le 4 novembre 1996.\n[181] Le 30 octobre 1996, le patient revoit son m\u00e9decin traitant qui remplit un autre certificat m\u00e9dical (1935) pr\u00e9voyant un retour au travail de son patient \u00e0 temps partiel, sans restriction, le 2 d\u00e9cembre 1996.\n[182] Pierre Bergeron rencontre le Dr Cond\u00e9 le 31 octobre 1996. Il note que le plaignant l'informe qu'il va mieux depuis un mois ; il fait du sport une fois par semaine ; son app\u00e9tit a augment\u00e9 et il a pris du poids ; il se sent moins fatigu\u00e9 et ses capacit\u00e9s physiques augmentent ; sa m\u00e9moire et sa concentration sont correctes. Le Dr Cond\u00e9 note \u00e9galement que le patient n'a plus de pleurs, pas d'id\u00e9e suicidaire, ni tristesse.\n[183] Le Dr Cond\u00e9 \u00e9met l'opinion que l'\u00e9tat du patient s'est am\u00e9lior\u00e9. Il lui recommande de poursuivre ses traitements de psychoth\u00e9rapie et d'augmenter ses activit\u00e9s quotidiennes pour continuer \u00e0 se mettre en forme et de prendre la m\u00e9dication prescrite par le Dr Perrier.\n[184] Comme le retour au travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu par le Dr Perrier le 2 d\u00e9cembre 1996, il fixe un rendez-vous au plaignant le 26 novembre 1996 pour un examen de retour au travail. Lors de cette rencontre, le Dr Cond\u00e9 note que le patient va mieux. Il lui d\u00e9clare qu'il a augment\u00e9 ses activit\u00e9s physiques, qu'il a un bon moral, qu'il est de bonne humeur.\n[185] Il l'informe \u00e9galement qu'il se sent moins fatigu\u00e9 et qu'il ressent une augmentation d'\u00e9nergie. Il se sent am\u00e9lior\u00e9 par la massoth\u00e9rapie et la psychoth\u00e9rapie.\n[186] Le Dr Cond\u00e9 en arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que la d\u00e9pression s'est nettement am\u00e9lior\u00e9e et il approuve la recommandation du m\u00e9decin traitant pour un retour au travail \u00e0 temps partiel sans restriction \u00e0 compter du 2 d\u00e9cembre 1996. Toutefois, il recommande, avec l'accord du plaignant, un retour progressif au travail soit deux jours semaine cons\u00e9cutifs dans la semaine du 2 d\u00e9cembre 1996, trois jours semaine du 9 d\u00e9cembre 1996 au 3 janvier 1997 et cinq jours semaine \u00e0 partir du 6 janvier 1997.\n[187] Le 9 d\u00e9cembre 1996, en l'absence du Dr Cond\u00e9, le plaignant a rencontr\u00e9 l'infirmi\u00e8re Linda Doyter au bureau de ce dernier. Elle inscrit au dossier que Pierre Bergeron a travaill\u00e9 les 2 et 3 d\u00e9cembre 1996. Sa concentration est bonne mais il se sent physiquement \u00e9puis\u00e9. Elle note que le patient l'informe que moralement il va bien ; il a un nouveau travail o\u00f9 il subit une pression face \u00e0 sa performance tr\u00e8s suivie. Il doit revoir son m\u00e9decin le 12 d\u00e9cembre 1996. L'infirmi\u00e8re d\u00e9cide qu'au cours de la semaine du 9 d\u00e9cembre l'employ\u00e9 ne fera pas un retour au travail \u00e0 temps partiel sans restriction \u00e0 raison de trois jours semaine comme pr\u00e9vu mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 raison de deux jours semaine non cons\u00e9cutifs.\n[188] Une rencontre est fix\u00e9e avec le Dr Cond\u00e9 le 17 d\u00e9cembre 1996 pour un examen de contr\u00f4le de retour au travail. Effectivement, Pierre Bergeron a rencontr\u00e9 le Dr Cond\u00e9 le 17 d\u00e9cembre 1996. Le plaignant relate au m\u00e9decin qu'il a travaill\u00e9 deux jours la semaine pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente et il estime avoir eu une bonne performance au travail. Le plaignant lui dit \u00e9galement que physiquement il se sent capable de travailler et qu'il est pr\u00eat \u00e0 augmenter sa performance et son temps au travail. Il pr\u00e9tend avoir un bon moral, sans sympt\u00f4me d\u00e9pressif et sans pleurs, ni tristesse. De plus, son app\u00e9tit est bon et il dort bien avec sa m\u00e9dication.\n[189] Devant ces faits, le Dr Cond\u00e9 conclut que l'\u00e9tat du plaignant s'est encore am\u00e9lior\u00e9, qu'il se sent en forme et qu'il n'a pas de sympt\u00f4me d\u00e9pressif pr\u00e9sent. Avec l'accord de Pierre Bergeron, le Dr Cond\u00e9 recommande un retour au travail \u00e0 temps partiel sans restriction \u00e0 raison de quatre jours semaine au cours de la semaine courante et \u00e0 temps plein sans restriction \u00e0 compter du 23 d\u00e9cembre 1996. Comme l'\u00e9volution du patient lui semble satisfaisante, le Dr Cond\u00e9 ne pr\u00e9voit pas le revoir.\n[190] Le 11 d\u00e9cembre 1996, Pierre Bergeron a rencontr\u00e9 son m\u00e9decin traitant pour un examen de contr\u00f4le. Celui-ci note que son patient n'a pas de trouble d'humeur. Le Dr Cond\u00e9 estime qu'\u00e0 cette date le m\u00e9decin traitant du plaignant le jugeait remis de sa d\u00e9pression et apte \u00e0 travailler.\n[191] Le 14 janvier 1997, le Dr Cond\u00e9 rencontre le plaignant qui lui raconte qu'il n'a pas travaill\u00e9 les 23 et 24 d\u00e9cembre 1996. Il a pris des vacances pendant la p\u00e9riode des F\u00eates. Il a repris le travail \u00e0 temps plein le 6 janvier 1997 et il estime avoir fourni une bonne performance.\n[192] Le patient lui apprend \u00e9galement qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied en raison de son manque d'exp\u00e9rience et de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 faire le travail. Le Dr Cond\u00e9 constate que le plaignant accepte la situation avec calme ; il a peu pleur\u00e9 ; il d\u00e9montre un bon jugement et une bonne appr\u00e9ciation de sa situation. Il esp\u00e8re \u00eatre rappel\u00e9 au travail. Il pr\u00e9cise que son impression diagnostique est \u00e0 l'effet que la r\u00e9action calme et contr\u00f4l\u00e9e du patient, face \u00e0 sa mise \u00e0 pied, et l'absence de sympt\u00f4me d\u00e9pressif d\u00e9montrent que la d\u00e9pression est gu\u00e9rie.\n[193] Il note aussi que, le 13 janvier 1997, le plaignant a rencontr\u00e9 son m\u00e9decin traitant qui constate que celui-ci n'a pas de trouble d\u00e9pressif. Il a diminu\u00e9 la prise de Paxil de 40 \u00e0 20 milligrammes.\n(vi) Jos\u00e9e Ferron [194] Jos\u00e9e Ferron a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e chez T\u00e9l\u00e9bec en avril 1992 et elle occupe le poste de directrice des ressources humaines depuis janvier 1996. Elle travaillait au niveau de la s\u00e9lection, de l'embauche et du mouvement de personnel alors que Lyne Doroftei \u00e9tait assign\u00e9e \u00e0 tout ce qui touchait les relations de travail. Ce n'est que depuis 1999 qu'elle a assum\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 des relations de travail.\n[195] Au d\u00e9but de mai 1996, une demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite pour combler deux postes d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur \u00e0 Val-d'Or. Le 7 mai 1996, elle a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un affichage de ces deux postes aux tableaux d'affichage situ\u00e9s dans les centres de travail (Pi\u00e8ce I-14). Ce document identifie le poste, le lieu de travail, la dur\u00e9e, les exigences minimales requises, le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de l'emploi et la date pr\u00e9vue de l'emploi. Le t\u00e9moin pr\u00e9cise que l'affichage est d'une dur\u00e9e de cinq jours ouvrables selon les termes de la convention collective et qu'il se terminait le 13 mai 1996.\n[196] Au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, l'employ\u00e9 doit poser sa candidature par une demande de mutation comme Pierre Bergeron l'a fait (Pi\u00e8ce P-13) le 13 mai 1996. Le t\u00e9moin raconte que cinq candidats ont pos\u00e9 leur candidature \u00e0 savoir Guy Desgagn\u00e9, Normand Rouleau, Pierre Bergeron, Daniel Lemieux et Serge Chayer.\n[197] Jos\u00e9e Ferron raconte qu'une fois le processus d'affichage termin\u00e9 elle proc\u00e8de aux entrevues avec les candidats ayant appliqu\u00e9 pour v\u00e9rifier leurs comp\u00e9tences et leurs qualifications au poste convoit\u00e9. L'entrevue se r\u00e9alise parfois par entretien t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique comme ce fut le cas avec le plaignant qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 La Sarre tandis que le bureau des ressources humaines se trouvait \u00e0 Val-d'Or. Le t\u00e9moin a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'entrevue t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec le plaignant le 22 mai 1996 et l'entrevue a dur\u00e9 entre 30 et 45 minutes.\n[198] Le t\u00e9moin a pos\u00e9 des questions au plaignant pour v\u00e9rifier s'il poss\u00e9dait les exigences minimales requises pour le poste, pour \u00e9valuer sa capacit\u00e9 dans un travail en \u00e9quipe, son sens de la coop\u00e9ration, ses connaissances techniques, son autonomie, son sens des responsabilit\u00e9s, sa vision de l'approche avec la client\u00e8le.\n[199] Le t\u00e9moin d\u00e9clare \u00e9valuer \u00e9galement chez le candidat l'esprit d'\u00e9quipe, sa capacit\u00e9 de faire face \u00e0 l'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9, son leadership, sa capacit\u00e9 de prise de d\u00e9cision et la compr\u00e9hension de l'anglais qui constitue un atout.\n[200] Suite \u00e0 l'entrevue, le t\u00e9moin d\u00e9clare avoir pr\u00e9par\u00e9 une \u00e9valuation \u00e9crite (Pi\u00e8ce I-23). Elle y a \u00e9crit que le plaignant devra am\u00e9liorer son leadership et que sa motivation professionnelle est faible car il semble d\u00e9motiv\u00e9 suite aux mises \u00e0 pied et ne pas comprendre le contexte actuel de l'entreprise ; son niveau de connaissances techniques \u00e9tait faible.\n[201] Suite aux entrevues avec les candidats, le t\u00e9moin d\u00e9clare avoir rencontr\u00e9 le directeur du service, Serge Faubert, et Alain Rivard ou Claude Mayrand pour proc\u00e9der au choix des candidats. Apr\u00e8s discussions, un seul candidat a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu soit Daniel Lemieux pour un poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur et le second poste a fait l'objet d'une embauche \u00e0 l'externe, Alain Brouillette, en date du 17 juin 1997.\n[202] Le t\u00e9moin raconte que Daniel Lemieux a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 qu'il avait obtenu le poste. Toutefois, il s'est d\u00e9sist\u00e9 de sorte qu'un poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur n'\u00e9tait pas encore combl\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, une seconde analyse des candidats a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite avec Serge Faubert et le t\u00e9moin. Elle a racont\u00e9 qu'elle a insist\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de Serge Faubert en invoquant que le plaignant avait des connaissances de base, qu'on devrait lui donner une chance et que, de toute fa\u00e7on, il aurait une p\u00e9riode d'essai sur le poste et qu'on pourrait toujours le retourner sur la liste de rappel comme \u00e9pisseur s'il \u00e9tait incapable de rencontrer les exigences du poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur.\n[203] Le t\u00e9moin raconte que, finalement, il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'accorder le poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur au plaignant qui l'a accept\u00e9 le 22 juillet 1996 pour entrer en fonction le 6 ao\u00fbt 1996.\n(vii) Richard Leblanc [204] Richard Leblanc est \u00e0 l'emploi de T\u00e9l\u00e9bec \u00e0 Val-d'Or depuis 1990 \u00e0 titre de directeur \u00e0 la gestion du r\u00e9seau d'acc\u00e8s. Ses responsabilit\u00e9s consistent \u00e0 analyser les secteurs desservis par T\u00e9l\u00e9bec pour s'assurer que la capacit\u00e9 du r\u00e9seau est suffisante pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de la client\u00e8le et pour s'assurer de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du r\u00e9seau. Elles consistent en outre \u00e0 confectionner les plans reli\u00e9s \u00e0 de nouveaux projets.\n[205] Il raconte qu'\u00e0 l'automne 1997, il \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 de projet pour l'ex\u00e9cution d'un projet \u00e0 Chibougamau d'une dur\u00e9e de six mois visant le remplacement d'un r\u00e9seau d\u00e9suet et congestionn\u00e9. Le travail avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 \u00e0 un sous-traitant. Des travaux d'\u00e9pissage de c\u00e2bles d'une dur\u00e9e approximative de quatre \u00e0 six semaines devaient \u00eatre accomplis par un \u00e9pisseur. Une demande en ce sens a \u00e9t\u00e9 achemin\u00e9e au d\u00e9partement des ressources humaines (Pi\u00e8ce I-18) et le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 temporairement au travail pour la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9vue (Pi\u00e8ce P-28).\n[206] Richard Leblanc se rappelle que, vers la fin de novembre 1997, Pierre Bergeron a communiqu\u00e9 avec lui pour savoir si son embauche temporaire se terminait bien \u00e0 l'expiration de la p\u00e9riode de six semaines. Le t\u00e9moin a communiqu\u00e9 avec son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat Yvon Hall\u00e9 pour lui sugg\u00e9rer de maintenir le plaignant au travail pour aider le sous-traitant. Yvon Hall\u00e9 a pris la d\u00e9cision de garder Pierre Bergeron \u00e0 l'emploi jusqu'au 24 d\u00e9cembre 1997. Le t\u00e9moin a fait part de cette d\u00e9cision au plaignant qui semblait satisfait. Cette prolongation d'emploi n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e au plaignant par \u00e9crit.\n[207] Richard Leblanc rappelle que les conditions d'embauche de Pierre Bergeron stipulaient qu'apr\u00e8s 10 jours cons\u00e9cutifs de travail il devait prendre quatre jours de cong\u00e9 cons\u00e9cutifs. Pierre Bergeron lui a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il serait \u00e0 Chibougamau du 1er au 24 d\u00e9cembre 1997. Richard Leblanc lui a mentionn\u00e9 que s'il entendait demeurer \u00e0 Chibougamau, il devait respecter la prise de ses cong\u00e9s.\n[208] Le t\u00e9moin affirme, contrairement aux pr\u00e9tentions du plaignant, qu'il ne lui a pas affirm\u00e9 que sa prolongation d'emploi \u00e9tait pour une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e parce qu'il n'avait pas l'autorit\u00e9 pour prendre une telle d\u00e9cision et qu'il s'est conform\u00e9 aux directives de son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat, Yvon Hall\u00e9.\n[209] Richard Leblanc se souvient que le 9 d\u00e9cembre 1997, il a re\u00e7u un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de Pierre Bergeron l'avisant de son hospitalisation \u00e0 Chibougamau ; il s'est inform\u00e9 du motif de son hospitalisation. Le plaignant lui a dit qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas bless\u00e9 sans lui fournir de plus amples d\u00e9tails.\n[210] Le t\u00e9moin a communiqu\u00e9 avec Lyne Doroftei au d\u00e9partement des relations industrielles pour conna\u00eetre la marche \u00e0 suivre dans les circonstances d'autant plus que l'emploi du plaignant se terminait le 24 d\u00e9cembre 1997. Cette derni\u00e8re lui a demand\u00e9 de lui transmettre par courriel les informations relatives aux ententes avec le plaignant et la date de sa terminaison d'emploi, ce que le t\u00e9moin a fait le 10 d\u00e9cembre 1997 (Pi\u00e8ce I-12). Elle lui a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e9galement qu'un avis de mise \u00e0 pied lui serait remis afin qu'il le transmette au plaignant sans d\u00e9lai (Pi\u00e8ce P-30).\n[211] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u et sign\u00e9 le document, le t\u00e9moin a appris qu'Alain Rivard se rendait \u00e0 Chibougamau et il lui a demand\u00e9 de se rendre au chevet du plaignant pour lui remettre l'avis de mise \u00e0 pied. Le t\u00e9moin a cru bon de pr\u00e9ciser que le plaignant, pendant qu'il fut sous sa responsabilit\u00e9, a fourni une tr\u00e8s bonne qualit\u00e9 de travail \u00e0 titre d'\u00e9pisseur et qu'il n'a jamais mis fin \u00e0 son emploi en raison de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9.\nIII. LA LOI [212] L'article 7 de la Loi \u00e9nonce que le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects, de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu ou de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi constitue un acte discriminatoire s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. L'article 3 de la Loi pr\u00e9cise que la d\u00e9ficience est un motif de distinction illicite.\n[213] L'article 14 (1) de la Loi dispose que le fait de harceler un individu en cours d'emploi constitue un acte discriminatoire s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite.\nIV. FARDEAU DE LA PREUVE [214] Depuis la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'affaire O'Malley 1, il est \u00e9tabli qu'il appartient d'abord au plaignant d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve prime facie est celle qui porte sur des all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e.\nV. ANALYSE A. Le plaignant a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 en cours d'emploi en raison d'une d\u00e9ficience (d\u00e9pression) ? (i) Mise \u00e0 pied du 6 d\u00e9cembre 1995 [215] La preuve d\u00e9montre que le plaignant occupait le poste d'\u00e9pisseur chez l'intim\u00e9e depuis 1990. Le 20 novembre 1995, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 de sa mise \u00e0 pied effective le 6 d\u00e9cembre 1995. Son nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 sur une liste de rappel. La convention collective lui conf\u00e9rait un droit de rappel au travail au cours des 24 mois suivant sa mise \u00e0 pied.\n[216] Le plaignant soutient que l'intim\u00e9e ne lui a pas permis d'exercer son droit de supplantation et d'\u00eatre ainsi maintenu en emploi. Il ressort de la preuve que la pr\u00e9tention du plaignant n'est pas fond\u00e9e. En effet, l'anciennet\u00e9 acquise par le plaignant ne lui permettait pas d'exercer son droit de supplantation. Il y a lieu de souligner que devant l'impossibilit\u00e9 d'exercer son droit de supplantation, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief pour revendiquer ce droit mais ce grief fut plus tard retir\u00e9 par l'Union des Routiers.\n[217] Le plaignant sugg\u00e8re que sa mise \u00e0 pied de d\u00e9cembre 1995 et son incapacit\u00e9 d'exercer son droit de supplantation ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 chez lui une situation d'ins\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de crainte de perte d\u00e9finitive de son emploi qui furent \u00e0 l'origine de la d\u00e9pression qu'il a v\u00e9cue en ao\u00fbt 1996. La preuve est \u00e0 l'effet que l'intim\u00e9e a proc\u00e9d\u00e9, \u00e0 la fin de 1995, \u00e0 une restructuration administrative importante de l'entreprise qui s'est traduite par de nombreuses mises \u00e0 pied. Il y a lieu de croire que le plaignant, qui jouissait d'un emploi stable chez l'intim\u00e9e depuis plus de neuf ans, ait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 par un manque de travail et qu'il ait craint pour son avenir \u00e0 l'emploi de l'intim\u00e9e. Toutefois, le plaignant n'a soumis aucune preuve d\u00e9montrant que lors de sa mise \u00e0 pied du 6 d\u00e9cembre 1995 il souffrait de quelque d\u00e9ficience que ce soit, except\u00e9 le fait qu'il ait subi une d\u00e9pression 11 ans auparavant.\n[218] Sans rejeter pour autant la pr\u00e9tention du plaignant voulant que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus soient \u00e0 l'origine d'une d\u00e9pression survenue en ao\u00fbt 1996, il n'en demeure pas moins qu'aucune preuve ne permet de conclure que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied en raison d'une d\u00e9ficience.\n(ii) Mise \u00e0 pied du 24 janvier 1997 [219] Le plaignant a repris le travail le 2 d\u00e9cembre 1996 suite \u00e0 une absence pour maladie, soit une d\u00e9pression survenue en ao\u00fbt 1996. Il estime que l'intim\u00e9e l'a mis \u00e0 pied en raison de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9.\n[220] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, suite \u00e0 sa mise \u00e0 pied, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 temporairement au travail de fa\u00e7on successive, \u00e0 son poste d'\u00e9pisseur ou monteur de lignes, \u00e0 compter du 26 mars 1996. Il ressort \u00e9galement de la preuve que le 7 mai 1996 l'intim\u00e9e a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'affichage de deux postes d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur \u00e0 Val-d'Or et que le plaignant a pos\u00e9 sa candidature de m\u00eame que quatre autres employ\u00e9s.\n[221] Il convient de rappeler que le plaignant avait rempli les t\u00e2ches d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur lors de son embauche le 7 mai 1987 jusqu'au 23 avril 1990 alors qu'il a obtenu un poste d'\u00e9pisseur.\n[222] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque le travail d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur s'exer\u00e7ait tr\u00e8s majoritairement dans le secteur r\u00e9sidentiel. Il consistait \u00e0 amener des fils de service depuis le poteau jusqu'\u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence et \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'installation de fils dans la r\u00e9sidence pour permettre l'acc\u00e8s aux branchements de poste. L'installateur-r\u00e9parateur livrait l'appareil t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique au client. Quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration, il s'agissait de v\u00e9rifier l'aspect r\u00e9sistif de la ligne t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique et la condition de terre. Le travail de l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur n'\u00e9tait utilis\u00e9 que tr\u00e8s occasionnellement dans le secteur affaires. Il se limitait \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches de c\u00e2blage permettant l'installation de petits syst\u00e8mes t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques et \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser la programmation \u00e0 l'aide de registres fixes pr\u00e9\u00e9tablis.\n[223] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'\u00e0 compter de 1992, dans le secteur affaires, l'arriv\u00e9e du microprocesseur a amen\u00e9 de nombreux syst\u00e8mes t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques avec un langage de programmation beaucoup plus large qui a permis d'offrir de meilleurs services \u00e0 la client\u00e8le. S'est ajout\u00e9e la vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence et internet. Par cons\u00e9quent, la programmation a fait en sorte que l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur devait remplir des t\u00e2ches d'analyste. Il devait \u00e9galement \u00e9tablir un contact constant avec la client\u00e8le pour conna\u00eetre ses besoins et lui vendre des \u00e9quipements adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 ses besoins. Concernant le secteur r\u00e9sidentiel, le travail de l'installateur-r\u00e9parateur \u00e9tait de moins en moins requis car le r\u00e9seau avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9am\u00e9nag\u00e9. Ainsi, les r\u00e9parations et l'installation de nouveaux syst\u00e8mes \u00e9taient moins fr\u00e9quentes.\n[224] La preuve a \u00e9tabli que le document d'affichage des postes d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur comportait une description des exigences minimales requises. Le plaignant a reconnu qu'il ne r\u00e9pondait pas \u00e0 certaines de ces exigences, notamment la connaissance de base de la transmission des donn\u00e9es. Quant \u00e0 l'exigence de conna\u00eetre les diff\u00e9rents produits et services de l'entretien (s\u00e9rie Norstar et autres) qui constituait un avantage, il a admis qu'il ne connaissait pas les produits de l'entreprise alors sur le march\u00e9 puisqu'il avait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'installation d'un seul appareil Norstar lorsqu'il avait occup\u00e9 le poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur. Concernant l'exigence d'une connaissance des principes de la programmation, le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait peu de connaissance des principes de la programmation. Relativement \u00e0 l'exigence d'\u00eatre apte \u00e0 transiger et communiquer avec le client, le plaignant a reconnu que dans l'ex\u00e9cution de son travail d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur il avait rarement eu \u00e0 communiquer et transiger avec le client.\n[225] La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u les candidatures des employ\u00e9s d\u00e9sireux d'obtenir les postes d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur Jos\u00e9e Ferron, alors directrice des ressources humaines, a eu une entrevue avec chacun des candidats afin d'\u00e9valuer leurs qualifications et leurs comp\u00e9tences pour obtenir ces postes. Jos\u00e9e Ferron a fait une entrevue t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec le plaignant suite \u00e0 laquelle elle a tir\u00e9 la conclusion que le plaignant manquait de leadership et de motivation et que son niveau de connaissances techniques \u00e9tait peu \u00e9lev\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s avoir pr\u00e9par\u00e9 une \u00e9valuation de chacun des candidats, elle a soumis le tout au directeur Serge Faubert et superviseur, soit Alain Rivard ou Claude Mayrand. La candidature d'un seul employ\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue et, pour le second poste, on a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'embauche d'un nouvel employ\u00e9. Toutefois, le candidat choisi s'est d\u00e9sist\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s une seconde analyse, il fut entendu d'accorder le poste au plaignant qui l'a accept\u00e9.\n[226] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le plaignant est entr\u00e9 dans ses nouvelles fonctions le 2 ao\u00fbt 1996 mais qu'il a d\u00fb s'absenter du travail le 10 ao\u00fbt 1996 en raison d'une d\u00e9pression majeure.\n[227] La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que le Dr Cond\u00e9, m\u00e9decin consultant de l'intim\u00e9e, a rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 plusieurs reprises. Lors d'une premi\u00e8re rencontre avec le plaignant, le Dr Cond\u00e9 note que le plaignant, suivant le diagnostic de son m\u00e9decin traitant, souffre d'une d\u00e9pression majeure caus\u00e9e par un changement au niveau de l'emploi, le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement et la perte d'un \u00eatre cher, soit son chien. Il recommande de continuer la psychoth\u00e9rapie que suit le patient. Il rencontre \u00e0 nouveau le plaignant, le 31 octobre 1996, qui lui fait part qu'il se sent mieux et moins fatigu\u00e9. Le plaignant se sent plus capable physiquement. Le Dr Cond\u00e9 a appris du patient qu'il n'a plus de pleurs, ni tristesse, ni id\u00e9e suicidaire. Il conclut que l'\u00e9tat du patient s'est am\u00e9lior\u00e9. Le Dr Cond\u00e9 a rencontr\u00e9 encore le plaignant le 26 novembre 1996 pour analyser la possibilit\u00e9 d'un retour au travail. Apr\u00e8s avoir appris du plaignant qu'il va mieux, qu'il a un bon moral, qu'il est de bonne humeur, qu'il ressent une augmentation d'\u00e9nergie, le Dr Cond\u00e9 estime que l'\u00e9tat du patient s'est suffisamment am\u00e9lior\u00e9 pour approuver la recommandation de son m\u00e9decin de permettre un retour progressif au travail sans restriction \u00e0 compter du 2 d\u00e9cembre 1996.\n[228] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le plaignant est entr\u00e9 au travail comme installateur-r\u00e9parateur \u00e0 Val-d'Or le 2 d\u00e9cembre 1996. Son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat \u00e9tait Alain Rivard et en l'absence de ce dernier, Claude Mayrand. Son retour au travail \u00e9tait progressif, soit deux jours cons\u00e9cutifs au cours de cette semaine. On lui confie un travail de transfert de lignes \u00e0 Senneterre puis il est assign\u00e9 chez T\u00e9l\u00e9bec Mobilit\u00e9 pour aider un installateur-r\u00e9parateur \u00e0 l'installation d'un syst\u00e8me t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique 032.\n[229] La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu'au cours de la semaine du 9 d\u00e9cembre 1996 le plaignant devait travailler trois jours non cons\u00e9cutifs mais qu'il a travaill\u00e9 seulement deux jours. Il s'est vu confier, par son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat Alain Rivard, le mandat de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'installation d'un syst\u00e8me t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique Norstar \u00e0 la Brasserie La P\u00e9pie. Pendant que le plaignant proc\u00e9dait \u00e0 l'installation de ce syst\u00e8me, Alain Rivard s'est rendu sur les lieux pour apprendre de la cliente que le plaignant \u00e9prouvait des difficult\u00e9s avec la programmation, qu'il lui avait mentionn\u00e9 que ce n'\u00e9tait pas son domaine. Elle craignait que l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier pr\u00e9vu pour l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux ne soit pas rencontr\u00e9.\n[230] La preuve a \u00e9tabli de fa\u00e7on non contredite que Alain Rivard a rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant pour discuter de la situation et que ce dernier lui a fait part qu'il ne voulait pas accomplir le travail d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur car il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait le travail d'\u00e9pisseur. Devant ces faits, Alain Rivard a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de confier au plaignant un travail moins astreignant. Il fut assign\u00e9 en compagnie de deux employ\u00e9s, installateurs-r\u00e9parateurs, dont un repr\u00e9sentant syndical, chez Aub\u00e9 Pontiac Buick.\n[231] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que lors de cette rencontre le plaignant a inform\u00e9 Alain Rivard de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Alain Rivard a soulign\u00e9 au plaignant que rien ne lui indiquait de restriction quant \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de faire le travail exig\u00e9 et qu'il devait s'y soumettre.\n[232] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que, pour faciliter la t\u00e2che au plaignant, Alain Rivard lui a confi\u00e9 un travail en compagnie de deux installateurs-r\u00e9parateurs pour refaire certains filages avec cache-fils chez Val-d'Or Performance. Une fois de plus, Alain Rivard a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que la qualit\u00e9 du travail du plaignant laissait \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer.\n[233] La preuve a \u00e9tabli que le plaignant a travaill\u00e9 les 16, 18 et 20 d\u00e9cembre 1996. Au cours de la semaine du 16 d\u00e9cembre 1996, le plaignant a demand\u00e9 la permission de s'absenter du travail les 23 et 24 d\u00e9cembre 1996, permission qui ne lui fut point accord\u00e9e, les besoins de personnel ne le permettaient pas \u00e0 la veille de la p\u00e9riode des F\u00eates.\n[234] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le 20 d\u00e9cembre 1996, en fin de journ\u00e9e, le plaignant se sentait \u00e0 bout et au bord des larmes. Il a inform\u00e9 la secr\u00e9taire qu'il quittait le travail. Au cours de la fin de semaine, il a festoy\u00e9, de sorte qu'il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de se pr\u00e9senter au travail les 23 et 24 d\u00e9cembre 1996 en raison d'une gastro-ent\u00e9rite.\n[235] La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que le plaignant s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au travail le 6 janvier 1997. Alain Rivard, toujours dans le but d'aider le plaignant, lui a confi\u00e9 un travail de pr\u00e9filage dans un \u00e9difice gouvernemental sur un quart de travail de 16 h 00 \u00e0 minuit.\n[236] La preuve a \u00e9tabli que le 7 janvier 1997 le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 convoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 une rencontre avec ses sup\u00e9rieurs imm\u00e9diats, Claude Mayrand et Alain Rivard. Il lui fut reproch\u00e9 d'avoir quitt\u00e9 le travail le 20 d\u00e9cembre 1996 sans avoir averti son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat. Il lui fut \u00e9galement reproch\u00e9 de s'\u00eatre absent\u00e9 du travail le 23 d\u00e9cembre 1996 en invoquant la prise de cong\u00e9 annuel non autoris\u00e9e alors qu'il \u00e9tait absent pour cause de maladie. Il lui fut \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 que malgr\u00e9 le fait qu'on lui ait confi\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches relativement faciles sa productivit\u00e9 laissait quand m\u00eame \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer.\n[237] La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu'au cours de la semaine du 6 janvier 1997 la qualit\u00e9 du travail de pr\u00e9filage r\u00e9alis\u00e9 \u00e9tait toujours irr\u00e9prochable mais que la productivit\u00e9 \u00e9tait toujours d\u00e9faillante.\n[238] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le 8 janvier 1997 Alain Rivard, accompagn\u00e9 de Claude Mayrand, a rencontr\u00e9 le directeur Serge Faubert pour lui faire part de ses inqui\u00e9tudes \u00e0 l'endroit du plaignant. Apr\u00e8s une analyse compl\u00e8te de la situation, Alain Rivard est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que le plaignant ne pouvait remplir les t\u00e2ches d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur.\n[239] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le plaignant, apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu, suite \u00e0 un affichage, le poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait d'une p\u00e9riode d'essai en vertu de la clause 13.10 de la convention collective qui pr\u00e9voit que si un salari\u00e9 n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 sa capacit\u00e9 de remplir sa nouvelle t\u00e2che conform\u00e9ment aux normes de la compagnie dans les 120 jours qui suivent sa promotion ou sa mutation, il devra retourner \u00e0 son poste et localit\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurs... Au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, l'employeur pouvait mettre fin \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode d'essai s'il arrivait \u00e0 la conclusion que l'employ\u00e9 ne pouvait r\u00e9pondre aux exigences normales de la t\u00e2che.\n[240] La preuve a \u00e9tabli que le 10 janvier 1997, l'intim\u00e9e a inform\u00e9 le plaignant qu'il serait en mise \u00e0 pied \u00e0 compter du 24 janvier 1997 au motif qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de d\u00e9montrer, depuis son arriv\u00e9e au poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur, la capacit\u00e9 de remplir ses nouvelles t\u00e2ches conform\u00e9ment aux normes demand\u00e9es et exig\u00e9es. Le plaignant retournait sur une liste de rappel comme \u00e9pisseur avec droit de rappel pour une p\u00e9riode de 24 mois.\n[241] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le plaignant a contest\u00e9 sa mise \u00e0 pied en d\u00e9posant un grief qui fut retir\u00e9 par la suite \u00e0 l'initiative de l'Union des Routiers. Suite au d\u00e9p\u00f4t, le comit\u00e9 de grief s'est r\u00e9uni et un proc\u00e8s-verbal des discussions a \u00e9t\u00e9 dress\u00e9 (Pi\u00e8ce P-65). Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour l'obtention du poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur non pas par int\u00e9r\u00eat pour cet emploi mais uniquement pour obtenir du travail.\n[242] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le plaignant a rencontr\u00e9 le Dr Cond\u00e9 le 17 d\u00e9cembre 1996 pour un examen de contr\u00f4le. Il a inform\u00e9 ce dernier que physiquement il se sent pr\u00eat \u00e0 augmenter son temps de travail et sa performance. Il d\u00e9clare avoir un bon moral, sans sympt\u00f4me d\u00e9pressif, sans pleurs, ni tristesse. Le Dr Cond\u00e9 est d'avis que l'\u00e9tat du plaignant s'est encore am\u00e9lior\u00e9 et qu'il ne pr\u00e9sente aucun sympt\u00f4me d\u00e9pressif. \u00c0 sa demande, le Dr Cond\u00e9 a vu le plaignant le 14 janvier 1997 lequel lui apprend qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied en raison de son manque d'exp\u00e9rience et de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 faire le travail. Le Dr Cond\u00e9 note que le plaignant accepte la situation avec calme et qu'il a peu pleur\u00e9. Il \u00e9met un diagnostic \u00e0 l'effet que la d\u00e9pression subie par le plaignant est gu\u00e9rie.\n[243] Lors de son retour au travail le 2 d\u00e9cembre 1996, le plaignant jouissait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d'une exp\u00e9rience acquise ant\u00e9rieurement au poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur. Pour aider le plaignant \u00e0 se familiariser \u00e0 son nouveau poste, l'intim\u00e9e lui a confi\u00e9 un travail peu compliqu\u00e9 d'installation d'un syst\u00e8me t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pour le secteur affaires. Le travail n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le temps normalement pr\u00e9vu pour l'ex\u00e9cution de ce genre de travail. Le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de r\u00e9aliser la programmation et le contact avec le client a comport\u00e9 des lacunes. L'intim\u00e9e a confi\u00e9 au plaignant divers travaux de base pour un installateur-r\u00e9parateur ax\u00e9s particuli\u00e8rement au pr\u00e9filage de c\u00e2bles et les standards de productivit\u00e9 n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rencontr\u00e9s. Malgr\u00e9 la simplicit\u00e9 du travail confi\u00e9, la productivit\u00e9 du plaignant ne s'est pas am\u00e9lior\u00e9e.\n[244] L'obligation premi\u00e8re du plaignant \u00e9tait de fournir, m\u00eame \u00e0 temps partiel, une prestation de travail satisfaisante pour l'intim\u00e9e. Il m'appara\u00eet que, malgr\u00e9 le fait que l'intim\u00e9e lui ait confi\u00e9 un travail exigeant l'ex\u00e9cution de t\u00e2ches de base pour un installateur-r\u00e9parateur, le plaignant, qui avait postul\u00e9 sur ce poste pour jouir d'un emploi stable et qui n'aimait pas, de son propre aveu, ce genre de travail, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de d\u00e9montrer qu'il pouvait accomplir les t\u00e2ches d'un installateur-r\u00e9parateur. L'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e de mettre fin \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode d'essai du plaignant au poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur et de le placer sur la liste de rappel \u00e0 son poste d'\u00e9pisseur.\n[245] De plus, j'estime que la d\u00e9ficience, soit l'\u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif du plaignant, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 l'un des facteurs qui ont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le d\u00e9terminant dans la prise de d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je retiens le t\u00e9moignage non contest\u00e9 du Dr Cond\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effet que le plaignant \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 reprendre le travail de fa\u00e7on progressive et sans aucune restriction. De plus, lors de la prise de d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e de mettre fin \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode d'essai du plaignant au poste d'installateur-r\u00e9parateur, ce dernier ne ressentait aucun sympt\u00f4me de d\u00e9pression et celle-ci \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement gu\u00e9rie. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'en arrive \u00e0 la conclusion, suite \u00e0 la preuve entendue sur cet aspect de l'affaire, que le plaignant n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied le 24 janvier 1997 en raison d'une d\u00e9ficience, soit la d\u00e9pression.\n(iii) Mises \u00e0 pied en 1997 [246] Le plaignant soutient qu'au cours de l'ann\u00e9e 1997 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 temporairement au travail et mis \u00e0 pied \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes reprises. Selon lui, l'intim\u00e9e souhaitait qu'il quitte son emploi et elle agissait de la sorte en sachant fort bien qu'il ne pouvait refuser un rappel au travail sous peine de perdre son emploi. De plus, lors de ses rappels au travail, le plaignant all\u00e8gue qu'on lui imposait des conditions de travail particuli\u00e8res et non conformes \u00e0 celles pr\u00e9vues dans la convention collective qui s'appliquait aux employ\u00e9s permanents. Ainsi, il estime avoir subi un traitement diff\u00e9rent de celui des employ\u00e9s permanents.\n[247] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 la fin de 1995 l'intim\u00e9e a d\u00fb proc\u00e9der \u00e0 de nombreuses mises \u00e0 pied. Un certain nombre d'employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9s sur une liste de rappel pour une p\u00e9riode de 24 mois suite \u00e0 la date effective de leur mise \u00e0 pied. Dans le but de diminuer ses co\u00fbts d'op\u00e9ration l'intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire appel \u00e0 la sous-traitance. Face \u00e0 cette situation, l'Union des Routiers a convenu avec l'intim\u00e9e, par lettres d'entente, de conditions particuli\u00e8res de travail pour les employ\u00e9s en mise \u00e0 pied afin de lui permettre de rappeler ces employ\u00e9s temporairement au travail pour diff\u00e9rents projets au lieu de recourir \u00e0 la sous-traitance.\n[248] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le plaignant et tous les employ\u00e9s sur la liste de rappel \u00e9taient vis\u00e9s par les conditions particuli\u00e8res de travail apparaissant aux diverses lettres d'entente.\n[249] La pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve est \u00e0 l'effet que l'employ\u00e9 sur la liste de rappel qui se d\u00e9clarait non disponible lors d'un rappel au travail ne perdait pas son emploi et qu'il demeurait sur la liste de rappel.\n[250] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9, de l'aveu m\u00eame du plaignant, que lors de chacun de ses rappels au travail, il a accept\u00e9 les conditions particuli\u00e8res d'emploi qui s'y rattachaient et qu'il n'a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aucun grief.\n[251] La preuve a \u00e9tabli que, lors du rappel au travail du plaignant au poste d'\u00e9pisseur, l'intim\u00e9e n'a fait que respecter les dispositions de la convention collective relatives au rappel au travail des employ\u00e9s en mise \u00e0 pied en fonction de leur anciennet\u00e9 et dans la mesure de leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter le travail requis.\n[252] Suite \u00e0 la preuve soumise, je ne suis pas convaincu qu'\u00e0 l'occasion des mises \u00e0 pied et rappels au travail du plaignant pour des emplois temporaires, l'intim\u00e9e ait voulu inciter ce dernier \u00e0 quitter son emploi. Au contraire, l'intim\u00e9e a rappel\u00e9 le plaignant au travail en respectant les dispositions de la convention collective traitant du rappel au travail des employ\u00e9s en mise \u00e0 pied. Si elle avait agi autrement, elle aurait brim\u00e9 les droits du plaignant. De plus, comme les conditions particuli\u00e8res de travail visaient tous les employ\u00e9s sur la liste de rappel il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'un traitement diff\u00e9rent puisqu'il \u00e9tait parmi les employ\u00e9s plac\u00e9s sur cette liste de rappel.\n(iv) Mise \u00e0 pied du 24 d\u00e9cembre 1997 [253] Le plaignant a soulev\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de le mettre \u00e0 pied le 24 d\u00e9cembre 1997 en raison de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, soit une d\u00e9pression.\n[254] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le plaignant a accept\u00e9 un rappel temporaire au travail du poste d'\u00e9pisseur \u00e0 Chibougamau \u00e0 compter du 20 octobre 1997 pour une p\u00e9riode de quatre \u00e0 six semaines.\n[255] Le plaignant a soutenu qu'\u00e0 la fin du mois de novembre 1997 son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat l'a inform\u00e9 que la dur\u00e9e de son emploi \u00e9tait prolong\u00e9e pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Par contre, le sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat du plaignant a affirm\u00e9 qu'il avait plut\u00f4t avis\u00e9 le plaignant que son emploi se terminerait le 24 d\u00e9cembre 1997.\n[256] La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu'au d\u00e9but de d\u00e9cembre 1997 le plaignant a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 ressentir les sympt\u00f4mes d'une d\u00e9pression. Il a consult\u00e9 un m\u00e9decin \u00e0 Chibougamau qui lui a prescrit du Paxil. Il a d\u00fb \u00eatre hospitalis\u00e9 \u00e0 Chibougamau les 9, 10 et 11 d\u00e9cembre 1997 en raison d'une mauvaise r\u00e9action aux m\u00e9dicaments et, le 11 d\u00e9cembre 1997, il a rencontr\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau ce m\u00e9decin \u00e0 Chibougamau lequel a \u00e9mis un certificat m\u00e9dical avec un diagnostic de d\u00e9pression. Lors de son hospitalisation, le plaignant a avis\u00e9 son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat, sans lui pr\u00e9ciser la cause de son hospitalisation.\n[257] Le sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat du plaignant a communiqu\u00e9 avec le d\u00e9partement des relations industrielles pour conna\u00eetre la marche \u00e0 suivre \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l'emploi du plaignant se terminait le 24 d\u00e9cembre 1997. Il a transmis un m\u00e9mo \u00e0 ce d\u00e9partement indiquant qu'il avait inform\u00e9 le plaignant de sa mise \u00e0 pied effective le 24 d\u00e9cembre 1997. Un avis de mise \u00e0 pied \u00e0 l'endroit du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le 10 d\u00e9cembre 1997 et remis \u00e0 ce dernier le m\u00eame jour \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital de Chibougamau par Alain Rivard.\n[258] La preuve soumise sur ce point m'am\u00e8ne \u00e0 conclure que l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du plaignant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur d\u00e9terminant dans la prise de d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e de mettre fin \u00e0 l'emploi du plaignant \u00e0 compter du 24 d\u00e9cembre 1997. Je retiens la version du superviseur imm\u00e9diat du plaignant plut\u00f4t que celle du plaignant \u00e0 l'effet que sa mise \u00e0 pied \u00e9tait effective le 24 d\u00e9cembre 1997. De plus, il est \u00e9vident qu'au moment o\u00f9 l'intim\u00e9e a avis\u00e9 le plaignant de sa mise \u00e0 pied, soit le 10 d\u00e9cembre 1997, elle n'avait aucune connaissance de l'\u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif du plaignant.\nB. Le plaignant a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de la part des intim\u00e9s de harc\u00e8lement en cours d'emploi en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience (d\u00e9pression) ? [259] En vertu de l'article 14 (1) (c) de la Loi, le fait de harceler un individu en cours d'emploi constitue un acte discriminatoire s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. Selon les dispositions de l'article 3 (1) de la Loi, la d\u00e9ficience est un motif de distinction illicite.\n[260] La Commission des droits de la personne du Qu\u00e9bec a d\u00e9fini comme suit le harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail :\n\u00ab Il s'agit d'une conduite se manifestant, entre autres, par des paroles, des actes ou des gestes r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s, \u00e0 caract\u00e8re vexatoire ou m\u00e9prisant, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une personne ou d'un groupe de personnes en raison de l'un ou l'autre des motifs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 10 de la Charte. Il peut s'agir de harc\u00e8lement d'une personne en raison de sa race, son sexe, son orientation sexuelles, sa religion, son handicap, etc. \u00bb 2\n[261] Le Tribunal doit \u00e9valuer la gravit\u00e9 d'une conduite importune. Dans l'affaire Dhanjal, le Tribunal pr\u00e9cise que :\n\u00ab La gravit\u00e9 d'un comportement pr\u00e9tendument harcelant doit \u00eatre appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e non pas selon le crit\u00e8re et la perspective de la < personne raisonnable >, qui serait forc\u00e9ment une personne faisant partie de la majorit\u00e9 raciale, mais plut\u00f4t le crit\u00e8re et la perspective de la victime raisonnable \u00bb.\n[262] Le Tribunal ajoute :\n\u00ab Par ailleurs, si le crit\u00e8re subjectif de la perception du plaignant, selon sa personnalit\u00e9 et sa sensibilit\u00e9 propres, est pertinent et n\u00e9cessaire, c'est uniquement \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de l'\u00e9valuation du pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la victime et des dommages qui en r\u00e9sultent. \u00bb (3)\n[263] Le Tribunal doit \u00e9galement \u00e9valuer le caract\u00e8re r\u00e9p\u00e9titif d'une conduite importune. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, dans Commission Scolaire des Deux-Montagnes, le Tribunal dit :\n\u00ab La durabilit\u00e9 qu'une conduite vexatoire doit \u00e9galement comporter pour constituer du harc\u00e8lement peut donc tant\u00f4t \u00eatre \u00e9tablie par la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de certains actes, tant\u00f4t par leur gravit\u00e9, dans la mesure o\u00f9 leurs effets ont alors un caract\u00e8re de continuit\u00e9. \u00bb4)\n[264] Le plaignant s'est absent\u00e9 du travail le 10 ao\u00fbt 1996 pour cause de maladie. Dans la semaine qui a suivi, il a re\u00e7u \u00e0 son domicile la visite d'un repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9e, Claude Mayrand, pour lui remettre le formulaire m\u00e9dical qu'il devait faire remplir par son m\u00e9decin traitant. La position du plaignant est \u00e0 l'effet que l'objectif r\u00e9ellement recherch\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait, lors de cette visite, de s'assurer qu'il \u00e9tait vraiment malade, ce qu'il qualifie de harc\u00e8lement.\n[265] Je ne puis accepter la position du plaignant. En effet, tout employ\u00e9 qui s'absente du travail pour maladie d'une dur\u00e9e pr\u00e9visible de huit jours ou plus doit, par un formulaire m\u00e9dical rempli par son m\u00e9decin traitant, informer son employeur de la nature de la maladie qui l'afflige et de la dur\u00e9e de son absence du travail. Je ne crois pas qu'une victime raisonnable ait conclu que le geste pos\u00e9 par le repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9e s'apparente \u00e0 du harc\u00e8lement.\n[266] Le plaignant propose que les passages r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s, devant son domicile entre le 10 ao\u00fbt 1996 et le 2 d\u00e9cembre 1996, du repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9e au volant de son v\u00e9hicule pour rendre visite \u00e0 son p\u00e8re et sa sur constituaient du harc\u00e8lement. Je ne crois pas que les agissements du repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9e, m\u00eame s'ils \u00e9taient r\u00e9p\u00e9titifs, puissent constituer des agissements vexatoires et m\u00e9prisants permettant \u00e0 une victime raisonnable de conclure qu'elle est harcel\u00e9e.\n[267] Plus particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l'endroit de Alain Rivard, le plaignant a soutenu que ce dernier a pos\u00e9 un acte de harc\u00e8lement \u00e0 son endroit en \u00e9crivant de fausses lettres de r\u00e9primandes qu'il pla\u00e7ait dans son dossier et \u00e0 son insu. \u00c0 l'appui de cette all\u00e9gation, le seul document produit fut un m\u00e9mo transmis par Claude Mayrand \u00e0 Alain Rivard dans lequel il relate les circonstances du d\u00e9part du travail le 20 d\u00e9cembre 1996 et l'absence du travail du plaignant le 23 d\u00e9cembre 1996. Il a toutefois admis n'avoir jamais re\u00e7u officiellement de r\u00e9primande \u00e9crite de la part des intim\u00e9s. J'en conclus que cette all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement est manifestement mal fond\u00e9e.\n[268] Le plaignant a soutenu \u00e9galement qu'au cours de sa p\u00e9riode d'emploi \u00e0 temps partiel entre le 2 d\u00e9cembre 1996 et le 24 janvier 1997, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement, en raison de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, de la part de Claude Mayrand et Alain Rivard. Ce harc\u00e8lement s'est manifest\u00e9 lors de fr\u00e9quentes rencontres avec les deux repr\u00e9sentants de l'intim\u00e9e par des engueulades injustifi\u00e9es visant \u00e0 l'\u00e9craser et l'humilier. La pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que lors de ces rencontres les deux repr\u00e9sentants de l'intim\u00e9e ont certes avis\u00e9 le plaignant, comme ils se devaient de le faire, qu'ils n'\u00e9taient pas satisfaits de la fa\u00e7on dont il s'\u00e9tait comport\u00e9 les 20 et 23 d\u00e9cembre 1996. De plus, au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, suivant le t\u00e9moignage non contredit du Dr Cond\u00e9 et auquel j'accorde une compl\u00e8te cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, la d\u00e9pression subie par le plaignant \u00e9tait pratiquement gu\u00e9rie de sorte qu'il ne souffrait d'aucune d\u00e9ficience.\n[269] La pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve est aussi \u00e0 l'effet que les rencontres en question ne se sont pas termin\u00e9es par des pleurs du plaignant comme il l'a affirm\u00e9. Si tel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas, il en aurait s\u00fbrement fait part lors de ses rencontres du 17 d\u00e9cembre 1996 et du 14 janvier 1997 avec le Dr Cond\u00e9. Au contraire, le plaignant lui affirme, le 17 d\u00e9cembre 1996, qu'il a un excellent moral, sans pleurs, ni tristesse et, lors de la visite du 14 janvier 1997, il confie au Dr Cond\u00e9 avoir accept\u00e9 l'annonce de sa mise \u00e0 pied avec calme et n'avoir que peu pleur\u00e9.\n[270] J'en tire donc la conclusion que les propos \u00e9chang\u00e9s par Claude Mayrand et Alain Rivard avec le plaignant au cours de la p\u00e9riode du 2 d\u00e9cembre 1996 au 24 janvier 1997 ne constituaient pas du harc\u00e8lement \u00e0 l'endroit du plaignant en raison d'une d\u00e9ficience.\nVI. CONCLUSION [271] J'estime que le plaignant n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 relever le fardeau de faire la preuve prima facie que :\nT\u00e9l\u00e9bec Limit\u00e9e a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 son endroit en le traitant de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9favorable en emploi en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience contrairement \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\nT\u00e9l\u00e9bec Limit\u00e9e a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 son endroit en refusant de lui offrir un milieu de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, contrairement \u00e0 l'article 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\nAlain Rivard a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 son endroit en le harcelant en cours d'emploi en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, contrairement \u00e0 l'article 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\nEN CONS\u00c9QUENCE :\nLes plaintes sont rejet\u00e9es.\nSign\u00e9e par\nRoger Doyon\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 21 mai 2004\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIERS DU TRIBUNAL :\nT741\/4602 et T742\/4702\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nPierre Bergeron c.

INTRODUCTION [1] Le SCEP invoque un privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de deux documents.\n[2] Le Document 1 compte sept pages (pages 1 \u00e0 6 et page 8). Ce document est intitul\u00e9 Discussion Elizabeth Millar, May 25 and 28th. Les pages 5 et 6 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites et d\u00e9pos\u00e9es \u00e0 titre de pi\u00e8ce R-269. La pi\u00e8ce R-270 est probablement la page 7 du Document 1, mais ce n'est pas s\u00fbr. Le SCEP n'a pas produit les pages 1, 2, 3, 4 et 8 du Document 1, invoquant un privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige.\n[3] Le Document 2 (document 382 de la divulgation du SCEP) est l'ordre du jour d'une r\u00e9union du 27 ao\u00fbt. Au recto de la page 1 figurent des notes manuscrites r\u00e9dig\u00e9es, pr\u00e9sume-t-on, par Fred Pomeroy. Ces notes empi\u00e8tent sur le verso de la page 1 ([TRADUCTION] Suite au verso). Le Document 2 a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit \u00e0 Bell, \u00e0 l'exception du verso de la page 1. Le SCEP invoque un privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des notes qui empi\u00e8tent sur le verso.\nII. LE DROIT [4] Pour qu'il soit fait droit \u00e0 la revendication de privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige du SCEP, celle-ci doit satisfaire aux crit\u00e8res suivants :\nla communication doit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 d'un litige; la communication doit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans le but principal d'obtenir des conseils juridiques ou de faciliter le d\u00e9roulement de l'instance; l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 d'un litige doit \u00eatre raisonnable.\nIII. D\u00c9CISION A. Document 1 [5] Les pages 5, 6 et 7 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites et d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en preuve. Mme Blackstaffe a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9e au sujet de ces pi\u00e8ces. La transcription r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'elle associe ces pages \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation de M. Ranger de l'\u00e9tude sur la parit\u00e9 salariale au Manitoba. La preuve d\u00e9montre maintenant que les pages 5, 6 et 7 ont trait, en fait, \u00e0 une discussion que Mme Elizabeth Millar et Mme Blackstaffe ont eue les 25 et 28 mai et qu'elles n'ont rien \u00e0 voir avec l'\u00e9valuation de M. Ranger de l'\u00e9tude concernant le Manitoba.\n[6] Il s'agit de d\u00e9terminer si le SCEP, en divulguant une partie du document, a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 toute revendication de privil\u00e8ge \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du reste. \u00c0 notre avis, et le droit abonde en ce sens, il peut y avoir renonciation, d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou non, si l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 l'exige. Le SCEP a divulgu\u00e9 une partie du Document 1. Bell a men\u00e9 son contre-interrogatoire en tenant pour acquis qu'il s'agissait du document int\u00e9gral. Ce n'est pas le cas et le contexte est incomplet. Bell ayant re\u00e7u une partie du document, l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 exige qu'elle l'obtienne dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9.\n[7] De plus, le Document 1 exprime les opinions de Mme Millar au sujet de la parit\u00e9 salariale, de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois, des points, de l'utilisation de l'\u00e9tude du Manitoba et du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de plaintes. Il ne semble pas que le document ait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans le but principal d'obtenir des conseils juridiques ou de faciliter le d\u00e9roulement de l'instance. Ni la preuve ni les arguments du SCEP nous convainquent que le document a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 d'un litige.\nB. Document 2 [8] En ce qui concerne le Document 2, le Tribunal conclut \u00e9galement que la revendication de privil\u00e8ge du SCEP n'est pas fond\u00e9e. Il ne satisfait pas aux crit\u00e8res qui s'appliquent \u00e0 une telle revendication.\n[9] Les notes manuscrites sont des notes ou des observations personnelles r\u00e9dig\u00e9es par Fred Pomeroy, pr\u00e9sume-t-on. Nous ne sommes pas convaincus que ces notes constituent une communication de M. Pomeroy ou soient le r\u00e9sultat d'une communication qu'il a re\u00e7ue en vue d'obtenir des conseils juridiques ou de faciliter le d\u00e9roulement de l'instance.\n[10] Par cons\u00e9quent, le SCEP doit produire \u00e0 Bell les pages litigieuses du Document 1 et du Document 2.\nSign\u00e9 par\nJ.

INTRODUCTION [1] Marc Genest \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'emploi de Bell Mobilit\u00e9 lorsqu'en juin 1995 est entr\u00e9 en vigueur un nouveau r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective pour les employ\u00e9s. Le plaignant, homosexuel, pr\u00e9tend que l'intim\u00e9e lui a refus\u00e9 le droit de souscrire une assurance sur la vie de son conjoint de m\u00eame sexe. Marc Genest estime que Bell Mobilit\u00e9 a ainsi pos\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit un acte discriminatoire en le traitant de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9favorable en emploi \u00e0 cause de son orientation sexuelle (homosexuel) et de son \u00e9tat matrimonial (concubinage homosexuel) contrairement \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi ).\nII. LA PREUVE A. Preuve du plaignant (i) Marc Genest [2] Marc Genest a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 chez Bell Mobilit\u00e9 en mars 1994 avec un statut d'employ\u00e9 temporaire \u00e0 temps plein. Il occupait son emploi au 1425, route Transcanadienne, Dorval. Il a acquis le statut d'employ\u00e9 permanent \u00e0 temps partiel le 28 juin 1995.\n[3] Il faisait partie d'un groupe d'une trentaine d'employ\u00e9s assign\u00e9s comme repr\u00e9sentants au service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le sous la supervision de Karine Mariasine. Le d\u00e9partement du service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le occupait une partie d'un \u00e9tage de l'immeuble divis\u00e9e en postes de travail \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de petits cubicules. Une autre partie de l'\u00e9tage \u00e9tait occup\u00e9e par une dizaine d'employ\u00e9s affect\u00e9s au service de la perception. Les cadres occupaient des bureaux \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 des aires de travail des employ\u00e9s. Le rez-de-chauss\u00e9e \u00e9tait occup\u00e9 par le service des ressources humaines et celui de l'administration. Environ 80 personnes \u00e9taient \u00e0 l'emploi de Bell Mobilit\u00e9 dans cet \u00e9difice dont une trentaine avait divulgu\u00e9 leur orientation sexuelle mais c'\u00e9tait un sujet dont il ne fallait pas parler. Il n'a donc pas divulgu\u00e9 son orientation si ce n'est qu'\u00e0 une seule reprise lors d'une circonstance tr\u00e8s particuli\u00e8re. En avril 1994, il \u00e9tait en p\u00e9riode de formation pendant un mois sous la gouverne d'une formatrice. Il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s perturb\u00e9 suite \u00e0 un accident d'automobile subi par son conjoint et il s'\u00e9tait confi\u00e9 \u00e0 cette formatrice.\n[4] Marc Genest raconte qu'en 1995 il entretenait depuis pr\u00e8s de huit ans une relation avec un conjoint de m\u00eame sexe.\n[5] Apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu sa permanence en juin 1995, il a re\u00e7u de son employeur une brochure contenant les informations relatives au r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective pour les employ\u00e9s de Bell Mobilit\u00e9 avec instructions de faire conna\u00eetre ses choix d'assurance en remplissant un formulaire de choix d'options d'assurance attach\u00e9 \u00e0 la brochure et d'acheminer le tout, par courrier interne, au service des ressources humaines. Il d\u00e9clare ne pas se souvenir que des sessions d'information ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es aux employ\u00e9s pour leur expliquer le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective.\n[6] Apr\u00e8s analyse de cette brochure, Marc Genest a compris qu'elle ne fournissait pas d'information sur la possibilit\u00e9 de souscrire une assurance-vie pour un conjoint de m\u00eame sexe.\n[7] Par cons\u00e9quent, il a pris un rendez-vous avec Lucie Laroche au service des ressources humaines afin d'obtenir de plus amples informations et compl\u00e9ter le formulaire de choix d'options d'assurance (Pi\u00e8ce P-4) en s'assurant que ses choix soient bien \u00e9clair\u00e9s. Cette rencontre s'est tenue au bureau de Lucie Laroche vers 11 h 00 le 28 ao\u00fbt 1995.\n[8] Le t\u00e9moin raconte qu'il a fait part \u00e0 Lucie Laroche qu'il avait un conjoint de m\u00eame sexe et qu'il ne comprenait pas pour quelle raison le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective permettait \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 d'assurer son conjoint de m\u00eame sexe pour d\u00e9c\u00e8s et mutilation accidentels et qu'il ne pouvait pas le faire en assurance-vie. \u00c0 la demande du t\u00e9moin, Lucie Laroche lui a dit qu'elle vivait avec un conjoint depuis quatre ans. Il lui a r\u00e9torqu\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait invraisemblable qu'apr\u00e8s seulement quatre ans de vie commune avec son conjoint elle puisse souscrire une assurance sur sa vie alors que lui, malgr\u00e9 plus de sept ans de vie commune avec son conjoint ne pouvait pas le faire. Lucie Laroche \u00e9tait bien attentive \u00e0 ses arguments, mais elle lui a dit qu'il ne pouvait obtenir l'assurance-vie pour son conjoint parce qu'il vivait avec un conjoint de m\u00eame sexe.\n[9] Il se souvient que Lucie Laroche lui a dit qu'il pouvait faire part de ses dol\u00e9ances \u00e0 sa superviseure Karine Mariasine. Elle lui a dit qu'il n'y avait rien \u00e0 faire pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la situation et d'en parler \u00e0 Sylvie Sauv\u00e9 \u00e9galement superviseure. Cette derni\u00e8re lui a dit qu'elle ne vivait pas le m\u00eame probl\u00e8me que lui puisque, dans son cas, son amie \u00e9tait \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'emploi de Bell Mobilit\u00e9, ce qui lui permettait d'\u00eatre b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de l'assurance-vie de son conjoint et vice versa. Marc Genest a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 qu'il ne pouvait se pr\u00e9valoir des m\u00eames pr\u00e9rogatives que sa superviseure parce que son conjoint n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 l'emploi de Bell Mobilit\u00e9. M\u00eame s'il estimait \u00eatre d\u00e9favoris\u00e9, il a cess\u00e9 de poursuivre ses d\u00e9marches de peur de perdre son emploi car il venait \u00e0 peine d'obtenir sa permanence.\n[10] Marc Genest a expliqu\u00e9 les choix qu'il avait faits au moment o\u00f9 il a rempli son formulaire du choix d'options (Pi\u00e8ce P-4). Une partie des options choisies \u00e9tait pay\u00e9e par l'employeur et l'autre partie par lui-m\u00eame. Il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'adh\u00e9rer au r\u00e9gime d'assurance-maladie pour lui seul car il ne voyait pas la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'en faire b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier \u00e9galement son conjoint qui ne jouissait pas des privil\u00e8ges d'une assurance collective.\n[11] Le plaignant a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9valoir du r\u00e9gime d'assurance dentaire, tant pour lui-m\u00eame que pour son conjoint. Il a opt\u00e9 pour le r\u00e9gime d'assurance sur sa vie dont le montant repr\u00e9sentait le double de son salaire annuel. Il reconna\u00eet avoir d\u00e9sign\u00e9 sa m\u00e8re comme b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de cette assurance. Le plaignant a choisi le r\u00e9gime d'assurance-d\u00e9c\u00e8s et mutilation accidentels (ADMA) pour lui-m\u00eame \u00e0 raison de cinq fois son salaire annuel. Comme son conjoint avait subi un grave accident d'automobile sans blessure en 1994 et que son travail de courtier en immeuble exigeait une utilisation constante de son v\u00e9hicule-automobile, le plaignant a opt\u00e9 l'ADMA pour son conjoint et ceci pour un montant de 200 000 $. Il croyait qu'avec ce montant d'assurance il pourrait, en cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s accidentel de son conjoint, \u00eatre en mesure d'en assumer les cons\u00e9quences financi\u00e8res sans difficult\u00e9. Enfin, le plaignant a souscrit au r\u00e9gime d'assurance-invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme. Cette option n'\u00e9tait pas accessible \u00e0 son conjoint.\n[12] Marc Genest a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 son conjoint sur ce formulaire comme personne \u00e0 charge. Une fois le formulaire de choix d'options compl\u00e9t\u00e9, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 achemin\u00e9 par courrier interne au d\u00e9partement des ressources humaines qui a transmis au plaignant un relev\u00e9 de confirmation (Pi\u00e8ce P-6) d\u00e9montrant que son r\u00e9gime d'assurance \u00e9tait conforme aux options qu'il avait exerc\u00e9es et ce, pour la p\u00e9riode du 29 juin 1995 au 31 mai 1996. Le t\u00e9moin d\u00e9clare ne pas se souvenir d'avoir renouvel\u00e9 ses b\u00e9n\u00e9fices d'assurance en 1996 et 1997 car ses choix d'options d'assurance demeuraient les m\u00eames.\n[13] Le t\u00e9moin relate qu'\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque son conjoint d\u00e9tenait une assurance-vie au montant de 50 000 $ dont il \u00e9tait le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Il souhaitait souscrire une assurance sur la vie de son conjoint au montant maximum pr\u00e9vu par le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective afin d'assurer sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ce dernier.\n[14] Marc Genest raconte qu'en 1997 son conjoint, \u00e0 l'emploi de Royal Lepage comme courtier en immeuble, a perdu son statut de salari\u00e9 pour devenir travailleur autonome. Au moment de l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du paiement de la prime d'assurance sur sa vie au montant de 800 $ son conjoint ne pouvait rencontrer cette obligation. Le p\u00e8re de son conjoint, moyennant qu'il devienne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de cette police, a accept\u00e9 d'acquitter la prime. Le p\u00e8re de son conjoint est devenu b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la police.\n[15] Le t\u00e9moin raconte que le p\u00e8re de son conjoint, de nationalit\u00e9 \u00e9gyptienne, n'a jamais accept\u00e9 que son fils soit homosexuel.\n[16] Le t\u00e9moin affirme qu'entre le 28 ao\u00fbt 1995, date o\u00f9 il a rencontr\u00e9 Lucie Laroche, et le 15 juin 1998, l'employeur n'a fourni \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s aucune information relative au r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective, ni aucune session d'information pour expliquer les modifications qui auraient pu \u00eatre apport\u00e9es au r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, le plaignant admet qu'au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, il n'a eu aucune discussion avec Lucie Laroche pour traiter de sa situation.\n[17] Marc Genest se souvient que le 15 juin 1998 Lucie Laroche a tenu une session d'information pour expliquer aux employ\u00e9s les modifications apport\u00e9es au r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que maintenant le conjoint homosexuel \u00e9tait \u00e9ligible \u00e0 toutes les options d'assurance pr\u00e9vues au r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective. Le plaignant est intervenu publiquement en disant : Qu'est-ce qui arrive avec moi maintenant que mon conjoint est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 ? (Volume 1, page 127). Lucie Laroche lui a r\u00e9pondu de se consoler en pensant que sa lutte aura b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 aux autres employ\u00e9s dans la m\u00eame situation.\n[18] Suite au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son conjoint, le 16 f\u00e9vrier 1998, il en a fait part \u00e0 Lucie Laroche. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s surpris qu'elle lui mentionne sur le champ que son conjoint n'avait aucune couverture d'assurance sur la vie. Puis, elle l'a inform\u00e9 qu'il b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait d'un cong\u00e9 de deuil de trois jours.\n[19] Marc Genest a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 consulter le contrat d'assurance collective avec Aetna Canada (1995) pour les employ\u00e9s de Bell Mobilit\u00e9 (Pi\u00e8ce P-2) et un extrait de ce m\u00eame contrat (Pi\u00e8ce P- 3) et il d\u00e9clare ne les avoir jamais vus auparavant.\n[20] Le t\u00e9moin a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 par le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son conjoint et il \u00e9prouvait beaucoup de difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 faire son travail; il sentait un pressant besoin d'aide psychologique. Il a demand\u00e9 au d\u00e9partement des ressources humaines de lui fournir les services d'un psychologue et ce, par le biais du programme d'aide aux employ\u00e9s (PAE) mis sur pied par l'entreprise et auquel les employ\u00e9s contribuaient financi\u00e8rement. Ce n'est qu'un an plus tard qu'il a pu rencontrer un psychologue qui ne lui a apport\u00e9 aucune aide.\n[21] Marc Genest raconte que suite au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son conjoint il a multipli\u00e9 les demandes, \u00e0 compter de mars ou avril 1998, aupr\u00e8s d'Angella Santullo du service des ressources humaines afin d'obtenir une copie du contrat d'assurance collective. Elle lui disait ne pas d\u00e9tenir de copie de ce contrat. Puis, en septembre 2000, il s'est adress\u00e9 \u00e0 Julie Walbrecq du m\u00eame service mais sa d\u00e9marche a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 vaine. Le document recherch\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu dans le cadre de l'enqu\u00eate visant la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[22] Marc Genest \u00e9tait locataire avec son conjoint d'une maison \u00e0 l'\u00cele Perrot. Ils \u00e9taient copropri\u00e9taire d'un bateau \u00e0 voile. Le plaignant \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de son v\u00e9hicule et son conjoint disposait d'un v\u00e9hicule en location. Son conjoint r\u00e9alisait par son travail de courtier en immeuble un revenu annuel net d'environ 70 000 $. Toutefois, \u00e0 partir du mois de juillet 1997, le t\u00e9moin se souvient que son conjoint a ralenti son rythme de travail en raison de la fatigue et d'une baisse dans le march\u00e9 immobilier. Auparavant, le plaignant affirme que son conjoint jouissait d'une excellente sant\u00e9. Sans \u00eatre un grand sportif, il pratiquait la voile et allait danser trois fois par semaine. Il d\u00e9pensait beaucoup d'\u00e9nergie au travail. En septembre 1997, au retour d'un voyage en Floride, il a constat\u00e9 que son conjoint \u00e9tait encore affect\u00e9 par la fatigue. Il lui a conseill\u00e9 de voir le m\u00e9decin mais il ne l'a pas fait. Il ne travaillait plus et son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 se d\u00e9gradait ; son \u00e9tat de faiblesse a n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 l'hospitalisation le 27 octobre 1997 \u00e0 l'H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al. Suite \u00e0 de nombreux examens, son conjoint a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 s\u00e9ropositif. Il a pu quitter l'h\u00f4pital pour la p\u00e9riode des F\u00eates et, par la suite, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis dans un centre d'h\u00e9bergement et il est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 16 f\u00e9vrier 1998.\n[23] Marc Genest r\u00e9v\u00e8le que pendant la maladie de son conjoint il a d\u00fb assumer seul toutes les d\u00e9penses qu'il partageait avec lui, notamment celles reli\u00e9es au logement, et s'absenter du travail pendant six semaines. De plus, m\u00eame si ce n'\u00e9tait pas recommand\u00e9, il s'est procur\u00e9 de la marijuana pour stimuler l'app\u00e9tit de son conjoint. Lors du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son conjoint, sa situation financi\u00e8re \u00e9tait pr\u00e9caire et le tout s'est aggrav\u00e9 apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9c\u00e8s. Il a d\u00fb utiliser la marge de cr\u00e9dit de 5 000 $ qu'il avait obtenue. Il a utilis\u00e9 un montant de 20 000 $ sur cartes de cr\u00e9dit. Il a d\u00fb assumer le paiement d'un montant de 4 000 $ pour une dette de son conjoint. Sa m\u00e8re lui a avanc\u00e9 un montant de 8 000 $ qu'il n'a pas rembours\u00e9. Il disposait d'un revenu annuel de 23 500 $ approximativement. En plus du traumatisme que lui avait caus\u00e9 la perte de son conjoint, Marc Genest raconte que le poids de ses obligations financi\u00e8res lui a caus\u00e9 beaucoup de stress et d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. Le plaignant a conserv\u00e9 le logement qu'il habitait avec son conjoint au Plateau Mont-Royal jusqu'en juillet 1999 car il n'avait pu se r\u00e9signer \u00e0 le faire plus t\u00f4t. Il a occup\u00e9 un appartement au co\u00fbt mensuel de 700 $ auquel s'ajoutait le co\u00fbt du chauffage. En ao\u00fbt 2001, il a lou\u00e9 un appartement plus modeste et, en 2002, sa situation financi\u00e8re l'oblige \u00e0 louer une chambre chez un ami pendant trois mois. Suite \u00e0 son retour au travail, en octobre 2002, il a lou\u00e9 un appartement au co\u00fbt de 550 $ par mois.\n[24] En octobre 1998, il a souffert d'hyperventilation qui a n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 une hospitalisation d'une journ\u00e9e et une absence du travail pendant quelques semaines. En octobre 1999, il a subi une d\u00e9pression s\u00e9v\u00e8re caus\u00e9e par un deuil non r\u00e9solu qui a n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 une absence du travail de quelques semaines.\n[25] Marc Genest a quitt\u00e9 son emploi chez Bell Mobilit\u00e9 en f\u00e9vrier 2001 et il fut sans emploi pendant un an. Il a d\u00fb liquider tous ses actifs pour subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins. Il a repris le travail \u00e0 l'automne 2002 comme repr\u00e9sentant dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de fiducie avec une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration annuelle de 28 000 $. Le plaignant a fait des \u00e9tudes en tourisme, particuli\u00e8rement comme agent de voyages et guide touristique. Il a re\u00e7u aussi une formation comme agent et courtier immobilier.\n[26] Le t\u00e9moin d\u00e9clare qu'il ignorait que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d'une assurance-vie doive r\u00e9clamer la prestation dans les six mois qui suivent le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de l'assur\u00e9.\n[27] Le t\u00e9moin, dans un courriel adress\u00e9 \u00e0 Julie Walbrecq (Pi\u00e8ce I-1, onglet 7), le 11 septembre 2000, \u00e9crivait que la rencontre d'information tenue en 1998 \u00e0 laquelle participaient une vingtaine de personnes, \u00e9tait dirig\u00e9e par Genevi\u00e8ve Britt du d\u00e9partement des ressources humaines. Cette rencontre visait \u00e0 informer les employ\u00e9s des modifications apport\u00e9es au r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective.\n[28] Le plaignant reconna\u00eet que le 26 septembre 2000 il a adress\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Il \u00e9crit qu'en 1995, devant l'impossibilit\u00e9 de souscrire une assurance sur la vie de son conjoint, il a signal\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait de discrimination flagrante. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, il soutient avoir fait part de ses dol\u00e9ances \u00e0 Lucie Laroche, Karine Mariasine et Sylvie Sauv\u00e9, mais il admet ne pas avoir utilis\u00e9 les termes discrimination flagrante . Il affirme avoir mentionn\u00e9 que la situation \u00e0 laquelle il devait faire face n'avait pas de bon sens et n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e9quitable.\n[29] Marc Genest a fait parvenir \u00e0 Aetna Canada une mise en demeure le 15 f\u00e9vrier 2001 (Pi\u00e8ce I-1, onglet 9) dans laquelle il r\u00e9clame le paiement d'un montant de 20 000 $ suite au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son conjoint survenu le 16 f\u00e9vrier 1998. Il pr\u00e9tend que le montant de 20 000 $ r\u00e9clam\u00e9 \u00e9tait le montant de base de l'assurance-vie. Il a adress\u00e9 cette mise en demeure parce qu'il \u00e9tait impossible, malgr\u00e9 ses demandes r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es, d'obtenir le contrat d'assurance collective.\n[30] Le 29 avril 2002, le t\u00e9moin a communiqu\u00e9 par \u00e9crit sa version des faits \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Il mentionne que lors de sa rencontre avec Lucie Laroche, en ao\u00fbt 1995, cette derni\u00e8re a dessin\u00e9 un X sur la page traitant de l'assurance-vie dans la brochure explicative du r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective.\n[31] Il ajoute que Lucie Laroche lui a mentionn\u00e9 que la couverture de base pour l'assurance-vie d'un conjoint de sexe oppos\u00e9 \u00e9tait d'un montant de 20 000 $ qui aurait pu \u00eatre major\u00e9 sur paiement de primes additionnelles. Toutefois, il n'avait pas cette disponibilit\u00e9 dans les circonstances.\n[32] Dans ce m\u00eame document, le plaignant r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'\u00e0 l'automne 1999, lors d'une rencontre avec Genevi\u00e8ve Britt, directrice du service des ressources humaines, elle lui aurait indiqu\u00e9 qu'en 1995, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 possible d'assurer la vie de son conjoint. Il aurait suffi de l'identifier en inscrivant son nom et en indiquant au f\u00e9minin le pr\u00e9nom de son conjoint.\n[33] Au cours de cette m\u00eame rencontre, il a fait part \u00e0 Genevi\u00e8ve Britt qu'il avait besoin d'aide car il \u00e9tait d\u00e9pressif et se sentait d\u00e9courag\u00e9 de la vie. Genevi\u00e8ve Britt l'a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 un psychologue qui lui a dit qu'il devait se rendre directement \u00e0 l'urgence de l'h\u00f4pital. Il a refus\u00e9 de s'y rendre car il ne croyait pas au bien-fond\u00e9 de la recommandation de ce psychologue. Il n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de revenir \u00e0 la charge aupr\u00e8s de quiconque au service des ressources humaines pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier du programme d'aide aux employ\u00e9s.\n[34] Dans ce document, Marc Genest affirme que son conjoint b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait d'un r\u00e9gime d'assurance-maladie chez son employeur. Il a admis en contre-interrogatoire que tel n'\u00e9tait pas le cas. Le t\u00e9moin affirme que la brochure explicative du r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective contenait la d\u00e9finition de conjoint sans distinction pour les conjoints de m\u00eame sexe.\n[35] Le t\u00e9moin affirme qu'en 1995, ce n'\u00e9tait pas dans les habitudes chez Bell Mobilit\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s affichent publiquement leur orientation sexuelle par crainte de froisser les gens ou de compromettre les chances d'avancement. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, il pr\u00e9tend que sur les 30 repr\u00e9sentants au service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le seulement trois \u00e9taient homosexuels. Il nie que des gens homosexuels faisaient des blagues au sujet des homosexuels et m\u00eame lors de petites repr\u00e9sentations th\u00e9\u00e2trales \u00e0 l'occasion de soir\u00e9es sociales.\n[36] En contre-interrogatoire, le plaignant a reconnu que le revenu annuel de son conjoint, qu'il avait affirm\u00e9 \u00eatre d'environ 70 000 $ net, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plut\u00f4t approximativement de 40 000 $ brut pour les ann\u00e9es 1995 et 1996 et moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 en 1997. Il estime qu'au cours de ces ann\u00e9es sa situation financi\u00e8re et celle de son conjoint \u00e9taient bonnes. En contre-interrogatoire il a d\u00fb admettre que son conjoint avait fait cession de ses biens en d\u00e9cembre 1996 et qu'il en aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 en mai 1997. Il raconte avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fort surpris car son conjoint ne lui avait jamais fait part de ses difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res et frustr\u00e9 que son conjoint ait agi ainsi suite aux conseils re\u00e7us de son p\u00e8re et sans en discuter au pr\u00e9alable avec lui.\n[37] Marc Genest affirme que, lorsque son conjoint est revenu d'un voyage en Floride en septembre 1997 pour visiter sa m\u00e8re, il a constat\u00e9 qu'il avait beaucoup maigri et \u00e9prouvait des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 se d\u00e9placer. Il a alors soup\u00e7onn\u00e9 qu'il pouvait \u00eatre atteint du sida. Il ne peut pr\u00e9ciser \u00e0 quel moment il a contract\u00e9 la maladie et il n'en a jamais discut\u00e9 avec lui.\n[38] Marc Genest r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'en d\u00e9cembre 1996 son conjoint lui a fait part qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 voir ailleurs. Le plaignant d\u00e9clare avoir compris ce qu'il voulait dire et il n'a pas voulu en conna\u00eetre davantage.\n[39] Marc Genest pr\u00e9tend, \u00e0 sa connaissance, qu'avant son hospitalisation en novembre 1997 son conjoint a consult\u00e9 le m\u00e9decin environ deux fois par ann\u00e9e. Il ne lui connaissait pas de m\u00e9decin personnel.\n[40] Le t\u00e9moin a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier le sommaire des consultations m\u00e9dicales de son conjoint pour la p\u00e9riode du 30 janvier 1996 au 18 janvier 1998 (Pi\u00e8ce I-2). Ce sommaire provient de la R\u00e9gie de l'assurance-maladie du Qu\u00e9bec et d\u00e9montre qu'entre le 28 f\u00e9vrier 1997 et le 5 novembre 1997 le conjoint du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet de 21 actes m\u00e9dicaux. Marc Genest a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son conjoint ne l'a pas tenu au courant de ses visites chez le m\u00e9decin.\n(ii) Angello Galletto [41] Angello Galletto a travaill\u00e9 chez Bell Mobilit\u00e9 pendant trois ans \u00e0 compter du 11 ao\u00fbt 1997. Apr\u00e8s avoir termin\u00e9 une p\u00e9riode de probation de trois mois, il a acquis le statut d'employ\u00e9 permanent lui permettant de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des avantages sociaux consentis par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 son personnel, notamment le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective.\n[42] Le t\u00e9moin relate avoir assist\u00e9, avec une douzaine de coll\u00e8gues de travail, \u00e0 une session d'information donn\u00e9e par Katherine Daoust, conseill\u00e8re au d\u00e9partement des ressources humaines, pour leur expliquer entre autres les diff\u00e9rentes couvertures d'assurance offertes par le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective. Une fois les informations re\u00e7ues, l'employ\u00e9 devait faire conna\u00eetre le choix des couvertures d'assurance auxquelles il souhaitait adh\u00e9rer.\n[43] Le t\u00e9moin homosexuel vivait avec un conjoint de m\u00eame sexe en f\u00e9vrier 1996 apr\u00e8s trois mois de fr\u00e9quentation. Il soutient qu'au cours de la session d'information la possibilit\u00e9 d'une couverture d'assurance pour les conjoints de m\u00eame sexe n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e. Angello Galletto se souvient avoir communiqu\u00e9 avec Katherine Daoust pour savoir s'il pouvait inscrire son conjoint \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de l'assurance-vie. Elle lui a r\u00e9pondu que ce n'\u00e9tait pas possible mais qu'on pouvait proc\u00e9der en d\u00e9clarant le nom du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire et uniquement la premi\u00e8re lettre du pr\u00e9nom du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas adopter cette avenue d'autant plus que son conjoint d\u00e9tenait une assurance-vie avec le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective chez son employeur.\n[44] Le t\u00e9moin d\u00e9clare qu'il n'avait pas soulev\u00e9, lors de la session de formation, la question d'assurabilit\u00e9 de son conjoint parce qu'il s'agissait pour lui d'une affaire personnelle. En outre, il croit que dans ce temps-l\u00e0 l'orientation sexuelle n'\u00e9tait pas reconnue chez Bell Mobilit\u00e9. C'\u00e9tait un sujet qui, selon lui, n'\u00e9tait pas abord\u00e9 avec la direction. Des discussions pouvaient avoir lieu entre employ\u00e9s qui s'\u00e9taient li\u00e9s d'amiti\u00e9. Il \u00e9tait tout de m\u00eame reconnu qu'un nombre de personnes \u00e0 l'emploi de Bell Mobilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait homosexuelles.\n(iii) Martin Pelletier [45] Martin Pelletier a \u00e9t\u00e9 le conjoint de Marc Genest de septembre 1999 \u00e0 avril 2000. Lors de leur premi\u00e8re rencontre le plaignant lui a racont\u00e9 que son conjoint \u00e9tait d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 16 f\u00e9vrier 1998 et qu'auparavant son employeur lui avait refus\u00e9 de souscrire une assurance sur la vie de son conjoint. Plus tard, le t\u00e9moin a appris que le plaignant avait beaucoup de difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res, suite au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son conjoint, et qu'il s'\u00e9tait retrouv\u00e9 sans argent. Il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d'acquitter les frais fun\u00e9raires reli\u00e9s au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son conjoint et il avait d\u00fb quitter l'appartement luxueux qu'il occupait avec ce dernier. Marc Genest attribuait ses d\u00e9boires financiers au fait que son employeur lui avait refus\u00e9 l'opportunit\u00e9 de souscrire une assurance sur la vie de son conjoint dont il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire.\n[46] Marc Genest lui a \u00e9galement fait part que, dans les mois qui ont suivi le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son conjoint, Bell Mobilit\u00e9 avait modifi\u00e9 le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective afin de permettre \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 de souscrire une assurance sur la vie de son conjoint de m\u00eame sexe. Il lui a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e9galement avoir tent\u00e9 d'obtenir, tant de la part de l'assureur que de son employeur, le contrat d'assurance collective mais qu'ils n'ont jamais r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 sa demande.\n[47] Le t\u00e9moin d\u00e9clare qu'il a entrepris les premi\u00e8res d\u00e9marches qui ont conduit au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte parce qu'il constatait qu'\u00e9motivement Marc Genest ne se sentait pas capable de le faire.\n(iv) Gis\u00e8le T\u00e9trault [48] Gis\u00e8le T\u00e9trault est la m\u00e8re de Marc Genest. Elle raconte qu'au cours des six mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du conjoint de son fils celui-ci a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9prouver des difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res en raison de l'absence de revenus de son conjoint qui \u00e9tait malade et incapable de travailler. Elle a d\u00fb aider financi\u00e8rement son fils en lui pr\u00eatant un montant de 2 500 $. Suite au d\u00e9c\u00e8s du conjoint de son fils, ses ennuis financiers se sont alourdis et elle lui a pr\u00eat\u00e9 un montant de 5 500 $ et ces pr\u00eats ne lui ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9s.\n(v) Karine Mariasine [49] Karine Mariasine \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'emploi de Bell Mobilit\u00e9 en 1995 et 1996 \u00e0 titre de superviseure au d\u00e9partement de service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le. Elle se rappelle qu'au printemps 1995 Marc Genest est venu la rencontrer pour lui faire part des difficult\u00e9s qu'il \u00e9prouvait \u00e0 obtenir une couverture d'assurance sur la vie de son conjoint. Elle lui a dit qu'elle ne pouvait pas lui venir en aide. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, le t\u00e9moin d\u00e9clare qu'au d\u00e9partement du service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le une bonne dizaine d'employ\u00e9s s'affichaient publiquement comme homosexuels.\n(vi) Lorenzo Casanova [50] Le t\u00e9moin a d\u00e9but\u00e9 chez Bell Mobilit\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps que Marc Genest. Il a travaill\u00e9 avec le plaignant plus particuli\u00e8rement au cours des ann\u00e9es 1997 et 1998. Le t\u00e9moin relate qu'il \u00e9tait au courant que, suite au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son conjoint, Marc Genest avait des probl\u00e8mes avec le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective.\n[51] Le t\u00e9moin raconte qu'au cours de sa p\u00e9riode d'emploi chez l'intim\u00e9e plusieurs employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient homosexuels et il y avait \u00e9galement des employ\u00e9s homosexuels dont le conjoint \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'emploi de Bell Mobilit\u00e9.\n[52] Le t\u00e9moin a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 se souvenir qu'en 1998 des s\u00e9ances d'information ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es par des repr\u00e9sentants des ressources humaines concernant le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective et qu'il y a assist\u00e9.\nB. Preuve de l'intim\u00e9e (i) Sophie Boucher [53] Sophie Boucher a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e chez Bell Mobilit\u00e9 en 1986. Elle a d\u00e9but\u00e9 comme commis pour \u00eatre promue successivement au service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le, au service de la collection et finalement au service des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications.\n[54] Depuis son arriv\u00e9e chez Bell Mobilit\u00e9, elle s'est toujours affich\u00e9e en tant qu'homosexuelle. En 1995, sa conjointe travaillait \u00e9galement chez Bell Mobilit\u00e9 depuis 1990. Elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e comme repr\u00e9sentante au service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le pour devenir ensuite superviseure et finalement directrice.\n[55] Elle soutient qu'en 1995 l'homosexualit\u00e9 chez les employ\u00e9s ne causait aucun probl\u00e8me parmi les dirigeants. Elle se souvient, \u00e0 titre d'exemple, avoir confi\u00e9 \u00e0 son patron sa volont\u00e9 de mettre au monde un enfant et les d\u00e9marches qu'elle avait entreprises. Elle se souvient \u00e9galement que plusieurs employ\u00e9s s'affichaient publiquement comme homosexuels.\n[56] Sophie Boucher d\u00e9clare qu'avant 1995 il existait un r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective chez Bell Mobilit\u00e9 qui d\u00e9cidait de l'adh\u00e9sion des employ\u00e9s aux diff\u00e9rentes cat\u00e9gories d'assurances. \u00c0 compter de 1995, le nouveau r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective permettait aux employ\u00e9s d'exercer des options de diverses couvertures d'assurance. C'est la raison pour laquelle les repr\u00e9sentants des ressources humaines ont tenu des sessions d'information pour expliquer aux employ\u00e9s les diverses couvertures d'assurance disponibles et les co\u00fbts s'y rattachant, tant pour l'employ\u00e9 que pour l'employeur.\n[57] Le t\u00e9moin d\u00e9clare ne pas avoir port\u00e9 d'int\u00e9r\u00eat pour la couverture d'assurance-vie du conjoint de m\u00eame sexe parce que sa conjointe, \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'emploi de Bell Mobilit\u00e9, pouvait adh\u00e9rer au r\u00e9gime d'assurance-vie.\n(ii) Sylvie Sauv\u00e9 [58] Sylvie Sauv\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e chez Bell Mobilit\u00e9 en mars 1990 comme repr\u00e9sentante en ligne. En 1994, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 promue superviseure et, en 1997, elle est devenue directrice au service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le.\n[59] Le t\u00e9moin a rencontr\u00e9, en mai 1990, sa conjointe \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'emploi de Bell Mobilit\u00e9. Elles se sont toujours affich\u00e9es publiquement comme gaies. Elle affirme que son orientation sexuelle ne lui a jamais caus\u00e9 d'emb\u00fbche dans son cheminement de carri\u00e8re. Elle relate que plusieurs employ\u00e9s s'affichaient publiquement comme homosexuels, notamment une de ses coll\u00e8gues gaies qui \u00e9tait directrice. Il arrivait que des employ\u00e9s homosexuels lui fassent des blagues sur son orientation sexuelle.\n[60] Le t\u00e9moin relate que lors de l'arriv\u00e9e du nouveau r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective en 1995, elle ne s'est pas pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e de l'adh\u00e9sion \u00e0 l'assurance-vie pour sa conjointe vu qu'elle \u00e9tait aussi \u00e0 l'emploi de Bell Mobilit\u00e9.\n[61] Elle raconte que le plaignant lui a parl\u00e9 de la situation qu'il vivait relativement \u00e0 une couverture d'assurance sur la vie de son conjoint et qu'elle lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle ne vivait pas cette situation car sa conjointe travaillait chez Bell Mobilit\u00e9.\n(iii) Genevi\u00e8ve Britt [62] Genevi\u00e8ve Britt a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9e en 1995 par Bell Mobilit\u00e9 au poste de directrice, formation et d\u00e9veloppement organisationnel. En 1996, elle a occup\u00e9 le poste de directrice, relations avec les employ\u00e9s et, \u00e0 la fin de 1997, celui de directrice des ressources humaines chez Bell Mobilit\u00e9 Cellulaires. En 1999, elle a quitt\u00e9 cet emploi pour occuper celui de directrice des ressources humaines chez Bell Express Vu.\n[63] Elle a fait la connaissance du plaignant au printemps de 1998 alors qu'il s'est rendu la rencontrer parce qu'il \u00e9prouvait des difficult\u00e9s suite au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son conjoint. Le plaignant lui avait confi\u00e9 que son partenaire \u00e9tait d'origine \u00e9gyptienne et que sa famille acceptait mal leur relation, ce qui lui causait un certain stress. En plus du deuil qu'il vivait, il lui fait part qu'il avait des difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res.\n[64] Genevi\u00e8ve Britt a demand\u00e9 au plaignant s'il avait souscrit une assurance sur la vie de son conjoint. Il a r\u00e9pond qu'il ignorait qu'il b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait de cette opportunit\u00e9 et il semblait tr\u00e8s \u00e9tonn\u00e9 de l'apprendre.\n[65] Le t\u00e9moin d\u00e9clare qu'elle lui a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de recourir au programme d'aide aux employ\u00e9s. Comme il semblait \u00e9puis\u00e9, elle lui a conseill\u00e9 de consulter un m\u00e9decin. Genevi\u00e8ve Britt raconte qu'elle ne peut avoir rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant en 1999 puisqu'elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'emploi de Bell Express Vu.\n[66] Le t\u00e9moin r\u00e9v\u00e8le que contrairement aux affirmations du t\u00e9moin dans sa lettre du 29 avril 2002 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission, elle ne lui a pas donn\u00e9 d'information sur le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective car, de par ses fonctions, elle n'a jamais eu \u00e0 travailler dans ce domaine. Elle nie cat\u00e9goriquement avoir dit au t\u00e9moin qu'il aurait pu indiquer le pr\u00e9nom de son conjoint au f\u00e9minin pour lui permettre de souscrire une assurance sur sa vie. Elle pr\u00e9tend qu'elle n'aurait jamais incit\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 frauder un assureur.\n[67] Le t\u00e9moin soutient que chez Bell Mobilit\u00e9 on faisait preuve d'une grande ouverture d'esprit et qu'on ne faisait aucune diff\u00e9rence entre l'employ\u00e9 homosexuel et h\u00e9t\u00e9rosexuel. Elle affirme que plusieurs employ\u00e9s, en 1995, s'affichaient publiquement au travail en tant qu'homosexuels.\n[68] Le t\u00e9moin d\u00e9clare ne pas se souvenir d'avoir tenu une r\u00e9union d'information sur le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective en 1998 au cours de laquelle le plaignant aurait pleur\u00e9.\n[69] Le t\u00e9moin raconte que suite \u00e0 son embauche en 1995 elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e que le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective \u00e9tait offert au conjoint de m\u00eame sexe. Elle rapporte qu'en 1998 des rencontres ont eu lieu avec le personnel pour expliquer les modifications apport\u00e9es au r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective.\n(iv) Katherine Daoust [70] Katherine Daoust est \u00e0 l'emploi de Bell Mobilit\u00e9 depuis le 1er avril 1985. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 adjointe \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cutif. Depuis septembre 1995, elle occupe le poste de directeur administratif des avantages sociaux.\n[71] Elle \u00e9tait appel\u00e9e \u00e0 rencontrer les employ\u00e9s par petits groupes pour leur fournir des informations relatives aux avantages sociaux offerts par Bell Mobilit\u00e9, notamment le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective. Elle affirme qu'elle sp\u00e9cifiait que le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective \u00e9tait disponible aux conjoints de m\u00eame sexe ou de sexe diff\u00e9rent et ce, pour autant qu'il \u00e9tait de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 publique que les conjoints faisaient vie commune et que cette vie commune existait depuis au moins 12 mois.\n[72] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, elle admet avoir mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 Angello Galletto qu'il ne pouvait assurer son conjoint parce qu'il n'habitait pas avec lui depuis au moins 12 mois. Le t\u00e9moin r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'il y avait de nombreux employ\u00e9s qui faisaient part de leur homosexualit\u00e9 sans probl\u00e8me, tant chez les filles que chez les gar\u00e7ons.\n[73] Elle affirme qu'\u00e0 chaque rencontre qu'elle faisait avec des groupes d'employ\u00e9s elle se faisait un devoir de les informer parce qu'elle craignait que de nouveaux employ\u00e9s n'osent pas aborder cette question de l'assurabilit\u00e9 des conjoints de m\u00eame sexe.\n(v) Michel C\u00f4t\u00e9 [74] Michel C\u00f4t\u00e9 a d\u00e9but\u00e9 \u00e0 l'emploi de Bell Mobilit\u00e9 en 1988 pour un projet sp\u00e9cial au t\u00e9l\u00e9marketing. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 promu coordonnateur de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication puis coordonnateur de l'administration. En 1996, il a occup\u00e9 cette fonction \u00e0 Toronto. En 2002, il a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 remplir la m\u00eame responsabilit\u00e9 chez Bell Express Vu.\n[75] Le t\u00e9moin d\u00e9clare qu'il est gai. Il estime que l'orientation sexuelle des employ\u00e9s ne faisait pas l'objet de discussions chez les dirigeants de Bell Mobilit\u00e9. Il affirme qu'il pouvait vivre son homosexualit\u00e9 en toute qui\u00e9tude. \u00c0 titre d'exemple, le t\u00e9moin se souvient qu'\u00e0 l'occasion de la p\u00e9riode des F\u00eates des spectacles \u00e9taient organis\u00e9s au cours desquels l'homosexualit\u00e9 \u00e9tait fr\u00e9quemment abord\u00e9e, d'autant plus que les deux animateurs \u00e9taient gais. Ces spectacles \u00e9taient enregistr\u00e9s et une vid\u00e9o \u00e9tait achemin\u00e9e aux dirigeants de Bell Mobilit\u00e9 qui souhaitaient voir ces spectacles. Le contenu des spectacles auxquels le t\u00e9moin a particip\u00e9 pendant six \u00e0 sept ans \u00e9tait pr\u00e9alablement approuv\u00e9 par le comit\u00e9 de gestion.\n[76] Le t\u00e9moin raconte qu'un comit\u00e9 form\u00e9 d'un directeur et d'une dizaine d'employ\u00e9s avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis sur pied. L'objectif de ce comit\u00e9 \u00e9tait de sensibiliser les dirigeants aux divers probl\u00e8mes que vivaient les employ\u00e9s au travail et de trouver des solutions. Le t\u00e9moin affirme qu'\u00e0 l'occasion d'une r\u00e9union de ce comit\u00e9 il a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices d'assurances soient les m\u00eames, aussi bien pour un couple h\u00e9t\u00e9rosexuel que pour un couple homosexuel. Il pr\u00e9tend que sa suggestion a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue lors de la mise sur pied, en juin 1995, du r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective.\n[77] Lors de l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de ce nouveau r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective, le t\u00e9moin vivait seul mais il fr\u00e9quentait quelqu'un de sexe masculin qui travaillait \u00e0 Police Cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 Ottawa. En 1996, cette personne \u00e9tait devenue son conjoint. Il a souscrit une assurance sur la vie de son conjoint ainsi qu'une assurance-d\u00e9c\u00e8s et mutilation accidentels.\n(vi) Lucie Laroche [78] Lucie Laroche est \u00e0 l'emploi de Bell Mobilit\u00e9 depuis le 29 septembre 1986. De janvier 1992 \u00e0 novembre 1998 elle a occup\u00e9 le poste d'administratrice des ressources humaines pour \u00eatre affect\u00e9e par la suite au service de la paie.\n[79] Elle devait s'occuper de la gestion des diff\u00e9rents programmes d'avantages sociaux tels le r\u00e9gime d'assurance, le r\u00e9gime de retraite, le programme d'aide aux employ\u00e9s, le r\u00e9gime d'achat d'actions.\n[80] Lucie Laroche raconte que lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 obtenait son statut d'employ\u00e9 permanent il pouvait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des programmes d'avantages sociaux. Le service des ressources humaines disposait d'une trousse qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9e pour chaque employ\u00e9 permanent. Elle contenait une brochure explicative du r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective intitul\u00e9e Avantages \u00e0 la carte , accompagn\u00e9e d'un formulaire de choix d'options d'assurance. Elle contenait \u00e9galement les informations sur les autres programmes d'avantages sociaux. Par la suite, les employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient invit\u00e9s, par petits groupes, pour une session d'information donn\u00e9e par un repr\u00e9sentant des ressources humaines bien au courant des programmes d'avantages sociaux. Lors de la rencontre, la trousse \u00e9tait remise \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 et l'information \u00e9tait transmise. Par la suite, l'employ\u00e9 devait d\u00e9cider \u00e0 quelle couverture d'assurance il choisissait d'adh\u00e9rer. S'il avait besoin d'\u00e9claircissement sur les options d'assurance \u00e0 exercer, il pouvait obtenir des renseignements de la part d'un administrateur aux ressources humaines. Puis, l'employ\u00e9 devait remplir le formulaire de choix d'options d'assurance et l'acheminer par courrier interne au service des ressources humaines. Enfin, un relev\u00e9 de confirmation de couverture d'assurance \u00e9manant de l'assureur \u00e9tait transmis \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 par le service des ressources humaines.\n[81] Le t\u00e9moin r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la brochure Avantages \u00e0 la carte identifiait les r\u00e9gimes d'assurance disponibles, leur contenu et les taux applicables. Elle contenait des explications sur chacun des r\u00e9gimes. Par exemple, cette brochure contenait des informations sur le r\u00e9gime d'assurance-vie de l'employ\u00e9. Elle pr\u00e9cisait que l'assurance de base sur la vie d'un employ\u00e9 devait \u00eatre d'un minimum de 10 000 $. L'employ\u00e9 pouvait majorer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de cette assurance de deux fois jusqu'\u00e0 sept fois son salaire. Le t\u00e9moin a fourni des explications sur le r\u00e9gime d'assurance-d\u00e9c\u00e8s et mutilation accidentels (ADMA). Cette couverture d'assurance s'appliquait uniquement dans le cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s accidentel de l'employ\u00e9. En pratique, en cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s accidentel, la couverture ADMA et la couverture d'assurance-vie trouvaient leur application mais ce n'est pas le cas suite \u00e0 une mort naturelle. En cas de mutilation, un pourcentage de la couverture d'assurance s'appliquait. Ce pourcentage variait selon la gravit\u00e9 de la mutilation. La brochure contenait \u00e9galement des informations sur le r\u00e9gime d'assurance dentaire, le r\u00e9gime d'assurance-maladie, le r\u00e9gime d'assurance-invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme.\n[82] La brochure offrait \u00e9galement l'assurance-vie pour le conjoint par tranche de 25 000 $ et dont la prime \u00e9tait payable en entier par l'employ\u00e9. Le t\u00e9moin pr\u00e9cise les conditions pour qu'une personne soit reconnue comme conjoint : soit d'\u00eatre mari\u00e9 par mariage civil ou religieux ou \u00eatre conjoint de fait. Pour \u00eatre conjoint de fait on devait cohabiter avec une autre personne depuis une p\u00e9riode d'au moins 12 mois et s'afficher publiquement comme couple. Elle soutient que les conjoints de m\u00eame sexe \u00e9taient reconnus au m\u00eame titre que les conjoints de fait h\u00e9t\u00e9rosexuels.\n[83] Selon le t\u00e9moin, la brochure indiquait \u00e9galement la possibilit\u00e9 de couverture ADMA pour le conjoint et pour les enfants de m\u00eame qu'une couverture d'assurance-vie pour les enfants.\n[84] Le t\u00e9moin raconte qu'avant l'av\u00e8nement du programme Avantages \u00e0 la carte le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective en vigueur n'offrait pas de choix d'options d'assurance aussi vari\u00e9s que le nouveau programme et l'opportunit\u00e9 d'adh\u00e9rer aux options d'assurance en fonction des besoins particuliers de chaque employ\u00e9.\n[85] Le t\u00e9moin souligne qu'en 1994 elle a fait partie d'un groupe de travail compos\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentants de Bell Mobilit\u00e9 et de consultants qui ont particip\u00e9 au d\u00e9veloppement et \u00e0 la mise en place le 1er juin 1995 du programme Flex I avec la compagnie d'assurance Aetna Canada. En se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant au contrat d'assurance collective en vigueur en 1995 (Pi\u00e8ce P-2), le t\u00e9moin a indiqu\u00e9 que toute demande de couverture d'assurance-vie pour l'employ\u00e9 ou son conjoint n'\u00e9tait pas sujette \u00e0 une preuve d'assurabilit\u00e9 si elle \u00e9tait faite dans les 31 jours qui suivaient la date o\u00f9 l'employ\u00e9 devenait \u00e9ligible au programme d'assurance collective. L'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait acquise \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 l'employ\u00e9 obtenait sa permanence. Si la demande d'assurance \u00e9tait faite apr\u00e8s l'expiration de ce d\u00e9lai, l'assureur exigeait une preuve d'assurabilit\u00e9.\n[86] Selon toujours la pi\u00e8ce P-2, page 7 ELIB, le t\u00e9moin a expliqu\u00e9 les diff\u00e9rentes options d'assurance-vie disponibles pour un employ\u00e9. La premi\u00e8re option est celle d'une assurance de base de 10 000 $ obligatoire ; la seconde option est une assurance repr\u00e9sentant une fois le salaire annuel de l'employ\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 une possibilit\u00e9 de sept fois le salaire annuel. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'assurance-vie du conjoint (Pi\u00e8ce P-2, page 7, 2-DLIB2), on constate que l'employ\u00e9 peut opter pour une couverture d'assurance sur la vie de son conjoint variant entre 25 000 $ et 250 000 $. Toutefois, l'employ\u00e9 ne pouvait souscrire une assurance sur la vie de son conjoint pour un montant plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui auquel il avait souscrit pour lui-m\u00eame en assurance-vie.\n[87] Par ailleurs, si la couverture d'assurance sur la vie du conjoint est sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 25 000 $, une preuve d'assurabilit\u00e9 est requise. De plus, lors du renouvellement annuel de l'assurance-vie, toute augmentation de la couverture d'assurance-vie du conjoint est sujette \u00e0 une preuve d'assurabilit\u00e9.\n[88] Enfin, \u00e0 la page 9 de la pi\u00e8ce P-2, Lucie Laroche indique que toute r\u00e9clamation de b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d'assurance sur la vie doit \u00eatre soumise \u00e0 l'assureur dans les six mois du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de l'assur\u00e9.\n[89] Lucie Laroche pr\u00e9cise que le choix d'options d'assurance exerc\u00e9 par l'employ\u00e9 est valide jusqu'\u00e0 la date de renouvellement qui \u00e9tait le 1er juin 1996. Au cours du printemps, les employ\u00e9s re\u00e7oivent \u00e0 nouveau une trousse contenant notamment la brochure explicative du programme d'assurance collective avec le formulaire de choix d'options. Des rencontres d'information ont lieu et les employ\u00e9s qui d\u00e9sirent apporter des modifications \u00e0 leur choix d'assurance peuvent le faire en remplissant le formulaire de choix d'options. Ce formulaire est transmis par l'employ\u00e9 au service des ressources humaines qui l'achemine \u00e0 l'assureur. Une fois les modifications accept\u00e9es, l'assureur \u00e9met un relev\u00e9 de confirmation qui est envoy\u00e9 au service des ressources humaines et transmis \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9. Le m\u00eame processus se r\u00e9p\u00e8te chaque ann\u00e9e.\n[90] Le t\u00e9moin a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 commenter le formulaire de choix d'options d'assurance rempli par Marc Genest le 28 ao\u00fbt 1995 (Pi\u00e8ce P-4). Le document d\u00e9montre que Bell Mobilit\u00e9 mettait \u00e0 la disposition du plaignant un montant de 411,12 $ pour payer le co\u00fbt de certains r\u00e9gimes d'assurance. On constate \u00e9galement que Marc Genest a choisi d'adh\u00e9rer \u00e0 l'assurance-maladie seulement pour lui-m\u00eame et \u00e0 l'assurance dentaire pour lui-m\u00eame et son conjoint. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'assurance-vie, Marc Genest a opt\u00e9 pour une couverture d'assurance-vie repr\u00e9sentant deux fois son salaire annuel. Il n'a pas adh\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l'assurance-vie du conjoint, ni \u00e0 celle des enfants. Il a opt\u00e9 pour l'ADMA pour lui-m\u00eame avec une couverture de cinq fois son salaire annuel et l'ADMA pour son conjoint avec une couverture de 200 000 $. Il a adh\u00e9r\u00e9 aussi \u00e0 l'assurance-invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme pour lui-m\u00eame.\n[91] Ce formulaire d\u00e9montre \u00e9galement que le plaignant a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 sa m\u00e8re \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de ses assurance-vie et ADMA et son conjoint comme personne \u00e0 charge.\n[92] Lucie Laroche r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'au moment o\u00f9 Marc Genest a adh\u00e9r\u00e9 au r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective son salaire annuel \u00e9tait de 24 226,80 $ en ao\u00fbt 1995. Par cons\u00e9quent, comme il avait souscrit une assurance sur sa vie pour un montant repr\u00e9sentant deux fois son salaire annuel, il disposait d'une assurance sur sa vie de 49 000 $. Si Marc Genest avait opt\u00e9 pour une assurance sur la vie de son conjoint, le montant de celle-ci aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de 25 000 $, selon la version du t\u00e9moin. Elle explique que l'assurance-vie du conjoint \u00e9tait offerte par tranche de 25 000 $ et qu'un montant de 50 000 $ sur la vie du conjoint du plaignant aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieur au montant de sa propre assurance sur la vie, ce qui n'\u00e9tait pas accept\u00e9 par l'assureur.\n[93] Lucie Laroche relate qu'en 1995 elle \u00e9tait mari\u00e9e depuis neuf ans et m\u00e8re de deux enfants.\n[94] Le t\u00e9moin raconte qu'en 1998 le programme Flex I a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9 par le programme Flex II . Ce nouveau programme ne comportait pas de changements majeurs des couvertures d'assurance. On avait apport\u00e9 des modifications pour am\u00e9liorer la flexibilit\u00e9 du choix d'assurance.\n[95] \u00c0 l'arriv\u00e9e de ce programme, Lucie Laroche a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration du document appel\u00e9 Avantages \u00e0 la carte 2 remis aux employ\u00e9s lors des sessions d'information. De plus, elle a fourni la formation aux repr\u00e9sentants des ressources humaines appel\u00e9s \u00e0 tenir les sessions d'information et elle en a fait quelques-unes elle-m\u00eame.\n[96] Le t\u00e9moin rappelle que toutes les couvertures d'assurance telles que l'assurance-maladie, l'assurance dentaire, l'assurance-vie ou ADMA \u00e9taient offertes aussi bien aux conjoints de m\u00eame sexe qu'\u00e0 ceux de sexe oppos\u00e9.\n[97] Le t\u00e9moin a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 commenter le contenu d'une lettre adress\u00e9e par le plaignant \u00e0 la Commission le 26 septembre 2000 (Pi\u00e8ce I-1, onglet 8). On peut y lire au paragraphe a) :\n\u00ab Le programme d'assurance collective en vigueur n'offrait aucune couverture pour l'assurance-vie pour les conjoints de m\u00eame sexe, malgr\u00e9 le fait que cette m\u00eame police acceptait les conjoints de m\u00eame sexe pour tous les types de couvertures, auxquels j'ai enregistr\u00e9 mon conjoint d'ailleurs. \u00bb\n[98] Puis, au paragraphe b), le plaignant soutient que :\n\u00ab La police en vigueur obligeait le paiement par pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement directs sur les paies d'une prime de base \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s couvrant entre autres, une protection d'assurance vie de base de 20 000 $ pour les conjoints de sexe oppos\u00e9s d'employ\u00e9s. \u00bb\n[99] Lucie Laroche affirme que le contrat d'assurance n'exigeait aucunement le paiement par pr\u00e9l\u00e8vements directs sur les paies des employ\u00e9s pour une prime de base d'assurance. De plus, elle soutient qu'il n'y a jamais eu de couverture de base en assurance-vie pour le conjoint de m\u00eame sexe ou de sexe oppos\u00e9. Au surplus, le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective ne mentionnait aucune assurance-vie de base de 20 000 $ pour le conjoint.\n[100] Lucie Laroche expose que Bell Mobilit\u00e9 avait mis sur pied un programme d'aide aux employ\u00e9s (PAE) pour fournir des services d'aide ponctuelle aux employ\u00e9s qui vivaient des probl\u00e8mes personnels, qui avaient besoin d'aide psychologique, financi\u00e8re ou l\u00e9gale. Le PAE disposait d'un service central t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique auquel l'employ\u00e9 se rapportait. Suite au probl\u00e8me soumis, les dispositions \u00e9taient prises pour r\u00e9f\u00e9rer l'employ\u00e9 \u00e0 un consultant en mesure de lui venir en aide.\n[101] Le t\u00e9moin a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 commenter la pr\u00e9tention du t\u00e9moin \u00e0 l'effet que lors d'une rencontre elle aurait barr\u00e9 d'un X la page de la brochure explicative de l'assurance-vie en affirmant qu'il n'avait pas droit \u00e0 celle-ci pour son conjoint. Lucie Laroche nie cette pr\u00e9tention du t\u00e9moin et demeure convaincue que toutes les couvertures d'assurance s'appliquaient au conjoint de m\u00eame sexe.\n[102] Lucie Laroche se souvient d'une conversation avec le plaignant, non pas pour lui apprendre le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son conjoint, mais quelques mois plus tard. Le plaignant lui avait alors fait part qu'il avait des difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res et qu'il \u00e9tait attrist\u00e9 du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son conjoint.\n[103] Le t\u00e9moin d\u00e9clare qu'elle n'a aucun souvenir d'une session d'information avec les employ\u00e9s en juin 1998 o\u00f9 elle aurait affirm\u00e9 que Avantages \u00e0 la carte 2 permettait dor\u00e9navant une couverture compl\u00e8te d'assurance pour les conjoints du m\u00eame sexe. Elle est toutefois convaincue qu'elle n'aurait pas tenu un tel discours puisque le programme Avantages \u00e0 la carte permettait d\u00e9j\u00e0 une couverture d'assurance pour les conjoints de m\u00eame sexe depuis 1995 et que le programme Avantages \u00e0 la carte 2 ne comportait aucun changement \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[104] Lucie Laroche a affirm\u00e9, \u00e0 l'aide du document faisant \u00e9tat de la progression du salaire annuel de Marc Genest (Pi\u00e8ce I-1, onglet 2), que ce dernier a obtenu le statut d'employ\u00e9 permanent \u00e0 temps partiel le 28 juin 1995 et permanent \u00e0 temps plein le 27 avril 1998.\n[105] En contre-interrogatoire, le t\u00e9moin a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 commenter le fait qu'en 1995 la couverture d'assurance sur la vie des conjoints de m\u00eame sexe existait mais qu'on ne la rendait pas publique. Le t\u00e9moin affirme qu'en 1995, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la formation sur le programme d'assurance collective, elle a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 sa fa\u00e7on de faire apr\u00e8s avoir donn\u00e9 la formation \u00e0 d'autres employ\u00e9s qui devaient tenir les sessions de formation. Aussi, pr\u00e9tend-elle avoir donn\u00e9, lors de sessions de formation et celles d'information aux employ\u00e9s, toutes les informations relatives \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 d'assurance pour les conjoints de m\u00eame sexe. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que les informations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es lors de sessions de formation de petits groupes d'employ\u00e9s.\n[106] Le t\u00e9moin d\u00e9clare se souvenir d'une rencontre avec deux employ\u00e9s dans un bureau. Elle ne peut affirmer que l'un d'eux \u00e9tait Marc Genest. Toutefois, elle se rappelle que l'un d'eux a pos\u00e9 des questions sur l'assurabilit\u00e9 des conjoints de m\u00eame sexe. Ce genre de question l'avait frapp\u00e9e parce qu'elle ne l'avait pas souvent entendu lors des sessions d'information avec de petits groupes d'employ\u00e9s.\n[107] \u00c0 l'aide du document intitul\u00e9 historique des absences de Marc Genest entre novembre 1997 et d\u00e9cembre 2000, Lucie Laroche constate que le plaignant s'est absent\u00e9 du travail en invalidit\u00e9 court terme du 6 novembre 1997 au 19 d\u00e9cembre 1997, du 22 septembre 1998 au 19 octobre 1998, du 12 octobre 1999 au 8 f\u00e9vrier 2000 et, finalement, du 9 novembre 2000 au 4 d\u00e9cembre 2000. Au cours de ces p\u00e9riodes d'absence, le plaignant recevait 90 ou 100 pour cent de son salaire en vertu du r\u00e9gime d'assurance-invalidit\u00e9 court terme qui est enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 la charge de l'employeur. L'assurance-invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme s'appliquait apr\u00e8s 26 semaines d'absence en invalidit\u00e9.\n[108] Lucie Laroche a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la brochure explicative du programme d'assurance collective Flex I qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise aux employ\u00e9s au printemps de 1995. Le document s'intitule Avantages \u00e0 la carte (Pi\u00e8ce I-6). Ce programme est entr\u00e9 en vigueur le 29 juin 1995.\n[109] Le t\u00e9moin r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 la page 2 du document o\u00f9 il est \u00e9crit :\n\u00ab Pour Bell Mobilit\u00e9, il est important que tous les employ\u00e9s b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d'une protection financi\u00e8re de base en assurance-vie et en assurance-invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme. Un niveau de protection minimum est donc obligatoire pour ces deux r\u00e9gimes. Dans le cas des autres r\u00e9gimes, vous \u00eates libre de n'opter pour aucune protection, si vous le d\u00e9sirez. \u00bb\n[110] \u00c0 la page 6 de ce m\u00eame document, le t\u00e9moin r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 la notion de personnes \u00e0 charge. On peut y lire :\n\u00ab Personnes \u00e0 charge - Les membres de votre famille peuvent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des r\u00e9gimes suivants : assurance-maladie, assurance dentaire, assurance-vie et assurance-d\u00e9c\u00e8s et mutilation accidentels.\nLes personnes \u00e0 charge admissibles sont :\n* votre conjoint, avec qui vous \u00eates l\u00e9galement mari\u00e9 ou vivez en union libre depuis au moins 12 mois ;\n* vos enfants \u00e0 charge de moins de 21 ans, vos enfants \u00e0 charge de moins de 25 ans s'ils \u00e9tudient \u00e0 temps plein ou vos enfants handicap\u00e9s, quel que soit l'\u00e2ge, s'ils d\u00e9pendent enti\u00e8rement de vous sur le plan financier. \u00bb\n[111] \u00c0 la page 18 du document, des informations sont fournies sur les options d'assurance-vie du conjoint.

Il pouvait opter \u00e9galement pour une assurance-vie \u00e0 un montant repr\u00e9sentant une fois son salaire annuel jusqu'\u00e0 six fois son salaire annuel arrondi au millier de dollars suivant. Ainsi, l'employ\u00e9 qui optait pour une assurance-vie repr\u00e9sentant une fois son salaire et dont le revenu \u00e9tait de 24 000 $ voyait son montant d'assurance arrondi \u00e0 25 000 $.\n[120] Le t\u00e9moin relate que la demande d'assurance doit \u00eatre formul\u00e9e dans les 31 jours qui suivent l'admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'assurance. \u00c0 d\u00e9faut, une attestation m\u00e9dicale est requise c'est-\u00e0-dire un questionnaire sur la sant\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par l'assureur.\n[121] En ce qui concerne les options d'assurance qu'un employ\u00e9 peut choisir sur la vie de son conjoint, le t\u00e9moin r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le montant minimum est de 25 000 $.

Elle ajoute qu'elle n'a jamais vu de r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective qui exclut les partenaires de m\u00eame sexe d'une partie des protections disponibles aux personnes \u00e0 charge.\n[126] Pour terminer la preuve de l'intim\u00e9e, une lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, (Pi\u00e8ce I-10), attestant que le contrat d'assurance-vie que le conjoint du plaignant d\u00e9tenait avec la Sun Life au montant de 10 000 $ a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9 le 12 juin 1995 r\u00e9troactivement au 1er juillet 1994 en raison des primes impay\u00e9es en juillet, octobre 1994 et janvier 1995.\nIII. LE DROIT [127] L'article 7 de la Loi \u00e9nonce que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects de d\u00e9favoriser un individu en cours d'emploi. De plus, l'article 3 de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que les motifs de distinction illicites sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s, notamment sur l'orientation sexuelle et l'\u00e9tat matrimonial.\n[128] La jurisprudence enseigne qu'en mati\u00e8re de discrimination, il incombe au plaignant d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier une d\u00e9cision en faveur du plaignant, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9e.\nIV. ANALYSE [129] Le procureur du plaignant a reconnu qu'en juin 1995, le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective pour les employ\u00e9s de Bell Mobilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9voyait pour le conjoint de m\u00eame sexe l'option d'assurance-vie tout comme celle de l'assurance-maladie, de l'assurance dentaire et de l'assurances-d\u00e9c\u00e8s et mutilation accidentels. Il soutient plut\u00f4t que les repr\u00e9sentants de l'intim\u00e9e n'ont pas fourni au plaignant les informations pertinentes lui permettant de souscrire une assurance sur la vie de son conjoint et qu'ils ne lui ont pas permis de le faire.\n[130] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Marc Genest a affirm\u00e9 ne pas se souvenir qu'en 1995 des repr\u00e9sentants du service des ressources humaines aient tenu des sessions d'information aupr\u00e8s des employ\u00e9s pour leur dispenser les renseignements sur le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective. La pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve est \u00e0 l'effet contraire et ce, tant par le t\u00e9moignage de Lucie Laroche que par les documents achemin\u00e9s aux employ\u00e9s par Bob Ferchat, pr\u00e9sident du Conseil, pr\u00e9sident et chef de la direction, ainsi que Marc-Andr\u00e9 Malboeuf, administrateur, ressources humaines (Pi\u00e8ce P-11).\n[131] Marc Genest a soutenu qu'apr\u00e8s avoir pris connaissance de la brochure informative du r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective il a rencontr\u00e9 Lucie Laroche le 28 ao\u00fbt 1995 pour obtenir des explications. Il affirme que lors de cette rencontre elle lui aurait mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle vivait avec un conjoint depuis quatre ans. Or, Lucie Laroche a cat\u00e9goriquement ni\u00e9 cette affirmation en pr\u00e9cisant qu'\u00e0 ce moment elle avait un conjoint depuis neuf ans et elle \u00e9tait la m\u00e8re de deux enfants.\n[132] Marc Genest a pr\u00e9tendu que lors de cette rencontre Lucie Laroche lui a affirm\u00e9 que l'option d'assurance sur la vie du conjoint ne s'appliquait pas au conjoint du m\u00eame sexe. La pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 le bien-fond\u00e9 de cette pr\u00e9tention. En effet, la preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que Lucie Laroche a collabor\u00e9 avec une \u00e9quipe de travail \u00e0 la mise sur pied du nouveau r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective de sorte qu'elle en connaissait tr\u00e8s bien le contenu. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 dispenser de la formation aux repr\u00e9sentants du service des ressources humaines qui ont tenu des s\u00e9ances d'information aupr\u00e8s des groupes d'employ\u00e9s. Elle a elle-m\u00eame dirig\u00e9 des sessions de formation pour les employ\u00e9s. Tant lors des cours de formation aux repr\u00e9sentants du service des ressources humaines que lors des sessions d'information aux groupes d'employ\u00e9s, elle a affirm\u00e9 avoir toujours mentionn\u00e9 que l'option d'assurance-vie s'appliquait au conjoint de m\u00eame sexe.\n[133] Je retiens le t\u00e9moignage de Lucie Laroche plut\u00f4t que celui du plaignant lorsqu'elle nie lui avoir indiqu\u00e9 que le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective ne permettait pas d'exercer l'option d'assurance sur la vie d'un conjoint de m\u00eame sexe. De plus, je ne vois pas quel pouvait \u00eatre l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de Lucie Laroche \u00e0 cacher cette information au plaignant.\n[134] Pour les motifs ci-avant \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, je n'accorde pas foi au t\u00e9moignage du plaignant lorsqu'il affirme que, lors d'une session d'information tenue le 15 juin 1998, Lucie Laroche a annonc\u00e9 que dor\u00e9navant le conjoint homosexuel \u00e9tait \u00e9ligible \u00e0 toutes les options d'assurance pr\u00e9vues au r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective. Cette pr\u00e9tention est d'autant peu plausible en retenant le t\u00e9moignage de la repr\u00e9sentante de l'assureur qui a affirm\u00e9 n'avoir jamais vu de r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective qui exclut les partenaires de m\u00eame sexe d'une partie des protections disponibles aux personnes \u00e0 charge.\n[135] Marc Genest, dans son t\u00e9moignage, a soutenu qu'en 1995 il a fait part, lors de sa rencontre avec Lucie Laroche, qu'il \u00e9tait victime de discrimination vu qu'on lui refusait de souscrire une assurance sur la vie de son conjoint. De plus, dans sa plainte, il relate :\n\u00ab Aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u ces informations, j'ai v\u00e9h\u00e9ment protest\u00e9 et signal\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait de discrimination flagrante. Toute d\u00e9marche s'est av\u00e9r\u00e9e infructueuse et on m'a dit qu'il n'y avait rien \u00e0 faire. \u00bb\n[136] En contre-interrogatoire, il a admis ne pas avoir affirm\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait victime de discrimination mais plut\u00f4t d'une situation qui n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e9quitable. Il a reconnu de plus que, devant l'impossibilit\u00e9 d'obtenir une assurance sur la vie de son conjoint, il n'a pas os\u00e9 insister trop fortement car il venait d'obtenir son statut d'employ\u00e9 permanent et il craignait de perdre son emploi. Cette explication peut sembler plausible. Toutefois, pourquoi n'est-il pas revenu \u00e0 la charge lors du renouvellement de son r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective en 1996 et 1997 ? La crainte d'une perte d'emploi ne pouvait, \u00e0 mon avis, \u00eatre une raison valable. Pourtant, il n'a rien fait.\n[137] Il a reconnu de plus qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 exercer de recours car il croyait qu'il n'y avait rien \u00e0 faire. C'est plut\u00f4t un ami qui a entrepris des d\u00e9marches pour lui lesquelles ont conduit au d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte le 4 novembre 2000.\n[138] Marc Genest a soutenu qu'il tenait \u00e0 souscrire une assurance sur la vie de son conjoint en plus de l'assurance-d\u00e9c\u00e8s et mutilation accidentels pour obtenir une protection financi\u00e8re ad\u00e9quate en cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ce dernier. Selon lui, son conjoint poss\u00e9dait une assurance-vie \u00e0 ce moment de 50 000 $ dont il \u00e9tait le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Toutefois, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 sans \u00e9quivoque que cette assurance-vie \u00e9tait de 10 000 $.\n[139] Marc Genest a affirm\u00e9 qu'en 1997 son conjoint ne pouvait payer la prime de 800 $ pour son assurance-vie et que, moyennant qu'il devienne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la police, son p\u00e8re a acquitt\u00e9 la prime. Toutefois, tel que le d\u00e9montre la documentation fournie par l'assureur de son conjoint, Sun Life (Pi\u00e8ce I-10), le conjoint du plaignant n'avait pas acquitt\u00e9 les primes d'assurance dues en juillet, octobre 1994 et janvier 1995, de sorte que l'assurance a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e r\u00e9troactivement au 1er juillet 1994.\n[140] Marc Genest a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait important pour lui d'obtenir une assurance sur la vie de son conjoint parce que le couple avait un train de vie assez dispendieux. Ils occupaient un appartement de haute gamme et poss\u00e9daient chacun un v\u00e9hicule. Au cours des ann\u00e9es 1995 et 1996 et jusqu'\u00e0 l'automne 1997 la situation financi\u00e8re du couple, selon le plaignant, \u00e9tait bonne. Apr\u00e8s avoir soutenu que le revenu de son conjoint \u00e9tait d'environ 70 000 $ net, il fut forc\u00e9 d'admettre, en contre-interrogatoire, que pour les ann\u00e9es 1995 et 1996 le revenu annuel de son conjoint \u00e9tait de l'ordre d'environ 40 000 $ brut et encore moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 en 1997 en raison de son absence pour cause de maladie. De plus, il a d\u00fb reconna\u00eetre que son conjoint avait fait cession de ses biens en 1996. Il pr\u00e9tend n'avoir jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 par son conjoint des ennuis financiers qu'il rencontrait. Je ne puis me convaincre que le plaignant, qui a exprim\u00e9 entretenir une relation tr\u00e8s \u00e9troite avec son conjoint, n'ait pu \u00eatre inform\u00e9 de ses probl\u00e8mes financiers.\n[141] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 que l'information sur les options d'assurance pour le conjoint se faisait du bout des l\u00e8vres parce qu'en 1995 l'homosexualit\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas une situation reconnue et accept\u00e9e chez Bell Mobilit\u00e9. La pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve a plut\u00f4t d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s homosexuels \u00e9taient trait\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que les employ\u00e9s h\u00e9t\u00e9rosexuels. Les employ\u00e9s s'affichaient publiquement comme homosexuels et, lors de soir\u00e9es sociales organis\u00e9es par les employ\u00e9s, on faisait des spectacles en blaguant sur le sujet de l'homosexualit\u00e9. Des employ\u00e9s ont connu des cheminements de carri\u00e8re fort int\u00e9ressants chez Bell Mobilit\u00e9 et obtenu des postes cadre importants sans qu'il ne soit nullement tenu compte de leur orientation sexuelle. La pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve ne permet pas de reconna\u00eetre la th\u00e8se du plaignant voulant que les repr\u00e9sentants du service des ressources humaines n'aient pas inform\u00e9 les employ\u00e9s lors des sessions de formation de la possibilit\u00e9 d'assurer la vie d'un conjoint de m\u00eame sexe.\n[142] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9, dans son t\u00e9moignage, qu'entre 1995 et 1998 Bell Mobilit\u00e9 n'a fourni \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s aucune information relativement au r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective ni aucune session d'information pour leur expliquer les modifications au r\u00e9gime d'assurance. Cette affirmation n'est nullement corrobor\u00e9e par l'ensemble de la preuve sur ce point. De fait, lors du renouvellement annuel de l'assurance collective, les employ\u00e9s ont re\u00e7u une brochure explicative du r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective et ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9s \u00e0 apporter des modifications \u00e0 leur r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective selon leurs besoins et leur situation qui auraient pu changer comparativement \u00e0 l'ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. De plus des sessions d'information ont eu lieu pour tous les employ\u00e9s (Pi\u00e8ce I-7).\n[143] La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu'en 1996 Michel C\u00f4t\u00e9, alors coordonnateur de l'administration chez Bell Mobilit\u00e9 et homosexuel, a souscrit une assurance sur la vie de son conjoint de m\u00eame sexe.\n[144] Marc Genest a affirm\u00e9 avec conviction qu'il n'avait jamais envoy\u00e9 de courriel \u00e0 Julie Walbrecq. Toutefois, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il avait adress\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 Julie Walbrecq le 11 septembre 2000 (Pi\u00e8ce I-1, onglet 7).\n[145] Marc Genest fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, dans ce courriel, \u00e0 une option d'assurance-vie de base au montant de 20 000 $ pour les conjoints de sexe oppos\u00e9. Or, il est tr\u00e8s clair, m\u00eame pour une personne qui a peu de connaissance dans le domaine des assurances, \u00e0 la page 18 de la brochure Avantages \u00e0 la carte (Pi\u00e8ce I-6), qu'il n'existe aucune option d'assurance-vie de base pour les conjoints de m\u00eame sexe ou de sexe oppos\u00e9. La seule couverture de base en assurance-vie \u00e9tait de 10 000 $ et elle s'appliquait uniquement \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9.\n[146] De plus, le plaignant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans sa plainte que la prime d'assurance-vie de base du conjoint devait \u00eatre pay\u00e9e par pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement direct sur la paie. La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que cette pr\u00e9tention \u00e9tait erron\u00e9e.\n[147] Marc Genest a affirm\u00e9 que, suite au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son conjoint, il en a inform\u00e9 Lucie Laroche qui s'est empress\u00e9e de lui rappeler que son conjoint n'avait aucune couverture d'assurance-vie. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, Lucie Laroche reconna\u00eet avoir eu une conversation avec le plaignant, non pas suite au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son conjoint mais quelques mois plus tard, et elle nie lui avoir formul\u00e9 une telle remarque. Je ne vois pas ce qui aurait pu motiver Lucie Laroche \u00e0 agir de la sorte.\n[148] Le procureur du plaignant affirme qu'il n'existait pas chez Bell Mobilit\u00e9 une politique informant clairement les employ\u00e9s de la possibilit\u00e9 d'obtenir une couverture d'assurance pour le conjoint de m\u00eame sexe. Selon lui, l'information \u00e9tait transmise sur demande seulement. Si l'on transpose cette vision \u00e0 la situation du plaignant, il aurait demand\u00e9 une assurance-d\u00e9c\u00e8s et mutilation accidentels pour son conjoint et une assurance dentaire et on l'aurait inform\u00e9 que ces options \u00e9taient reconnues et pourquoi n'aurait-on pas fourni la m\u00eame information \u00e0 la demande d'assurance-vie ? Je ne vois pas pourquoi on aurait agi diff\u00e9remment dans le cas de l'assurance-vie pour le conjoint de m\u00eame sexe que dans les cas de l'assurance-d\u00e9c\u00e8s et mutilation accidentels et de l'assurance dentaire.\n[149] La pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve m'am\u00e8ne \u00e0 conclure qu'en juin 1995, au moment d'exercer son choix d'options d'assurance, tant pour lui-m\u00eame que pour son conjoint, la brochure Avantages \u00e0 la carte lui fournissait des renseignements tr\u00e8s clairs lui permettant de comprendre qu'il lui \u00e9tait possible d'opter pour un r\u00e9gime d'assurance dentaire, un r\u00e9gime d'assurance-maladie, un r\u00e9gime d'assurance-d\u00e9c\u00e8s et mutilation accidentels et un r\u00e9gime d'assurance-vie tant pour lui-m\u00eame que pour son conjoint. De plus, les informations transmises par les repr\u00e9sentantes du service des ressources humaines lui permettaient d'exercer des choix bien \u00e9clair\u00e9s. En effet, il a opt\u00e9 pour le r\u00e9gime d'assurance dentaire \u00e0 l'endroit de son conjoint car il croyait que les soins dentaires s'av\u00e9raient souvent n\u00e9cessaires. Il n'a pas cru bon de choisir l'assurance-maladie pour son conjoint parce qu'il \u00e9tait convaincu que celui-ci \u00e9tait en bonne sant\u00e9. Quant \u00e0 l'assurance-d\u00e9c\u00e8s et mutilation accidentels, Marc Genest s'est empress\u00e9 d'y souscrire son conjoint pour un montant de 200 000 $ et ce, pour les motifs tout \u00e0 fait justifi\u00e9s qu'il a exprim\u00e9s dans son t\u00e9moignage. Concernant l'assurance-vie de son conjoint, je ne crois pas que l'intim\u00e9e, par ses agissements, l'ait emp\u00each\u00e9 ou lui ait refus\u00e9 de l'obtenir. Je ne pense pas que Marc Genest, sachant que son conjoint disposait d'une assurance-vie au montant de 50 000 $ dont il \u00e9tait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, ait r\u00e9ellement eu l'intention de souscrire une assurance sur la vie de son conjoint.\nV. CONCLUSION [150] J'estime que Marc Genest n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir la preuve prima facie que Bell Mobilit\u00e9 a pos\u00e9 un acte discriminatoire \u00e0 son endroit en le traitant de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9favorable en emploi \u00e0 cause de son orientation sexuelle et de son \u00e9tat matrimonial et ce, en lui refusant de se pr\u00e9valoir d'une couverture d'assurance sur la vie de son conjoint.\n[151] En cons\u00e9quence, la plainte est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nRoger Doyon\nLe 4 juin 2004\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT753\/0303\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nMarc Genest c Bell Mobilit\u00e9\nDATES ET LIEU\nDE L'AUDIENCE :\nMontr\u00e9al (Qu\u00e9bec)\nles 8, 9, 10 et 11 d\u00e9cembre 2003\nles 9 et 11 f\u00e9vrier 2004\nDATE DE LA D\u00c9CISION\nDU TRIBUNAL :\nle 4 juin 2004\nONT COMPARU :\nNo\u00ebl Saint-Pierre\nPour le plaignant\nJohanne Cav\u00e9\nPour l'intim\u00e9e",

Grant Sinclair\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] Le plaignant, Maurice Bressette, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne une plainte en date du 30 mars 2002 contre l'intim\u00e9, le Conseil de bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle Point et de Stony Point. Dans sa plainte, le plaignant all\u00e8gue que l'intim\u00e9 a exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille en refusant de l'embaucher \u00e0 titre de travailleur en service social familial, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l'art. 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[2] Le 30 octobre 2003, le Tribunal a tenu une audience pr\u00e9liminaire pour examiner deux requ\u00eates, l'une pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 qui conteste la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal en vertu de l'art. 67 de la Loi, et l'autre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant qui vise \u00e0 modifier sa plainte afin d'y ajouter des all\u00e9gations voulant que l'intim\u00e9 ait exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre lui et contrevenu ainsi \u00e0 l'art. 14.1 de la Loi.\n[3] La requ\u00eate du plaignant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience pr\u00e9liminaire. Le Tribunal a plut\u00f4t ordonn\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 modifier la plainte soit examin\u00e9e par voie d'observations \u00e9crites des parties, les observations \u00e9crites du plaignant devant \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9es avant le 7 novembre 2003 et celles de l'intim\u00e9, avant le 17 novembre 2003. En outre, le Tribunal a indiqu\u00e9 que l'audience se d\u00e9roulerait du 19 au 23 avril 2004 et du 26 au 30 avril 2004. Les dates de divulgation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9es au 31 mars 2004 (plaignant) et au 27 f\u00e9vrier 2004 (intim\u00e9).\n[4] Le TCDP et les tribunaux provinciaux des droits de la personne ont rendu un certain nombre de d\u00e9cisions traitant de la modification d'une plainte pour y ajouter une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles. (Voir Kavanagh c. Service correctionnel du Canada (31 mai 1999), T505\/2298 (T.C.D.P.); Entrop c. Compagnie p\u00e9troli\u00e8re imp\u00e9riale Lt\u00e9e (1994) 23 C.H.R.R. D\/186; Fowler v. Flicka Gymnastics Club, [1998] (T.D.P.C.-B. no 2); Schnell c. Machiavelli Associates c. John Micka (25 avril 2001), T\/594\/5200 (T.C.D.P.)).\n[5] Certains principes d\u00e9coulent de ces d\u00e9cisions. Une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission n'a rien d'une mise en accusation. Le Tribunal a le pouvoir de modifier une plainte afin d'y ajouter d'autres all\u00e9gations, dans la mesure o\u00f9 un pr\u00e9avis suffisant est donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 afin de ne pas lui causer pr\u00e9judice et de lui permettre de se d\u00e9fendre de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e. Le fait que la modification propos\u00e9e porte sur un article de la Loi qui est diff\u00e9rent de celui invoqu\u00e9 dans la plainte initiale ne prive pas le Tribunal de sa comp\u00e9tence.\n[6] Il ne devrait pas \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire que des all\u00e9gations voulant que des repr\u00e9sailles aient \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9es \u00e0 la suite d'une plainte donnent lieu \u00e0 une instance distincte. En fait, on devrait autoriser une modification, \u00e0 moins qu'il soit manifeste et \u00e9vident que les all\u00e9gations faisant l'objet de la demande de modification ne sauraient \u00eatre jug\u00e9es fond\u00e9es. Un exemple \u00e9vident, du moins pour ce qui est des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles, serait un cas o\u00f9 on pourrait d\u00e9montrer que les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s actes de repr\u00e9sailles se sont produits avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. Le Tribunal ne devrait pas s'engager dans un examen approfondi du bien-fond\u00e9 de la modification. Un tel examen devrait \u00eatre fait uniquement au regard de l'ensemble de la preuve, au terme d'une audience en bonne et due forme.\n[7] Dans ses observations \u00e9crites, le plaignant fait \u00e9tat de nombreux incidents qui sont survenus apr\u00e8s le 30 mars 2002 et qui, all\u00e8gue-t-il, constituent des repr\u00e9sailles. \u00c0 mon avis, quelques-uns des multiples incidents cit\u00e9s par le plaignant peuvent \u00e0 juste titre \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9s de repr\u00e9sailles. Il n'est pas manifeste et \u00e9vident que ces all\u00e9gations du plaignant ne sauraient \u00eatre jug\u00e9es fond\u00e9es.\n[8] Cela ne veut pas dire que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli que l'intim\u00e9 a contrevenu au paragraphe 14.1 de la Loi. Le plaignant devra prouver cela \u00e0 l'audience. Le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal a simplement conclu que la plainte initiale doit \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e afin d'y ajouter une all\u00e9gation aux termes de l'article 14.1 de la Loi.\n[9] Dans ses observations \u00e9crites, l'intim\u00e9 fait valoir que les observations et la documentation du plaignant ne sont que la continuation d'un dialogue entre le chef de bande, l'administrateur de la bande et le Conseil de bande, et que cela ne devrait ni ne saurait \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sailles. \u00c0 mon avis, ce n'est pas une raison de refuser la modification. Il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un argument \u00e0 faire valoir, \u00e0 l'appui de la preuve, au moment de l'audience.\n[10] Enfin, en ce qui touche la question du pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, je constate que ce dernier sait depuis au moins le 22 octobre 2003, date \u00e0 laquelle remonte le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa requ\u00eate, que le plaignant avait l'intention de demander cette modification. L'intim\u00e9 sait \u00e9galement depuis cette date quels sont les incidents et la documentation sur lesquels le plaignant se fonde. De plus, depuis le 7 novembre 2003, le plaignant a divulgu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 d'autres documents d\u00e9crivant d'autres incidents qu'il entend citer. Le plaignant doit par ailleurs faire une pleine divulgation avant le 31 mars 2004.\n[11] \u00c0 mon avis, l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisamment inform\u00e9 de la preuve \u00e0 r\u00e9futer et ne subira aucun pr\u00e9judice si le Tribunal autorise la modification.\n[12] Par cons\u00e9quent, il est fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate du plaignant visant \u00e0 modifier la plainte initiale afin d'y ajouter une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles aux termes de l'art. 14.1 de la Loi.\nSigned by\nJ.

INTRODUCTION\nII. LE DROIT\nIII. CONCLUSION\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision vise \u00e0 trancher l'objection relative \u00e0 un rapport d'expert pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le plaignant. Le rapport en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli par Mme Frances Henry, qui semble \u00eatre \u00e9minemment qualifi\u00e9e en tant qu'experte en mati\u00e8re de racisme. Mme Henry est titulaire d'un doctorat en anthropologie sociale, a publi\u00e9 de nombreux ouvrages et a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 comme experte devant nombre de cours et de tribunaux. \u00c0 ce stade-ci de l'instance \u00e0 tout le moins, ses comp\u00e9tences ne sont pas contest\u00e9es.\n[2] Dans l'introduction de son rapport, Mme Henry pose deux questions :\nEst-il possible ou non que la race ait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans le classement du plaignant au 13e rang dans la liste d'admissibilit\u00e9, ou est-ce simplement le fait du favoritisme et de l'incomp\u00e9tence du jury de s\u00e9lection? Est-il possible ou non que le refus de nommer le plaignant pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e de six mois, m\u00eame s'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 satisfait aux crit\u00e8res juridiques \u00e0 un certain nombre d'occasions, soit un acte de racisme?\nJ'aurais pens\u00e9 que le Tribunal \u00e9tait d\u00fbment saisi de chacune de ces possibilit\u00e9s.\n[3] Mme Henry d\u00e9crit ensuite un cadre fondamental d'\u00e9valuation de ces questions. Elle affirme qu'il existe une nouvelle forme de racisme qui a remplac\u00e9 des formes de racisme traditionnelles et d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9es. Ce genre de racisme comprend [TRADUCTION] des formes de comportement et des attitudes plus cach\u00e9es, plus subtiles et parfois m\u00eame inconscientes qui n'en sont pas moins discriminatoires \u00e0 l'endroit des groupes minoritaires. Cette nouvelle forme de racisme se manifeste par un d\u00e9ni de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 qui occulte les motivations raciales sous-jacentes \u00e0 de nombreux actes discriminatoires en milieu de travail. Comme l'indique Mme Henry \u00e0 la page 3 de son rapport, il s'agit [TRADUCTION] d'un refus d'accepter la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 du racisme en d\u00e9pit des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s raciaux et de la discrimination raciale manifestes auxquels se heurtent les personnes de couleur dans leur vie et en ce qui touche leurs chances d'\u00e9panouissement.\n[4] Mme Henry applique ensuite ces observations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales aux faits de l'esp\u00e8ce. Cependant, le rapport ne fournit gu\u00e8re de donn\u00e9es statistiques ou scientifiques qui pourraient nous \u00e9clairer sur la situation particuli\u00e8re dont je suis saisi. L'id\u00e9e ma\u00eetresse de son argumentation est simplement que ce d\u00e9faut de perception est le principal facteur qui a engendr\u00e9 la situation qui nous occupe. Le probl\u00e8me que pose cette approche est qu'elle taxe de racisme quiconque rejette les all\u00e9gations du plaignant. Bien s\u00fbr, ces accusations portent l'imprimatur d'un expert, ce qui ne fait que mettre l'intim\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9fensive et rompt l'\u00e9quilibre sur lequel doit reposer une audience \u00e9quitable. Dans la pratique, il est impossible de faire de telles affirmations sans donner d'opinion au sujet de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins qui seront cit\u00e9s par l'autre partie. Il ne s'agit pas l\u00e0 d'une question qui se pr\u00eate \u00e0 des t\u00e9moignages d'opinion.\n[5] Le plaignant a fait valoir que le rapport est n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9futer les conclusions formul\u00e9es dans le rapport de la Commission de la fonction publique. Ce rapport, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 comme pi\u00e8ce \u00e0 l'audience, traite des m\u00eames all\u00e9gations fondamentales que celles dont le Tribunal est saisi. Le fait est que l'enqu\u00eateur de la Commission, Ella Coffil, a rejet\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations du plaignant. M. Bagambiire et M. Flaherty ont donc soutenu que le rapport de Mme Henry constitue un correctif n\u00e9cessaire aux opinions exprim\u00e9es dans son rapport. Ce genre d'argument ne saurait \u00eatre admis. Bien que le rapport puisse pr\u00e9senter un certain int\u00e9r\u00eat du point de vue de l'\u00e9tablissement de la chronologie et de certains faits en l'esp\u00e8ce, on ne saurait y formuler des opinions sur une question fondamentale dont le Tribunal est saisi. Il incombe exclusivement au Tribunal de d\u00e9terminer si M. Brooks a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination aux termes de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[6] Cela dit, une r\u00e9serve s'impose. Je partage maintes pr\u00e9occupations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le rapport Henry et je ne veux pas emp\u00eacher le plaignant de plaider sa cause. M. Brooks est libre de pr\u00e9tendre que les personnes qui ont pris les d\u00e9cisions au sujet de son emploi n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de discerner les \u00e9l\u00e9ments raciaux qu'elles comportaient. Ce genre de pr\u00e9tention s'inscrit bien dans l'\u00e9ventail de vues formul\u00e9es habituellement dans une affaire de cette nature. En outre, je conviens qu'un tribunal devrait veiller \u00e0 prendre ses distances par rapport \u00e0 tout point de vue adopt\u00e9 par l'enqu\u00eateur de la Commission. Il est incontestable que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur les faits et la preuve dont il est saisi plut\u00f4t que sur les id\u00e9es pr\u00e9con\u00e7ues des parties.\nII. LE DROIT [7] Le crit\u00e8re de recevabilit\u00e9 d'un rapport d'expert a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans R. c. Mohan, [1994] 2 R.C.S. 9. Dans cet arr\u00eat, le juge Sopinka affirme que l'admission de la preuve d'expert repose sur l'application des quatre crit\u00e8res suivants :\nla pertinence; le caract\u00e8re n\u00e9cessaire de l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve; l'absence de toute r\u00e8gle d'exclusion; les comp\u00e9tences de l'expert.\nLa Cour ajoute qu'une analyse co\u00fbts-avantages devrait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e pour d\u00e9terminer si la valeur probatoire d'un rapport d'expert l'emporte sur son effet pr\u00e9judiciable.\n[8] Le premier crit\u00e8re est donc celui de la pertinence. L'avocat du plaignant semble pr\u00e9senter deux arguments. Le premier veut simplement que le rapport de Mme Henry soit pertinent parce qu'il tend \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que la race est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui a jou\u00e9 dans les d\u00e9cisions prises au sujet de M. Brooks. Le probl\u00e8me que pose cet argument est qu'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'est fourni \u00e0 l'appui d'une telle conclusion dans le rapport. Le document ne comporte aucune analyse statistique ou sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e que l'on trouverait normalement dans un rapport d'expert. Le deuxi\u00e8me argument a trait \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Sur ce plan, il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans le rapport que l'enqu\u00eateuse de la Commission de la fonction publique n'a pas tenu compte de la possibilit\u00e9 que les faits de l'esp\u00e8ce soient empreints de racisme, d'o\u00f9 l'insinuation voulant qu'elle entretenait des vues racistes. Les consid\u00e9rations de ce genre sont tout \u00e0 fait accessoires \u00e0 la question dont je suis saisi. Il n'y a aucune raison que je m'y arr\u00eate.\n[9] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il me semble que Mme Henry se soit content\u00e9e d'examiner les faits de l'esp\u00e8ce et d'informer le Tribunal qu'ils \u00e9tayent une conclusion de racisme. Ce genre d'assistance professionnelle va au-del\u00e0 du r\u00f4le l\u00e9gitime d'un expert. Je souscris \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour supr\u00eame de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse dans Campbell v. Jones, [2001] N.S.J. No 598 (QL), dans laquelle la cour pr\u00e9cise, au sujet d'un autre rapport de Mme Henry, que [TRADUCTION] rien dans le rapport ne justifie qu'on applique dans une cour de justice des principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux du domaine des sciences sociales \u00e0 la situation particuli\u00e8re du gendarme Campbell. M\u00eame si, dans Campbell, la cour \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par les effets d'une telle preuve sur le jury, la pr\u00e9occupation fondamentale se situe au niveau du r\u00f4le des faits et des opinions dans la proc\u00e9dure juridique. De simples expressions d'opinions ne sont gu\u00e8re utiles lorsqu'il s'agit de d\u00e9cider si un plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination.\n[10] La deuxi\u00e8me question est la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9. Dans Mohan (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9), la Cour supr\u00eame a soutenu qu'un rapport d'expert vise \u00e0 fournir une conclusion qu'on ne pourrait tirer sans la preuve de l'expert. Au paragraphe 21, la Cour souscrit \u00e0 l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 formul\u00e9 par le juge Dickson dans R. c. Abbey, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 24 (\u00e0 la p. 42) :\nLe r\u00f4le d'un expert est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de fournir au juge et au jury une conclusion toute faite que ces derniers, en raison de la technicit\u00e9 des faits, sont incapables de formuler. [TRADUCTION] L'opinion d'un expert est recevable pour donner \u00e0 la cour des renseignements scientifiques qui, selon toute vraisemblance, d\u00e9passent l'exp\u00e9rience et la connaissance d'un juge ou d'un jury. Si, \u00e0 partir des faits \u00e9tablis par la preuve, un juge ou un jury peut \u00e0 lui seul tirer ses propres conclusions, alors l'opinion de l'expert n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire.\nC'est dans ce contexte que la question de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e.\n[11] Un tribunal ne devrait pas appliquer trop scrupuleusement une norme comme celle de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9. Il faut se poser la question \u00e0 savoir si la preuve est n\u00e9cessaire logiquement plut\u00f4t que du point de vue probatoire. Il doit y avoir une raison d'appeler un expert et le simple fait que le t\u00e9moignage semble aider la cause d'une des parties n'est pas suffisant. Une partie n'a pas le droit d'\u00e9tayer sa preuve en fournissant au Tribunal les opinions d'experts qui se trouvent \u00e0 partager sa vision des choses. On ne saurait trancher une plainte en sondant les experts.\n[12] Il y a d'autres pr\u00e9occupations dans le contexte de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9. L'une d'elles r\u00e9side dans le fait que le Tribunal des droits de la personne est un tribunal sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 qui est lui-m\u00eame expert en mati\u00e8re de discrimination. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est \u00e0 m\u00eame de parvenir, sans l'aide d'un expert, \u00e0 une opinion \u00e9clair\u00e9e quant au poids et \u00e0 la valeur d'une preuve de discrimination. Une autre pr\u00e9occupation a trait \u00e0 la nature du rapport, qui pr\u00f4ne une certaine interpr\u00e9tation de la preuve dont le Tribunal est saisi. Dans Brough v. Richmond, 2003 B.C.S.C. 512, la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique affirme (au par. 14) :\n[TRADUCTION] : Un expert ne peut prendre fait et cause pour quelqu'un. Tout expert devrait \u00e9viter de plaider la cause, r\u00f4le qu'il convient de laisser au conseil. Surrey Credit Union v. Willson, [1990] B.C.J. no 766 (C.S.) (\u00e0 la p. 5). Les avis d'experts deviennent inadmissibles quand ils ne sont rien de plus qu'une expression ou une reformulation des arguments des avocats qui participent \u00e0 la cause. Quand un argument est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sous le couvert d'un rapport d'expert, il sera rejet\u00e9 pour ce qu'il est.\nJe crois que ces observations s'appliquent au rapport pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le plaignant.\n[13] La troisi\u00e8me pr\u00e9occupation est plus fondamentale. Bien qu'elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 assouplie ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, la r\u00e8gle qui emp\u00eache de fournir une opinion sur le point litigieux dont le tribunal est saisi doit tout de m\u00eame \u00eatre respect\u00e9e. Le tribunal ne saurait d\u00e9l\u00e9guer ses responsabilit\u00e9s \u00e0 des experts, qui n'ont ni la formation juridique de ses membres, ni leur capacit\u00e9 d'appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve, ni leur exp\u00e9rience dans le domaine de l'arbitrage. Tout organisme d'arbitrage a l'obligation de tirer ses propres conclusions sur les aspects fondamentaux d'une plainte, sans b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de directives de la part des parties.\n[14] Le rapport de Mme Henry est pr\u00e9judiciable au vrai sens du terme. Il renferme des commentaires sur la preuve que l'intim\u00e9 entend pr\u00e9senter et donne \u00e0 croire que le Tribunal ne pourra tirer qu'une seule conclusion \u00e0 la fin de l'audience. \u00c0 mon avis, cela mine l'ind\u00e9pendance de la proc\u00e9dure et empi\u00e8te implicitement sur le droit de l'intim\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter sa preuve. Cela risque d'entraver la capacit\u00e9 du Tribunal de se prononcer librement sur les choix qui lui sont soumis par les diff\u00e9rentes parties. C'est l\u00e0 exactement ce qu'une preuve d'expert ne doit pas faire.\nIII. CONCLUSION [15] Lorsque j'applique le genre d'analyse co\u00fbt-avantages envisag\u00e9e par la Cour supr\u00eame dans Mohan, je conclus que le rapport de Mme Henry ne satisfait pas \u00e0 la norme \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans la jurisprudence. Il devrait donc \u00eatre exclu de la preuve. Cette conclusion est conforme \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision rendue dans Singh c. Statistique Canada (5 janvier 1998; transcription ci-incluse), o\u00f9 les Membres instructeurs on rendu une d\u00e9cision similaire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un rapport ant\u00e9rieur de Mme Henry.\nPaul Groarke\nHALIFAX (Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse)\nle 8 juin 2004\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT838\/8803\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nCecil Brooks c.

LA PREUVE A. Preuve du plaignant (i) Bruno Boudreault [3] Bruno Boudreault est un r\u00e9sidant de l'\u00cele-aux-Coudres. En 1998, il a travaill\u00e9 comme journalier au chantier maritime du Groupe Oc\u00e9an \u00e0 l'\u00cele-aux-Coudres. En juillet 1998, il a subi une intervention chirurgicale au genou gauche. Au printemps de 1999, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 par les Croisi\u00e8res A.M.L. \u00e0 titre de journalier assign\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration des bateaux pour la saison touristique. Puis, il a travaill\u00e9 comme pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la maintenance et animateur en loisirs \u00e0 l'H\u00f4tel Cap-aux-Pierres situ\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00cele-aux-Coudres jusqu'en septembre 1999. En mars 2000, il a obtenu un emploi de matelot et timonier sur le navire de croisi\u00e8re le Cavalier Maxime, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Croisi\u00e8res A.M.L.\n[4] Au cours de l'hiver 2001, \u00e0 la suggestion d'un ami, il a communiqu\u00e9 avec Andr\u00e9e Viger qui travaillait, suivant ses informations, pour Logistec Navigation afin de solliciter un emploi de matelot sur un navire qui devait voyager au cours de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le Grand Nord. Andr\u00e9e Viger lui a demand\u00e9 de lui transmettre son curriculum vitae (c.v.) et un certificat d'examen m\u00e9dical. Il lui a transmis son c.v. et son attestation de cours de formation d'urgence en mer (F.U.M.).\n[5] Le plaignant raconte que le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2001, il s'est rendu rencontrer le Dr Marcel \u00c9thier \u00e0 l'\u00cele-aux-Coudres qui \u00e9tait d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par Transports Canada pour proc\u00e9der aux \u00e9valuations m\u00e9dicales. Le docteur \u00c9thier a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical. Le plaignant affirme qu'il a fait part au m\u00e9decin de l'intervention subie au genou gauche. Le Dr \u00c9thier a d\u00e9livr\u00e9 le certificat m\u00e9dical requis (Pi\u00e8ce P-11) que le plaignant a transmis \u00e0 Andr\u00e9e Viger.\n[6] Andr\u00e9e Viger a communiqu\u00e9 de nouveau avec le plaignant pour lui souligner que, s'il pouvait d\u00e9tenir un brevet d'homme de quart \u00e0 la passerelle ou timonier, il augmenterait d'autant ses chances d'embauche. Le plaignant a obtenu son brevet de timonier le 9 mai 2001 (Pi\u00e8ce P-14). Sur r\u00e9ception de ce document, Andr\u00e9e Viger l'a inform\u00e9 qu'il avait obtenu un emploi comme timonier d\u00e9bardeur et que \u00c9douard Nadeau, mandat\u00e9 comme gestionnaire du personnel, communiquerait avec lui pour lui faire part des modalit\u00e9s d'emploi.\n[7] Le t\u00e9moin raconte avoir re\u00e7u un appel d'\u00c9douard Nadeau pour confirmer son embauche comme timonier d\u00e9bardeur. \u00c9douard Nadeau lui a demand\u00e9 s'il s'y connaissait dans les travaux de d\u00e9bardage. Il d\u00e9clare avoir r\u00e9pondu qu'il avait vu des d\u00e9bardeurs faire le travail mais qu'il n'avait aucune exp\u00e9rience en la mati\u00e8re. \u00c9douard Nadeau lui a demand\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 bord du navire Umiavut au port de Valleyfield le 16 juin 2001 et qu'il le rencontrerait personnellement sur place. \u00c0 la demande du plaignant, \u00c9douard Nadeau a consenti \u00e0 ce qu'il reporte son arriv\u00e9e au lendemain, dimanche, 17 juin 2001. Le t\u00e9moin se souvient qu'\u00e0 son arriv\u00e9e il a rencontr\u00e9 \u00c9douard Nadeau pour signer son contrat de travail (Pi\u00e8ce P-I). Ce dernier lui a fait visiter le navire. Il lui a remis son carnet de marin pour qu'il soit transmis au capitaine selon les normes en vigueur.\n[8] Le t\u00e9moin d\u00e9clare ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 du travail qu'il aurait \u00e0 effectuer lors de l'arr\u00eat du navire dans les ports. Le chef d'\u00e9quipage lui avait toutefois mentionn\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait possible qu'il soit affect\u00e9 \u00e0 la conduite d'un remorqueur.\n[9] Le t\u00e9moin se souvient, qu'\u00e0 la demande du premier ma\u00eetre, il a d\u00e9but\u00e9 son travail de surveillance de 20 h 00 \u00e0 minuit. Il effectuait un quart de travail de quatre heures et une p\u00e9riode de repos de huit heures suivi d'un quart de travail de quatre heures. Le mardi ou mercredi, il \u00e9tait couch\u00e9, suite \u00e0 son quart de travail qui s'\u00e9tait termin\u00e9 \u00e0 8 h 00, lorsqu'il fut r\u00e9veill\u00e9 par le premier ma\u00eetre qui lui fit part qu'il devait se pr\u00e9senter au bureau du capitaine.\n[10] Il s'est rendu au bureau du capitaine Robert B\u00e9langer o\u00f9 il a fait la connaissance de ce dernier et d'Andr\u00e9e Viger qui \u00e9tait \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 la rencontre. Le capitaine lui a fait part qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 sa connaissance qu'il pla\u00e7ait de la glace sur son genou et qu'il craignait qu'il ait subi un accident sur le bateau. Le t\u00e9moin a inform\u00e9 le capitaine que tel n'\u00e9tait pas le cas mais qu'il avait subi une intervention chirurgicale au genou en 1998 et qu'il lui arrivait de mettre de la glace sur son genou lorsqu'il sentait des raideurs mais que cette situation ne l'emp\u00eachait pas de faire son travail.\n[11] Comme sa condition physique semblait inqui\u00e9ter le capitaine B\u00e9langer, le t\u00e9moin d\u00e9clare lui avoir offert de communiquer avec son m\u00e9decin orthop\u00e9diste dont il lui a remis le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Il lui a \u00e9galement offert de se soumettre \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical d'un m\u00e9decin orthop\u00e9diste de son choix. Le capitaine B\u00e9langer lui a fait part qu'il \u00e9tudierait la situation et qu'il lui reparlerait au cours de la journ\u00e9e. Environ une demi-heure apr\u00e8s son retour \u00e0 sa cabine, il fut de nouveau convoqu\u00e9 au bureau du capitaine B\u00e9langer.\n[12] En arrivant dans le bureau, il a demand\u00e9 si on avait communiqu\u00e9 avec son m\u00e9decin orthop\u00e9diste. Andr\u00e9e Viger lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle avait deux options : soit de communiquer avec son m\u00e9decin et de le maintenir en emploi, soit de ne pas communiquer avec son m\u00e9decin et de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi. Le t\u00e9moin d\u00e9clare qu'il a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de quitter le navire pour se rendre au bureau de son m\u00e9decin \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec et de ramener son dossier m\u00e9dical. Cette suggestion ne fut pas retenue. Le capitaine B\u00e9langer lui a dit qu'il devait mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi parce que l'\u00e9tat de son genou ne permettait pas qu'il prenne le risque de maintenir ses services pour un voyage dans le Nord. \u00c0 la demande du plaignant, le capitaine B\u00e9langer lui a remis une lettre attestant la terminaison de son emploi en raison de probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 son genou gauche (Pi\u00e8ce P-2).\n[13] Bruno Boudreault a quitt\u00e9 imm\u00e9diatement le navire pour regagner son domicile. Il s'est arr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec. Le lendemain, par l'interm\u00e9diaire de sa procureure, il a transmis une mise en demeure \u00e0 Logistec Navigation l'enjoignant de le r\u00e9int\u00e9grer dans son emploi (Pi\u00e8ce P-3) avant le d\u00e9part du bateau pr\u00e9vu pour la fin de juin 2001. Cependant, comme cette mise en demeure ne visait pas l'employeur d\u00e9sign\u00e9 au contrat, une seconde mise en demeure a \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 l'employeur intim\u00e9, le 19 juillet 2001 contestant le bien-fond\u00e9 du cong\u00e9diement et exigeant la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration dans l'emploi.\n[14] Le plaignant relate qu'\u00e0 sa connaissance le navire a quitt\u00e9 le port de Valleyfield le 26 ou le 27 juin 2001. Il d\u00e9clare avoir communiqu\u00e9 avec Andr\u00e9e Viger pour la convaincre de lui permettre de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer son emploi. Il lui a transmis par fax, le 26 juin 2001, un rapport de son orthop\u00e9diste (Pi\u00e8ce P-4) indiquant qu'en date du 14 juin 1999 il \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 reprendre le travail suite \u00e0 une intervention chirurgicale au genou gauche en juillet 1998 (Pi\u00e8ce P-4). Andr\u00e9e Viger lui a fait part que quelqu'un d'autre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 et qu'elle ne pouvait rien faire pour lui. Le plaignant a \u00e9galement produit une lettre de l'orthop\u00e9diste qui l'a trait\u00e9 (Pi\u00e8ce P-6), dat\u00e9e du 4 octobre 2001, qui confirme que l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de son genou n'entra\u00eenait pas de restrictions fonctionnelles \u00e0 toute forme de travail.\n[15] L'intim\u00e9e a transmis au plaignant un premier relev\u00e9 d'emploi dat\u00e9 du 29 juin 2001 sans commentaire \u00e0 la section Observations (Pi\u00e8ce P-1). Le 16 juillet 2001, l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9mettait un second relev\u00e9 d'emploi o\u00f9 il mentionne \u00e0 la section Observations : Selon le capitaine, inapte au travail pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[16] Le t\u00e9moin raconte qu'apr\u00e8s avoir regagn\u00e9 son domicile il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s \u00e9branl\u00e9 par la perte de son emploi. Aussi, pendant quelques semaines il n'a pas fait de d\u00e9marches pour se trouver un emploi. Il s'est, par la suite, rendu au bureau de l'assurance-ch\u00f4mage et au bureau du syndicat des marins pour trouver un emploi mais sans succ\u00e8s. Il a \u00e9galement sollicit\u00e9 un emploi au chantier maritime du Groupe Oc\u00e9an et sur les navires de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re. Puis, il fut r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 le 31 juillet 2001 comme matelot timonier sur le navire \u00c9cho des Mers jusqu'au 12 octobre 2001. Du 13 mai 2002 au 21 septembre 2003, il a obtenu un emploi de premier officier sur le navire Famille Dufour II et il a repris le m\u00eame travail en 2003.\n[17] Le t\u00e9moin ajoute qu'en janvier 2003 il a suivi un cours pour le simulateur radar. Il entend suivre un cours en radiot\u00e9l\u00e9phonie lui permettant de se soumettre \u00e0 l'examen visant l'obtention de son brevet de capitaine en eaux secondaires.\nB. Preuve de l'intim\u00e9e (i) Robert B\u00e9langer [18] Le t\u00e9moin a d\u00e9but\u00e9 sa carri\u00e8re maritime comme matelot en 1975. \u00c0 compter de 1980, il a gravi les diff\u00e9rents \u00e9chelons de fonction d'officier pour obtenir, en 1995, le brevet de capitaine de long cours. Comme officier de pont, il a eu l'occasion de naviguer fr\u00e9quemment dans les r\u00e9gions arctiques du Canada particuli\u00e8rement sur le navire Lucien Paquin. Les activit\u00e9s de ce navire \u00e9taient concentr\u00e9es dans le transport de marchandises de toutes sortes destin\u00e9es aux postes et villages dans les r\u00e9gions de l'Arctique. Il proc\u00e9dait \u00e9galement au transport de marchandises d'un village \u00e0 l'autre et au retour de marchandises vers le sud, notamment \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.\n[19] En 2001, Transport Nanuk a retenu ses services comme capitaine sur le navire Umiavut dont la mission \u00e9tait la m\u00eame que celle du navire Lucien Paquin. L'\u00e9quipage du Umiavut se composait de personnel affect\u00e9 au d\u00e9partement de navigation. Il s'agit du capitaine qui doit superviser l'entit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te de l'activit\u00e9 maritime. Il doit s'assurer que la Loi sur la marine marchande du Canada et les r\u00e8glements de Transports Canada sont respect\u00e9s, notamment quant \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des membres d'\u00e9quipage, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du navire lui-m\u00eame et celle de tout ce qui est transport\u00e9 \u00e0 bord du navire. Il doit \u00eatre en mesure de prendre les dispositions requises en cas d'urgences telles que l'incendie ou une situation exigeant l'abandon du navire. Il maintient une liaison constante avec le propri\u00e9taire pour le tenir au courant de la progression du navire. Puis, il y a le chef officier charg\u00e9 des activit\u00e9s sp\u00e9cifiquement reli\u00e9es \u00e0 la cargaison. S'ajoutent trois officiers de navigation qui assument la responsabilit\u00e9 reli\u00e9e \u00e0 la progression du navire sur l'eau. Ils ex\u00e9cutent des quarts de veille de huit heures par jour divis\u00e9s en p\u00e9riode de quatre heures de travail \u00e0 partir d'un horaire d\u00e9butant \u00e0 minuit. Le d\u00e9partement de navigation comprend \u00e9galement trois timoniers. Chacun est affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un officier et travaille avec ce dernier.\n[20] Le timonier est affect\u00e9 \u00e0 la gouverne du navire vers une direction sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 partir des directives re\u00e7ues de l'officier de navigation. Lorsque les conditions le permettent, le syst\u00e8me de pilote automatique est mis en fonction. D\u00e8s lors, le timonier est assign\u00e9 \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s de vigie pour s'assurer que la progression du navire est s\u00e9curitaire.\n[21] Le personnel \u00e0 bord du Umiavut comprenait \u00e9galement cinq journaliers matelots et un chef matelot. L'\u00e9quipage comprenait \u00e9galement le personnel du d\u00e9partement de m\u00e9canique, soit le chef m\u00e9canicien et deux m\u00e9caniciens. Il se compl\u00e9tait par le personnel du d\u00e9partement alimentaire, soit le chef cuisinier et un cuisinier.\n[22] La livraison de marchandises dans le Nord du Qu\u00e9bec d\u00e9bute au moment de la lib\u00e9ration des glaces, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement entre le premier et le 15 juillet, pour se terminer avec le retour des glaces au d\u00e9but de novembre. Le capitaine B\u00e9langer pr\u00e9cise l'importance du respect des dates pr\u00e9vues de livraison.\n[23] En plus du transport de marchandises, le navire qui se rend dans le Nord du Qu\u00e9bec doit fournir \u00e9galement les services de d\u00e9bardage parce que les lieux de destination n'offrent pas d'am\u00e9nagements portuaires.\n[24] Le capitaine B\u00e9langer a d\u00e9crit les diff\u00e9rentes op\u00e9rations de d\u00e9chargement des marchandises. Une fois arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 un endroit de livraison, le navire est ancr\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire le plus pr\u00e8s possible de la jet\u00e9e. \u00c0 l'aide de grues sur le navire, le mat\u00e9riel de transit, soit deux remorqueurs et deux chalands, sont mis \u00e0 l'eau. Puis, des tracteurs et du mat\u00e9riel de d\u00e9chargement qui serviront \u00e0 la manutention des marchandises sur la jet\u00e9e sont plac\u00e9s sur les chalands. Les remorqueurs tirent les chalands sur la jet\u00e9e et les \u00e9quipements de manutention y sont d\u00e9charg\u00e9s. Par la suite, les remorqueurs et les chalands reviennent au navire afin de proc\u00e9der aux op\u00e9rations de d\u00e9chargement des marchandises. Une fois ces op\u00e9rations termin\u00e9es, il peut arriver que des marchandises soient amen\u00e9es au navire pour \u00eatre achemin\u00e9es vers une autre destination ou bien les \u00e9quipements sont ramen\u00e9s \u00e0 bord du navire, de m\u00eame que les chalands et les remorqueurs, et le navire se dirige vers un autre point de livraison.\n[25] Les op\u00e9rations de d\u00e9bardage sont confi\u00e9es aux membres d'\u00e9quipage \u00e0 l'exception des officiers, m\u00e9caniciens et cuisiniers. Pour les fins de manutention des marchandises \u00e0 d\u00e9charger, le capitaine B\u00e9langer a expliqu\u00e9 que des \u00e9lingues manipul\u00e9es par les membres d'\u00e9quipage sont plac\u00e9es autour des marchandises et rattach\u00e9es \u00e0 la grue pour la sortie du navire et le d\u00e9p\u00f4t sur les chalands.\n[26] Il y a le contrema\u00eetre de terre (beachmaster). Il n'est pas attitr\u00e9 \u00e0 la navigation. Pendant que le navire voyage en mer, il voit \u00e0 l'entretien de tous les \u00e9quipements servant au d\u00e9chargement des marchandises et pr\u00e9pare le d\u00e9roulement des op\u00e9rations de d\u00e9chargement \u00e0 l'arriv\u00e9e du navire au lieu de livraison. Lors du d\u00e9chargement, il se rend sur la jet\u00e9e pour s'assurer de la bonne marche des op\u00e9rations de d\u00e9chargement. Il est accompagn\u00e9 d'un op\u00e9rateur de tracteur et tous deux conduisent les tracteurs. Un matelot se rend sur la jet\u00e9e o\u00f9 il assume la fonction de v\u00e9rificateur. Il voit \u00e0 l'aspect administratif de la livraison des marchandises avec les gens concern\u00e9s.\n[27] Les remorqueurs sont op\u00e9r\u00e9s par un capitaine remorqueur. En raison de ses connaissances maritimes, cette responsabilit\u00e9 est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement celle du timonier. En plus de gouverner le remorqueur, il lui incombe, avec l'aide d'un matelot, de manipuler les arrimages servant \u00e0 tirer les chalands vers la jet\u00e9e.\n[28] Sur le navire, on retrouve un op\u00e9rateur de grue et un chef officier signaleur de grue qui doit s'assurer que le chargement des chalands se fait en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et selon les besoins convenus avec le contrema\u00eetre de terre. Dans la cale du navire, un op\u00e9rateur de camion \u00e0 fourchettes et deux matelots manipulent les marchandises pour le d\u00e9chargement.\n[29] Le capitaine B\u00e9langer a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effet que les membres d'\u00e9quipage doivent \u00eatre en mesure de r\u00e9pondre aux urgences sur le navire, soit la situation d'incendie \u00e0 bord du navire et la situation ultime d'abandon du navire. Le potentiel d'incendie se situe dans la salle des machines o\u00f9 l'on retrouve des quantit\u00e9s de p\u00e9trole. La moindre fuite peut g\u00e9n\u00e9rer un incendie. Il se retrouve \u00e9galement du c\u00f4t\u00e9 des marchandises \u00e0 bord du navire. Les membres d'\u00e9quipage doivent \u00eatre toujours pr\u00eats \u00e0 fournir un effort commun pour combattre les incendies en suivant les proc\u00e9dures de Transports Canada qui pr\u00e9voient les t\u00e2ches qui doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9volues au membre d'\u00e9quipage en pareille circonstance. Les officiers assument des t\u00e2ches de supervision et les matelots, incluant les timoniers, doivent combattre l'incendie. L'obligation d'abandon du navire est susceptible de se produire en cas d'incendie ou de collision avec les glaces ou un autre navire ce qui n\u00e9cessite la mise \u00e0 l'eau des embarcations de sauvetage.\n[30] Suite \u00e0 son embauche, le capitaine B\u00e9langer est mont\u00e9 \u00e0 bord du navire Umiavut \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res et il a fait le transit jusqu'au port de Valleyfield o\u00f9 il est arriv\u00e9 le 17 juin 2001. Normalement, le navire devait prendre la mer imm\u00e9diatement d\u00e8s le chargement compl\u00e9t\u00e9. Au cours de la journ\u00e9e, les membres d'\u00e9quipage ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 monter \u00e0 bord du navire. \u00c9douard Nadeau de la firme Great Circle Marine Services inc., qui agissait comme fournisseur du personnel \u00e0 bord du Umiavut \u00e0 l'exception du capitaine et du chef m\u00e9canicien, \u00e9tait \u00e0 bord pour l'accueil du personnel. Les op\u00e9rations de chargement ont d\u00e9but\u00e9 le lundi 18 juin 2001 pour se terminer normalement le vendredi suivant.\n[31] Le capitaine B\u00e9langer relate que le voyage \u00e9tait initialement pr\u00e9vu en eaux canadiennes mais, comme il devait se rendre \u00e0 Thule au Groenland, il est devenu un voyage de long cours international. Or, pour le personnel \u00e0 bord du navire, la r\u00e9glementation de Transports Canada est diff\u00e9rente qu'il s'agisse d'un voyage en eaux canadiennes ou d'un voyage de long cours international. \u00c0 titre d'exemple, le t\u00e9moin souligne que la r\u00e9glementation de Transports Canada exige que chaque membre d'\u00e9quipage fournisse un certificat m\u00e9dical conforme \u00e0 ses normes et ait r\u00e9ussi le cours de formation d'urgence en mer (F.U.M.). Quant au plaignant, il devait d\u00e9tenir un certificat d'homme de quart \u00e0 la passerelle. Pour un voyage en eaux secondaires, la r\u00e9glementation n'exige pas de certificat m\u00e9dical pour le matelot.\n[32] Le t\u00e9moin reconna\u00eet que Bruno Boudreault r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 toutes les exigences requises par Transports Canada pour accomplir les t\u00e2ches de timonier pour un voyage de long cours international. De plus, le travail \u00e0 accomplir par le plaignant lors des op\u00e9rations de d\u00e9chargement des marchandises n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 mais il estime qu'il aurait occup\u00e9 le poste de capitaine de remorqueur.\n[33] Il se souvient que le mardi 19 juin 2001 un membre d'\u00e9quipage l'a inform\u00e9 qu'il avait vu le plaignant placer de la glace sur son genou. Il a profit\u00e9 de la visite d'Andr\u00e9e Viger le lendemain 20 juin 2001 pour lui faire part de la situation. Il a dit \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re (page 303 des notes st\u00e9nographiques) :\n\u00ab J'aimerais \u00e7a qu'on puisse rencontrer la personne concern\u00e9e. De cette mani\u00e8re l\u00e0, un, je ne serais pas seul \u00e0 me faire un jugement puis, deux, bien vous seriez aussi au fait de poser des questions si n\u00e9cessaire. \u00bb\n[34] Le t\u00e9moin a fait venir le plaignant \u00e0 son bureau et il lui a fait part des informations qu'il avait re\u00e7ues. Il pr\u00e9tend que le plaignant a reconnu qu'il mettait de la glace sur son genou parce qu'il ressentait des douleurs \u00e0 la fin de sa journ\u00e9e de travail. Il ne peut fournir plus de pr\u00e9cision sur le contenu de cette discussion qui a dur\u00e9 15 \u00e0 20 minutes \u00e0 part le fait que le plaignant aurait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son malaise au genou r\u00e9sultait d'une situation survenue ant\u00e9rieurement. Le t\u00e9moin dit qu'il l'a remerci\u00e9 des explications fournies et que l'entrevue s'est termin\u00e9e sur cette note.\n[35] Apr\u00e8s discussion avec Andr\u00e9e Viger, le capitaine B\u00e9langer a pris la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 l'emploi de Bruno Boudreault parce qu'il a jug\u00e9 que le genou du plaignant ne pourrait gu\u00e9rir avec la charge de travail qui lui serait attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 bord du navire lequel exige une assiduit\u00e9 constante. Il pr\u00e9cise qu'il avait l'obligation d'assurer sur le navire, tant la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des membres d'\u00e9quipage que celle du plaignant lui-m\u00eame, et qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 irresponsable de sa part de maintenir l'emploi du plaignant.\n[36] En cons\u00e9quence, le capitaine B\u00e9langer raconte qu'il a fait venir \u00e0 nouveau le plaignant \u00e0 son bureau pour lui faire part de sa terminaison imm\u00e9diate d'emploi. Il lui a dit (page 309 des notes st\u00e9nographiques) :\n\u00ab... consid\u00e9rant la situation de son genou que moi je consid\u00e9rais que c'\u00e9tait un degr\u00e9 de difficult\u00e9 qui commen\u00e7ait apr\u00e8s deux jours de travail, je consid\u00e9rais \u00e7a comme quand m\u00eame pas s\u00e9curitaire pour lui-m\u00eame et pour le reste de l'\u00e9quipage d'avoir \u00e0 l'obliger \u00e0 suivre l'aventure dans l'Arctique pour une saison compl\u00e8te. \u00bb\n[37] Le t\u00e9moin reconna\u00eet que la possibilit\u00e9 de soumettre le plaignant \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e mais qu'elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue. Il explique qu'il ne lui \u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d'obtenir un avis m\u00e9dical pour lui faire part de ce qu'il savait d\u00e9j\u00e0, soit que le plaignant ressentait des douleurs au genou. Il a jug\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait imprudent de permettre \u00e0 une personne qui \u00e9prouve des douleurs au genou de partir dans les r\u00e9gions arctiques. Par ailleurs, \u00e0 la demande du plaignant, il a accept\u00e9 de lui remettre une lettre de fin d'emploi (Pi\u00e8ce P-2). Il se souvient que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9 par un matelot qui poss\u00e9dait un certificat d'homme de quart \u00e0 la passerelle et qu'un matelot additionnel a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 et est mont\u00e9 \u00e0 bord du navire \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec.\n[38] Interrog\u00e9 \u00e0 savoir s'il avait envisag\u00e9 des mesures d'accommodement qui auraient permis au plaignant de maintenir son emploi, le capitaine B\u00e9langer, sans r\u00e9pondre directement \u00e0 la question, a d'abord soutenu que les facilit\u00e9s d'h\u00e9bergement \u00e0 bord du navire ne permettaient pas l'embauche de personnel additionnel pour pallier aux absences possibles du plaignant. En second lieu, la continuit\u00e9 du travail lors des op\u00e9rations de d\u00e9chargement ne permettait pas le remplacement de personnel pour \u00e9viter une perte possible d'efficacit\u00e9 et un retard dans les d\u00e9lais de livraison \u00e0 respecter.\n(ii) Andr\u00e9e Viger [39] Andr\u00e9e Viger \u00e9tait, en 2001, coordonnatrice, ressources humaines chez Transport Nanuk. Elle s'occupait de l'embauche des employ\u00e9s de bureau de m\u00eame que celle du personnel naviguant \u00e0 bord du navire Aivik et de celle du capitaine et du chef m\u00e9canicien sur le navire Umiavut lou\u00e9 par Transport Nanuk. Comme l'intim\u00e9e devait proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'embauche du personnel naviguant pour le navire Umiavut, elle a fait appel \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e. Elle a fourni \u00e0 \u00c9douard Nadeau, repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9e, de l'aide en lui transmettant des c.v. de personnel marin. Elle pr\u00e9voyait qu'\u00c9douard Nadeau \u00e9prouve des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 trouver des membres d'\u00e9quipage en mesure de cumuler les t\u00e2ches de timonier et d\u00e9bardeur.\n[40] Au printemps 2001, Andr\u00e9e Viger se souvient que Bruno Boudreault a communiqu\u00e9 avec elle par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone pour solliciter un emploi comme matelot. Elle lui a demand\u00e9 de lui faire parvenir son c.v. Sur r\u00e9ception de ce document, elle a communiqu\u00e9 avec lui pour savoir s'il d\u00e9tenait un certificat d'homme de quart \u00e0 la passerelle. Le plaignant lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'il ne l'avait pas mais qu'il pouvait passer l'examen afin de l'obtenir car il disposait des pr\u00e9-requis \u00e0 cette fin. Apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu son certificat d'homme de quart \u00e0 la passerelle, le plaignant en a inform\u00e9 le t\u00e9moin qui lui a demand\u00e9 de lui transmettre le document par t\u00e9l\u00e9copie. Elle a, par la suite, avis\u00e9 verbalement le plaignant qu'elle avait transmis les renseignements \u00e0 \u00c9douard Nadeau qui communiquerait probablement avec lui pour lui offrir un emploi.\n[41] Le t\u00e9moin relate que le 20 juin 2001 elle s'est rendue au port de Valleyfield pour rencontrer le capitaine B\u00e9langer qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 bord du navire Umiavut. Lors de cette visite, le capitaine B\u00e9langer lui a fait part que le plaignant mettait de la glace sur son genou, qu'il souhaitait qu'elle assiste \u00e0 une rencontre avec ce dernier et elle a accept\u00e9.\n[42] \u00c0 l'arriv\u00e9e du plaignant dans son bureau, le capitaine B\u00e9langer lui a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 son attention qu'il mettait de la glace sur son genou gauche. Le plaignant a admis ce fait et racont\u00e9 qu'il avait subi une op\u00e9ration au genou gauche, qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas compl\u00e8tement gu\u00e9ri mais qu'il \u00e9tait en bonne voie de gu\u00e9rison. Il aurait ajout\u00e9 qu'il faisait de l'arthrite dans le genou et que la glace calmait la douleur. Le capitaine l'a pri\u00e9 de se retirer et a dit qu'il lui ferait conna\u00eetre sa d\u00e9cision.\n[43] Apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 le tout, le t\u00e9moin r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le capitaine a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'en fonction de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 il ne pourrait garder \u00e0 l'emploi une personne qui n'a pas toute sa capacit\u00e9 physique. Le capitaine B\u00e9langer a rappel\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 son bureau pour lui annoncer que pour sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 personnelle et celle des membres de l'\u00e9quipage il devait le remercier de ses services.\n[44] Le t\u00e9moin se souvient que le plaignant soutenait qu'il pouvait faire son travail. De plus, le plaignant a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 d'appeler son m\u00e9decin et de prendre les mesures pour fournir son dossier m\u00e9dical. Le t\u00e9moin d\u00e9clare ne pas avoir retenu ces suggestions sous pr\u00e9texte que le 20 juin 2001 \u00e9tait un mercredi et, le navire devant quitter le vendredi 22 juin 2001, elle n'avait pas le temps de communiquer avec le m\u00e9decin traitant du plaignant. Comme il insistait pour fournir son dossier m\u00e9dical, Andr\u00e9e Viger lui a mentionn\u00e9 de lui faire parvenir et elle a re\u00e7u du t\u00e9moin le 26 juin 2001, par t\u00e9l\u00e9copie, copie d'une lettre de l'orthop\u00e9diste Fran\u00e7ois Marquis.\n[45] Interrog\u00e9 sur la possibilit\u00e9 de soumettre le plaignant \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical d'un orthop\u00e9diste, le t\u00e9moin soutient qu'il lui \u00e9tait impossible dans un d\u00e9lai de deux jours d'obtenir un rendez-vous apr\u00e8s du Groupe Sant\u00e9 M\u00e9dicis, firme d'experts m\u00e9dicaux avec qui elle faisait affaires depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es.\n[46] Lorsque le plaignant a constat\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision du capitaine B\u00e9langer \u00e9tait irr\u00e9vocable, il lui a demand\u00e9 une lettre attestant sa fin d'emploi (Pi\u00e8ce I-2) et le t\u00e9moin l'a transmise par t\u00e9l\u00e9copie \u00e0 \u00c9douard Nadeau.\n[47] Pour rem\u00e9dier au d\u00e9part de Bruno Boudreault, le t\u00e9moin se souvient que le matelot Dave Cossette a \u00e9t\u00e9 promu timonier et son poste a \u00e9t\u00e9 combl\u00e9 par l'embauche d'un matelot.\n[48] Le t\u00e9moin a mentionn\u00e9 que le navire Umiavut devait quitter le port de Valleyfield le 22 juin 2001. Toutefois, la majorit\u00e9 des matelots \u00e0 bord ne disposait pas du certificat m\u00e9dical requis par Transports Canada devenu obligatoire parce que le navire devait faire un voyage de long cours en eaux internationales. Le t\u00e9moin r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'elle a pris les dispositions pour qu'un m\u00e9decin d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par Transports Canada se rende \u00e0 bord du navire le dimanche 24 juin 2001 afin de faire subir les examens m\u00e9dicaux et d\u00e9livrer les certificats m\u00e9dicaux requis.\n[49] Le t\u00e9moin r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le navire Umiavut a quitt\u00e9 le port de Valleyfield mardi le 26 juin 2001 pour son premier voyage dans le Grand Nord. Il est revenu le 28 ao\u00fbt 2001. Au cours de ce voyage, Dave Cossette, rempla\u00e7ant du plaignant, a re\u00e7u une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de 17 320,07 $ dont 10 296,74 $ comme timonier et 7 023,33 $ comme d\u00e9bardeur. Lors du second voyage du 3 septembre 2001 au 4 novembre 2001, le timonier St\u00e9phane Lavoie qui a remplac\u00e9 Dave Cossette a re\u00e7u une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de 17 358,35 $ soit 9 524,01 $ comme timonier et 7 834,34 $ comme d\u00e9bardeur.\n[50] Lors de la prise de d\u00e9cision de remercier le plaignant de ses services, le t\u00e9moin raconte que la possibilit\u00e9 de restreindre le travail du plaignant comme timonier et d\u00e9bardeur n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 envisag\u00e9e parce que le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 pour accomplir \u00e0 la fois les t\u00e2ches de timonier et d\u00e9bardeur. De plus, une restriction des t\u00e2ches aurait n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 le paiement d'heures de travail en temps suppl\u00e9mentaire.\n(iii) \u00c9douard Nadeau [51] \u00c9douard Nadeau est le pr\u00e9sident de l'intim\u00e9e, Great Circle Marine Services inc. Il s'agit d'une entreprise qui fournit le personnel appel\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler sur les navires. En 2001, l'intim\u00e9e a sign\u00e9 une entente avec Transport Umialarik pour la gestion d'\u00e9quipage sur le navire Umiavut \u00e0 l'exception du capitaine et du chef m\u00e9canicien. La repr\u00e9sentante de Umialarik, Andr\u00e9e Viger, a fait part au t\u00e9moin du personnel requis \u00e0 bord du navire. Elle lui a transmis le c.v. de Bruno Boudreault, le certificat m\u00e9dical et le brevet d'homme de quart \u00e0 la passerelle.\n[52] Il a communiqu\u00e9 avec le plaignant pour lui offrir un emploi de timonier d\u00e9bardeur sur le navire Umiavut. Comme il ne s'y connaissait pas dans le travail de d\u00e9bardeur, le t\u00e9moin a demand\u00e9 au plaignant s'il s'y connaissait dans ce genre de travail. Ce dernier l'a avis\u00e9 qu'il n'avait jamais fait ce genre de travail mais que, selon la description que ses amis lui en avaient faite, il pr\u00e9tendait \u00eatre en mesure de remplir la fonction. \u00c9douard Nadeau a mentionn\u00e9 au plaignant d'amener avec lui des v\u00eatements chauds sans lui pr\u00e9ciser ceux qu'il lui fournissait et qui apparaissaient au contrat individuel de travail sign\u00e9 \u00e0 bord du navire.\n[53] Le t\u00e9moin a fourni le personnel requis \u00e0 sa cliente. Il reconna\u00eet que certains membres d'\u00e9quipage, tout comme le plaignant, en \u00e9taient \u00e0 leur premi\u00e8re exp\u00e9rience de travail sur un navire voyageant dans les r\u00e9gions arctiques.\n[54] Le t\u00e9moin raconte qu'avec sa permission le plaignant s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 bord du navire le 17 juin 2001 au port de Valleyfield. Il lui a fait signer le contrat de travail (Pi\u00e8ce P-1). Apr\u00e8s avoir compl\u00e9t\u00e9 l'embauche de l'ensemble du personnel, le t\u00e9moin a quitt\u00e9 le navire le 19 juin 2001 pour retourner \u00e0 Sh\u00e9diac (Nouveau-Brunswick), lieu de sa r\u00e9sidence et du si\u00e8ge social de l'intim\u00e9e.\n[55] \u00c9douard Nadeau raconte que le 20 ou le 21 juin 2001, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 par Andr\u00e9e Viger que le capitaine B\u00e9langer avait remerci\u00e9 le plaignant de ses services pour des raisons de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et elle lui a transmis la lettre du capitaine (Pi\u00e8ce P-2). Il r\u00e9v\u00e8le ne pas avoir contest\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du capitaine pour la raison suivante (page 389 des notes st\u00e9nographiques) :\n\u00ab Je n'ai pas protest\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de l'emploi de monsieur Boudreault. J'ai 15 ans d'exp\u00e9rience dans le m\u00e9tier comme marin, comme officier et puis la d\u00e9cision du capitaine, c'est la d\u00e9cision finale. Ca fait qu'il n'y avait pas de discussions \u00e0 avoir avec \u00e7a. \u00bb\n[56] Des d\u00e9marches ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entreprises pour remplacer le plaignant. Un matelot d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 bord du navire, qui n'avait jamais voyag\u00e9 dans le Nord, d\u00e9tenait un brevet d'homme de quart \u00e0 la passerelle et il fut promu timonier. Le t\u00e9moin a, par la suite, embauch\u00e9 un autre matelot qui est mont\u00e9 \u00e0 bord du navire \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec.\n[57] Apr\u00e8s \u00eatre retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 son domicile, \u00c9douard Nadeau a re\u00e7u une communication t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du plaignant pour l'aviser de son renvoi parce qu'il mettait de la glace sur son genou. Il a dit au plaignant qu'il se soumettait \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du capitaine du navire et qu'il tenterait de lui trouver un autre emploi. Il a tent\u00e9 de le faire mais sans succ\u00e8s. Toutefois, suite \u00e0 la mise en demeure qu'il a re\u00e7ue du plaignant (Pi\u00e8ce P-5) il a cess\u00e9 les recherches d'emploi. Il a reconnu qu'il \u00e9tait difficile de trouver un matelot disposant d'un brevet d'homme de quart \u00e0 la passerelle ou timonier.\n(iv) Georges Tousignant [58] Georges Tousignant \u00e9tait, en 2001, directeur des op\u00e9rations pour Transport Nanuk depuis 1994. Il assume la responsabilit\u00e9 des op\u00e9rations reli\u00e9es au navire soit l'approvisionnement du navire, le transport des marchandises, les op\u00e9rations de maintenance et d'entretien du navire. Apr\u00e8s avoir compl\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes \u00e0 l'\u00c9cole de Marine, il a obtenu un premier certificat d'officier en 1978. Il a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 compter de 1979 comme officier de navigation sur des navires de type cargo. Il a navigu\u00e9 principalement sur les Grands Lacs et dans l'Arctique canadien. Il a obtenu en 1992 un brevet de capitaine de long cours.\n[59] Le t\u00e9moin explique qu'en 2001 le navire Umiavut se rendait dans le Nord qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois \u00e0 deux reprises au cours de la p\u00e9riode de navigation pour y livrer des marchandises plac\u00e9es dans des conteneurs ou caisses de bois ou encore en ballots comme des mat\u00e9riaux de construction ainsi que des \u00e9quipements roulants tels que des camions.\n[60] Georges Tousignant a expliqu\u00e9 que la saison de navigation s'\u00e9tend g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement du d\u00e9but juillet jusqu'\u00e0 la mi-novembre.\n[61] Il a racont\u00e9 que la navire Umiavut est arriv\u00e9 au port de Valleyfield le 17 juin 2001. Le chargement devait s'effectuer au cours de la semaine pour permettre au navire de partir le vendredi 22 juin 2001 pour un voyage de long cours international car il devait faire un arr\u00eat \u00e0 Thule au Groenland. Toutefois, comme tout le personnel \u00e0 bord du navire devait avoir subi un examen m\u00e9dical selon les exigences de Transports Canada et comme des matelots n'avaient pas de certificat m\u00e9dical, le d\u00e9part a \u00e9t\u00e9 retard\u00e9 au 26 juin 2001 pour leur permettre de se soumettre \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical par un m\u00e9decin d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par Transports Canada. Un m\u00e9decin s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 bord du navire le 24 juin 2001 pour soumettre des matelots \u00e0 cet examen et d\u00e9livrer les certificats m\u00e9dicaux.\n[62] Le t\u00e9moin raconte qu'il \u00e9tait sur le navire et qu'il s'est soumis lui-m\u00eame \u00e0 l'examen m\u00e9dical qui a dur\u00e9 environ 15 minutes. Le m\u00e9decin a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la prise de la pression sanguine et \u00e0 un examen sommaire de l'ou\u00efe et de la vue. Enfin, le t\u00e9moin a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 un questionnaire.\n[63] Le t\u00e9moin a expliqu\u00e9 que le navire Umiavut pouvait transporter un chargement de 3 000 tonnes et que les frais de transport et de livraison \u00e9taient d'environ 200 $ la tonne. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que les co\u00fbts d'op\u00e9ration du navire en attente \u00e0 quai sont de l'ordre de 15 000 $ par jour et, lorsqu'il navigue, de 18 000 $ \u00e0 19 000 $ par jour. Il a mentionn\u00e9 que lorsque le navire subit un retard attribuable au client, le transporteur absorbe les co\u00fbts occasionn\u00e9s par le retard.\n[64] Georges Tousignant a reconnu que, m\u00eame si le transporteur met tout en uvre pour respecter les d\u00e9lais de livraison, des retards se produisent fr\u00e9quemment notamment en raison des difficult\u00e9s rencontr\u00e9es au cours de la navigation.\n[65] Georges Tousignant a mentionn\u00e9 que lors des op\u00e9rations de d\u00e9chargement des marchandises, les membres d'\u00e9quipage sont assign\u00e9s aux op\u00e9rations de d\u00e9bardage. Sur le navire Umiavut l'\u00e9quipe de d\u00e9bardage comprend environ dix membres d'\u00e9quipage. Il soutient que l'absence d'un d\u00e9bardeur am\u00e8ne une perte de productivit\u00e9 de 10 % dans les op\u00e9rations de d\u00e9bardage.\n[66] Advenant qu'un membre d'\u00e9quipage ne soit plus en mesure de faire son travail de d\u00e9bardeur, le t\u00e9moin r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'il est retourn\u00e9 chez lui et remplac\u00e9 par un autre. Il admet que le voyage pourrait se poursuivre sans le remplacer mais il pense qu'il n'est pas pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable d'agir ainsi parce que, si un autre membre d'\u00e9quipage devenait incapable de faire le travail, la productivit\u00e9 en serait d'autant plus affect\u00e9e.\n[67] Le t\u00e9moin a expliqu\u00e9 les t\u00e2ches de timonier. Celui-ci est affect\u00e9 \u00e0 la conduite du navire dans un lieu de travail appel\u00e9 la timonerie . Il re\u00e7oit ses instructions, quant \u00e0 la gouverne du navire, de la part de l'officier de navigation ou du capitaine. Auparavant, il gouvernait le navire \u00e0 l'aide d'une roue d'o\u00f9 l'appellation homme de roue . Avec l'av\u00e8nement de la technologie, ce travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 diminu\u00e9 par l'utilisation d'un pilote automatique. Le timonier est affect\u00e9 \u00e0 la veille. Il fait le guet pour signaler \u00e0 l'officier de navigation tout obstacle ou situation de nature \u00e0 entraver la navigation. Son horaire journalier de travail est de huit heures, soit quatre heures de travail et huit heures de repos, en alternance.\n[68] Le t\u00e9moin relate qu'on retrouve, dans la timonerie, des si\u00e8ges \u00e0 l'usage exclusif du capitaine. Un si\u00e8ge est \u00e9galement fourni, sur demande, au pilote sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 qui monte \u00e0 bord du navire pour y demeurer pendant plusieurs heures cons\u00e9cutives. Le t\u00e9moin a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il ne voit pas pour quelle raison un si\u00e8ge pourrait \u00eatre mis \u00e0 la disposition du timonier. Pour lui, la coutume \u00e9tablie et reconnue veut que le timonier demeure debout pour faire son travail, sauf pendant sa pause repos de 15 minutes au cours de son quart de travail.\n(v) Marcel \u00c9thier [69] Marcel \u00c9thier est un m\u00e9decin d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par Transports Canada pour \u00e9mettre le certificat d'examen m\u00e9dical en vertu des r\u00e8glements de l'organisme. Il exerce sa profession \u00e0 l'\u00cele-aux-Coudres. R\u00e9f\u00e9rant au dossier m\u00e9dical, il d\u00e9clare avoir rencontr\u00e9 Bruno Boudreault en 1997 comme m\u00e9decin traitant. Puis, il a revu le plaignant le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2001 pour un examen requis par Transports Canada.\n[70] Le docteur \u00c9thier raconte qu'il a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical complet avec la tension art\u00e9rielle, les pulsations, le poids et la glyc\u00e9mie. Il a aussi fait un examen physique g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la t\u00eate, des poumons, du cur, de l'abdomen, des extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s et tout \u00e9tait normal. Il constate que son dossier ne comporte pas de mention relative \u00e0 un probl\u00e8me de genou chez le plaignant.\nIII. LE DROIT [71] Bruno Boudreault a formul\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 l'endroit de l'intim\u00e9e lui reprochant d'avoir viol\u00e9 les dispositions de l'article 7 de la Loi. Aux termes de cet article, constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects, de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu ou de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi. L'acte discriminatoire doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. L'article 3 de la Loi pr\u00e9cise que la d\u00e9ficience est un motif de distinction illicite. Il a de plus all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas respect\u00e9 les dispositions de l'article 10 de la Loi en ce qu'il a commis un acte discriminatoire en exigeant que tous les membres d'\u00e9quipage sur un navire, sans exception, pr\u00e9sentent une condition physique ad\u00e9quate dont l'\u00e9valuation est sujette \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation du capitaine du navire.\nEnfin, l'alin\u00e9a 15 (1) a) de la Loi \u00e9nonce que :\n\u00ab Ne constituent pas des actes discriminatoires les refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de l'employeur qui d\u00e9montre qu'ils d\u00e9coulent d'exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es. \u00bb\nL'alin\u00e9a 15 (2) de la Loi pr\u00e9cise que :\n\u00ab Les faits pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a (1) a) sont des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es ou un motif justifiable au sens de l'alin\u00e9a (1) g), s'il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d'une personne ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. \u00bb\n[72] En 1999, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendu deux importantes d\u00e9cisions qui sont appel\u00e9es Meiorin 1et Grismer .2 Dans ces deux arr\u00eats, la Cour supr\u00eame \u00e9tablit les r\u00e8gles \u00e0 suivre dans le traitement des plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne. En premier lieu, il appartient \u00e0 la partie plaignante d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve prima facie de discrimination doit reposer sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e.\n[73] Une fois qu'une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il appartient \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de prouver que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, la norme ou la politique contest\u00e9e \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e. Pour ce faire, elle doit d\u00e9montrer :\nqu'elle a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but qui est rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la fonction exerc\u00e9e. Il y a lieu d'analyser si la norme a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans le but d'assurer l'ex\u00e9cution de la fonction de mani\u00e8re s\u00fbre et efficace ; qu'elle a adopt\u00e9 la norme en question de bonne foi et en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser le but l\u00e9gitime reli\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions ; que la norme contest\u00e9e est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre le but poursuivi, soit l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions de mani\u00e8re s\u00fbre et efficace.\n[74] Pour d\u00e9montrer que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, la partie intim\u00e9e doit prouver qu'elle ne peut composer avec les besoins particuliers d'un employ\u00e9 ayant les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que la partie plaignante sans subir une contrainte excessive.\nIV. ANALYSE A. La preuve prima facie de discrimination [75] Il ressort de la preuve que Bruno Boudreault a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e pour la p\u00e9riode du 15 juin 2001 au 31 octobre 2001 pour exercer les fonctions de timonier et d\u00e9bardeur \u00e0 bord du navire Umiavut qui devait effectuer le transport et la livraison de marchandises dans diff\u00e9rents postes et villages \u00e0 l'occasion de deux voyages dans le Grand Nord. Le capitaine du navire \u00e9tait Robert B\u00e9langer.\n[76] Le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 requis de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 bord du navire ancr\u00e9 au port de Valleyfield le 17 juin 2001. Comme ses fonctions de timonier s'exerceraient lorsque le navire serait en mer et celles de d\u00e9bardeur au moment du d\u00e9chargement des marchandises, il fut assign\u00e9 \u00e0 la surveillance du navire. Il faisait des p\u00e9riodes de guet de quatre heures interrompues par une p\u00e9riode de repos de huit heures.\n[77] Le mercredi 20 juin 2001, peu de temps apr\u00e8s son quart de surveillance termin\u00e9 \u00e0 8 h 00, il fut convoqu\u00e9 au bureau du capitaine qui d\u00e9sirait v\u00e9rifier l'information re\u00e7ue \u00e0 l'effet qu'il avait plac\u00e9 de la glace sur son genou gauche. Le plaignant a confirm\u00e9 l'information. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il avait subi une op\u00e9ration au genou gauche en 1998, qu'il lui arrivait de ressentir une raideur ou douleur au genou qu'il calmait avec de la glace. Selon la version d'Andr\u00e9e Viger, le plaignant aurait mentionn\u00e9 souffrir d'arthrite, ce que celui-ci nie. Toutefois, contrairement \u00e0 l'affirmation de la procureure de l'intim\u00e9e, tant le plaignant que le capitaine et Andr\u00e9e Viger n'ont mentionn\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 question d'enflure au genou gauche.\n[78] Apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu ces informations, le capitaine a demand\u00e9 au plaignant de regagner sa cabine et a dit qu'il lui ferait part de sa d\u00e9cision au cours de la journ\u00e9e. Le capitaine a discut\u00e9 avec Andr\u00e9e Viger pour ensuite rappeler le plaignant au bureau environ une demi-heure plus tard.\n[79] Le capitaine a inform\u00e9 Bruno Boudreault qu'il avait pris la d\u00e9cision de le remercier de ses services \u00e0 cause de probl\u00e8mes au genou gauche. Il a jug\u00e9 que la d\u00e9ficience observ\u00e9e chez le plaignant ne lui permettrait pas d'accomplir le travail de timonier et de d\u00e9bardeur lors des voyages \u00e0 effectuer en raison de la lourdeur des fonctions \u00e0 exercer. En outre, le capitaine a jug\u00e9 que les probl\u00e8mes au genou du plaignant \u00e9taient susceptibles de mettre en p\u00e9ril sa sant\u00e9 et sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et celle des membres de l'\u00e9quipage.\n[80] \u00c0 mon avis, le plaignant a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire la preuve prima facie d'une distinction fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience r\u00e9elle ou per\u00e7ue dans la fa\u00e7on dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 par le capitaine. Je crois \u00e9galement que les probl\u00e8mes au genou du plaignant peuvent constituer une d\u00e9ficience et un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite au sens de l'article 7 de la Loi. De plus, il ne fait aucun doute que cette distinction a eu pour effet d'emp\u00eacher le plaignant de maintenir son emploi pour l'intim\u00e9e.\n[81] Je crois \u00e9galement que le plaignant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 prima facie que l'intim\u00e9e a viol\u00e9 les dispositions de l'article 10 de la Loi en laissant au seul jugement du capitaine l'\u00e9valuation de la condition physique d'un employ\u00e9. L'intim\u00e9e devrait se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 l'expertise d'un personnel m\u00e9dical en mesure de l'\u00e9clairer sur la condition physique requise du personnel marin en tenant compte des fonctions qu'il sera appel\u00e9 \u00e0 accomplir. Toutefois, comme l'employeur du capitaine B\u00e9langer n'est pas partie \u00e0 la plainte de Bruno Boudreault, le Tribunal ne discutera pas des mesures \u00e0 envisager pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 cette situation.\nB. Exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e [82] Une fois la preuve prima facie de discrimination reconnue, il y a lieu de rechercher si la discrimination d\u00e9coule d'une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e selon la m\u00e9thode sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e par la jurisprudence de la Cour supr\u00eame.\nC. La norme a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans un but qui est rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la fonction exerc\u00e9e ? [83] Afin de d\u00e9montrer l'existence d'une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de prouver que le fait d'exiger une condition physique ad\u00e9quate de la part du personnel marin, tel que le timonier ou d\u00e9bardeur, a un lien rationnel avec les fonctions qu'il occupe. L'analyse \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape ne porte pas sur la validit\u00e9 de la norme en cause mais plut\u00f4t sur la validit\u00e9 de son objet plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral 3. Il m'appara\u00eet que l'objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la norme en l'esp\u00e8ce est d'assurer l'ex\u00e9cution s\u00fbre et efficace du travail. En cons\u00e9quence, je crois que la condition physique ad\u00e9quate est rationnellement li\u00e9e aux fonctions exerc\u00e9es par le personnel marin tel que le timonier et le d\u00e9bardeur.\nD. La norme a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e de bonne foi ? [84] \u00c0 ce stade, l'intim\u00e9e a le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer que la norme exigeant une condition physique ad\u00e9quate a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e de bonne foi et avec la croyance sinc\u00e8re qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre un objectif l\u00e9gitime reli\u00e9 \u00e0 l'emploi. Cependant, si l'exigence d'une condition physique ad\u00e9quate n'est pas jug\u00e9e raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire ou est motiv\u00e9e par des motifs discriminatoires, elle sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme injustifi\u00e9e.\n[85] L'intim\u00e9e n'a soumis aucune preuve d\u00e9finissant la condition physique ad\u00e9quate qu'elle exigeait du personnel embauch\u00e9 \u00e0 bord du navire. La procureure de l'intim\u00e9e a soumis dans sa liste d'autorit\u00e9s le R\u00e8glement sur l'armement en \u00e9quipage du navire (R\u00e8glement) en vigueur \u00e0 compter d'octobre 2003, soit post\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 l'origine de la pr\u00e9sente affaire et elle a attir\u00e9 l'attention du tribunal \u00e0 la section 8 dudit r\u00e8glement qui traite des examens m\u00e9dicaux des navigants dont je discuterai plus tard. La procureure de l'intim\u00e9e a affirm\u00e9 que cette section 8 dudit r\u00e8glement n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e en octobre 2001 et qu'elle s'appliquait \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Quant au capitaine B\u00e9langer, il n'a pas \u00e9clair\u00e9 non plus le tribunal sur la d\u00e9finition de cette norme ; il s'est content\u00e9 de pr\u00e9ciser uniquement les objectifs poursuivis par l'exigence de la condition physique ad\u00e9quate pour les membres d'\u00e9quipage.\n[86] La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que tant Andr\u00e9e Viger qu'\u00c9douard Nadeau n'ont jamais inform\u00e9 Bruno Boudreault, lors des discussions t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant son embauche, de l'importance d'une condition physique ad\u00e9quate pour exercer les fonctions de timonier et d\u00e9bardeur.\n[87] Ils se sont content\u00e9s du certificat m\u00e9dical \u00e9mis par le Dr \u00c9thier ce qui m'am\u00e8ne \u00e0 discuter de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 des examens m\u00e9dicaux des navigants. Lorsqu'ils sont requis, les examens m\u00e9dicaux des navigants sont administr\u00e9s par un m\u00e9decin qui a une connaissance du travail des navigants et qui est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le ministre. Le personnel navigant occupant les fonctions de capitaine, officier et timonier, doit obligatoirement d\u00e9tenir un certificat m\u00e9dical d\u00e9livr\u00e9 pas un m\u00e9decin d\u00e9sign\u00e9.\n[88] De plus, tout le personnel naviguant \u00e0 bord d'un navire qui effectue un voyage de long cours doit \u00e9galement d\u00e9tenir ce certificat m\u00e9dical. Ce ne sera toutefois pas le cas si le navire effectue un voyage en eaux secondaires alors que le certificat m\u00e9dical n'est pas exig\u00e9 pour les matelots.\n[89] L'article 66 de la section 8 dudit r\u00e8glement traite de la nature de l'examen qui doit \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par le m\u00e9decin d\u00e9sign\u00e9. On peut y lire :\n\u00ab 66 (1) Le m\u00e9decin qui fait subir l'examen m\u00e9dical aux termes de la pr\u00e9sente section doit d\u00e9terminer si le navigant n'est pas atteint :\na) d'une incapacit\u00e9 qui pourrait causer une perte de conscience soudaine et qui ne peut \u00eatre contr\u00f4l\u00e9e \u00e0 l'aide de m\u00e9dicaments ;\nb) de troubles de nature \u00e0 l'emp\u00eacher de r\u00e9agir efficacement, durant son quart, en cas d'urgence ;\nc) de troubles de nature \u00e0 poser un risque pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des autres personnes, compte tenu des conditions de vie confin\u00e9es \u00e0 bord ;\nd) d'un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 qui risque de n\u00e9cessiter des soins m\u00e9dicaux urgents et qui ne peut \u00eatre contr\u00f4l\u00e9 \u00e0 l'aide de m\u00e9dicaments ;\ne) d'un trouble psychiatrique non trait\u00e9.\n(2) Le m\u00e9decin qui fait subir l'examen m\u00e9dical aux termes de la pr\u00e9sente section doit d'assurer que le navigant :\na) a une force musculaire suffisante pour transporter des poids de 22 kg ;\nb) est physiquement capable de porter un appareil respiratoire et de l'\u00e9quipement de sauvetage ;\nc) a la qualit\u00e9 de vision et d'ou\u00efe ainsi que la souplesse et la force physique n\u00e9cessaires pour accomplir les fonctions de lutte contre les incendies, de secourisme et d'abandon de navire, en cas d'urgence. \u00bb\n[90] Il ressort clairement du t\u00e9moignage du m\u00e9decin d\u00e9sign\u00e9, le Dr \u00c9thier, que l'examen du plaignant, le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2001, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 administr\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on approfondie pour lui permettre de r\u00e9pondre aux exigences de l'alin\u00e9a 66 dudit r\u00e8glement et le certificat m\u00e9dical \u00e9mis n'y r\u00e9pond pas non plus. Le Dr \u00c9thier a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il avait soumis le plaignant \u00e0 un examen sommaire et g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n[91] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'au moment de l'embauche du plaignant le 17 juin 2001 comme timonier d\u00e9bardeur \u00e0 bord du navire Umiavut, le voyage alors pr\u00e9vu devait s'effectuer en eaux secondaires. Le R\u00e8glement n'imposait pas le certificat m\u00e9dical aux matelots. Il est en preuve que plusieurs matelots embauch\u00e9s ne d\u00e9tenaient pas le certificat m\u00e9dical et l'intim\u00e9e ne l'avait aucunement exig\u00e9. Ce n'est que lorsque le type de voyage est devenu de long cours que le certificat m\u00e9dical a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 aux matelots non pas par souci d'une v\u00e9rification ne serait-ce que sommaire de la condition physique des matelots mais seulement parce que le R\u00e8glement le commandait.\n[92] \u00c0 partir de quelles donn\u00e9es suffisamment s\u00e9rieuses et convaincantes, le capitaine B\u00e9langer a-t-il tir\u00e9 la conclusion que Bruno Boudreault n'\u00e9tait pas dans une condition physique ad\u00e9quate pour r\u00e9pondre aux exigences des fonctions de timonier et de d\u00e9bardeur ? Il y a lieu de souligner ici que les fonctions de d\u00e9bardeur qu'aurait eu \u00e0 exercer le plaignant n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9es. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'il est probable qu'il aurait alors agi comme conducteur de remorqueur, soit capitaine de remorqueur.\n[93] La premi\u00e8re information d\u00e9tenue par le capitaine B\u00e9langer est celle que le plaignant a plac\u00e9 de la glace sur son genou. Rien n'indique que le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure, au cours des jours pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, de remplir la fonction de surveillant \u00e0 laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 et qui, incidemment, est inh\u00e9rente aux fonctions de timonier. La seconde information re\u00e7ue par le capitaine B\u00e9langer est celle provenant du plaignant qui lui raconte l'op\u00e9ration subie \u00e0 son genou gauche trois ans auparavant et qu'il \u00e9prouve une certaine raideur au genou gauche et parfois une douleur justifiant de placer de la glace. Il obtient l'assurance du plaignant qu'il est en mesure de faire son travail.\n[94] Ces renseignements \u00e0 eux seuls guideront le capitaine B\u00e9langer dans sa d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 l'emploi du plaignant. Pourquoi ne pas avoir retenu la suggestion du plaignant de communiquer avec son m\u00e9decin orthop\u00e9diste ou de se rendre \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital pour ramener son dossier m\u00e9dical ? La r\u00e9ponse d'Andr\u00e9e Viger est celle que le temps manquait puisqu'on \u00e9tait le mercredi et que le navire devait quitter le port le vendredi. Dans les faits, le navire a pris la mer le mardi suivant. La preuve a \u00e9galement r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que le plaignant a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de se soumettre \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical par un m\u00e9decin au choix de l'intim\u00e9e. Il convient de se rappeler que la preuve est \u00e0 l'effet que les marins d\u00e9tenant un brevet d'homme de quart \u00e0 la passerelle \u00e9taient une denr\u00e9e tr\u00e8s rare. N\u00e9anmoins, cette suggestion du plaignant n'est pas non plus retenue par Andr\u00e9e Viger sous pr\u00e9texte d'un manque de temps. Andr\u00e9e Viger explique qu'elle faisait affaires avec une firme d'experts m\u00e9dicaux depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Ainsi, sa pr\u00e9tention \u00e0 l'effet qu'il lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible d'obtenir un rendez-vous \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur d'un d\u00e9lai de deux jours me laisse fort sceptique. Pourtant, il lui fut cependant possible d'obtenir les services d'un m\u00e9decin qui s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 bord du navire le dimanche 24 juin 2002 pour faire subir un examen m\u00e9dical aux matelots ne disposant pas du certificat m\u00e9dical requis.\n[95] Les renseignements dont disposait le capitaine B\u00e9langer ne justifiaient pas \u00e0 eux seuls son verdict sur la condition physique du plaignant. En outre, le contenu du certificat m\u00e9dical du plaignant, m\u00eame si le capitaine B\u00e9langer en avait pris connaissance, ne l'aurait pas conduit vers une d\u00e9cision mieux \u00e9clair\u00e9e. Pour bien juger que les probl\u00e8mes au genou du plaignant cr\u00e9aient chez lui une condition physique inad\u00e9quate pour lui permettre d'exercer les fonctions de timonier et d\u00e9bardeur d'une fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire et efficace, il aurait d\u00fb obtenir une expertise m\u00e9dicale qui r\u00e9ponde aux exigences de l'article 66 du R\u00e8glement.\n[96] Une fois la norme d'une condition physique ad\u00e9quate adopt\u00e9e, on se devait d'en aviser formellement de son existence et de son importance tout candidat avant son embauche, ce qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. De plus, m\u00eame si on s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 satisfait du certificat m\u00e9dical du m\u00e9decin d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par Transports Canada pour v\u00e9rifier la condition physique d'un candidat, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que ce certificat n'\u00e9tait pas une condition premi\u00e8re d'embauche pour tout le personnel marin. Enfin, si la condition physique ad\u00e9quate \u00e9tait essentielle, une expertise m\u00e9dicale approfondie r\u00e9pondant aux exigences de l'article 66 (1) du R\u00e8glement aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre obligatoire pour s'assurer que la norme \u00e9tait rencontr\u00e9e.\n[97] J'arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que la norme de condition physique ad\u00e9quate adopt\u00e9e \u00e0 l'endroit du personnel n'\u00e9tait pas raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire et ne constituait pas une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9e a donc commis un acte discriminatoire en remerciant le plaignant de ses services en raison de sa condition physique inad\u00e9quate, soit des probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 son genou gauche.\n[98] En cons\u00e9quence, la plainte de Bruno Boudreault est accueillie.\nV. MESURES DE REDRESSEMENT A. La r\u00e9int\u00e9gration dans les fonctions [99] Ayant tir\u00e9 la conclusion que la plainte est bien fond\u00e9e, le Tribunal se doit de replacer le plaignant dans la m\u00eame situation que celle qui aurait pr\u00e9valu n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire, soit son cong\u00e9diement le 20 juin 2001.\n[100] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 en vertu d'un contrat de travail \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e soit du 15 juin 2001 au 31 octobre 2001. En cons\u00e9quence, m\u00eame si le plaignant affirme que l'intim\u00e9e lui aurait fait part de la possibilit\u00e9 d'un nouveau contrat de travail, je ne crois pas que la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration soit bien fond\u00e9e.\nB. Les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour pertes p\u00e9cuniaires [101] Bruno Boudreault r\u00e9clame le salaire perdu suite \u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement. La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que lors du premier voyage effectu\u00e9 par le navire, soit du 26 juin 2001 au 28 ao\u00fbt 2001, le travail du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 accompli par un autre timonier et d\u00e9bardeur qui a re\u00e7u une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de 17 320,07 $. Lors de son argumentation, la procureure de l'intim\u00e9e a soutenu qu'un montant de 447,09 $ devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9duit de ce montant, soit le montant vers\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e au plaignant pour le travail qu'il a effectu\u00e9 du 17 juin 2001 au 20 juin 2001. Elle soutient que le rempla\u00e7ant du plaignant \u00e9tait \u00e9galement au travail du 17 juin au 20 juin 2001 et qu'il a re\u00e7u le m\u00eame montant que le plaignant. Cependant, rien dans la preuve n'indique que le rempla\u00e7ant du plaignant \u00e9tait au travail au cours de cette p\u00e9riode. J'en arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que la perte mon\u00e9taire subie par le plaignant du 21 juin 2001 au 28 ao\u00fbt 2001 a \u00e9t\u00e9 de 17 320,07 $.\n[102] Pour le deuxi\u00e8me voyage du navire, les parties s'entendent \u00e0 l'effet que la perte mon\u00e9taire du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 de 17 358,35 $ En d\u00e9finitive, la perte de revenu du plaignant pour la dur\u00e9e du contrat de travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 de 34 678,42 $. Toutefois, \u00e0 compter du 31 juillet 2001 jusqu'au 12 octobre 2001 il a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 un revenu de 5 616,00 $ de sorte que sa perte r\u00e9elle de revenu a \u00e9t\u00e9 de 29 062,42 $.\n[103] J'ordonne donc \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de verser au plaignant un montant de 29 062,42 $. Comme ce montant forfaitaire accord\u00e9 au plaignant aura possiblement comme cons\u00e9quence de lui imposer une responsabilit\u00e9 fiscale accrue qui aurait pour effet de le p\u00e9naliser sans aucune justification, j'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de verser au plaignant une somme additionnelle suffisante pour couvrir les obligations fiscales suppl\u00e9mentaires qui pourraient lui \u00eatre impos\u00e9es suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception du paiement ordonn\u00e9 et ce, en tenant compte de ses autres revenus et des retenues obligatoires qui s'y rattachent.\n[104] Le plaignant a \u00e9galement r\u00e9clam\u00e9 les pertes de revenu en assurance-emploi qu'il a subies en raison de son cong\u00e9diement. Il explique cette r\u00e9clamation p\u00e9cuniaire du fait qu'en travaillant pour l'intim\u00e9e il aurait r\u00e9alis\u00e9 des revenus beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s au cours de la dur\u00e9e de son contrat de travail que ceux qu'il a obtenus d'un autre travail. En cons\u00e9quence les prestations d'assurance-emploi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 beaucoup moins \u00e9lev\u00e9es que celles qu'il aurait re\u00e7ues s'il \u00e9tait demeur\u00e9 \u00e0 l'emploi de l'intim\u00e9e. Toutefois, le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de quantifier le montant des prestations d'assurance-emploi qu'il a perdu de sorte que cette perte de revenus ne peut \u00eatre retenue.\n[105] Le plaignant a \u00e9galement r\u00e9clam\u00e9 un montant de 7 000 $ au motif que son cong\u00e9diement l'a emp\u00each\u00e9 d'accumuler les heures de travail comme timonier de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 devenir \u00e9ventuellement \u00e9ligible pour obtenir un brevet de pilote de long cours. Le plaignant a reconnu que le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait arbitraire sans aucune donn\u00e9e pour en \u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9. Rien dans la preuve n'indique que le plaignant a fait les efforts, suite \u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement, pour continuer son cheminement afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e9ventuellement aux conditions d'obtention d'un brevet de pilote de long cours. Par cons\u00e9quent, la preuve ne justifie pas d'accorder le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 pour perte d'avancement de carri\u00e8re.\nC. D\u00e9penses (i) Achat de v\u00eatements [106] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que lors d'une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique \u00c9douard Nadeau a avis\u00e9 le plaignant que, comme il devait se rendre dans le Grand Nord, il lui serait n\u00e9cessaire de se procurer des v\u00eatements ad\u00e9quats. Le plaignant s'est procur\u00e9 des sous-v\u00eatements hypothermiques, un sac de couchage, des surv\u00eatements et des bottes d'hiver qui lui ont co\u00fbt\u00e9 un montant de 700 $.\n[107] J'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de payer ce montant de 700 $ au plaignant.\n(ii) Honoraires d'avocat [108] Le plaignant, suite \u00e0 la perte de son emploi, a retenu les services d'une procureure qu'il a mandat\u00e9e pour le repr\u00e9senter dans le cheminement de son dossier depuis le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de l'audition devant le Tribunal.\n[109] La procureure du plaignant a soumis au Tribunal une note d'honoraires au montant de 6 377,46 $. La procureure de l'intim\u00e9e reconna\u00eet que les honoraires r\u00e9clam\u00e9s sont directement reli\u00e9s \u00e0 la plainte \u00e0 l'exception d'un montant de 360 $. La procureure de l'intim\u00e9e a raison sur ce point puisque ce montant de 360 $ est reli\u00e9 \u00e0 une r\u00e9clamation civile exerc\u00e9e par le plaignant contre l'intim\u00e9e.\n[110] Le plaignant demande au Tribunal d'ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de l'indemniser pour un montant de 6 377,46 $ afin de payer les honoraires de son avocate mais j'estime que le montant de 6 017,46 $ devrait plut\u00f4t \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[111] Les dispositions de l'article 53 (1) de la Loi conf\u00e8rent au Tribunal le pouvoir d'accorder au plaignant la totalit\u00e9 ou la fraction des pertes de salaires et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire.\n[112] L'analyse des affaires Stevenson 4 et Nkwazi5 m'am\u00e8ne \u00e0 conclure que les honoraires d'avocat r\u00e9clam\u00e9s par le plaignant font partie des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire. En cons\u00e9quence, j'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de payer au plaignant les honoraires de son avocate au montant de 6 017,46 $.\n(iii) Le pr\u00e9judice moral [113] En vertu des dispositions de l'article 53 (2) e) de la Loi, le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e d'indemniser la victime jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence d'un montant de 20 000 $ en raison du pr\u00e9judice moral que lui a caus\u00e9 l'acte discriminatoire.\n[114] La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 boulevers\u00e9 d'apprendre d'une mani\u00e8re soudaine la perte de son emploi. Il a perdu l'espoir qu'il nourrissait de poursuivre sa carri\u00e8re de timonier et \u00e9ventuellement d'obtenir son brevet de capitaine de long cours. Cette perte subite d'emploi a affect\u00e9 son moral. Compte tenu de ces faits, j'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de payer au plaignant, au titre de pr\u00e9judice moral, un montant de 3 000 $.\n(iv) Indemnit\u00e9 pour acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 [115] En se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant au paragraphe 53 (3) de la Loi, le plaignant a requis du Tribunal d'ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de lui verser une indemnit\u00e9 de 20 000 $ en raison du fait que l'acte discriminatoire dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[116] Rien dans la preuve ne d\u00e9montre le bien-fond\u00e9 de cette demande qui est rejet\u00e9e.\n(v) Int\u00e9r\u00eats [117] J'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de payer au plaignant un int\u00e9r\u00eat simple sur tous les montants pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment accord\u00e9s. Cet int\u00e9r\u00eat simple devra \u00eatre calcul\u00e9 sur une base annuelle selon un taux \u00e9quivalent au taux d'escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle).\n[118] Les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les montants \u00e0 payer pour le pr\u00e9judice moral et les d\u00e9penses commenceront \u00e0 courir \u00e0 compter de la date du cong\u00e9diement jusqu'\u00e0 la date du dernier versement. Il en sera de m\u00eame sur le montant \u00e0 verser sur les pertes salariales. Cependant, le calcul des int\u00e9r\u00eats devra tenir compte des dates de versement du salaire au plaignant.\nSign\u00e9e par\nRoger Doyon\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 30 juin 2004\n1 Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3\n2 Colombie-Britannique (Superintendant of Motor Vehicles) c.

En cons\u00e9quence, la plaignante d\u00e9sire \u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Alain Duguay aux fins de la pr\u00e9sentation de sa preuve.\n[4] Le Tribunal a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 statuer sur le droit d'une personne d'agir \u00e0 la fois comme t\u00e9moin lors de l'audition de la preuve de la Commission et comme repr\u00e9sentant de la plaignante lors de la pr\u00e9sentation de sa preuve \u00e0 l'audition.\nL'article 50 (1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne pr\u00e9voit que :\nLe membre instructeur, apr\u00e8s avis conforme \u00e0 la Commission, aux parties et, \u00e0 son appr\u00e9ciation, \u00e0 tout int\u00e9ress\u00e9, instruit la plainte pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 ; il donne \u00e0 ceux-ci la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations.\n[5] Malgr\u00e9 l'existence de cette disposition, le Tribunal s'est toujours souci\u00e9 d'accorder aux plus d\u00e9munis la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de faire valoir leurs droits en \u00e9tant repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par un non juriste.

AUTRES QUESTIONS\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision porte sur les mesures de redressement. \u00c0 mon avis, l'obligation du Tribunal de proc\u00e9der de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive , pour reprendre les mots employ\u00e9s dans la Loi, s'applique \u00e9galement \u00e0 la question du redressement. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ai inform\u00e9 les parties que je r\u00e9glerais le plus grand nombre possible de questions en suspens avant de me pencher sur celle des frais.\n[2] La plaignante demande d'\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e sous deux chefs. D'abord, elle r\u00e9clame une indemnit\u00e9 de vingt mille dollars, soit l'indemnit\u00e9 maximale pouvant \u00eatre accord\u00e9e en cas de pr\u00e9judice moral aux termes de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Ensuite, elle exige une indemnit\u00e9 du m\u00eame montant en vertu du paragraphe 53(3), qui permet au Tribunal d'accorder des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats suppl\u00e9mentaires s'il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 . En outre, la plaignante demande que le Tribunal lui accorde des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur l'indemnit\u00e9 et ordonne que les frais qu'elle a engag\u00e9s relativement \u00e0 l'audience lui soient rembours\u00e9s.\nI. Pr\u00e9judice moral [3] Il ne fait aucun doute que la plaignante a souffert \u00e9motionnellement des injustices dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime dans le processus de promotion. L'exp\u00e9rience l'a \u00e9branl\u00e9e. Son amour-propre en a pris pour son rhume. Je suis persuad\u00e9 qu'elle a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 substantielle au titre du pr\u00e9judice moral.\n[4] Il y a eu un d\u00e9bat sur la raison d'\u00eatre d'une telle indemnit\u00e9. L'avocat de la plaignante a fait valoir que l'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral ne se voulait pas [TRADUCTION] simplement une compensation mon\u00e9taire pour la douleur et la souffrance inflig\u00e9es \u00e0 la victime . Cette indemnit\u00e9 vise \u00e9galement \u00e0 montrer que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 condamne de telles pratiques.\n[5] Je ne suis pas convaincu. La l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne rev\u00eat un caract\u00e8re r\u00e9parateur plut\u00f4t que punitif. L'indemnit\u00e9 a pour objet de remettre la partie plaignante dans la situation o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire. Lorsqu'il s'agit de d\u00e9terminer le montant d'une indemnit\u00e9, on devrait se fonder sur les exp\u00e9riences v\u00e9cues par la partie plaignante plut\u00f4t que sur la conduite de la partie intim\u00e9e.\n[6] \u00c0 mon avis, Me Gordon devrait invoquer \u00e0 l'appui de son argument le paragraphe 53(3), qui pr\u00e9voit un chef d'indemnit\u00e9 distinct dans les cas o\u00f9 l'acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. La r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale voulant que la l\u00e9gislation rev\u00eate un caract\u00e8re r\u00e9parateur semble souffrir d'une exception. On peut pr\u00e9sumer que cette disposition se veut une mesure dissuasive et vise \u00e0 d\u00e9courager ceux qui font d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment de la discrimination.\n[7] En ce qui concerne le paragraphe 53(2), la situation est diff\u00e9rente. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la nature de la conduite de l'intim\u00e9e n'est pertinente du point de vue de la d\u00e9termination de l'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral que lorsqu'il existe un lien causal entre la conduite de la partie intim\u00e9e et l'\u00e9tat \u00e9motionnel de la partie plaignante. Si la conduite de la GRC a eu pour effet d'accro\u00eetre le degr\u00e9 de stress et de frustration de la plaignante, je conviens qu'il y a lieu de tenir compte de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment dans la d\u00e9termination de l'indemnit\u00e9 au titre du pr\u00e9judice moral. C'est le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[8] La plaignante soutient que la conduite de la GRC a aggrav\u00e9 inutilement sa souffrance. Dans une certaine mesure, je comprends ce point de vue. En l'esp\u00e8ce, l'attitude de la Gendarmerie a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour le moins intransigeante. La GRC a laiss\u00e9 la situation perdurer ind\u00fbment, ce qui a aggrav\u00e9 sa souffrance. Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment doit \u00eatre pris en compte dans le contexte de l'indemnisation. La GRC a omis de corriger la situation. S'il y a un message \u00e0 lui transmettre, c'est celui-l\u00e0.\n[9] J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulign\u00e9 qu'il y avait eu de l'ent\u00eatement de part et d'autre. Il est \u00e9vident, par exemple, que la caporale Brown n'\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 rentrer au travail sans un aveu qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'injustice. Cette attitude n'\u00e9tait pas totalement raisonnable. J'admets \u00e9galement que la Gendarmerie a fait des tentatives sinc\u00e8res et bien intentionn\u00e9es pour r\u00e9soudre la situation. Fait ironique, elle a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante un cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical pour lui permettre de surmonter les probl\u00e8mes psychologiques caus\u00e9s par l'affaire.\n[10] D'autres facteurs ont jou\u00e9. Je ne suis pas en mesure de r\u00e9gler la querelle plut\u00f4t acrimonieuse entre les parties quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tendue de la condition psychologiques ant\u00e9rieure de la plaignante. Il existe n\u00e9anmoins de nombreux facteurs ind\u00e9pendants de la volont\u00e9 de la Gendarmerie qui ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat \u00e9motionnel et mental de la plaignante. Son p\u00e8re \u00e9tait mourant; elle \u00e9tait en proie \u00e0 des migraines et on a laiss\u00e9 entendre qu'elle \u00e9tait confront\u00e9e \u00e0 des difficult\u00e9s dans son m\u00e9nage. Par ailleurs, elle a refus\u00e9 de prendre des m\u00e9dicaments, apparemment pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales, et a rejet\u00e9 les ouvertures que l'intim\u00e9e lui a faites. Ce sont aussi des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui entrent en ligne de compte dans la d\u00e9termination du niveau d'indemnisation appropri\u00e9.\nII. Conduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e [11] La plaignante exige \u00e9galement des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats exemplaires aux termes du paragraphe 53(3) en raison de la conduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e de l'intim\u00e9e. Mon coll\u00e8gue Me Hadjis a accord\u00e9 des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats en vertu de ce paragraphe dans un certain nombre d'affaires de harc\u00e8lement. Aussi la plaignante m'a-t-elle pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des copies des d\u00e9cisions qu'il a rendues dans Woiden c. Lynn 2002 TCDP 6, Bushey c. Sharma, 2003 TCDP 21 et Groupe d'aide et d'information c. Jean Barbe, 2003 TCDP 24.\n[12] Je ne vois pas vraiment en quoi ces d\u00e9cisions sont pertinentes \u00e0 l'affaire dont je suis saisi. Dans chacun de ces cas-l\u00e0, l'intim\u00e9 a agi de fa\u00e7on humiliante et nettement blessante. Dans Woiden, par exemple, l'intim\u00e9e traitait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement ses employ\u00e9es de maudites putains , une situation qui ne s'apparente nullement \u00e0 celle qui nous occupe.\n[13] La Gendarmerie a peut-\u00eatre fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l'endroit de la plaignante, mais elle est demeur\u00e9e bien en de\u00e7\u00e0 des normes habituelles de conduite. L'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res \u00e9tait en proie \u00e0 d'\u00e9normes pressions qui \u00e9manaient de partout, mais elle s'est comport\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on professionnelle. Elle ne s'est nullement comport\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on offensante, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui a manifestement \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas dans les affaires cit\u00e9es par la plaignante. Je ne suis pas d'avis qu'il faille tenir compte des commentaires \u00e9mis par le sergent Kalin.\n[14] Le paragraphe 53(3) ne s'applique pas seulement \u00e0 des cas de harc\u00e8lement. Il faut cependant plus que l'ent\u00eatement. \u00c0 mon avis, la disposition invoqu\u00e9e pr\u00e9voit une indemnisation dans les cas o\u00f9 il existait chez la partie intim\u00e9e une intention, voire une volont\u00e9, de discrimination \u00e0 l'endroit de la partie plaignante. L'intention de la loi s'applique notamment aux cas de conduite inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e. Sous ce rapport, ces cas qui rel\u00e8vent du paragraphe 53(3) diff\u00e8rent des plaintes habituelles de discrimination, qui n'exigent pas de preuve d'intention.\n[15] La plaignante a fait valoir que la norme est moins \u00e9lev\u00e9e dans un cas de conduite inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e que dans un cas de conduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e. Elle s'est appuy\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9finition du Dictionary of Canadian Law.\n[TRADUCTION]\nInconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 : Se dit d'une personne qui, bien que consciente des cons\u00e9quences qui pourraient r\u00e9sulter d'une fa\u00e7on d'agir ou d'une situation, d\u00e9cide de courir un risque qui est d\u00e9raisonnable, compte tenu de sa nature et de son \u00e9tendue.\nCette d\u00e9finition s'appliquerait uniquement dans la mesure o\u00f9 la partie intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait consciente de l'\u00e9tat psychologique pr\u00e9caire dans lequel se trouvait la plaignante, et a manifest\u00e9 le comportement reproch\u00e9 en sachant qu'elle risquait de pousser l'autre \u00e0 la d\u00e9pression. Les faits de l'esp\u00e8ce ne corroborent tout simplement pas pareille all\u00e9gation.\n[16] Je ne vois pas ici les indices d'une conduite inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e. Les mots que la commission d'enqu\u00eate emploie dans Cameron v. Nel-Gor Castle Nursing Home (1984), 5 C.H.R.R. D\/2170 pour d\u00e9crire les actes r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles commis ne s'appliquent gu\u00e8re aux actes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9s dans le cas qui nous occupe et que l'on ne saurait qualifier de t\u00e9m\u00e9raires, d'insouciants ou de gratuits. La Gendarmerie a peut-\u00eatre eu ses torts, mais elle n'a pas commis d'\u00e9carts de conduite et s'est comport\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on professionnelle. \u00c0 mon avis, il ne serait pas juste de dire qu'elle a agi de fa\u00e7on inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e.\nIII. ORDONNANCE SUR L'INDEMNIT\u00c9 ACCORD\u00c9E [17] Eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 toutes ces consid\u00e9rations, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de verser \u00e0 la plaignante une somme de dix mille (10 000) dollars \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral. La plaignante a droit \u00e0 des int\u00e9r\u00eats simples sur cette somme, qui doivent \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s sur une base annuelle en se fondant sur le taux applicable aux obligations d'\u00e9pargne du Canada. La p\u00e9riode ouvrant droit \u00e0 des int\u00e9r\u00eats est comprise entre le 14 mars 2000 et la date du paiement. Le Tribunal enjoint l'intim\u00e9e de verser cette somme \u00e0 la plaignante dans les quatre semaines suivant la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nIV. AUTRES QUESTIONS [18] La plaignante demande \u00e9galement qu'une copie de ma d\u00e9cision portant sur la responsabilit\u00e9 soit vers\u00e9e \u00e0 son dossier d'employ\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9e ne s'\u00e9tant pas oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 cette demande, je lui ordonne de verser une copie de la d\u00e9cision en question, de m\u00eame que la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, au dossier de la caporale Brown. Il n'y a pas de raison d'\u00e9tendre la port\u00e9e de cette ordonnance aux d\u00e9cisions futures.\n[19] Par ailleurs, une nouvelle question a surgi en ce qui concerne la mutation que j'ai ordonn\u00e9e dans ma d\u00e9cision traitant de la responsabilit\u00e9. Je crois comprendre que la plaignante a demand\u00e9 un cong\u00e9 d'\u00e9tudes. L'intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9agi en d\u00e9posant un avis de requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 dessaisir le Tribunal de l'affaire. Le fond de l'affaire est d\u00e9crit dans la documentation d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e.\n[20] Je ne dispose pas de suffisamment de preuves pour r\u00e9gler la controverse entre les parties. Cela n'a pas d'importance. Dans les faits, les deux parties ont convenu que la Gendarmerie s'\u00e9tait conform\u00e9e, sur le fond, \u00e0 mon ordonnance. Je suis persuad\u00e9 que la Gendarmerie a satisfait, voire outrepass\u00e9, ses obligations en ce qui touche l'octroi d'une mutation. Par cons\u00e9quent, la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme le constat formel que le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour se pencher plus avant sur le litige.\n[21] L'avocat de la plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal des copies de certaines lettres \u00e9chang\u00e9es entre les parties \u00e0 ce sujet. La lettre de l'avocat au Tribunal laisse entendre que la requ\u00eate n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire et t\u00e9moigne simplement du d\u00e9sir de l'intim\u00e9e [TRADUCTION] de d\u00e9peindre la plaignante comme une personne d\u00e9raisonnable alors que le membre instructeur doit trancher la question des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats . Par cons\u00e9quent, la plaignante all\u00e8gue que la requ\u00eate \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 un abus de proc\u00e9dure et demande qu'on l'indemnise des frais y aff\u00e9rents. La question des frais devra \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e ult\u00e9rieurement. Toutefois, je puis fournir \u00e0 la plaignante l'assurance que la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e n'a aucunement influenc\u00e9 ma d\u00e9cision en ce qui touche le montant des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n[22] La seule question qui demeure en litige est celle concernant les frais. L'intim\u00e9e a soulev\u00e9 une question pr\u00e9liminaire, \u00e0 savoir si le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour adjuger des frais aux termes de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment exige une plus ample r\u00e9flexion.\nM.

Requ\u00eate du SCEP visant \u00e0 limiter le contre-interrogatoire de Mme Blackstaffe 5\n[1] Le Tribunal est saisi de trois requ\u00eates. Deux de ces requ\u00eates \u00e9manent de l'intim\u00e9e, Bell, tandis que l'autre a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant, le SCEP.\n[2] Dans sa premi\u00e8re requ\u00eate, Bell demande que le Tribunal r\u00e9examine sa d\u00e9cision qui l'emp\u00eache de contre-interroger Mme Blackstaffe sur l'\u00e9tude d'AT&T, le protocole d'entente de l'\u00e9tude conjointe et la formation donn\u00e9e aux membres du comit\u00e9 conjoint et du sous-comit\u00e9.\n[3] La deuxi\u00e8me requ\u00eate de Bell vise \u00e0 obtenir une ordonnance pour emp\u00eacher que le rapport d'expert du 25 mars 2004 de Dr Lawrence Gould sur le calcul des int\u00e9r\u00eats ne soit pas admis en preuve par le Tribunal ou sinon, pour faire retrancher certaines parties.\n[4] Le SCEP demande que la dur\u00e9e restante du contre-interrogatoire de Mme Blackstaffe par Bell soit limit\u00e9e et propose plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment qu'on mette fin \u00e0 celui-ci le 14 septembre 2004.\nA. Demande de r\u00e9examen de Bell - Contre-interrogatoire sur l'\u00e9tude d'AT&T [5] Dans son interrogatoire principal, Mme Blackstaffe a affirm\u00e9 que le sous-comit\u00e9 charg\u00e9 de l'\u00e9tude conjointe s'est rendu au New Jersey pour discuter avec des repr\u00e9sentants d'AT&T et des Travailleurs en Communication d'Am\u00e9rique de leur \u00e9tude d'\u00e9valuation des postes. Bell s'est vigoureusement oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 ce t\u00e9moignage, car Mme Blackstaffe n'avait pas une connaissance personnelle directe de l'\u00e9tude d'AT&T. Bell a \u00e9galement fait valoir que ce t\u00e9moignage n'\u00e9tait pas pertinent, que l'\u00e9tude d'AT&T n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en uvre et qu'elle ne pouvait, par cons\u00e9quent, servir \u00e0 \u00e9valuer l'\u00e9tude conjointe. Bell a \u00e9galement \u00e9mis la crainte que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Blackstaffe soit fond\u00e9 sur des ou\u00ef-dire, sur ce que lui avaient dit des gens ayant particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude d'AT&T qui ne pouvaient \u00eatre contre-interrog\u00e9s.\n[6] Le Tribunal a conclu que Mme Blackstaffe pouvait \u00eatre interrog\u00e9e au sujet de la visite du sous-comit\u00e9 au New Jersey, de l'information qu'elle a obtenue et de l'usage que le sous-comit\u00e9 en a fait. Par la suite, Bell, faisant fi de ses objections ant\u00e9rieures, a demand\u00e9 de contre-interroger Mme Blackstaffe au sujet de l'\u00e9tude d'AT&T et plus particuli\u00e8rement de l'\u00e9cart entre les r\u00e9sultats attribu\u00e9s aux \u00e9pisseurs de c\u00e2bles par rapport aux t\u00e9l\u00e9phonistes d'AT&T et ceux attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 ces deux types de poste dans l'\u00e9tude conjointe. Le Tribunal n'a pas autoris\u00e9 la poursuite de cet interrogatoire vu qu'il impliquait d'avoir une connaissance directe de l'\u00e9tude d'AT&T et exigeait une comparaison \u00e9valuative, la comp\u00e9tence de Mme Blackstaffe n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie ni dans un cas ni dans l'autre.\n[7] Dans le document de Bell intitul\u00e9 Outline of the Cross-examination of CEP Witness, Patricia Blackstaffe en date du 30 juin 2004 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal, Bell indique que le contre-interrogatoire sur l'\u00e9tude d'AT&T est important aux fins d'\u00e9valuation pour qu'[TRADUCTION] on puisse d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 juste titre qu'on ne peut absolument pas se fier aux r\u00e9sultats de l'\u00e9tude. Cette pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e non-fiabilit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre prouv\u00e9e en comparant la d\u00e9marche suivie pour l'\u00e9tude d'AT&T avec celle adopt\u00e9e dans le cadre de l'\u00e9tude conjointe.\n[8] Dans ses observations orales \u00e0 ce sujet, Bell a fait valoir que le contre-interrogatoire sur l'\u00e9tude d'AT&T ne comporterait aucune comparaison avec l'\u00e9tude conjointe. Bell entend plut\u00f4t demander \u00e0 Mme Blackstaffe ce qu'elle a appris au sujet de l'\u00e9tude d'AT&T et comment elle a utilis\u00e9 cette information; pourquoi elle a retenu les services d'un expert-conseil pour examiner l'\u00e9tude d'AT&T; l'importance accord\u00e9e \u00e0 cette \u00e9tude dans les n\u00e9gociations que Bell et le SCEP ont men\u00e9es de 1988 \u00e0 1990 au sujet de la parit\u00e9 salariale; et, enfin, si des renseignements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis au comit\u00e9 conjoint \u00e0 propos de l'\u00e9tude d'AT&T.\n[9] \u00c0 notre avis, ces points que Bell a l'intention de soulever sont dans une large mesure ceux que le SCEP a abord\u00e9s lors de l'interrogatoire principal de Mme Blackstaffe. Nous avons conclu que Bell peut contre-interroger Mme Blackstaffe au sujet de l'\u00e9tude d'AT&T, mais que ses questions doivent porter uniquement sur les points mentionn\u00e9s dans le paragraphe pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent.\nB. Protocole d'entente- \u00c9tude conjointe [10] D'apr\u00e8s notre interpr\u00e9tation du document de Bell intitul\u00e9 Outline for the Cross-Examination et des observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es de vive voix, Bell veut \u00e9tablir lors du contre-interrogatoire de Mme Blackstaffe que le pouvoir de prendre des d\u00e9cisions \u00e0 propos de l'\u00e9tude conjointe n'appartenait pas au comit\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9voyait le protocole d'entente, mais qu'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9volu, en fait, au sous-comit\u00e9. Bell all\u00e8gue que ce changement a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9 par Mme Blackstaffe afin que le SCEP puisse influencer ind\u00fbment les r\u00e9sultats de l'\u00e9tude conjointe.\n[11] Le Tribunal a entendu de longs t\u00e9moignages tant de la part de Linda Wu que de Mme Blackstaffe au sujet des n\u00e9gociations qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 l'adoption du protocole d'entente par les parties. Aspect plus pertinent, Mme Wu, et plus particuli\u00e8rement Mme Blackstaffe, ont longuement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des activit\u00e9s du sous-comit\u00e9. Mme Blackstaffe a produit une documentation volumineuse, notamment des notes manuscrites, des ordres du jour de r\u00e9unions des deux comit\u00e9s, des notes de service adress\u00e9es aux dirigeants du SCEP, des proc\u00e8s-verbaux de r\u00e9unions du sous-comit\u00e9 et du comit\u00e9 conjoint et une foule d'autres documents. Tous ces documents indiquent tous comment le sous-comit\u00e9 fonctionnait, les d\u00e9cisions qu'il a prises et le r\u00f4le qu'il a jou\u00e9 dans le cadre de l'\u00e9tude conjointe, comparativement au r\u00f4le du comit\u00e9 conjoint. Mme Blackstaffe a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 un contre-interrogatoire tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9 au sujet de cette documentation.\n[12] \u00c0 notre avis, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de produire d'autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 ce sujet pour que Bell puisse donner suite \u00e0 ses all\u00e9gations. La poursuite du contre-interrogatoire sur le protocole d'entente ne contribuerait gu\u00e8re, voire nullement, \u00e0 permettre au Tribunal d'approfondir sa connaissance et sa compr\u00e9hension de cette question.\nC. Formation des membres du comit\u00e9 conjoint [13] Bell affirme que les membres du comit\u00e9 conjoint n'ont pas re\u00e7u une formation suffisante en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9valuation des postes ou de parit\u00e9 salariale. Selon Bell, Mme Blackstaffe avait beaucoup plus de connaissances et a utilis\u00e9 celles-ci au profit du SCEP. Le Tribunal ne sait pas clairement quelle sera la nature du contre-interrogatoire de Bell. Le Tribunal d\u00e9terminera la port\u00e9e qu'il convient de donner au contre-interrogatoire de Bell \u00e0 ce sujet si des objections sont soulev\u00e9es.\nD. Le rapport d'expert de Dr Gould au sujet du calcul des int\u00e9r\u00eats [14] Bell demande que le Tribunal n'admette pas en preuve le rapport du professeur Lawrence Gould au sujet du calcul des int\u00e9r\u00eats. Dr Gould n'a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l'audience, et le Tribunal n'a encore pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de ses comp\u00e9tences. Nous croyons comprendre que c'est \u00e0 la demande du SCEP que Bell a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 cette requ\u00eate \u00e0 ce stade-ci de l'instance plut\u00f4t que d'attendre jusqu'au moment du t\u00e9moignage de Dr Gould. Le SCEP a fait cette demande \u00e0 Bell afin d'\u00e9viter de retarder l'audience et de pouvoir indiquer avec certitude \u00e0 Dr Gould \u00e0 quel moment il t\u00e9moignera, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n[15] \u00c0 notre avis, le moment choisi pour pr\u00e9senter cette requ\u00eate est inopportun. Bell a clairement indiqu\u00e9 que si cette requ\u00eate n'est pas accueillie, elle se r\u00e9serve le droit de contre-interroger Dr Gould au sujet de sa comp\u00e9tence et de soulever, s'il y a lieu, d'autres objections \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son rapport d'expert. Ayant appris la chose, le Tribunal a indiqu\u00e9 aux parties qu'il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de statuer sur la requ\u00eate apr\u00e8s avoir entendu Dr Gould d\u00e9crire sa comp\u00e9tence et expliquer comment celle-ci cadre avec l'objet et la port\u00e9e de son rapport. Les parties ont repouss\u00e9 cette suggestion.\n[16] Nous ne voyons aucune utilit\u00e9 \u00e0 entendre cette requ\u00eate \u00e0 ce moment-ci. Le SCEP entend appeler un certain nombre de t\u00e9moins avant Dr Gould. On ne peut pr\u00e9voir quand ce dernier t\u00e9moignera. Bell entend contre-interroger Dr Gould sur sa comp\u00e9tence; par cons\u00e9quent, toute \u00e9conomie de temps envisag\u00e9e est illusoire. Enfin, il n'est pas particuli\u00e8rement souhaitable que ce Tribunal se penche sur l'admissibilit\u00e9 d'un t\u00e9moignage d'expert qui pourrait \u00eatre important alors qu'il ne sait absolument rien au sujet de la comp\u00e9tence du t\u00e9moin, si ce n'est ce qui est dit dans la version pr\u00e9liminaire du rapport de Dr Gould dont le Tribunal a re\u00e7u un exemplaire afin qu'il puisse le parcourir sans l'\u00e9clairage des parties.\n[17] Le Tribunal a conclu que cette requ\u00eate est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 et inopportune pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-dessus. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ne se prononcera pas sur cette requ\u00eate \u00e0 ce moment-ci. Cette d\u00e9cision n'emp\u00eache aucunement Bell de pr\u00e9senter ult\u00e9rieurement cette requ\u00eate ou une autre requ\u00eate au sujet du t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9vu de Dr Gould. Elle n'emp\u00eache pas non plus le SCEP de faire valoir des arguments \u00e0 l'encontre de toute requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Bell.\nE. Requ\u00eate du SCEP visant \u00e0 limiter le contre-interrogatoire de Mme Blackstaffe [18] Le SCEP demande que le contre-interrogatoire de Mme Blackstaffe par Bell soit limit\u00e9 \u00e0 dix ou douze jours de plus. D'apr\u00e8s ce que le Tribunal a entendu jusqu'\u00e0 maintenant, il semble que le motif principal, voire le seul motif, de cette requ\u00eate soit le d\u00e9sir de Mme Blackstaffe de terminer son contre-interrogatoire en raison des pressions dont elle fait l'objet au travail.\n[19] Le contre-interrogatoire de Mme Blackstaffe a d\u00e9but\u00e9 le 15 d\u00e9cembre 2003. Au 30 juin 2004, il n'avait pas encore pris fin. Entre le 15 d\u00e9cembre 2003 et le 30 juin 2004, Mme Blackstaffe a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins pendant environ 26 jours. Au cours de la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode, le Tribunal avait pr\u00e9vu 57 jours d'audience. Trente et un jours d'audience ont \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9s \u00e0 la demande des parties. Ces annulations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9es par divers facteurs, notamment la m\u00e9prise d'un procureur quant \u00e0 la date de la rel\u00e2che scolaire d'hiver, la participation du t\u00e9moin \u00e0 d'autres r\u00e9unions, les divulgations suppl\u00e9mentaires ou tardives de documents par un procureur, ainsi que des motifs m\u00e9dicaux ou personnels. Il est \u00e9vident que si l'audience s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9roul\u00e9e comme pr\u00e9vu, ou m\u00eame \u00e0 la plupart des dates pr\u00e9vues, le contre-interrogatoire de Mme Blackstaffe et tout r\u00e9interrogatoire auraient pris fin le ou avant le 30 juin 2004.\n[20] Comme l'ont reconnu les parties, le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure. Selon Brown et Evans - Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada (Toronto : Canvasback Publishing, 2003) - , un [TRADUCTION] tribunal a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de limiter un contre-interrogatoire afin de maintenir la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de limites raisonnables. Dans leur ouvrage intitul\u00e9 Witnesses (Toronto : Carswell, 2004), Mewett et Sankoff reconnaissent eux aussi que le droit de contre-interroger n'est pas illimit\u00e9 et que les tribunaux ont le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de limiter les interrogatoires r\u00e9p\u00e9titifs ou prolixes, mais que ce pouvoir doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 avec prudence.\n[21] Le SCEP a fait \u00e9tat d'un certain nombre de fa\u00e7ons d'abr\u00e9ger la suite du contre-interrogatoire de Mme Blackstaffe :\nmaintenir la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal relativement \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude d'AT&T; restreindre le contre-interrogatoire aux questions qui n'ont pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9es. Le Tribunal l'a fait dans le cas du protocole d'entente; les procureurs ne devraient pas revenir avec des questions qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 donn\u00e9 cette directive, \u00e0 laquelle le procureur de Bell s'est pour l'essentiel pli\u00e9 et continuera de se plier; le procureur de Bell devrait fournir \u00e0 Mme Blackstaffe les documents au pr\u00e9alable afin qu'elle puisse les lire avant d'\u00eatre contre-interrog\u00e9e \u00e0 leur sujet, ce qu'il s'est d'ailleurs engag\u00e9 \u00e0 faire; les procureurs devraient produire \u00e0 l'avance les documents avec le consentement des parties et prendront un engagement en ce sens; le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 au procureur de Bell de ne pas continuer de poser \u00e0 Mme Blackstaffe des questions sur des points dont elle a dit ne pas se souvenir ou ne pas \u00eatre au courant. Le procureur de Bell s'est pli\u00e9 \u00e0 cette directive et continuera de le faire. Le SCEP soutient que si ces suggestions sont adopt\u00e9es, il suffira probablement de dix \u00e0 douze jours pour terminer le contre-interrogatoire de Mme Blackstaffe, d'o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9sentation \u00e0 ce moment-ci de sa requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 limiter le contre-interrogatoire de cette derni\u00e8re.\n[22] \u00c0 notre avis, il ne s'agit pas d'un cas o\u00f9 le Tribunal doit exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et restreindre la dur\u00e9e du contre-interrogatoire de Bell. Bell a retir\u00e9 les 17 questions qu'elle entendait poser \u00e0 Mme Blackstaffe. Cette mesure, ainsi que les limites impos\u00e9es en ce qui touche le contre-interrogatoire portant sur l'\u00e9tude d'AT&T, la cessation du contre-interrogatoire sur le protocole d'entente, ainsi que le respect par les procureurs des consignes \u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9es ci-dessus, devraient r\u00e9duire consid\u00e9rablement le d\u00e9lai n\u00e9cessaire pour terminer le contre-interrogatoire de Mme Blackstaffe, d\u00e9lai qui pourrait peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame \u00eatre r\u00e9duit au nombre de jours indiqu\u00e9 par le SCEP. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal n'accueille pas la requ\u00eate du SCEP.\nSign\u00e9 par\nJ.

Maintien de la comp\u00e9tence\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision porte sur la question du redressement. Dans une d\u00e9cision rendue ant\u00e9rieurement dans cette affaire, j'ai jug\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9, le minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social (Sant\u00e9 Canada), avait exerc\u00e9 une discrimination \u00e0 l'endroit du plaignant, le Dr Shiv Chopra (Canada (Comm. des droits de la personne) c. Canada (minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social) (no 5) (2001), 40 C.H.R.R. D\/396 (T.C.D.P.)). \u00c0 la demande des parties, je n'ai abord\u00e9 que la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9 aux termes de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. J'ai conserv\u00e9 ma comp\u00e9tence pour entendre ult\u00e9rieurement des t\u00e9moignages et des arguments dans le cas o\u00f9 les parties seraient incapables de parvenir \u00e0 une entente en ce qui concerne la question du redressement.\n[2] Le 8 juillet 2002, le plaignant a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que les parties n'avaient pu en venir \u00e0 une entente et a demand\u00e9 la tenue d'une audience sur la question du redressement.\nI. HISTORIQUE [3] Le Dr Chopra a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (Commission) le 16 septembre 1992. Il a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que Sant\u00e9 Canada avait exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race, la couleur et l'origine nationale ou ethnique, compte tenu de la mani\u00e8re dont le poste de directeur du Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments humains prescrits (BMHP) a \u00e9t\u00e9 dot\u00e9 entre septembre 1990 et le printemps de 1992. En 1995, un tribunal pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 par Daniel Soberman a rejet\u00e9 la plainte. En 1998, la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le et a annul\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision. La Cour a renvoy\u00e9 la question au Tribunal afin qu'elle soit tranch\u00e9e sur la foi du dossier existant et de la preuve statistique qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 exclue par le tribunal initial. En janvier 1999, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a maintenu la d\u00e9cision de la Section de premi\u00e8re instance. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires m'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s lors d'audiences tenues entre mai 1999 et d\u00e9cembre 2000.\n[4] Dans ma d\u00e9cision, j'ai indiqu\u00e9 que le Dr Chopra avait vu sa candidature au poste de directeur du BMHP \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection parce qu'il ne poss\u00e9dait pas d' exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente en gestion . Au cours des deux ann\u00e9es qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le concours, le poste d'une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e de directeur du BMHP est demeur\u00e9 vacant. Le Dr Chopra avait demand\u00e9 qu'on le nomme \u00e0 ce poste \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire, mais sa demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. Si on l'avait nomm\u00e9, il aurait acquis l'exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente en gestion n\u00e9cessaire pour que sa candidature soit retenue \u00e0 la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection. Au regard de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, j'ai conclu que le fait d'avoir refus\u00e9 au Dr Chopra la possibilit\u00e9 d'occuper le poste \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire \u00e9tait attribuable en partie \u00e0 la discrimination dont il faisait l'objet en raison de son origine nationale ou ethnique.\n[5] Toutefois, j'ai \u00e9galement fait remarquer que m\u00eame si sa candidature avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue pour le concours final, le Dr Chopra n'aurait pas n\u00e9cessairement obtenu le poste. Cette question devait \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e ult\u00e9rieurement, au moment de l'examen de la question du redressement.\nII. CADRE JURIDIQUE [6] Les pouvoirs de r\u00e9paration du Tribunal sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 53 de la Loi. Les mesures de redressement pr\u00e9vues par cet article visent \u00e0 emp\u00eacher de futurs actes discriminatoires et \u00e0 indemniser les victimes. L'objectif de l'indemnisation est de remettre la victime dans la position o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 si le tort qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 ne s'\u00e9tait pas produit (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. McAlpine (1989), 12 C.H.R.R. D\/253, au par. 13 (C.A.F)).\n[7] Le Dr Chopra demande d'\u00eatre nomm\u00e9 sans tarder \u00e0 un poste de niveau EX et d'\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 des pertes salariales qu'il a subies de 1990 \u00e0 ce jour. Afin d'\u00e9tablir s'il a droit \u00e0 ces mesures de redressement, il doit d\u00e9montrer que la conduite discriminatoire de l'intim\u00e9 l'a emp\u00each\u00e9 d'obtenir l'exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente en gestion n\u00e9cessaire, qui l'aurait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00e0 occuper le poste \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire et qui aurait fait en sorte que sa candidature puisse \u00eatre retenue \u00e0 la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection aux fins du concours final. Il s'agit d'un exercice qui est manifestement hypoth\u00e9tique. Le Tribunal doit tenter de faire un retour dans le temps et d'examiner ce qui se serait produit en l'absence de discrimination. Sur quelle norme pareille d\u00e9cision doit-elle \u00eatre fond\u00e9e?\n[8] Les avocats de la Commission et du plaignant soutiennent tous deux qu'il suffit que le Tribunal conclue qu'il existait une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse qu'un \u00e9v\u00e9nement survienne. Par exemple, s'il existait une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse que le Dr Chopra soit le candidat heureux \u00e0 l'issue du concours final de 1992, en supposant que sa candidature ait \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue, on pourrait conclure qu'on a refus\u00e9 de lui accorder le poste en raison de l'acte discriminatoire. \u00c0 l'appui de leur pr\u00e9tention, ils citent les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par le juge Marceau dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Morgan [1992] 2 C.F. 401 (C.A.F.). En l'occurrence, le plaignant avait tent\u00e9 de s'enr\u00f4ler dans les Forces canadiennes, mais sa demande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e pour des motifs qui, en bout de ligne, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s discriminatoires. Les questions port\u00e9es devant la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale avaient trait au redressement auquel avait droit le plaignant. La Cour s'est pench\u00e9e sur la question de l'approche \u00e0 adopter pour d\u00e9terminer la perte indemnisable. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le juge Marceau a \u00e9crit ce qui suit aux pages 412 et 413 :\nIl m'est difficile d'accepter la conclusion du tribunal d'appel ent\u00e9rin\u00e9e par mon coll\u00e8gue qu'il suffisait d'examiner le r\u00e9sultat probable du processus de recrutement pour conclure qu'il s'agissait de la perte d'un emploi plut\u00f4t que de la perte d'une simple possibilit\u00e9 d'emploi. La Cour n'a pas \u00e0 se pencher sur la preuve d'un fait ant\u00e9rieur qui, dans une cour civile, se fait par pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. La Cour n'a pas non plus \u00e0 examiner le lien entre un r\u00e9sultat particulier et sa cause \u00e9ventuelle. Il me semble qu'il ne faut pas confondre la preuve d'une perte v\u00e9ritable et de son lien avec l'acte discriminatoire avec la preuve de l'ampleur de la perte. Pour d\u00e9montrer l'existence d'un pr\u00e9judice donnant droit \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9, il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9montrer que, n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire, le plaignant aurait certainement obtenu le poste. De plus, aux fins d'\u00e9tablir le pr\u00e9judice, point n'est besoin de d\u00e9montrer la probabilit\u00e9 de celui-ci. \u00c0 mon avis, la preuve d'une possibilit\u00e9, pourvu qu'elle soit s\u00e9rieuse, suffit \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer l'existence du pr\u00e9judice. Par contre, pour conna\u00eetre l'ampleur du pr\u00e9judice et les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qu'il entra\u00eene, il m'appara\u00eet impossible de rejeter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant que, de toute mani\u00e8re, le poste aurait pu \u00eatre refus\u00e9. La pr\u00e9sence de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment d'incertitude emp\u00eacherait le tribunal d'accorder les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qu'il accorderait en l'absence de celui-ci. L'indemnit\u00e9 fix\u00e9e par le tribunal devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9duite en fonction du degr\u00e9 d'incertitude.\n(c'est moi qui souligne)\n[9] Dans l'affaire Morgan, les deux autres juges de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n'ont pas adopt\u00e9 la m\u00eame approche. Le juge MacGuigan, \u00e0 la page 425 de son jugement dissident, a indiqu\u00e9 qu'un tribunal devrait examiner le r\u00e9sultat probable de l'ensemble du processus de s\u00e9lection pour d\u00e9terminer si un plaignant a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 dans le cas de la perte d'un emploi. Le juge Mahoney a choisi de ne pas se prononcer sur cette question. Il a fait remarquer que ses coll\u00e8gues et lui s'accordaient tous \u00e0 dire qu'en tout \u00e9tat de cause, compte tenu des faits entourant l'affaire, le plaignant aurait certes \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de s'enr\u00f4ler, n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire.\n[10] Dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Uzoaba [1995] 2 C.F. 569 (C.F., 1re inst.), le juge Rothstein a mentionn\u00e9 explicitement et fait sien le crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par le juge Marceau dans Morgan. Dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Green [2000] 4 C.F. 629, au par. 142 (C.F. 1re inst.), le juge Lemieux a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il faisait sien le principe formul\u00e9 dans Morgan selon lequel pour \u00e9tablir le pr\u00e9judice, soit la perte d'un emploi ou d'une promotion, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9montrer la probabilit\u00e9 - il suffit [au plaignant] de faire la preuve d'une possibilit\u00e9, pourvu qu'elle soit s\u00e9rieuse . Au paragraphe 151, la Cour explique que, pour certaines de ses conclusions, elle se fonde sur le crit\u00e8re de la possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse de l'arr\u00eat Morgan . Dans Nkwazi c. SCC (2001), 39 C.H.R.R. D\/237, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a appliqu\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re de la possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse pour d\u00e9terminer si la plaignante aurait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir un poste plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 si l'acte discriminatoire reproch\u00e9 ne l'avait pas emp\u00each\u00e9e de concourir.\n[11] Au regard de ces pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents et des autres textes faisant autorit\u00e9 cit\u00e9s par les avocats, je suis convaincu qu'un plaignant qui demande r\u00e9paration parce qu'on lui a refus\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un poste plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 n'a qu'\u00e0 fournir la preuve qu'il existait une s\u00e9rieuse possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9ussite.\nIII. REDRESSEMENTS DEMAND\u00c9S PAR LE DR CHOPRA A. Indemnisation des pertes salariales - Directeur int\u00e9rimaire du BMHP [12] Dans ma d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure, j'ai jug\u00e9 que Sant\u00e9 Canada avait discrimin\u00e9 le Dr Chopra en le privant de la possibilit\u00e9 d'occuper \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire le poste de directeur du BMHP. J'ai conclu que son origine nationale ou ethnique \u00e9tait l'un des facteurs qui avaient jou\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, et que le motif invoqu\u00e9 par Sant\u00e9 Canada (manque d'exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente en gestion) pour expliquer pourquoi sa candidature n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en compte \u00e9tait un pr\u00e9texte.\n[13] Sant\u00e9 Canada soutient que le Dr Chopra n'avait pas la comp\u00e9tence n\u00e9cessaire pour occuper \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire le poste de directeur du BMHP et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il n'aurait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi \u00e0 cette fin, qu'il y ait eu ou non discrimination. Cependant, on ne saurait admettre cette pr\u00e9tention. Mme Claire Franklin a obtenu l'affectation, qui a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9e, et ce, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s que le Comit\u00e9 d'appel de la Commission de la fonction publique eut jug\u00e9 qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas enti\u00e8rement qualifi\u00e9e pour occuper le poste \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire. De toute \u00e9vidence, Sant\u00e9 Canada ne se souciait pas outre mesure de la question \u00e0 savoir si un candidat satisfaisait \u00e0 toutes les conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis convaincu, au regard de la preuve en l'esp\u00e8ce quant aux comp\u00e9tences du Dr Chopra \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque et du peu d'importance que Sant\u00e9 Canada accordait \u00e0 l'aspect comp\u00e9tence, qu'il existait une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse, que le Dr Chopra soit nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire directeur du BMHP, n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 des actes discriminatoires dont il a fait l'objet.\n[14] Quelle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 la dur\u00e9e de son affectation int\u00e9rimaire? Mme Franklin a obtenu trois nominations int\u00e9rimaires au cours de la p\u00e9riode de onze mois comprise entre le 20 octobre 1990 et le 20 septembre 1991. Entre le 20 septembre 1991 et le 13 f\u00e9vrier 1992, Mme Franklin n'\u00e9tait plus officiellement titulaire par int\u00e9rim du poste, mais elle a continu\u00e9 officieusement d'exercer les fonctions s'y rattachant. Sa classification et son traitement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rajust\u00e9s afin qu'ils correspondent \u00e0 son affectation ant\u00e9rieure. Bien que Mme Franklin ait officiellement cess\u00e9 d'occuper \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire le poste de directeur du BMHP, je suis convaincu, au regard des conclusions de ma d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure, que sa nomination int\u00e9rimaire a, en fait, \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue tout au cours de cette p\u00e9riode. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'il n'y a pas eu de titulaire int\u00e9rimaire entre le 13 f\u00e9vrier 1992 et le 21 avril 1992. Le 21 avril 1992, la Commission de la fonction publique a confirm\u00e9 la nomination pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e de Mme Franklin au poste de directeur du BMHP. Cette d\u00e9cision a fait l'objet d'un appel, mais la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a finalement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas faire obstacle \u00e0 la nomination. Par cons\u00e9quent, la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 le poste int\u00e9rimaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 occup\u00e9 est d'environ seize mois (ou 68 semaines), allant du 20 octobre 1990 au 13 f\u00e9vrier 1992.\n[15] Le 13 septembre 1990, le Dr Chopra a \u00e9crit au Dr Emmanuel Somers, directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Direction des m\u00e9dicaments, afin de proposer sa candidature au poste int\u00e9rimaire. Le Dr Chopra a propos\u00e9 que lui et les autres candidats assurent, par voie de rotation, l'int\u00e9rim pendant un certain temps, apr\u00e8s quoi on demanderait \u00e0 la personne la plus efficace de continuer d'assumer les fonctions pendant une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Dans les circonstances, cela aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 une option raisonnable que le Dr Somers et le sous-ministre adjoint, le Dr Albert Liston, auraient pu retenir, n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision qu'ils avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 prise de nommer Mme Franklin. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que les affectations int\u00e9rimaires \u00e9taient habituellement pour des p\u00e9riodes ne d\u00e9passant pas quatre mois afin d'\u00e9viter d'avoir \u00e0 tenir un concours en bonne et due forme. Les affectations int\u00e9rimaires d'une dur\u00e9e de plus de quatre mois \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des nominations susceptibles d'appel, aux termes de la Loi sur l'emploi dans la fonction publique, L.R.C. 1985, ch. P-33. En l'esp\u00e8ce, la nomination de Mme Franklin, bien que d'une dur\u00e9e limit\u00e9e \u00e0 quatre mois, a \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9e officiellement \u00e0 deux reprises, avec le r\u00e9sultat qu'elle a occup\u00e9 le poste durant 11 mois au total.\n[16] Au moins trois personnes ont manifest\u00e9 de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du poste int\u00e9rimaire de directeur du BMHP : le Dr Chopra, Mme Franklin et le Dr Michele Brill-Edwards. Il conviendrait \u00e0 mon avis de diviser par trois la p\u00e9riode de 68 semaines, compte tenu du nombre de candidats int\u00e9ress\u00e9s. Je ne m'inqui\u00e8te pas du fait que le r\u00e9sultat obtenu (22 b ou environ 5 a mois) d\u00e9passe la dur\u00e9e habituelle de quatre mois des affectations int\u00e9rimaires. Comme je l'ai dit, Sant\u00e9 Canada, dans le cas de Mme Franklin, n'a pas eu de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 renouveler les affectations et \u00e0 prolonger ainsi leur dur\u00e9e.\n[17] L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e a propos\u00e9 que je fonde mes calculs sur une p\u00e9riode de onze mois afin de tenir compte du fait qu'\u00e0 compter du 20 septembre 1991, Mme Franklin n'agissait plus comme titulaire int\u00e9rimaire du poste. Cependant, comme je l'ai indiqu\u00e9 ci-haut, le changement rev\u00eatait un caract\u00e8re purement th\u00e9orique. Dans la pratique, elle a continu\u00e9 d'exercer les m\u00eames fonctions qu'auparavant. La p\u00e9riode de 68 semaines est plus r\u00e9aliste.\n[18] Comme ma conclusion \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est bas\u00e9e sur l'hypoth\u00e8se que les trois candidats \u00e9taient \u00e9galement int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e0 agir comme directeur int\u00e9rimaire du BMHP, je ne vois aucune raison de ne pas ordonner que les dommages au chapitre des pertes salariales soient calcul\u00e9s \u00e0 compter de la date de la premi\u00e8re nomination int\u00e9rimaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Dr Chopra doit \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 de toutes les pertes qu'il a subies en ce qui touche les salaires et les autres avantages sur une p\u00e9riode de 22 2\/3 semaines \u00e0 compter du 20 octobre 1990, soit la date du d\u00e9but de la premi\u00e8re affectation int\u00e9rimaire.\nB. Indemnisation des pertes salariales - poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e de directeur du BMHP [19] Le Dr Chopra demande d'\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 des pertes salariales qu'il a subies relativement au poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e de directeur du BMHP. Il affirme que s'il avait occup\u00e9 \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire le poste au cours des mois ayant pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le concours final de 1992, il aurait acquis l'exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente en gestion n\u00e9cessaire pour que sa candidature soit retenue \u00e0 la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection. Selon ses dires, il aurait exist\u00e9, une fois l'\u00e9tape de la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection franchie, une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse qu'il remporte le concours.\n[20] Le guide de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection \u00e9tabli en vue du concours \u00e9non\u00e7ait certaines conditions minimales auxquelles un candidat devait satisfaire pour passer \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape suivante. Ces conditions avaient trait aux \u00e9tudes du candidat, \u00e0 son exp\u00e9rience, \u00e0 sa connaissance des langues officielles et \u00e0 ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de rendement. La fiche de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection utilis\u00e9e par le jury de s\u00e9lection indique que seulement quatre des quatorze candidats dont la candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s comme ayant les comp\u00e9tences voulues dans chacune de ces cat\u00e9gories; Mme Franklin et le Dr Brill-Edwards \u00e9taient du nombre. Le Dr Chopra a \u00e9t\u00e9 exclu parce qu'il ne poss\u00e9dait pas d'exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente dans la gestion d'un organisme \u00e0 vocation scientifique ou m\u00e9dicale dot\u00e9 de son propre budget et sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 dans un certain nombre de disciplines ou d'activit\u00e9s de programme. Cette lacune est signal\u00e9e sur la fiche de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection au moyen d'un X . Cependant, outre cette annotation, on trouve en regard du nom du Dr Chopra un point d'interrogation relativement \u00e0 l'\u00e9tendue de son exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente comme porte-parole officiel de Sant\u00e9 Canada ou d'autres organismes sur des questions de sant\u00e9 comportant de multiples facettes. Bien qu'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 produit pour expliquer pleinement la signification du point d'interrogation, il est \u00e9vident que ce r\u00e9sultat n'est pas aussi concluant que les marques qu'on trouve ailleurs sur la fiche de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection, comme celle confirmant que le Dr Chopra poss\u00e9dait les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents scolaires n\u00e9cessaires.\n[21] Parmi les quatre employ\u00e9s dont la candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue au stade de la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection, deux ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de se retirer du processus d'\u00e9valuation tandis que les deux autres (Mme Franklin et le Dr Brill-Edwards) ont acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape suivante. Un profil de s\u00e9lection distinct a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 pour cette \u00e9tape. Ce profil \u00e9non\u00e7ait les qualit\u00e9s requises, telles qu'\u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans le guide de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection, ainsi que plusieurs exigences nouvelles, notamment la connaissance des techniques de gestion, la connaissance de la conduite d'essais et de tests d'innocuit\u00e9 et d'efficacit\u00e9 des m\u00e9dicaments, la connaissance de la port\u00e9e et de la nature des m\u00e9dicaments destin\u00e9s \u00e0 l'usage humain, et la connaissance du r\u00f4le du gouvernement en mati\u00e8re de protection de la sant\u00e9, ainsi que des politiques, des programmes, des objectifs et des priorit\u00e9s connexes. De plus, le candidat devait \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 en fonction de son aptitude \u00e0 communiquer, \u00e0 g\u00e9rer un programme r\u00e9glementaire et \u00e0 \u00e9valuer, synth\u00e9tiser et analyser des donn\u00e9es scientifiques et m\u00e9dicales. Les comp\u00e9tences en leadership du candidat ainsi que ses aptitudes personnelles \u00e9taient \u00e9galement des \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e0 maintenant prendre en compte.\n[22] Le jury de s\u00e9lection a conclu que Mme Franklin \u00e9tait la seule candidate ayant les qualit\u00e9s requises. Mme Franklin a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal au cours de la derni\u00e8re s\u00e9rie d'audiences portant sur le redressement. Elle a fourni des pr\u00e9cisions quant aux comp\u00e9tences qu'elle poss\u00e9dait, estimait-elle, par rapport aux diverses exigences \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le guide de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection et le profil de s\u00e9lection \u00e9tablis relativement au poste de directeur du BMHP. Ainsi, de 1984 \u00e0 1990, elle a g\u00e9r\u00e9 une division de la Direction de l'hygi\u00e8ne du milieu de Sant\u00e9 Canada qui \u00e9tait dot\u00e9e d'un effectif d'environ 45 personnes et d'un budget de l'ordre de 10 millions de dollars. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la porte-parole officielle de Sant\u00e9 Canada devant de nombreux comit\u00e9s et a \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9e par les m\u00e9dias. Elle a \u00e9galement d\u00e9crit en d\u00e9tail les raisons pour lesquelles elle croyait poss\u00e9der les connaissances exig\u00e9es.\n[23] Mme Franklin a d\u00e9crit le processus d'\u00e9valuation suivi par le jury de s\u00e9lection. Vingt-quatre heures avant son entrevue, elle s'est vu remettre un document d'une centaine de pages portant sur une question scientifique qui ne relevait pas du domaine des m\u00e9dicaments humains prescrits et dont aucun des candidats n'avait une connaissance intime. Elle a d\u00fb lire le document en soir\u00e9e et assimiler l'information afin d'\u00eatre en mesure de pr\u00e9senter un bref expos\u00e9 et de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des questions \u00e0 l'entrevue. En outre, une heure avant de rencontrer le jury, elle a re\u00e7u un document \u00e0 propos duquel elle a d\u00fb r\u00e9diger une note de breffage destin\u00e9e \u00e0 un fonctionnaire sup\u00e9rieur. Ce document traitait d'une question non reli\u00e9e au domaine des m\u00e9dicaments humains prescrits. Mme Franklin se souvenait que son entrevue avait \u00e9t\u00e9 longue et intensive. Son t\u00e9moignage en ce qui touche le processus d'\u00e9valuation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9.\n[24] Lors des r\u00e9centes audiences portant sur la question du redressement, le Dr Chopra a lui aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9. On lui a demand\u00e9 ce qui se serait produit s'il avait pu acqu\u00e9rir de l'exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 titre de directeur int\u00e9rimaire du BMHP. Il a r\u00e9pondu qu'il avait toujours excell\u00e9 dans les \u00e9tudes qu'il avait entreprises dans de nombreuses disciplines. Il \u00e9tait une personne travailleuse; par exemple, il s'\u00e9tait mis \u00e0 l'apprentissage du fran\u00e7ais bien avant que celui-ci devienne populaire ou n\u00e9cessaire. Il a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que ses sup\u00e9rieurs ont reconnu son potentiel et qu'ils l'ont recommand\u00e9, par exemple, pour le Programme cours et affectations de perfectionnement et le Programme de gestion ax\u00e9e sur les objectifs (GAO). \u00c0 son avis, il \u00e9tait plus comp\u00e9tent que Mme Franklin en ce qui concerne le volet Connaissances, car celles-ci s'inscrivaient dans des domaines scientifiques o\u00f9 il travaillait depuis des ann\u00e9es, contrairement \u00e0 sa coll\u00e8gue qui n'avait pas, selon lui, suffisamment de connaissances.\n[25] On a fait remarquer au Dr Chopra que Mme Franklin avait accumul\u00e9 environ treize ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience en gestion avant sa nomination \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire au poste de directeur du BMHP en 1990, qu'elle avait dans le pass\u00e9 r\u00e9cent \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la t\u00eate d'une \u00e9quipe d'environ 45 employ\u00e9s et qu'elle poss\u00e9dait, par cons\u00e9quent, une exp\u00e9rience beaucoup plus vaste que celle qu'il aurait pu acqu\u00e9rir pendant quelques mois gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des affectations rotatives \u00e0 un poste int\u00e9rimaire. Le Dr Chopra a r\u00e9pondu qu'\u00e0 son avis, la composante gestion \u00e9tait faible par rapport au volet scientifique qui, lui, \u00e9tait beaucoup plus important. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus comp\u00e9tent que Mme Franklin si on lui avait donn\u00e9 l'occasion de rivaliser avec elle. Cependant, le Dr Chopra n'a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 \u00e0 aucun moment comment il aurait satisfait \u00e0 chacune des conditions requises \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le profil de s\u00e9lection.\n[26] Avait-il de l'exp\u00e9rience comme porte-parole de Sant\u00e9 Canada ou d'un organisme semblable au sujet de questions d\u00e9licates li\u00e9es \u00e0 la sant\u00e9? Connaissait-il le r\u00f4le que le gouvernement joue en mati\u00e8re de protection de la sant\u00e9? Connaissait-il les techniques et les approches de gestion? Le Dr Chopra et la Commission sont apparemment d'avis qu'il va de soi en quelque sorte qu'il poss\u00e9dait, ou aurait poss\u00e9der, les qualit\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires pour occuper le poste. Ses \u00e9valuations de rendement \u00e9taient enti\u00e8rement satisfaisantes. Du fait qu'il travaillait au sein du Bureau, il devait avoir une bonne connaissance du domaine pertinent. En 1975, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tach\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du projet GAO; en 1977, il a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 un programme de formation en gestion d'une dur\u00e9e de six semaines. Par cons\u00e9quent, il devait conna\u00eetre les techniques et les approches de gestion.\n[27] Abstraction faite de ses affirmations personnelles selon lesquelles il \u00e9tait plus comp\u00e9tent que Mme Franklin, le Dr Chopra n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve particulier \u00e0 l'appui de cette pr\u00e9tention. La Commission et le plaignant ont \u00e9nergiquement soutenu qu'un tel exercice \u00e9tait totalement inutile. Ils ont affirm\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de comparer les deux aspirants au poste, compte tenu du crit\u00e8re de la possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l'arr\u00eat Morgan. Le plaignant n'avait pas \u00e0 prouver qu'il aurait certainement, voire probablement, \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi pour le poste. S'il existait une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse que le Dr Chopra obtienne le poste, sa perte r\u00e9elle aura \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie et il ne restera qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9montrer l'\u00e9tendue des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats et \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer l'indemnit\u00e9 mon\u00e9taire pertinente.\n[28] Le plaignant a pr\u00e9tendu que l'exp\u00e9rience qu'il aurait acquise en occupant de fa\u00e7on int\u00e9rimaire le poste de directeur du BMHP aurait en soi cr\u00e9\u00e9 une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse qu'il gagne le concours. Dans son rapport annuel de 1992, la Commission de la fonction publique a \u00e9voqu\u00e9, non sans une certaine inqui\u00e9tude, une \u00e9tude r\u00e9cente r\u00e9v\u00e9lant que les employ\u00e9s ayant obtenu une nomination int\u00e9rimaire \u00e9taient quatre fois plus susceptibles que les autres d'obtenir subs\u00e9quemment une promotion. Dans son rapport annuel 2000-2001, la CFP r\u00e9it\u00e8re son inqui\u00e9tude \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du recours aux nominations int\u00e9rimaires et au fait que les titulaires int\u00e9rimaires jouissent d'un avantage lorsqu'ils posent leur candidature dans le cadre des concours tenus subs\u00e9quemment afin de pourvoir les postes qu'ils ont occup\u00e9s par int\u00e9rim. Le rapport faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une \u00e9tude portant sur 249 nominations faites au niveau EX au cours de deux p\u00e9riodes de trois mois en 1998 et 1999. L'\u00e9tude a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que 77 (environ 93 %) des 83 candidats ayant occup\u00e9 un poste \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire ont par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 choisis comme titulaires du poste en question.\n[29] L'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des preuves pour d\u00e9montrer que les donn\u00e9es que renferme cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tude sont incompl\u00e8tes. Par exemple, il est impossible de savoir si plus d'une personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire \u00e0 ces 77 postes ou si les p\u00e9riodes examin\u00e9es \u00e9taient de toute fa\u00e7on repr\u00e9sentatives. L'auteure de l'\u00e9tude, Madeleine Desroches, a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle avait choisi les p\u00e9riodes de mani\u00e8re al\u00e9atoire. Elle a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'elle avait choisi les 83 candidats surtout en fonction de donn\u00e9es qu'elle avait extraites de plusieurs formulaires \u00e9tablis dans le cadre des processus de nomination. Apparemment, l'employeur n'\u00e9tait aucunement oblig\u00e9 de pr\u00e9ciser sur ces formulaires si le poste avait fait l'objet ant\u00e9rieurement de nominations int\u00e9rimaires. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est possible que Mme Desroches n'ait pu recenser tous les cas de nomination int\u00e9rimaire avant la nomination pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[30] Selon l'intim\u00e9, une telle analyse, si elle doit \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9e, devrait porter sur Sant\u00e9 Canada. Des 25 employ\u00e9s nomm\u00e9s \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire \u00e0 un poste de niveau EX-1 pour une dur\u00e9e de quatre mois ou plus entre juillet 1990 et juillet 1993, seulement six ont par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 promus \u00e0 des postes de niveau EX pour une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e (environ 24 %). Des 10 employ\u00e9s nomm\u00e9s \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire \u00e0 un poste de niveau EX-2 pour une dur\u00e9e de quatre mois ou plus durant la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode, quatre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 promus ult\u00e9rieurement (40 %). Le pourcentage global serait de l'ordre de 29 %.\n[31] \u00c0 mon avis, les pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des donn\u00e9es de la CFP ne sont pas significatives. Il est certes possible que l'employeur ait omis d'indiquer sur certains formulaires que le poste avait ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e9t\u00e9 dot\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on int\u00e9rimaire, mais le fait demeure que dans 93 % des cas o\u00f9 le formulaire renfermait suffisamment de renseignements, on a constat\u00e9 que les candidats ayant obtenu une nomination int\u00e9rimaire avaient par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 promus au poste. Ces donn\u00e9es doivent certes avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisamment probantes puisque la CFP en a fait \u00e9tat dans son rapport annuel 2001-2002. Je ne puis non plus passer sous silence le fait que la CFP a men\u00e9 avant son rapport de 1992 une autre \u00e9tude \u00e9non\u00e7ant une conclusion similaire : ceux qui sont nomm\u00e9s \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire sont plus susceptibles que les autres d'obtenir par la suite une promotion. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve contredisant l'\u00e9tude de 1992 de la CFP, qui co\u00efncide avec le moment o\u00f9 le poste de directeur du BMHP a \u00e9t\u00e9 pourvu, n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9. M\u00eame lorsqu'on examine les donn\u00e9es de Sant\u00e9 Canada pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9, les pourcentages obtenus n'excluent pas une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse que les personnes nomm\u00e9es \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire obtiennent le poste qu'elles ont occup\u00e9.\n[32] Ces constatations m'am\u00e8nent \u00e0 conclure que si le Dr Chopra avait occup\u00e9 \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire le poste de directeur du BMHP pendant un peu plus de cinq mois, il aurait exist\u00e9 une possibilit\u00e9 simple mais s\u00e9rieuse qu'il soit le candidat heureux \u00e0 l'issue du concours final visant \u00e0 pourvoir le poste pour une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[33] Mais ce n'est pas tout. Il se peut que le Dr Chopra ait subi cette perte; toutefois, comme l'a fait remarquer le juge Marceau dans l'arr\u00eat Morgan, on ne saurait, lorsqu'il s'agit de d\u00e9terminer l'ampleur du pr\u00e9judice subi par le Dr Chopra et d'\u00e9valuer les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qu'il entra\u00eene, faire abstraction des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve quant \u00e0 l'incertitude entourant son accession au poste. Les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9duits en fonction du degr\u00e9 d'incertitude.\n[34] J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9crit de nombreux facteurs d'incertitude en l'esp\u00e8ce. Le processus de s\u00e9lection \u00e9tait fort complexe et certaines \u00e9preuves avaient d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ues de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ne conf\u00e9rer aucun avantage aux personnes qui travaillaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 au Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments humains prescrits. En ce qui concerne le cas particulier du Dr Chopra, je n'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi d'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve particulier permettant d'\u00e9tablir qu'il aurait satisfait aux crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans le profil de s\u00e9lection et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, jusqu'\u00e0 quel point. Son exp\u00e9rience la plus r\u00e9cente en gestion aurait consist\u00e9 strictement en une affectation int\u00e9rimaire d'une dur\u00e9e d'un peu plus de cinq mois. Comme je l'ai indiqu\u00e9 ci-haut, le Dr Brill-Edwards et Mme Franklin auraient elles aussi acquis la m\u00eame exp\u00e9rience. Cependant, la preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que Mme Franklin avait des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents vastes et suppl\u00e9mentaires en gestion qui \u00e9taitent bien sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 ceux dont le Dr Chopra poss\u00e9dait.\n[35] Par ailleurs, il ne faut pas oublier que, m\u00eame si le Dr Brill-Edwards a vu sa candidature \u00eatre retenue \u00e0 la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection, on n'a pas jug\u00e9 qu'elle avait les qualit\u00e9s requises pour le poste. Le fait qu'un candidat soit retenu \u00e0 la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection n'implique pas n\u00e9cessairement qu'il ait les qualit\u00e9s requises. Dans le cas du Dr Chopra, il faut aussi signaler la question du point d'interrogation inscrit sur sa fiche de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection relativement \u00e0 son exp\u00e9rience comme porte-parole officiel. Je suis conscient \u00e9galement du fait que cette affaire n'a pas trait \u00e0 des emplois de nature g\u00e9n\u00e9rique. Il n'est pas contest\u00e9 que chaque poste EX est unique et exige des comp\u00e9tences, des aptitudes, des connaissances et un bagage scolaire diff\u00e9rents. L'accession \u00e0 un poste EX n'a rien de simple ni d'automatique.\n[36] Compte tenu de tous ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments, je suis convaincu qu'on devrait r\u00e9duire les pertes salariales du plaignant des deux tiers (2\/3) afin de tenir compte du niveau d'incertitude relativement \u00e9lev\u00e9 quant \u00e0 son accession au poste \u00e0 l'issue du concours final.\n[37] Un autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment doit aussi \u00eatre pris en compte. Ainsi que l'a indiqu\u00e9 la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans McAlpine (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9) (paragraphe 14), seulement la perte qui est raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible est recouvrable. La victime de l'acte discriminatoire doit donc d\u00e9montrer qu'elle a pris des mesures raisonnables pour att\u00e9nuer sa perte (voir le par. 14 de l'arr\u00eat Morgan); par exemple, en l'instance, le plaignant doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il a pris des initiatives de nature \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer ses chances de r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 acc\u00e9der \u00e0 un poste de niveau EX et poser sa candidature \u00e0 de tels postes lorsque l'occasion se pr\u00e9sentait.\n[38] En 1997, le Dr Chopra a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 chef de la Division des m\u00e9dicaments antiparasitaires, endocriniens et du syst\u00e8me nerveux central au Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, poste qui lui a permis d'acqu\u00e9rir quatre mois d'exp\u00e9rience en gestion hi\u00e9rarchique. Cependant, au cours des ann\u00e9es qui ont suivi, il n'a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 aucun concours en vue d'\u00eatre promu \u00e0 un poste de niveau EX. En 2002, le Dr Chopra s'est vu offrir la possibilit\u00e9 d'agir comme chef int\u00e9rimaire de l'\u00c9quipe de l'innocuit\u00e9 microbiologique \u00e0 la Division de l'innocuit\u00e9 pour les humains. Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, il a dit avoir refus\u00e9 cette offre en guise de protestation, indiquant qu'une telle mesure de dotation aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 in\u00e9quitable envers ses coll\u00e8gues. Cependant, dans sa lettre de refus, il invoque comme raison pour justifier son rejet de l'offre le fait que le poste ne repr\u00e9senterait pas pour lui de l'avancement. Comme il \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 au niveau VM-4, le fait d'occuper \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire le poste propos\u00e9 de niveau REM-01 n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une promotion. C'est peut-\u00eatre vrai; toutefois, s'il avait accept\u00e9 le poste, il aurait acquis une exp\u00e9rience suppl\u00e9mentaire cruciale en gestion hi\u00e9rarchique. On a produit en l'esp\u00e8ce des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant que des employ\u00e9s acceptent souvent de nouveaux postes m\u00eame si ceux-ci ne repr\u00e9sentent pas techniquement des promotions, dans le seul but d'acqu\u00e9rir de l'exp\u00e9rience en vue d'obtenir \u00e9ventuellement de l'avancement.\n[39] Somme toute, abstraction faite du concours de 1993 au Bureau des m\u00e9dicaments v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires, auquel j'ai fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans ma d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure, aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour \u00e9tablir que le Dr Chopra avait depuis postul\u00e9 pour d'autres postes d'une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e au niveau EX. Sa candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection dans le cadre de deux concours visant \u00e0 pourvoir des postes au niveau VM-5, et ce, \u00e0 une date relativement r\u00e9cente (2002). Le Dr Chopra a peut-\u00eatre estim\u00e9 qu'il n'avait aucune chance de succ\u00e8s. Peut-\u00eatre ressentait-il une certaine frustration \u00e0 la suite de ses tentatives ant\u00e9rieures pour obtenir de l'avancement. Cependant, le fait demeure que le seul constat de discrimination en ce qui touche le Dr Chopra a trait \u00e0 la dotation du poste de directeur int\u00e9rimaire du BMHP en 1990. Dans ma d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure en l'esp\u00e8ce, j'ai conclu que le Dr Chopra avait avant 1990 n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de saisir plusieurs occasions d'avancement qui s'\u00e9taient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 lui. Il \u00e9tait peu dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher des promotions dans des secteurs qui ne correspondaient pas directement \u00e0 son domaine de sp\u00e9cialisation, et ce, m\u00eame si, dans le cas des employ\u00e9s EX, les aptitudes en gestion sup\u00e9rieure sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement plus importantes que les connaissances sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es dans une discipline scientifique particuli\u00e8re. J'ai conclu qu'il n'y avait pas eu de discrimination durant cette p\u00e9riode de temps. La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que cette tendance persiste encore aujourd'hui. Je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 que le plaignant a pris toutes les mesures raisonnables pour minimiser ses dommages.\n[40] Compte tenu de ces lacunes en ce qui touche l'obligation du Dr Chopra d'att\u00e9nuer les dommages, je conclus que le droit du plaignant \u00e0 un d\u00e9dommagement devrait se limiter \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode de six ans \u00e0 compter de la date o\u00f9 la CFP a confirm\u00e9 la nomination de Mme Franklin au poste, soit le 21 avril 1992.\n[41] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, le plaignant a droit \u00e0 une somme \u00e9quivalant au tiers (1\/3) de ses pertes au titre du salaire et des avantages au niveau EX-2 pendant une p\u00e9riode de six ans allant du 21 avril 1992 au 20 avril 1998.\nC. Indemnisation des pertes salariales au-del\u00e0 du niveau EX-2 [42] Le Dr Chopra a demand\u00e9 d'\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 des pertes salariales se rattachant aux promotions qu'il aurait re\u00e7ues apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu le poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e de directeur du BMHP en 1992. Selon lui, il aurait atteint le niveau EX-3 vers 1995, le niveau EX-4 avant 1998 et le niveau EX-5 avant 2001.\n[43] \u00c0 l'appui de sa demande, le Dr Chopra a invoqu\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de M. John Samuel, D.Ph, qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'expert en discrimination syst\u00e9mique et cheminement de carri\u00e8re dans la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. M. Samuel a d\u00e9crit les efforts qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s depuis le d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 90 afin de promouvoir la mobilit\u00e9 vers le haut des membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles au sein de la fonction publique, par suite desquels ces derniers ont peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 avantag\u00e9s dans le processus d'avancement. De l'avis de M. Samuel, si le Dr Chopra avait pu acc\u00e9der initialement \u00e0 un poste de niveau EX, il aurait profit\u00e9 du fruit de ces efforts, ajoutant qu'il serait [TRADUCTION] fort probablement parvenu \u00e0 gravir l'\u00e9chelle EX, compte tenu [TRADUCTION] de ses comp\u00e9tences, de sa d\u00e9termination et de sa t\u00e9nacit\u00e9 .\n[44] J'ai de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter les conclusions de M. Samuel. D'abord, la fa\u00e7on dont il est parvenu \u00e0 sa conclusion quant aux comp\u00e9tences, \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination et \u00e0 la t\u00e9nacit\u00e9 du Dr Chopra n'est pas claire. Il semble que, essentiellement, M. Samuel ait examin\u00e9 le curriculum vitae du Dr Chopra et ait conclu qu'il \u00e9tait une personne hautement motiv\u00e9e dont les comp\u00e9tences \u00e9taient [TRADUCTION] nettement sup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 celles qui sont requises pour le genre de postes qu'il a pu occuper dans la fonction publique . Selon M. Samuel, le cheminement de carri\u00e8re d'autres employ\u00e9s de niveau EX indique que le plaignant aurait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 se hisser aux paliers de gestion les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s. Cependant, l'analyse que fait M. Samuel du d\u00e9roulement de la carri\u00e8re des employ\u00e9s qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 au m\u00eame niveau (EX-2) que le Dr Chopra en 1992 \u00e9tait incompl\u00e8te et non concluante. Son analyse n'a port\u00e9 que sur quelques personnes. En outre, le contre-interrogatoire a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que plusieurs d'entre elles n'\u00e9taient pas de bons sujets de comparaison.\n[45] M. Samuel a nomm\u00e9 une poign\u00e9e de membres faisant partie de groupes des minorit\u00e9s visibles qui ont occup\u00e9 des postes dans la haute fonction publique au cours de la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie. Cependant, peu d'entre eux, voire aucun, n'auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9gaux (EX-2) du Dr Chopra en 1992. Aucune comparaison n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite entre la progression professionnelle des membres faisant partie des groupes des minorit\u00e9s visibles et celle des autres employ\u00e9s, afin d'appuyer la pr\u00e9tention voulant que le Dr Chopra aurait tir\u00e9 profit de la politique du gouvernement consistant \u00e0 favoriser l'avancement des membres de groupes minoritaires et qu'il aurait ainsi pu acc\u00e9der \u00e0 un poste de sous-ministre adjoint en 1998, comme le pr\u00e9tend M. Samuel. Par ailleurs, j'ai des doutes au sujet de l'objectivit\u00e9 de l'expert. Il a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 des affinit\u00e9s avec le plaignant et sa cause et il a fait preuve d'une attitude hostile envers l'intim\u00e9. Ainsi, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas confiance m\u00eame dans les donn\u00e9es les plus \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires sur l'emploi et la progression professionnelle produites par Sant\u00e9 Canada, car \u00e0 son avis [TRADUCTION] l'\u00e9valuation culturelle [de Sant\u00e9 Canada] n'est pas favorable et le minist\u00e8re [TRADUCTION] n'est pas tr\u00e8s bien dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des personnes de certaines origines .\n[46] Toutefois, abstraction faite de l'objectivit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de l'expert, je ne suis simplement pas convaincu qu'un refus de promouvoir le Dr Chopra \u00e0 un poste de niveau EX-3 ou sup\u00e9rieur constituait une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse. N'oublions pas que la conduite discriminatoire de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait li\u00e9e au fait que celui-ci n'a pas nomm\u00e9 le Dr Chopra au poste de directeur int\u00e9rimaire de la BMHP en 1990. La conclusion selon laquelle il aurait exist\u00e9 m\u00eame une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse que le Dr Chopra acc\u00e8de aux \u00e9chelons sup\u00e9rieurs de la haute fonction publique simplement parce qu'il aurait occup\u00e9 \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire le poste de directeur pendant un peu plus de cinq mois, est beaucoup trop lointaine et hypoth\u00e9tique, particuli\u00e8rement lorsqu'on tient compte \u00e9galement des pr\u00e9occupations en mati\u00e8re d'att\u00e9nuation des pertes dont nous avons fait \u00e9tat ci-haut, ainsi que de la nature particuli\u00e8re de chaque poste EX. Nul ne peut pr\u00e9sumer qu'il obtiendra automatiquement de l'avancement au sein de la hi\u00e9rarchie des EX dans le cours normal de sa carri\u00e8re. La demande du plaignant relative \u00e0 l'indemnisation de ses pertes salariales au-del\u00e0 du niveau EX-2 est rejet\u00e9e.\nD. Indemnisation des pertes salariales - autre poste de niveau EX [47] J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu qu'il existait un niveau important d'incertitude en ce qui touche la probabilit\u00e9 que le plaignant ait pu r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 obtenir le poste de directeur de la BMHP \u00e0 la suite du concours tenu en 1992. Cependant, le plaignant a fait valoir que m\u00eame s'il avait \u00e9chou\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, l'exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente en gestion qu'il aurait acquise en occupant ce poste \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire lui aurait permis d'\u00eatre nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre poste de niveau EX ult\u00e9rieurement dans sa carri\u00e8re.\n[48] Je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 que les choses se seraient d\u00e9roul\u00e9es ainsi. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, le processus de nomination aux \u00e9chelons sup\u00e9rieurs diff\u00e8re de celui qui existe aux \u00e9chelons inf\u00e9rieurs. Les qualit\u00e9s requises pour chaque poste sont particuli\u00e8res et la concurrence pour acc\u00e9der \u00e0 des postes de niveau EX semble tr\u00e8s f\u00e9roce. M. Samuel a reconnu lors de son t\u00e9moignage, par exemple, que des milliers de personnes ont postul\u00e9 les centaines de postes de niveau EX qu'il a analys\u00e9s dans le cadre de ses travaux de recherche ant\u00e9rieurs.\n[49] Le simple fait que le Dr Chopra aurait acquis une exp\u00e9rience en gestion de cinq \u00e0 six mois, n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire, ne cr\u00e9e pas pour autant une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse qu'il soit nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste EX plus tard dans sa carri\u00e8re. Il y a lieu d'\u00e9tablir une nette distinction par rapport \u00e0 ma conclusion concernant le concours tenu en 1992 en vue de doter le poste EX-2 de directeur du BMHP. Dans ce cas-l\u00e0, l'exp\u00e9rience qu'il aurait acquise en occupant \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire ce poste particulier m'a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure qu'il existait une possibilit\u00e9 simple mais s\u00e9rieuse qu'il soit le candidat heureux. Je ne puis tirer la m\u00eame conclusion en ce qui touche n'importe quel autre poste EX qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dot\u00e9 au cours des douze derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, d'autant plus qu'aucun autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit pour d\u00e9montrer que le Dr Chopra aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus comp\u00e9tent pour occuper un poste de niveau EX particulier s'il avait acquis une exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente en gestion en remplissant \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire les fonctions de directeur du BMHP. En fait, le plaignant a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir une exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente en gestion cinq ann\u00e9es plus tard, en 1997, lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 chef int\u00e9rimaire d'une division. N\u00e9anmoins, cela ne lui a pas pour autant permis d'\u00eatre nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste de niveau EX pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e au cours des ann\u00e9es qui ont suivi.\n[50] Pour ces motifs, je ne suis pas convaincu que le simple fait d'occuper \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire le titre de directeur du BMHP pendant un peu plus de cinq mois en 1990-1991 aurait cr\u00e9\u00e9 une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse que le plaignant puisse \u00eatre nomm\u00e9 ult\u00e9rieurement, pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, \u00e0 un autre poste de niveau EX.\nE. Demande visant \u00e0 nommer sans tarder le Dr Chopra \u00e0 un poste de niveau EX [51] Outre sa demande d'indemnisation de ses pertes salariales, le plaignant prie le Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance visant \u00e0 le nommer sans tarder \u00e0 un poste de niveau EX. Bien que j'aie conclu que, n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire, il existait une possibilit\u00e9 simple mais s\u00e9rieuse qu'il obtienne le poste de directeur du BMHP \u00e0 l'issue du concours tenu en 1992, j'ai \u00e9galement r\u00e9duit le montant du d\u00e9dommagement afin de tenir compte, d'une part, du niveau d'incertitude \u00e9lev\u00e9 qui existait quant \u00e0 ses chances d'obtenir le poste et, d'autre part, des lacunes en ce qui touche \u00e0 son obligation d'att\u00e9nuer ses pertes, comme le veut le crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Morgan. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis convaincu qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement d\u00e9dommag\u00e9 des pertes qu'il a subies du fait qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 promu. Dans les circonstances, il n'y a pas lieu d'ordonner que le Dr Chopra soit maintenant nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste de niveau EX.\nF. Majoration au titre de l'imp\u00f4t \u00e0 payer [52] Le versement au Dr Chopra d'une somme forfaitaire pour compenser les pertes salariales qu'il a subies pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es risque d'entra\u00eener une augmentation soudaine de son fardeau fiscal. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de verser au Dr Chopra une somme suppl\u00e9mentaire suffisante pour compenser tout l'imp\u00f4t suppl\u00e9mentaire qu'il pourrait avoir \u00e0 payer en raison de l'indemnit\u00e9.\nG. Dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires [53] En l'esp\u00e8ce, l'acte discriminatoire est survenu en 1990, soit avant l'adoption des modifications apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la Loi en 1998 par suite de l'adoption du projet de loi S-5. Aux termes de l'ancienne version de la Loi (paragraphe 53(3)), une victime pouvait obtenir une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 5 000 $ \u00e0 titre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires. La nouvelle version de la Loi permet d'accorder une indemnit\u00e9 pouvant atteindre 20 000 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral (al. 53(2)e)) et une somme additionnelle pouvant atteindre 20 000 $ si le Tribunal en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l'acte reproch\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 (par. 53(3)).\n[54] Le Dr Chopra pr\u00e9tend avoir droit \u00e0 une indemnisation aux termes des nouvelles dispositions de la Loi. Dans Nkwazi (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e), le Tribunal a affirm\u00e9 (par. 257 \u00e0 270) que ces dispositions n'ont pas d'effet r\u00e9troactif et ne sauraient, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es dans des cas o\u00f9 la conduite discriminatoire est survenue avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur des modifications \u00e0 la Loi. L'avocat du plaignant a respectueusement fait valoir que cette interpr\u00e9tation est erron\u00e9e. J'ai soigneusement examin\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision Nkwazi et les textes de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence cit\u00e9s par l'avocat du plaignant, mais ses arguments ne m'ont pas convaincu. Je souscris plut\u00f4t aux conclusions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es par le Tribunal dans Nkwazi. La demande de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires du Dr Chopra demeure donc assujettie \u00e0 l'ancienne version de la Loi.\n[55] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr Chopra a expliqu\u00e9 que son incapacit\u00e9 d'acc\u00e9der \u00e0 un poste de niveau EX avait entra\u00een\u00e9 des r\u00e9percussions psychologiques et avait \u00e9t\u00e9 une source d'embarras. Il a parl\u00e9 de la g\u00eane qu'il ressentait au travail et du fait que des coll\u00e8gues le fuyaient, en raison principalement de la publicit\u00e9 entourant son cas. Cependant, je suis conscient du fait qu'une partie de cette publicit\u00e9 est attribuable \u00e0 des questions qui ne sont pas li\u00e9es \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[56] En ce qui touche l'indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 ce chapitre, il ne faut pas oublier que la somme maximale (5 000 $) ne doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9e que dans le pire des cas (Premakumar c. Air Canada (2002), C.H.R.R. D\/63, au par. 107 (TCDP); Desormeaux c. Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d'Ottawa-Carleton 2003 TCDP 2 au par. 128). Au regard de l'ensemble des circonstances entourant cette affaire, j'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de verser au plaignant une somme de 3 500 $ \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale aux termes du par. 53(3) de l'ancienne version de la Loi.\nH. Int\u00e9r\u00eats [57] Le plaignant et la Commission ont soutenu que le calcul des int\u00e9r\u00eats devrait \u00eatre fond\u00e9 sur les taux \u00e9tablis conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi sur les tribunaux judiciaires de l'Ontario, L.R.O. 1990, ch. C-43, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l'acte discriminatoire a eu lieu en Ontario, province o\u00f9 r\u00e9side d'ailleurs le Dr Chopra. Selon eux, les taux applicables aux obligations d'\u00e9pargne du Canada (OEC) sont conservateurs et ne permettraient pas d'indemniser de fa\u00e7on satisfaisante le plaignant de ses pertes. Je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 de cela. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour d\u00e9montrer en quoi les taux applicables aux OEC ou d'autres taux fix\u00e9s par la Banque du Canada ne permettraient pas de d\u00e9dommager enti\u00e8rement le plaignant des pertes qu'il a subies. Est-ce que, par exemple, ces taux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieurs au taux d'inflation au cours de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e? On a fait valoir que cette proc\u00e9dure avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ponctu\u00e9e de longs retards et qu'aucun de ces retards n'\u00e9tait imputable au plaignant. C'est peut-\u00eatre le cas, mais l'intim\u00e9 n'est pas lui non plus responsable de cette situation, \u00e0 mon avis. Les d\u00e9lais s'expliquent en grande partie par le fait que cette affaire a suivi un parcours sinueux - du Tribunal \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale puis \u00e0 nouveau au Tribunal.\n[58] Le Tribunal a adopt\u00e9 dans ses r\u00e9centes d\u00e9cisions le taux d'escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle), et je ne vois aucune raison de ne pas faire de m\u00eame en l'esp\u00e8ce (voir Bushey c. Sharma 2003 TCDP 21 au par. 147; Groupe d'aide et d'information sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au travail de la province de Qu\u00e9bec Inc. c. Barbe 2003 TCDP 24, au par. 77; Boudreault c. Great Circle Marine Services Inc. 2004 TCDP 21, au par. 117).\n[59] Je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 non plus que le plaignant a droit \u00e0 des int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s, ainsi qu'il le voudrait. Le versement d'int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s est justifi\u00e9 si, et seulement si, compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des circonstances entourant l'affaire, cette mesure s'impose pour compenser les pertes subies (voir Morgan (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e), \u00e0 la page 420). Abstraction faite de la longue p\u00e9riode qui s'est \u00e9coul\u00e9e entre la date de la plainte (16 septembre 1992) et celle de ma d\u00e9cision (13 ao\u00fbt 2001), je ne vois en l'esp\u00e8ce aucune circonstance qui distingue cette affaire des autres plaintes dont le Tribunal est habituellement saisi. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9 que personne n'est responsable des retards. Je ne suis pas convaincu que les retards ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 des circonstances sp\u00e9ciales faisant en sorte que le plaignant ne serait pas enti\u00e8rement indemnis\u00e9 par suite du versement d'int\u00e9r\u00eats simples.\n[60] Toutes les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es par la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision donnent donc droit \u00e0 des int\u00e9r\u00eats simples, qui doivent \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s sur une base annuelle en appliquant un taux \u00e9quivalant au taux d'escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle). Les int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des pertes salariales doivent \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s en fonction des dates o\u00f9 les salaires auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9s, conform\u00e9ment aux conclusions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[61] En ce qui concerne l'indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires, il faut remonter jusqu'au 20 octobre 1990 aux fins du calcul des int\u00e9r\u00eats. Cependant, le montant des int\u00e9r\u00eats ne doit en aucun cas d\u00e9passer le maximum permis de 5 000 $ (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. H\u00e9bert (1995), C.H.R.R. D\/375, au par. 23 (C.F., 1re inst.)).\nI. Affichage de la d\u00e9cision [62] Le plaignant a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal rende une ordonnance exigeant que cette d\u00e9cision soit affich\u00e9e dans les locaux de Sant\u00e9 Canada et diffus\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle du pays, par voie de courrier \u00e9lectronique, \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s du minist\u00e8re. Une telle mesure s'inscrirait, a-t-on soutenu, dans le cadre de l'objectif \u00e9ducatif de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne. L'intim\u00e9 s'est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 cette demande.\n[63] Je ne pense pas qu'une telle ordonnance soit n\u00e9cessaire. Je ne vois pas comment un envoi massif par courrier \u00e9lectronique et la publication \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle d'une d\u00e9cision \u00e9non\u00e7ant les d\u00e9tails du d\u00e9dommagement auquel l'intim\u00e9 a droit pourrait contribuer de fa\u00e7on importante \u00e0 promouvoir les droits de la personne. Il ne faut pas perdre de vue qu'il s'agit en l'occurrence d'un cas de discrimination individuelle. Je n'ai fait aucun constat de discrimination syst\u00e9mique. En outre, cette affaire a fait l'objet d'une vaste couverture dans les m\u00e9dias du pays au moment o\u00f9 ma d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue publique, et le plaignant n'a pas demand\u00e9 d'affichage avant la diffusion. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, cette d\u00e9cision, \u00e0 l'instar de toutes les d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures, est et demeurera accessible au public par le biais d'Internet. L'adresse du site Web du Tribunal est www.chrt-tcdp.gc.ca.\nIV. Maintien de la comp\u00e9tence [64] Je conserve ma comp\u00e9tence en l'esp\u00e8ce pour le cas o\u00f9 les parties ne seraient pas en mesure de s'entendre sur l'\u00e9valuation quantitative ou l'application d'une des mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es par la pr\u00e9sente.\nAthanasios D.

ARGUMENTS DE L'INTIM\u00c9E (FAC)\nVI. D\u00c9CISION\nI. FAITS MAT\u00c9RIELS [1] Cette plainte concerne dix plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne entre octobre 1992 et juillet 1994.\n[2] Tous les plaignants ont atteint l'\u00e2ge de la retraite prescrit avant le 3 septembre 1992. Cependant, aucun d'entre eux n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9 par les Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes avant le 3 septembre 1992.\n[3] Avant le 3 septembre 1992, chacun des plaignants a \u00e9t\u00e9 contraint de prendre un cong\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement pay\u00e9, constitu\u00e9 de diff\u00e9rentes formes de cong\u00e9s, notamment de cong\u00e9s accumul\u00e9s (c.-\u00e0-d., cong\u00e9s annuels accumul\u00e9s), de cong\u00e9s annuels (c.-\u00e0-d., cong\u00e9s annuels pour l'ann\u00e9e de lib\u00e9ration), de cong\u00e9s sp\u00e9ciaux et de cong\u00e9s de r\u00e9adaptation conform\u00e9ment aux Ordonnances et r\u00e8glements royaux applicables aux Forces canadiennes (ORFC) et aux Ordonnances administratives des Forces canadiennes. L'ensemble de ces cong\u00e9s constitue ce qu'on appelle un cong\u00e9 de retraite \u00e0 l'article 16.18 des ORFC. En vertu des ORFC, les plaignants devaient prendre ce cong\u00e9 avant leur lib\u00e9ration.\n[4] Alors qu'ils \u00e9taient en cong\u00e9 avant leur lib\u00e9ration, les plaignants ont b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de leur plein solde et de tous les avantages sociaux et ont accumul\u00e9 du temps ouvrant pleinement droit \u00e0 pension. Durant leur cong\u00e9, ils n'avaient pas \u00e0 faire du service actif; cependant, ils \u00e9taient susceptibles d'\u00eatre rappel\u00e9s au travail pour faire du service actif \u00e0 n'importe quel moment, et ce, jusqu'\u00e0 leur lib\u00e9ration par les FAC.\n[5] Tous les plaignants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9s par les FAC apr\u00e8s le 3 septembre 1992.\nII. CONTEXTE [6] Le 14 ao\u00fbt 1992, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a rendu sa d\u00e9cision dans Martin et autres c. Canada (minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale) (1992), 17 C.H.R.R. D\/435. Le Tribunal a soutenu que les articles 15.17 et 15.31 des Ordonnances et r\u00e8glements royaux applicables aux Forces canadiennes n'\u00e9taient pas des r\u00e8glements pris relativement \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)b) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et ne pouvaient, par cons\u00e9quent, justifier la pratique discriminatoire de la mise \u00e0 la retraite obligatoire.\n[7] Le 3 septembre 1992, le gouverneur en conseil a modifi\u00e9 les articles 15.17 et 15.31 des ORFC afin de les harmoniser avec l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)b) de la LCDP, rendant ainsi les dispositions relatives \u00e0 la retraite obligatoire applicables \u00e0 compter de ce jour-l\u00e0.\n[8] Par la suite, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a confirm\u00e9 dans Carter c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, [2000] D.C.D.P. no 1 no D.T. 2\/00, confirm\u00e9e, [2001] A.C.F. no 1922 (C.F., 1re inst.); [2003] A.C.F. no 212 (C.A.F.), que la modification apport\u00e9e aux articles 15.17 et 15.31 des ORFC le 3 septembre 1992 avaient mis fin \u00e0 la pratique discriminatoire dont M. Carter avait fait l'objet par suite de sa lib\u00e9ration le 27 mai 1992 en raison du fait qu'il avait atteint l'\u00e2ge obligatoire de la retraite. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a conclu que les Forces canadiennes n'avaient pas \u00e0 indemniser M. Carter des pertes salariales subies apr\u00e8s le 3 septembre 1992.\nIII. LA QUESTION \u00c0 TRANCHER [9] En l'esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer si l'exigence voulant que les plaignants prennent leur cong\u00e9 de retraite avant le 3 septembre 1992 constituait une pratique discriminatoire aux termes des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP.\nIV. ARGUMENTS DE LA COMMISSION [10] La Commission a fait valoir que les plaignants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 contraints de prendre un cong\u00e9 de retraite en vertu de la politique des FAC concernant la retraite, alors que cette politique \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme discriminatoire.\n[11] Selon la Commission, les plaignants ont en fait \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9s de quitter les FAC en raison de leur \u00e2ge comparativement aux autres militaires. Au dire de la Commission, cette situation a eu pour effet de d\u00e9favoriser les plaignants en cours d'emploi, ce qui allait \u00e0 l'encontre du paragraphe 7b) de la LCDP, et r\u00e9sultait d'une politique privant les plaignants de possibilit\u00e9s d'emploi, en violation de l'article 10 de la LCDP.\n[12] En outre, la Commission a soutenu que les plaignants, par suite de la pratique discriminatoire, avaient un droit acquis en mati\u00e8re d'indemnisation et que la modification apport\u00e9e aux ORFC n'avait eu aucune incidence sur ce droit. Les modifications aux ORFC ne sont pas r\u00e9troactives. Ces modifications sont susceptibles d'avoir des r\u00e9percussions sur l'indemnisation, mais non sur la responsabilit\u00e9. La Commission a cit\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision Carter \u00e0 l'appui de cette pr\u00e9tention.\nV. ARGUMENTS DE L'INTIM\u00c9E (FAC) [13] L'argumentation des FAC s'articule autour des d\u00e9cisions rendues par le Tribunal et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Carter. Le caporal-chef Carter a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission une plainte contre les FAC le 25 ao\u00fbt 1993, all\u00e9guant avoir fait l'objet d'une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge en contravention de l'article 7 de la LCDP. Lorsque les FAC l'ont lib\u00e9r\u00e9 (27 mai 1992), il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de retraite depuis juin 1991. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, les dispositions de l'article 15.31 des ORFC concernant la retraite obligatoire n'\u00e9taient pas ex\u00e9cutoires en raison de la d\u00e9cision Martin.\n[14] Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9 que M. Carter, en raison de la pratique discriminatoire, avait droit \u00e0 une indemnisation. Le litige a port\u00e9 sur le montant de l'indemnit\u00e9. Selon la Commission, la dur\u00e9e de la p\u00e9riode indemnisable devait \u00eatre de 24 mois \u00e0 compter de la date de sa lib\u00e9ration. Les FAC, pour leur part, \u00e9taient d'avis que la p\u00e9riode indemnisable devait d\u00e9buter \u00e0 la date de sa lib\u00e9ration, soit le 27 mai 1992, et se terminer \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 la politique de retraite obligatoire des FAC a \u00e9t\u00e9 valid\u00e9e, soit le 3 septembre 1992.\n[15] Apr\u00e8s qu'on eut prouv\u00e9 que M. Carter avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'une pratique discriminatoire, le Tribunal a conclu qu'il avait un droit acquis en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et que la p\u00e9riode indemnisable appropri\u00e9e devrait aller du 27 mai 1992 au 3 septembre 1992.\n[16] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans le cadre d'un contr\u00f4le judiciaire, a souscrit \u00e0 la conclusion du Tribunal voulant que M. Carter ait un droit acquis en mati\u00e8re d'indemnisation mais non relativement au montant de l'indemnit\u00e9. En ce qui concerne la p\u00e9riode indemnisable, la Cour a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il doit y avoir un lien causal entre l'acte discriminatoire et le montant de l'indemnisation. Dans le cas de M. Carter, le lien causal a \u00e9t\u00e9 rompu le 3 septembre 1992, par suite de la modification apport\u00e9e aux ORFC, qui a permis aux FAC de lib\u00e9rer M. Carter. C'est \u00e0 cette date que la pratique discriminatoire a pris fin.\n[17] Les FAC soutiennent que la Commission n'a pas \u00e9tabli l'existence d'une preuve prima facie de la violation des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP, car elle n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les plaignants avaient subi des cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives ou avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9s de certaines possibilit\u00e9s.\n[18] Les FAC ont indiqu\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait en preuve tant au Tribunal qu'\u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale que M. Carter avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en cong\u00e9 de retraite entre juin 1991 et le 27 mai 1992. Si le fait de mettre quelqu'un en cong\u00e9 de retraite constituait une pratique discriminatoire, il \u00e9tait loisible \u00e0 la Commission de pr\u00e9tendre que la p\u00e9riode indemnisable dans le cas de M. Carter aurait d\u00fb d\u00e9buter en juin 1991, et non le 27 mai 1992. Toutefois, la Commission n'a pas avanc\u00e9 cet argument. Elle a plut\u00f4t adopt\u00e9 la position voulant que le droit de M. Carter en mati\u00e8re d'indemnisation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cristallis\u00e9 le 27 mai 1992, soit le jour de sa lib\u00e9ration discriminatoire. Le Tribunal et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ont tous deux clairement affirm\u00e9 dans leur d\u00e9cision respective que la lib\u00e9ration de M. Carter constituait une pratique discriminatoire. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon les FAC, la d\u00e9cision Carter \u00e9taye la th\u00e8se selon laquelle l'exigence de prendre un cong\u00e9 de retraite n'est pas une pratique discriminatoire.\n[19] Ce l'est d'autant moins, selon les FAC, que le fait de mettre un membre en cong\u00e9 de retraite n'a pas de cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives puisqu'il b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie, pendant un tel cong\u00e9, de tout ce \u00e0 quoi il aurait droit s'il \u00e9tait en service actif.\n[20] Les FAC ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un autre argument qui porte lui aussi sur la lib\u00e9ration. Les ORFC exigent que le cong\u00e9 de retraite soit pris avant la lib\u00e9ration. Tel qu'indiqu\u00e9 dans Carter, M. Carter aurait pu \u00eatre lib\u00e9r\u00e9 par les FAC \u00e0 compter du 3 septembre 1992, date o\u00f9 la politique de retraite obligatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 valid\u00e9e. Tous les autres plaignants en l'esp\u00e8ce ont \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le 3 septembre 1992. On peut pr\u00e9sumer que si les plaignants voulaient prendre leur cong\u00e9 de retraite, ils l'auraient fait avant leur lib\u00e9ration. C'est ce qu'ils ont fait. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n'y a pas eu de pratique discriminatoire.\nVI. D\u00c9CISION [21] Tant les arguments de la Commission que ceux des FAC sont attrayants. Toutefois, j'ai conclu que la politique des FAC qui exigeait que les plaignants prennent leur cong\u00e9 de retraite avant le 3 septembre 1992 constituait un acte discriminatoire allant \u00e0 l'encontre du paragraphe 7b) et du paragraphe 10 de la LCDP. Tel qu'indiqu\u00e9 ci-haut, les plaignants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9s du service actif et mis \u00e0 la retraite tout en continuant de figurer sur la liste de service des FAC. Ils \u00e9taient des soldats [TRADUCTION] cantonn\u00e9s \u00e0 la maison . Un grand nombre des plaignants \u00e9taient d\u00e9sireux de demeurer en service actif, ainsi qu'en t\u00e9moigne leur demande de prolongation de leur p\u00e9riode de service. Certaines demandes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9es, d'autres non.\n[22] \u00c0 mon avis, il n'est pas exact de dire que les plaignants n'ont pas subi de cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives parce qu'ils ont eu droit aux m\u00eames avantages que ceux dont ils auraient b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 s'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 en service actif. Les militaires qui sont en service actif, contrairement \u00e0 ceux qui sont en cong\u00e9 de retraite, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d'autres avantages que la solde et les droits \u00e0 pension. Parmi ces autres avantages figurent les promotions et les mutations. Bien s\u00fbr, les FAC offrent des cours de formation professionnelle, de l'avancement pour ses membres, des cours de formation en leadership, autant d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments susceptibles d'am\u00e9liorer les perspectives de carri\u00e8re d'un militaire.\n[23] Un autre effet n\u00e9gatif a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9 avec angoisse par le juge en chef Dickson dans le Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alb.) [1987] 1 R.C.S. 313 (\u00e0 la page 368) :\nLe travail est l'un des aspects les plus fondamentaux de la vie d'une personne, un moyen de subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins financiers et, ce qui est tout aussi important, de jouer un r\u00f4le utile dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. L'emploi est une composante essentielle du sens de l'identit\u00e9 d'une personne, de sa valorisation et de son bien-\u00eatre sur le plan \u00e9motionnel.\n[24] En outre, je n'accepte pas la pr\u00e9tention des FAC voulant que le cong\u00e9 de retraite ne soit pas une pratique discriminatoire ait \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e dans Carter. S'il \u00e9tait loisible \u00e0 la Commission de faire valoir cet argument dans Carter, son omission de le faire n'est pas d\u00e9terminante en l'esp\u00e8ce. On ne peut pas non plus affirmer que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, en indiquant que la pratique discriminatoire r\u00e9sidait dans la lib\u00e9ration du 27 mai 1992 de M. Carter, ait statu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on concluante que le cong\u00e9 de retraite de M. Carter ne pouvait \u00eatre une pratique discriminatoire. Il faut se rappeler que, dans Carter, le litige portait non pas sur la responsabilit\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 la politique de retraite des FAC mais strictement sur la question de l'indemnisation. Ni le Tribunal ni la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 se prononcer sur la question \u00e0 savoir si la p\u00e9riode indemnisable d\u00e9butait \u00e0 la date du cong\u00e9 de retraite plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 la date de la lib\u00e9ration. \u00c0 mon avis, la question \u00e0 savoir si le fait d'avoir ou non \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en cong\u00e9 de retraite avant le 3 septembre 1992 constituait une pratique discriminatoire est demeur\u00e9e enti\u00e8re apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision Carter.\n[25] Enfin, les FAC ont all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la politique de lib\u00e9ration obligatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 immunis\u00e9e par la modification apport\u00e9e aux ORFC le 3 septembre 1992. Comme le cong\u00e9 de retraite est un attribut accessoire de la politique en question, il est lui aussi immunis\u00e9.\n[26] Accepter cet argument impliquerait de donner un effet r\u00e9troactif \u00e0 la modification apport\u00e9e aux ORFC. Ce qui \u00e9tait discriminatoire avant la modification ne le serait plus en raison de la modification. La modification apport\u00e9e aux paragraphes 15.17 et 15.31 des ORFC ne pr\u00e9voyait pas express\u00e9ment que celle-ci puisse s'appliquer r\u00e9troactivement, et les FAC n'ont pas pr\u00e9tendu non plus qu'elle avait un effet r\u00e9troactif.\n[27] Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-haut, j'ai conclu que la politique des FAC exigeant que les plaignants prennent un cong\u00e9 de retraite avant le 3 septembre 1992 constituait une pratique discriminatoire allant \u00e0 l'encontre du paragraphe 7b) et de l'article 10 de la LCDP. Par cons\u00e9quent, les plaignants ont droit \u00e0 une indemnisation en raison de la pratique discriminatoire. Pour ce qui est du montant de l'indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 verser \u00e9ventuellement, nous aborderons la question ult\u00e9rieurement.\nJ.

MAINTIEN DE LA COMP\u00c9TENCE\n[1] La plaignante all\u00e8gue que l'intim\u00e9 a exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit une discrimination dans l'emploi en la harcelant sexuellement, allant ainsi \u00e0 l'encontre de l'art. 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Lors de l'audience, ni la plaignante ou l'intim\u00e9 n'\u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par des avocats. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a choisi de ne pas compara\u00eetre \u00e0 l'audience.\nI. FAITS [2] La plaignante et l'intim\u00e9 travaillaient comme chauffeurs d'autobus chez Penetang Midland Coach Lines (PMCL), dont le si\u00e8ge est \u00e0 Toronto. Ils \u00e9taient devenus de bons camarades de travail, ayant eu l'occasion de travailler ensemble lors de plusieurs voyages nolis\u00e9s d'une journ\u00e9e. En ao\u00fbt 1999, PMCL a envoy\u00e9 les deux chauffeurs \u00e0 la Base des Forces canadiennes de Petawawa, en Ontario. C'\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois qu'ils travaillaient ensemble en dehors de la ville pendant plus d'une journ\u00e9e. La p\u00e9riode de nolisement devait, semble-t-il, durer environ une semaine. Il s'agissait d'offrir un service de navette au personnel des Forces canadiennes qui se rendaient \u00e0 des exercices militaires et en revenaient. Ils travaillaient de dix \u00e0 quinze heures par jour.\n[3] \u00c0 Petawawa, ils \u00e9taient descendus \u00e0 un h\u00f4tel de l'endroit. Ils avaient des chambres s\u00e9par\u00e9es, dont les portes \u00e9taient l'une en face de l'autre. La plaignante all\u00e8gue qu'un soir, deux ou trois jours apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de l'affectation, elle est rentr\u00e9e \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel vers 20 h, apr\u00e8s son poste de travail. Elle s'est chang\u00e9e, enfilant un sweat-shirt et un short. Vers 21 h, l'intim\u00e9 lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de sa chambre pour lui demander si elle voulait faire quelque chose dans la soir\u00e9e. Ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de regarder la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision tous les deux dans sa chambre \u00e0 elle, o\u00f9 il est venu la rejoindre quelques minutes plus tard.\n[4] Selon la plaignante, sa chambre avait deux lits doubles. Elle s'est assise dans un des lits et lui dans l'autre pour regarder une \u00e9mission. \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9, elle s'est endormie. Elle s'est r\u00e9veill\u00e9e vers 3 h du matin et a constat\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait couch\u00e9 dans son lit \u00e0 ses c\u00f4t\u00e9s. Il \u00e9tait nu et il lui faisait des attouchements avec sa main en-dessous de la taille dans sa zone priv\u00e9e . Elle s'est aussit\u00f4t redress\u00e9e et lui a dit de cesser. Il riait en la regardant, mais elle a insist\u00e9 pour qu'il quitte. Il s'est lev\u00e9, a mis ses v\u00eatements et a quitt\u00e9 la chambre en continuant de rire.\n[5] La plaignante est demeur\u00e9e dans sa chambre le reste de la nuit, incapable de dormir. Vers 3 h 30 du matin, elle a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 un ami pour lui raconter ce qui s'\u00e9tait produit. Il lui a conseill\u00e9 d'appeler la police, mais elle a dit qu'elle ne le ferait pas avant d'avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 son r\u00e9partiteur, Gord Tuttle.\n[6] Dans la matin\u00e9e, elle a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Tuttle et lui a racont\u00e9 ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9. M. Tuttle a propos\u00e9 de d\u00e9p\u00eacher sur place un autre chauffeur pour la remplacer mais elle lui a dit que cela ne valait pas la peine puisque la p\u00e9riode de nolisement tirait \u00e0 sa fin. Elle a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Tuttle l'assurance qu'elle s'occuperait elle-m\u00eame du probl\u00e8me entre-temps, jusqu'\u00e0 son retour \u00e0 Toronto. En outre, elle lui a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas appeler la police, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il n'y aurait plus personne pour offrir le service puisque ni l'intim\u00e9 ni elle ne seraient disponibles pour travailler. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de donner la priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 son travail par rapport \u00e0 l'autre question. La plaignante a expliqu\u00e9 lors de l'audience qu'elle \u00e9tait r\u00e9ticente \u00e0 appeler les autorit\u00e9s pour une autre raison : elle avait eu la malchance dans sa jeunesse d'\u00eatre victime d'un crime grave et le proc\u00e8s criminel qui avait suivi avait laiss\u00e9 des s\u00e9quelles \u00e9motives. Elle ne voulait pas revivre pareille exp\u00e9rience.\n[7] Plus tard en matin\u00e9e, alors qu'elle marchait vers son autobus \u00e0 la base militaire, elle s'est retrouv\u00e9e pr\u00e8s de l'intim\u00e9. Il s'est approch\u00e9 d'elle et lui a demand\u00e9 si elle \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] le genre de fille qui d\u00e9clarerait cela - \u00e0 son employeur ou aux autorit\u00e9s, pr\u00e9sume-t-on. Elle lui a simplement dit [TRADUCTION] Fiche-moi la paix en se dirigeant vers son autobus. Elle a termin\u00e9 son affectation, \u00e0 laquelle il ne restait que quelques jours, puis a ramen\u00e9 son autobus \u00e0 Toronto seule le dernier jour, soit le dimanche 29 ao\u00fbt 1999.\n[8] L'intim\u00e9 a ni\u00e9 que l'incident all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par la plaignante se soit produit. Il a reconnu \u00eatre all\u00e9 \u00e0 sa chambre ce soir-l\u00e0, mais il a ni\u00e9 s'\u00eatre allong\u00e9 nu dans son lit ou avoir touch\u00e9 ses parties g\u00e9nitales. Il a pr\u00e9tendu que, pendant qu'ils regardaient la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, il lui avait mass\u00e9 le dos \u00e0 sa demande, pendant quelques minutes seulement. Ensuite, ils sont tous deux retourn\u00e9s devant le t\u00e9l\u00e9viseur. \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9, il a constat\u00e9 que la plaignante s'\u00e9tait endormie. Il a continu\u00e9 de regarder l'\u00e9mission durant un certain temps, puis s'est lev\u00e9, a mis ses chaussures et a quitt\u00e9 la chambre pendant que la plaignante dormait encore.\n[9] Le lundi 30 ao\u00fbt, \u00e0 son premier jour de travail apr\u00e8s son retour \u00e0 Toronto, la plaignante a signal\u00e9 l'incident \u00e0 son surveillant, Greg Pockneil, qui lui a demand\u00e9 de mettre sa plainte par \u00e9crit. Environ une semaine plus tard, M. Pockneil l'a convoqu\u00e9e \u00e0 une rencontre \u00e0 laquelle l'intim\u00e9 et le directeur de la succursale, Gord Moodie, \u00e9taient \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sents. Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les deux versions, MM. Pockneil et Moodie ont dit aux parties qu'ils allaient examiner la question et qu'ils leur reviendraient.\n[10] Au cours des semaines qui ont suivi, l'employeur a planifi\u00e9 les affectations de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que la plaignante et l'intim\u00e9 ne travaillent plus jamais ensemble. Toutefois, elle ne pouvait \u00e9viter de le croiser au travail, au d\u00e9but ou \u00e0 la fin de son poste. Elle a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu'une journ\u00e9e, en septembre 1999, l'intim\u00e9 avait gar\u00e9 son autobus en angle de telle fa\u00e7on qu'elle ne pouvait sortir sa voiture de son espace de stationnement. Elle lui a demand\u00e9 de d\u00e9placer l'autobus, ce qu'il a refus\u00e9 de faire. Elle s'est plainte \u00e0 un des gestionnaires qui, \u00e0 son tour, a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9placer son v\u00e9hicule. Elle a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 s'\u00e9tait conduit ainsi pour exercer contre elle des repr\u00e9sailles parce qu'elle s'\u00e9tait plainte \u00e0 l'employeur d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9e sexuellement lors de l'affectation \u00e0 Petawawa.\n[11] Selon la plaignante, l'employeur n'a jamais pris de mesures disciplinaires \u00e0 l'endroit de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite du pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 incident dans la chambre d'h\u00f4tel. Elle a dit qu'elle \u00e9tait mal \u00e0 l'aise, car elle continuait de le croiser dans la cour de l'entreprise. Elle \u00e9vitait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment de se rendre dans la salle de r\u00e9partition afin d'\u00e9viter tout contact avec lui. Des rumeurs ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 circuler au lieu de travail \u00e0 propos de l'incident. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 avait dit \u00e0 d'autres qu'elle \u00e9tait raciste (l'intim\u00e9 fait partie d'un groupe minoritaire visible). Elle avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises \u00e0 son employeur de cong\u00e9dier l'intim\u00e9. Cependant, apr\u00e8s plusieurs mois, rien ne s'\u00e9tait produit et, finalement, elle a remis sa d\u00e9mission le 17 d\u00e9cembre 1999. Dans sa lettre de d\u00e9mission, elle a indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle quittait en partie parce qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [TRADUCTION agress\u00e9e sexuellement par un coll\u00e8gue et qu'[TRADUCTION] on n'avait rien fait \u00e0 ce sujet .\nII. CADRE JURIDIQUE [12] Selon l'alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi, le fait de harceler un individu en mati\u00e8re d'emploi constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. Le sexe est l'un des motifs de distinction illicite (par. 3(1)). Le paragraphe 14(2) pr\u00e9cise que le harc\u00e8lement sexuel est r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre un harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite.\n[13] Le harc\u00e8lement sexuel en milieu de travail peut \u00eatre d\u00e9fini de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale comme une conduite de nature sexuelle non sollicit\u00e9e qui a un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le milieu de travail ou qui a des cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9judiciables en mati\u00e8re d'emploi pour la victime. Le harc\u00e8lement sexuel en milieu de travail est une atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 de la victime et \u00e0 son respect de soi \u00e0 la fois comme employ\u00e9 et comme \u00eatre humain. (Janzen c. Platy Enterprises Inc. [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1252).\nIII. ANALYSE [14] Je suis convaincu au regard de la preuve que l'incident dans la chambre d'h\u00f4tel a eu lieu, conform\u00e9ment aux all\u00e9gations de la plaignante. Son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l'audience \u00e9tait ferme et sinc\u00e8re. Elle se rappelait les circonstances en d\u00e9tail.\n[15] D'autre part, le souvenir que l'intim\u00e9 avait des \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e9tait fragmentaire. D'abord, il a affirm\u00e9 que la chambre d'h\u00f4tel de la plaignante \u00e9tait dot\u00e9e d'un seul lit et qu'ils avaient tous les deux regard\u00e9 la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision couch\u00e9s dans le lit. Plus tard au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, il a modifi\u00e9 sa version des faits, indiquant qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas s\u00fbr si la chambre avait un ou deux lits. Il ne se souvenait pas du moment o\u00f9 il a quitt\u00e9, affirmant s'\u00eatre lui aussi endormi. Il est bizarre qu'il ne se souvienne pas bien des d\u00e9tails puisque la pr\u00e9sentation de la plainte officielle de la plaignante contre lui et la r\u00e9union avec leurs surveillants ont eu lieu dans les quelques jours qui ont suivi leur retour \u00e0 Toronto. Ce n'est pas comme si l'accusation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e contre lui plusieurs mois apr\u00e8s coup. L'all\u00e9gation formul\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience selon laquelle il aurait mass\u00e9 le dos de la plaignante pendant quelques minutes \u00e0 sa demande semblait improvis\u00e9e et d\u00e9nu\u00e9e de toute cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9.\n[16] L'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9mis des doutes \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la d\u00e9cision de la plaignante de ne pas signaler l'incident \u00e0 la police, indiquant que cela \u00e9tait une indication que l'incident n'avait jamais eu lieu. \u00c0 l'appui de ses dires, l'intim\u00e9 a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant que la plaignante ne s'\u00e9tait pas g\u00ean\u00e9e pour informer les autorit\u00e9s d'autres actes dont elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime dans le pass\u00e9. Il a contre-interrog\u00e9 la plaignante au sujet de diverses questions personnelles et d\u00e9licates ayant trait \u00e0 des relations ant\u00e9rieures. La plaignante n'a \u00e9lev\u00e9 aucunement objection lorsque ces questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es et a volontiers admis qu'elle avait appel\u00e9 la police \u00e0 la suite d'une agression violente de la part d'un ex-ami de cur, laquelle avait n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 son hospitalisation. Elle a \u00e9galement r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu'elle avait communiqu\u00e9 avec la police pour se plaindre que son ex-mari \u00e9tait retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 la maison o\u00f9 elle vivait avec ses enfants et qu'il avait harcel\u00e9 ces derniers. J'accepte son interpr\u00e9tation voulant que ces incidents \u00e9taient plus graves que le pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 incident qui nous int\u00e9resse et justifiaient l'intervention de la police.\n[17] En outre, je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 que ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve conf\u00e8rent quelque cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 que ce soit \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9 voulant que l'incident dans la chambre d'h\u00f4tel ne se soit jamais produit. La plaignante \u00e9tait de toute \u00e9vidence une employ\u00e9e d\u00e9vou\u00e9e, ainsi qu'en t\u00e9moignent les \u00e9normes efforts qu'elle a faits une nuit \u00e0 Petawawa pour r\u00e9parer l'autobus de l'intim\u00e9, que celui-ci avait abandonn\u00e9 le long de la route. Lorsqu'elle lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 sa chambre d'h\u00f4tel pour lui demander de venir l'aider, il a refus\u00e9; elle a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 contrainte de demander \u00e0 des membres des Forces canadiennes de l'aider \u00e0 r\u00e9parer le v\u00e9hicule. Je n'ai aucune peine \u00e0 croire l'all\u00e9gation de la plaignante voulant qu'en d\u00e9cidant de ne pas appeler la police apr\u00e8s l'incident de la chambre d'h\u00f4tel, elle ait choisi de faire passer ses fonctions professionnelles avant ses affaires personnelles. De plus, j'accepte son t\u00e9moignage selon lequel elle craignait \u00e9galement d'avoir \u00e0 endurer les \u00e9preuves que doivent parfois traverser les victimes lors de proc\u00e8s criminels.\n[18] En tout \u00e9tat de cause, la plaignante a signal\u00e9 l'incident sans tarder \u00e0 ses surveillants qui, esp\u00e9rait-elle, prendraient les mesures qui s'imposaient. Elle s'est pli\u00e9e \u00e0 la demande de l'employeur de pr\u00e9senter sa plainte par \u00e9crit. Cependant, l'employeur n'a jamais \u00e0 son avis accord\u00e9 l'attention voulue \u00e0 ses pr\u00e9occupations. Elle a jug\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait d'autre choix que de quitter un emploi qu'elle adorait, selon ses dires. Elle a communiqu\u00e9 avec la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne dans les jours qui ont suivi l'incident et a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte quelques mois plus tard. L'enqu\u00eate et les autres \u00e9tapes de la proc\u00e9dure ont pris des ann\u00e9es. Dans l'intervalle, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 gravement malade.\n[19] Selon l'intim\u00e9, la plaignante a mont\u00e9 un bateau dans l'espoir d'obtenir des avantages financiers \u00e0 ses d\u00e9pens. Toutefois, les faits de l'esp\u00e8ce n'\u00e9tayent pas cette th\u00e9orie. \u00c0 la fin de son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante a d'abord indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal qu'elle ne cherchait pas \u00e0 obtenir un redressement aux termes de la Loi, si ce n'est une lettre d'excuses. Ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s avoir pris un peu de temps pour examiner la Loi durant une pause \u00e0 l'audience qu'elle a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'elle demandait une indemnit\u00e9 de 2 500 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral (alin\u00e9a 53(2)e)), et une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale de 2 500 $ (paragraphe 53(3)). Elle n'a demand\u00e9 aucune indemnisation pour ses pertes salariales. En fait, la plaignante a soulign\u00e9 qu'elle ne voulait pas demander plus d'argent, \u00e9tant consciente du fait que l'intim\u00e9 avait de modestes moyens. Elle ne voulait pas le ruiner. Elle a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de verser ces sommes d'argent \u00e0 un organisme de charit\u00e9 plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 elle. Je ne vois donc pas comment l'all\u00e9gation de l'intim\u00e9 quant aux motifs de la plaignante pourrait \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e.\n[20] L'intim\u00e9 a fait \u00e9tat de quelques exemples survenus au cours des jours qui ont suivi l'incident et o\u00f9, selon lui, la plaignante n'aurait fait preuve d'aucune hostilit\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit. Il s'est assis juste \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 d'elle dans un restaurant o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 attabl\u00e9e avec une amie. Il a \u00e9galement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu'elle avait accept\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre occasion un sandwich qu'il lui avait offert. La plaignante nie ces faits, tels que racont\u00e9s, affirmant que son amie et elle avaient termin\u00e9 leur repas et attendaient l'addition lorsque l'intim\u00e9 s'est assis \u00e0 la table voisine. Elles ont quitt\u00e9 les lieux peu de temps apr\u00e8s. Elle nie carr\u00e9ment avoir jamais accept\u00e9 de sandwich de l'intim\u00e9. Fait plus important, aucun de ces deux incidents banals ne t\u00e9moigne de la spontan\u00e9it\u00e9 ou de la franche camaraderie qui existaient entre les parties avant l'incident de la chambre d'h\u00f4tel. L'intim\u00e9 n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve indiquant que leur relation amicale \u00e9tait demeur\u00e9e inchang\u00e9e apr\u00e8s sa visite dans la chambre d'h\u00f4tel la nuit en question. Ce changement soudain dans la relation d'amiti\u00e9 cadre avec l'all\u00e9gation de la plaignante voulant qu'elle ait fait preuve de froideur et d'indiff\u00e9rence \u00e0 l'endroit de l'intim\u00e9 durant le reste de l'affectation, en attendant son retour \u00e0 Toronto et le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte aupr\u00e8s de l'employeur.\n[21] Selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je suis persuad\u00e9 que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par la plaignante ont eu lieu. Je trouve peu convaincante la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9 voulant que rien hors de l'ordinaire ne se soit produit durant la soir\u00e9e en question.\n[22] De surcro\u00eet, je suis convaincu que la conduite manifest\u00e9e cette nuit-l\u00e0 constituait du harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Il s'agissait d'une conduite de nature sexuelle non sollicit\u00e9e ayant un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le milieu de travail. La plaignante ne se sentait plus \u00e0 l'aise de travailler dans le m\u00eame milieu de travail que l'intim\u00e9; c'est l\u00e0 un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui l'ont incit\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9missionner de son poste chez PMCL. L'incident n'a dur\u00e9 que l'espace d'une soir\u00e9e, mais la conduite de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait suffisamment grave pour cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail hostile aux yeux d'une personne raisonnable (voir Canada (CDP) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es) et Franke (1999), 34 C.H.R.R. D\/140, aux paragraphes 29 \u00e0 50 (C.F., 1er inst.)).\n[23] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que l'intim\u00e9 a exerc\u00e9 une discrimination \u00e0 l'endroit de la plaignante en la harcelant sexuellement. La plainte est fond\u00e9e.\nIV. REDRESSEMENT [24] Comme je l'ai expliqu\u00e9 ci-haut, la plaignante a demand\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 de 2 500 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral. Elle a \u00e9galement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 a commis un acte discriminatoire d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9, pour lequel elle demande une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale de 2 500 $.\n[25] La plaignante a d\u00e9crit au cours de son t\u00e9moignage les s\u00e9quelles \u00e9motives de l'incident de harc\u00e8lement. Sa vie \u00e9tait perturb\u00e9e, particuli\u00e8rement au travail. Elle a modifi\u00e9 ses habitudes de travail afin d'\u00e9viter d'\u00eatre en contact avec l'intim\u00e9. La conduite discriminatoire de ce dernier a \u00e9t\u00e9 en fin de compte l'un des facteurs qui ont entra\u00een\u00e9 son d\u00e9part de chez PMCL, o\u00f9 son travail lui plaisait beaucoup. Je suis convaincu que la plaignante a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral par suite de l'acte discriminatoire. Par ailleurs, il ne fait aucun doute que la conduite de l'intim\u00e9 dans la chambre d'h\u00f4tel la nuit en question \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[26] Eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 ces circonstances, et compte tenu de la jurisprudence applicable en ce qui touche les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats non p\u00e9cuniaires dans des affaires de harc\u00e8lement (voir, par exemple, Bushey c. Sharma, 2003 TCDP 21; Woiden c. Lynn (no2) (2002), 43 C.H.R.R. D\/296 (TCDP)), je suis convaincu que les deux demandes de la plaignante sont plus que justifi\u00e9es. J'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de verser \u00e0 la plaignante une somme de 2 500 $ pour compenser le pr\u00e9judice moral qu'elle a subi (alin\u00e9a 53(2)e)), ainsi qu'une somme de 2 500 $ \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale (par. 53(3)). La plaignante a droit \u00e0 des int\u00e9r\u00eats simples \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ces deux indemnit\u00e9s. Ces int\u00e9r\u00eats doivent \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s en se fondant sur le taux d'escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle). Les int\u00e9r\u00eats doivent \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s \u00e0 partir du 29 ao\u00fbt 1999.\n[27] La plaignante a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 d'ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de lui pr\u00e9senter une lettre d'excuses. Dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Stevenson, 2003 CFPI 341, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a statu\u00e9 que la Loi n'autorise pas les tribunaux \u00e0 rendre de telles ordonnances. Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande de lettre d'excuses de la plaignante est rejet\u00e9e.\nV. MAINTIEN DE LA COMP\u00c9TENCE [28] Je conserve ma comp\u00e9tence pour le cas o\u00f9 surviendrait un diff\u00e9rend dans la mise en uvre des mesures de redressement ou relativement au calcul des indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es.\nAthanasios D.

L'intim\u00e9e estime que le Tribunal n'a pas le pouvoir d'attribuer les d\u00e9pens. \u00c0 mon avis, il faut, pour r\u00e9gler cette question correctement, se livrer \u00e0 une analyse approfondie de la jurisprudence - tant celle des cours que celle du Tribunal.\n[2] L'intim\u00e9e soutient que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne conf\u00e8re pas au Tribunal le pouvoir d'attribuer les d\u00e9pens. La plaignante conteste cette pr\u00e9tention. Son conseiller m'a avis\u00e9 qu'elle a engag\u00e9 des frais juridiques de l'ordre de 11 000 $ depuis le d\u00e9but de l'affaire. La majeure partie de ces frais sont attribuables \u00e0 l'audience. Le conseiller a fait valoir que, s'il n'ordonne pas \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de payer les frais engag\u00e9s par la plaignante, le Tribunal se trouvera \u00e0 la priver du d\u00e9dommagement auquel elle a droit aux termes de la Loi.\nII. DOMMAGES-INT\u00c9R\u00caTS A. Les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats n'incluent pas les d\u00e9pens [3] La r\u00e8gle fondamentale dans notre droit est simple. Le pouvoir d'accorder des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats n'inclut pas celui d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens. La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne donne au Tribunal le pouvoir d'attribuer une indemnit\u00e9. \u00c0 mon avis, il s'agit d'une forme de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qu'il faut distinguer des d\u00e9pens.\n[4] Dans Hrtschan c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville), REJB 2004-55545, la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec pr\u00e9cise au par. 60 que la distinction entre les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats et les d\u00e9pens est causale :\n60. Dans la logique de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile, laquelle requiert un lien de causalit\u00e9 directe entre la faute et le pr\u00e9judice, il ne suffit pas de dire qu'il a fallu recourir aux services d'un avocat pour conclure, au terme d'un proc\u00e8s qui tranche le cas, que la totalit\u00e9 de la note des honoraires et d\u00e9bours engag\u00e9s par la victime donne la mesure du pr\u00e9judice subi. (L'italique est de moi.)\nAu par. 75, le juge Pelletier cite un texte du professeur A. Popovici intitul\u00e9 Le Sort des honoraires extrajudiciaires, (2002) R. du B. 53, \u00e0 l'appui de sa position voulant que les d\u00e9pens ne soient pas des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nL'intim\u00e9e m'a fourni une traduction anglaise du par. 60, qu'il convient de citer sans faire de commentaires au sujet de l'exactitude de la traduction.\n60. In the logic of civil responsibility, which requires a direct causal link between the fault and the prejudice, a victim cannot rely on the assertion that he had to resort to the services of a lawyer to then be automatically awarded fees and disbursements at the end of the trial, on the basis that the lawyer's total bill equals the prejudice suffered.\nOn peut dire que les frais et d\u00e9pens engendr\u00e9s par un proc\u00e8s ou une audience ne d\u00e9coulent pas directement du pr\u00e9judice. Ils ont une autre origine - d'ordre contractuel celle-l\u00e0 - et ne constituent pas, par cons\u00e9quent, un chef ordinaire de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats ou d'indemnit\u00e9.\n[5] Il en r\u00e9sulte le principe selon lequel les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats et les d\u00e9pens doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9s s\u00e9par\u00e9ment. Il s'ensuit que le pouvoir d'attribuer les d\u00e9pens exige une comp\u00e9tence distincte et explicite. Ce principe est appliqu\u00e9, plut\u00f4t r\u00e9solument, tant dans le syst\u00e8me de common law que dans le syst\u00e8me de droit civil. Le pouvoir d'un tribunal et m\u00eame d'une cour d'attribuer les d\u00e9pens est assujetti aux conditions et modalit\u00e9s \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans les lois pertinentes.\nB. Frais li\u00e9s aux premi\u00e8res consultations [6] Le crit\u00e8re est celui de l'encha\u00eenement causal et la question est particuli\u00e8rement subtile. En d\u00e9pit de la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, certains frais et d\u00e9pens sont admissibles \u00e0 titre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Dans la d\u00e9cision Hrtschan, par exemple, la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec reconna\u00eet qu'une partie qui a un recours juridique a le droit de demander conseil \u00e0 un avocat. Les frais occasionn\u00e9s par cette consultation constituent un chef de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats recouvrable.\n[7] La r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n'est pas modifi\u00e9e pour autant.\n61. Si la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 des premi\u00e8res consultations et des premi\u00e8res prestations de service peut, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 la r\u00e9clamation pour frais extrajudiciaires une l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 du genre de celle que je viens d'\u00e9voquer, il n'en va pas n\u00e9cessairement de m\u00eame pour la suite des \u00e9v\u00e9nements. De fait, la situation risque de s'embrouiller tr\u00e8s rapidement au fil du d\u00e9roulement du conflit judiciaire.\nIl y a une diff\u00e9rence entre la consultation initiale d'un avocat par une partie et la repr\u00e9sentation de cette derni\u00e8re dans le cours d'une audience ou d'un proc\u00e8s.\n[8] Il est normal qu'une personne qui a fait l'objet de discrimination demande conseil \u00e0 un avocat. C'est une r\u00e9action tout \u00e0 fait pr\u00e9visible. Cette consultation pr\u00e9liminaire est suffisamment rapproch\u00e9e dans la cha\u00eene causale pour \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une cons\u00e9quence directe et in\u00e9vitable de la faute originale. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle constitue un \u00e9l\u00e9ment pr\u00e9visible des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats que le plaignant a subis par suite de la discrimination. Les actes reproch\u00e9s \u00e0 leur auteur constituent la cause imm\u00e9diate des frais engag\u00e9s par le plaignant pour obtenir les conseils d'un avocat.\n[9] Je comprends que le recours initial \u00e0 un avocat et les conseils d'un repr\u00e9sentant l\u00e9gal constituent des exceptions \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale voulant que les d\u00e9pens ne soient pas des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. En derni\u00e8re analyse, il faut d\u00e9terminer dans chaque cas s'il existe un lien causal. Il s'agit de se demander, en toute logique, si les frais juridiques que r\u00e9clame la partie plaignante sont une cons\u00e9quence n\u00e9cessaire de la discrimination. Une fois que la consultation initiale a eu lieu et que les frais qu'elle a occasionn\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 acquitt\u00e9s, la partie plaignante est en mesure de mandater un avocat. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, la cha\u00eene causale est rompue et toute d\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 la prestation de services juridiques d\u00e9coule logiquement de facteurs qui ne sont qu'indirectement li\u00e9s \u00e0 la cause d'action originale.\n[10] Le droit sur les droits de la personne reconna\u00eet l'exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Dans Waters v. British Columbia (Ministry of Health Services) 2003 BCHRT 13, le tribunal de la C.-B. a abord\u00e9 la question des frais juridiques engag\u00e9s avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte. Au par. 212, le Tribunal affirme que ces frais sont r\u00e9cup\u00e9rables :\n[TRADUCTION] Dans Radloff v. Stox Broadcast Corp., [1999] BCHRTD No. 36, le tribunal a soutenu que les frais juridiques d\u00e9coulant de la contravention qui ne peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des frais li\u00e9s \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9s : Radloff, au par. 99 (voir aussi Leeder v. O'Cana Enterprises Ltd. (exer\u00e7ant son activit\u00e9 sous le nom de Alisa Japanese Restaurant), [1999] B.C.H.R.T.D. No. 1, au par. 29).\nL'\u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u00e9terminant est qu'il existait entre la violation de la Loi et les frais un lien suffisant pour assimiler ceux-ci \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 ou aux dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n[11] L'exception s'applique dans d'autres cas. Dans Curling v. Torimiro [2000] O.H.R.B.I.D. No. 169 (QL), par exemple, la commission d'enqu\u00eate soutient, au par. 61, que le plaignant a le droit d'\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 de ses frais juridiques [TRADUCTION] dans le cadre de la restitution ordonn\u00e9e aux termes du Code de l'Ontario.\n[12] Si, comme c'est le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce, la partie plaignante engage des frais juridiques qui sont directement attribuables \u00e0 la conduite de la partie intim\u00e9e ayant port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 ses droits aux termes du Code, cette derni\u00e8re peut, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, \u00eatre condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'indemniser de ces frais de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 assurer une indemnisation int\u00e9grale.\nLes mots d\u00e9terminants sont directement attribuables. Au par. 62, la commission d'enqu\u00eate a exprim\u00e9 l'opinion que la plaignante r\u00e9clamait des frais juridiques qu'elle avait \u00e0 proprement parler engag\u00e9s :\n[TRADUCTION] par suite des actes de repr\u00e9sailles consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme contrevenant \u00e0 ses droits aux termes de l'art. 8. Le fait que les actes de repr\u00e9sailles aient pris la forme de recours judiciaires ou de menaces de recours judiciaires et exig\u00e9 une r\u00e9ponse l\u00e9gale est important.\nDans la d\u00e9cision Curling, la commission d'enqu\u00eate reconna\u00eet que, dans certains cas, le lien causal entre les frais et l'acte discriminatoire est tellement \u00e9troit que la partie plaignante a droit d'\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e de ses frais juridiques pour le motif qu'ils d\u00e9coulent directement de la discrimination.\nC. Frais juridiques li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience [13] Les frais juridiques engag\u00e9s ult\u00e9rieurement au cours de la proc\u00e9dure sont toutefois assujettis \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle d'exclusion. Ils ne devraient pas \u00eatre assimil\u00e9s \u00e0 des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. C'est le cas notamment des frais li\u00e9s \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration d'un rapport d'expert et d'autres frais qui d\u00e9coulent du litige plut\u00f4t que de l'acte discriminatoire reproch\u00e9. L'origine de ces frais r\u00e9side dans les instructions des parties et les conseils qu'ils re\u00e7oivent. Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment est en soi variable. L'opportunit\u00e9 d'appeler des t\u00e9moins ou de soulever certains points de droit est strictement une question de jugement. Diff\u00e9rentes personnes peuvent prendre ces d\u00e9cisions diff\u00e9remment.\n[14] Le juge Pelletier exprime des r\u00e9serves \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'id\u00e9e voulant que les juges s'engagent sur ce terrain. Il n'appartient pas aux arbitres de pr\u00eater des intentions aux parties, afin de d\u00e9terminer quels services \u00e9taient pertinents. Il y a \u00e9galement le danger de reprendre l'affaire, sans parler du probl\u00e8me consistant \u00e0 aborder des questions trait\u00e9es \u00e0 titre confidentiel ou sous le sceau du secret. Des consid\u00e9rations d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public emp\u00eachent un arbitre de se pencher de trop pr\u00e8s sur les d\u00e9cisions personnelles des parties ou d'\u00e9valuer leur conduite du dossier.\nIII. D\u00c9PENS A. La r\u00e8gle de common law : Le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9vu express\u00e9ment par la loi [15] On a toujours soutenu en common law qu'un organisme juridictionnel n'a le pouvoir d'attribuer les d\u00e9pens que dans la mesure o\u00f9 ce pouvoir lui a express\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9. Par ailleurs, un tel organisme jouit d'un pouvoir distinct qui lui permet de rem\u00e9dier aux abus.\n[16] Cette r\u00e8gle ne souffre d'aucune exception. Le pouvoir d'attribuer les d\u00e9pens rev\u00eat un caract\u00e8re extraordinaire et doit \u00eatre express\u00e9ment pr\u00e9vu par la loi. Dans Family and Children's Services of Annapolis County v. Clark, [1983] N.S.J. No. 586, par exemple, la Division d'appel de la Cour supr\u00eame de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse a soutenu que la Cour de la famille de cette province n'avait pas le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens. Au par. 5, elle \u00e9nonce la position historique :\n[TRADUCTION] La Cour de la famille est un tribunal d'archives cr\u00e9\u00e9 par une loi (S.N.S. 1967, ch. 98). Par cons\u00e9quent, elle ne peut se prononcer sur la question de fond que constituent les d\u00e9pens que si la loi constitutive ou une autre loi lui conf\u00e8re express\u00e9ment ce pouvoir. Les cours cr\u00e9\u00e9es par la loi n'ont pas de comp\u00e9tence inh\u00e9rente en mati\u00e8re d'attribution des d\u00e9pens. Cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e par cette cour, dont la structure et la composition \u00e9taient alors diff\u00e9rentes, dans Charles Brown (1928), 60 N.S.R. 76; 49 C.C.C. 402. Il s'agissait en l'occurrence de d\u00e9terminer si un juge de la cour de comt\u00e9 \u00e9tait habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 attribuer les d\u00e9pens dans le cas o\u00f9 une requ\u00eate d'habeas corpus est accueillie. Le pouvoir d'entendre la requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 par la County Court Act, R.S.N.S. 1923, ch. 215, telle que modifi\u00e9e par S.N.S. 1924, ch. 50, art. 3. Cependant, la loi \u00e9tait muette sur la question des d\u00e9pens. Cette cour a jug\u00e9 que le juge de la cour de comt\u00e9 n'avait pas le pouvoir d'attribuer les d\u00e9pens. La d\u00e9cision de la cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par le juge Chisholm (qui est devenu par la suite le juge en chef), qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 (aux p. 78 et 79 N.S.R.) :\n[TRADUCTION] ... La notion m\u00eame de recouvrement des d\u00e9pens n'existait pas en common law. Les cours n'ont pas de comp\u00e9tence inh\u00e9rente en mati\u00e8re d'attribution des d\u00e9pens. Elles ne jouissent d'un tel pouvoir dans une cause ou une instance que si la loi le leur conf\u00e8re express\u00e9ment. 2 Coke's Inst. 288; Duffill v. McFall (1878), 42 U.C.Q.B. 597; Lehigh Valley Railroad Co. v. McFarland (1882), 44 N.J.L. 674 5 Encyclopedia of Planning Law and Practice 108.\nSi j'ai cit\u00e9 un extrait aussi long, c'est pour illustrer le caract\u00e8re non \u00e9quivoque de la r\u00e8gle de common law.\n[17] Il existe des d\u00e9cisions similaires dans le domaine des droits de la personne. Dans Ontario (Liquor Control Board) v. Ontario (Ontario Human Rights Commission), par exemple, [1988] O.J. No. 167 (QL), trois juges de la Haute Cour de justice de l'Ontario abordent bri\u00e8vement la question :\n[TRADUCTION] Les demandeurs\/appelants ont soutenu que Baum avait commis une erreur de droit et de comp\u00e9tence en adjugeant les d\u00e9pens aux intim\u00e9s Karumanchiri, Ng et Yan. Une cour, pas plus d'ailleurs que tout autre organisme cr\u00e9\u00e9 par une loi, ne poss\u00e8de une comp\u00e9tence inh\u00e9rente en mati\u00e8re d'attribution des d\u00e9pens.\nRe Brown, [1928] 3 D.L.R. 234, 49 C.C.C. 402, 60 N.S.R. 76 (N.S.S.C.)\nOrkin, The Law of Costs, 1968, Canada Law Book Limited, Toronto, p. 1\nLa commission d'enqu\u00eate est cr\u00e9\u00e9e aux termes du Code des droits de la personne de l'Ontario, 1981, L.O. 1981, ch. 53. En tant qu'organisme cr\u00e9\u00e9 par une loi, la commission n'a le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens que dans la mesure o\u00f9 un tel pouvoir lui est express\u00e9ment conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par le Code ou une autre loi.\nRe Lachawski and Federated Mutual Insurance Co.

[n.p.]\nVoil\u00e0 l'\u00e9volution du droit relatif aux d\u00e9pens en Ontario, lequel d\u00e9coule de la common law.\n[18] Dans Ontario Liquor Control Board, les juges soutiennent pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment que la restitution ne comprend pas les d\u00e9pens :\n[TRADUCTION] Le l\u00e9gislateur a express\u00e9ment pr\u00e9vu le recouvrement des d\u00e9pens dans des circonstances sp\u00e9ciales aupr\u00e8s de la personne qui a fait l'objet de la plainte, aux termes du par. 40(6) du Code des droits de la personne de l'Ontario, 1981, L.O. 1981, ch. 53. Le pouvoir que le par. 40(1) conf\u00e8re \u00e0 la commission d'enqu\u00eate d'effectuer une restitution, y compris une indemnisation financi\u00e8re n'est pas une disposition pr\u00e9voyant express\u00e9ment l'attribution des d\u00e9pens aux plaignants en vertu du Code. Le principe de l'interpr\u00e9tation lib\u00e9rale visant la r\u00e9alisation des objectifs du Code afin de rem\u00e9dier aux effets de la discrimination et de contrer celle-ci, dans la mesure du possible, ne s'applique ni aux questions de proc\u00e9dure ni \u00e0 la question des d\u00e9pens. [n.p.]\nEn outre, dans Moncton v. Buggie and N.B. Human Rights Commission [1985] N.B.J. No. 276 (QL), la Cour d'appel du Nouveau-Brunswick affirme, au par. 35, qu'une commission d'enqu\u00eate n'a pas le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens.\nB. Autres sources du pouvoir d'attribuer les d\u00e9pens [19] Le fait que la r\u00e8gle soit diff\u00e9rente en equity est peut-\u00eatre important. Dans Oasis Hotel Ltd. v. Zurich Insurance Co. [1981] B.C.J. No. 690 (QL), la Cour d'appel de la C.-B. retrace l'historique du pouvoir d'adjudication des d\u00e9pens au sein des tribunaux d'equity. La Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique jouit des pouvoirs de la Haute Cour de la chancellerie de Grande-Bretagne, tels qu'exerc\u00e9s en 1858. La Cour d'appel a statu\u00e9 que cela lui conf\u00e9rait le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens. Au par. 11 de la d\u00e9cision Sturmer and Town of Beaverton (1912) 2 D.L.R. 501, (C. div. Ont.), le juge Middleton affirme que ce pouvoir n'est pas exerc\u00e9 en vertu d'un instrument habilitant, mais en toute bonne conscience, selon l'arbitrage d'un bon citoyen (arbitrio boni viri). Dans son Dictionnaire de maximes et locutions latines utilis\u00e9es en droit (3e \u00e9dition, Yvon Blais), Albert Mayrand explique pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment que la maxime latine arbitrio boni viri signifie selon l'arbitrage d'un bon citoyen.\n[20] Les tribunaux d'equity semblent avoir eu comme mandat d'offrir des recours utiles. Cela peut aider \u00e0 expliquer pourquoi les pouvoirs de r\u00e9paration d'un organisme cr\u00e9\u00e9 par une loi semblent importants lorsqu'il s'agit de d\u00e9terminer si ce dernier a le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens. Ainsi, dans Banca Nazionale c. Lee-Shanok, [1988] A.C.F. no 594 (QL), affaire qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un jugement unanime, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s'est pench\u00e9 sur le par. 61.5(9) du Code canadien du travail, L.R.C. 1970, ch. L-1, qui conf\u00e9rait \u00e0 un arbitre le pouvoir d'ordonner \u00e0 un employeur qui a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 un employ\u00e9 de le r\u00e9int\u00e9grer dans son emploi et de prendre toute autre mesure qu'il juge \u00e9quitable de lui imposer et de nature \u00e0 contrebalancer les effets du cong\u00e9diement ou \u00e0 y rem\u00e9dier. (L'italique est de moi.) La Cour a soutenu que ce paragraphe avait pour objet d'indemniser int\u00e9gralement un employ\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 injustement par son employeur. Le juge Stone \u00e9crit :\n[TRADUCTION] J'ai de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 concevoir qu'une indemnit\u00e9, obtenue par le plaignant \u00e0 grands frais en termes de d\u00e9pens, puisse avoir pour effet d'indemniser int\u00e9gralement le plaignant. Les d\u00e9pens engag\u00e9s se trouveraient \u00e0 r\u00e9duire l'indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e pour compenser la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration perdue, tandis que leur attribution semblerait rem\u00e9dier aux effets du cong\u00e9diement ou, du moins, \u00e0 les contrebalancer.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, la Cour a statu\u00e9 que le Code du travail conf\u00e9rait \u00e0 l'arbitre le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens.\nIV. LES POSITIONS DES PARTIES A. La position de l'intim\u00e9e [21] Selon l'intim\u00e9e, la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui s'applique \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est claire. Elle m'a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 un certain nombre de sources pertinentes. Dans Big Island Band c. Big George, [1995] A.C.F. no 543 (QL), par exemple, la Cour s'est pench\u00e9e sur la m\u00eame disposition que celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e dans Banca Nazionale. Cet arr\u00eat se distingue de celui rendu dans l'affaire Banca Nazionale, en ce sens que le juge a d\u00e9bout\u00e9 le plaignant mais a adjug\u00e9 des d\u00e9pens. Au par. 6, le juge Nadon cite un extrait qui figure \u00e0 la page 105 de l'ouvrage de Sara Blake intitul\u00e9 Administrative Law in Canada (Butterworths). Au par. 8 de la d\u00e9cision, il \u00e9crit :\nJe conviens enti\u00e8rement avec l'auteur du passage cit\u00e9 ci-dessus dans Administrative Law in Canada qu'un organisme ou tribunal administratif ne peut condamner une partie aux d\u00e9pens que s'il y est express\u00e9ment habilit\u00e9. Je dois ajouter que, \u00e0 mon avis, un arbitre n'a pas comp\u00e9tence inh\u00e9rente en la mati\u00e8re.\nIl est \u00e9vident, \u00e0 mon avis, qu'un tribunal qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 par une loi comme le Tribunal des droits de la personne n'est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 adjuger les d\u00e9pens que si un tel pouvoir lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 express\u00e9ment par la loi en question.\n[22] L'intim\u00e9e m'a aussi soumis un certain nombre d'extraits d'autres lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. L'alin\u00e9a 251.12(4)a) du Code canadien du travail, par exemple, donne \u00e0 un arbitre qui doit trancher une question faisant l'objet d'un appel le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens. Aux termes du paragraphe 25.1(1) de la Loi sur les transports au Canada, l'Office des transports du Canada a tous les pouvoirs de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'adjudication des frais relativement \u00e0 toute proc\u00e9dure prise devant lui. Au paragraphe 30.16(1) de la Loi sur le Tribunal canadien du commerce ext\u00e9rieur, il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que les frais relatifs \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate sont... laiss\u00e9s \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation du Tribunal. On retrouve le m\u00eame langage explicite dans d'autres lois.\n[23] D'autres arguments sont en faveur de l'intim\u00e9e. La partie 11 des R\u00e8gles de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale porte sur les d\u00e9pens. La Cour a des officiers taxateurs. Les r\u00e8gles traitent de questions telles que le cautionnement pour d\u00e9pens. Il existe \u00e9galement un tarif. Un r\u00e9gime complet est pr\u00e9vu en ce qui touche les d\u00e9pens. L'intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue qu'il n'y a rien de semblable dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. La Loi est totalement muette sur cette question.\n[24] En outre, l'intim\u00e9e fait valoir que la plaignante a engag\u00e9 des frais parce que la Commission s'est retir\u00e9e de l'audience. Cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise relativement tard dans le processus. Si quelqu'un doit assumer ces frais, soutient l'intim\u00e9e, c'est la Commission. Dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Morgan (1991) 21 C.H.R.R. D\/87, on trouve au moins une affirmation (par. 67) selon laquelle les intim\u00e9s ne devraient pas \u00eatre tenus responsables de probl\u00e8mes cr\u00e9\u00e9s par la conduite de la Commission.\nB. La position de la plaignante [25] Le conseiller de la plaignante a cit\u00e9 la jurisprudence mentionn\u00e9e ci-dessus. Essentiellement, il a fait valoir que les dispositions r\u00e9paratrices de la Loi deviendraient sans effet \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de l'adjudication des d\u00e9pens.\n[26] Le conseiller de la plaignante a aussi soutenu que le Tribunal jouit du m\u00eame pouvoir que les arbitres, qui ont apparemment comp\u00e9tence pour adjuger les d\u00e9pens. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il a cit\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Commission des relations de travail de la Colombie-Britannique dans l'affaire Graham [2000] BCLRBD no 1 (QL). Au par. 46 de cette d\u00e9cision, la Commission soutient que sa comp\u00e9tence [TRADUCTION] pour adjuger les frais et d\u00e9pens... comme forme de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats est bien \u00e9tablie. Au par. 48, elle ajoute ce qui suit : [TRADUCTION] La Commission a expliqu\u00e9 qu'une ordonnance de remboursement des frais raisonnables vise \u00e0 faire en sorte qu'un plaignant qui a gain de cause entre dans ses frais plut\u00f4t que de subir une perte : Tony McNamara et Pierre Comeau, IRC No. 302\/88 (r\u00e9examen de C25\/88), p. 12.\nC. La position de la Commission [27] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e que j'\u00e9tais saisi de la question des d\u00e9pens. Cependant, elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas compara\u00eetre et n'a pas pris position \u00e0 ce sujet. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne connais pas les circonstances qui ont amen\u00e9 la Commission \u00e0 se retirer de l'affaire.\nV. L\u00c9GISLATION A. Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne [28] Les parties ont convenu que le principal point de d\u00e9part de l'examen de la question dont je suis saisi r\u00e9side dans le fait que le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 par une loi et jouit, par cons\u00e9quent, des pouvoirs que celle-ci lui conf\u00e8re.\n[29] Il est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement reconnu que les seules dispositions de la Loi susceptibles de conf\u00e9rer au Tribunal le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens sont celles qui sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es aux alin\u00e9as 53(2)c) et 53(2)d). En vertu de ces dispositions, le Tribunal peut ordonner :\nc) d'indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte;\nd) d'indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des frais suppl\u00e9mentaires occasionn\u00e9s par le recours \u00e0 d'autres biens, services, installations ou moyens d'h\u00e9bergement, et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte...\nCes deux dispositions sont cit\u00e9es dans la jurisprudence. Il est \u00e9vident que l'exception concernant les frais occasionn\u00e9s par les consultations initiales rel\u00e8ve de l'alin\u00e9a d).\n[30] Deux arguments fondamentaux militent contre l'invocation de ces dispositions comme source du pouvoir du Tribunal d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens. D'abord, il y est fait mention des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte. Les d\u00e9penses sont ainsi assimil\u00e9es \u00e0 des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Il doit y avoir un lien causal ininterrompu entre l'acte discriminatoire et les d\u00e9penses qui sont r\u00e9clam\u00e9es.\n[31] Ensuite, les principes d'interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative ne sont pas compatibles avec une telle interpr\u00e9tation de la Loi. Il y a au moins deux principes qui s'appliquent. Le premier est ejusdem generis; en vertu de ce principe, le sens des termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux est restreint par les termes particuliers qui les pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent. Ainsi, le terme d\u00e9penses qui figure \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)d) fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux d\u00e9penses telles que celles occasionn\u00e9es par le recours \u00e0 d'autres biens, services, installations ou moyens d'h\u00e9bergement. \u00c0 l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c), il est fait mention du genre de d\u00e9penses occasionn\u00e9es \u00e0 la victime par suite des pertes de salaire.\n[32] Le deuxi\u00e8me principe est expressio unius est exclusio alterius. Dans Driedger on the Construction of Statutes (3d; Butterworths), Ruth Sullivan \u00e9crit \u00e0 la p. 168 ce qui suit au sujet de ce principe : [TRADUCTION] dans tous les cas o\u00f9 on a des raisons de croire que si le l\u00e9gislateur avait voulu inclure un \u00e9l\u00e9ment particulier dans le champ d'application de la loi, il en aurait fait mention express\u00e9ment. Dans Green (voir ci-dessous) le juge Lemieux invoque ce genre d'argument (au par. 186), affirmant que si le l\u00e9gislateur avait voulu que le tribunal ait le pouvoir d'octroyer des frais l\u00e9gaux, il l'aurait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9. L'argument veut que le l\u00e9gislateur ait \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 un certain nombre de chefs d'indemnit\u00e9 particuliers. S'il avait voulu donner au Tribunal le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens, il aurait inclus cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment dans la liste. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, la r\u00e8gle est renforc\u00e9e par rapport au caract\u00e8re extraordinaire du pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens, option qui n'existe que s'il est pr\u00e9vu express\u00e9ment dans la loi habilitante.\n[33] D'autres probl\u00e8mes se posent peut-\u00eatre. Je suis enclin \u00e0 croire que l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) pr\u00e9voit le recouvrement int\u00e9gral des d\u00e9penses engag\u00e9es par le plaignant. Ce n'est pas la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui s'applique aux frais juridiques, qui sont habituellement adjug\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on plus restrictive. Pr\u00e9tendre le contraire reviendrait \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer les d\u00e9penses comme des d\u00e9bours. En fait, je note que, sous l'entr\u00e9e expense (d\u00e9pense), on donne comme synonyme le mot disbursement (d\u00e9bours) dans le New Shorter Oxford Dictionary. Je pense que c'est le sens qu'il faut donner au mot d\u00e9penses, tel qu'il est utilis\u00e9 dans l'article.\n[34] Certaines consid\u00e9rations pratiques doivent aussi \u00eatre prises en compte. Le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne est un tribunal sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 qui a une connaissance pouss\u00e9e des questions de droit et de fait qui surgissent souvent dans le contexte de la discrimination. Il ne poss\u00e8de aucune exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re de taxation des comptes, domaine qui est reconnu comme une sp\u00e9cialisation en soi. Les relev\u00e9s de services d'avocat sont soumis \u00e0 un ensemble relativement complexe de r\u00e8gles et de principes.\n[35] Par ailleurs, le cas qui nous occupe illustre bien le caract\u00e8re probl\u00e9matique d'une instruction portant sur les d\u00e9pens. Si le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens, l'intim\u00e9e entend, m'avise-t-on, contester les honoraires r\u00e9clam\u00e9s par le repr\u00e9sentant de la plaignante. Cela risque d'amener le Tribunal \u00e0 se pencher sur les n\u00e9gociations tenues sous toutes r\u00e9serves entre les parties.\nB. Autres lois sur les droits de la personne [36] Dans son ouvrage intitul\u00e9 Discrimination and the Law (Carswell; 2004, Rel.2), William Pentney indique \u00e0 la p. 15-124 que les dispositions relatives aux d\u00e9pens varient \u00e9norm\u00e9ment dans l'ensemble du pays. Ainsi, le paragraphe 37(4) du Human Rights Code de la Colombie-Britannique permet \u00e0 un tribunal d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens si une partie [TRADUCTION] a fait montre d'une conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible. Il s'agit d'une norme rigoureuse : voir Cook v. Citizens Research Institute, 2002 BCHRTD 6.\n[37] On trouve des dispositions similaires en Alberta, dans l'\u00cele-du-Prince-\u00c9douard, \u00e0 Terre-Neuve (auxquelles on peut avoir recours contre une partie qui m\u00e9rite une telle sanction) et au Manitoba (qui s'appliquent en cas de conduite frivole ou vexatoire). En Ontario, le Code permet \u00e0 une commission d'enqu\u00eate de mettre les d\u00e9pens \u00e0 la charge de la Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne si le Tribunal conclut que la plainte \u00e9tait futile, frivole, vexatoire ou faite de mauvaise foi. Au Yukon et en Saskatchewan, seule la partie qui a contrevenu \u00e0 la loi pertinente est passible des frais et d\u00e9pens.\n[38] On retrouve dans certaines lois provinciales un langage similaire \u00e0 celui qui caract\u00e9rise les dispositions de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Ainsi, l'alin\u00e9a 28.4(1)iv) de la Human Rights Act de l'\u00cele-du-Prince-\u00c9douard permet aux juges instructeurs :\n[TRADUCTION] iv) d'indemniser le plaignant ou une autre personne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9s\u00e9e aux termes de cette loi de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte;\nLes similitudes sont \u00e9videntes. Cependant, il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9, au paragraphe 28.4(6) de cette m\u00eame loi que les membres instructeurs [TRADUCTION] peuvent rendre toute ordonnance jug\u00e9e opportune en ce qui touche les d\u00e9pens. Selon l'intim\u00e9e, cela montre bien ce qui manque dans la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[39] Voici ce que dit Pentney au sujet de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne :\n[TRADUCTION] Ni la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ni celle des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, du Nouveau-Brunswick ou de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse ne conf\u00e8re express\u00e9ment au tribunal comp\u00e9tent le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens. Cependant, on pourrait tr\u00e8s bien faire valoir que [dans chaque cas] ce pouvoir lui est d\u00e9volu, compte tenu de sa comp\u00e9tence pleine et enti\u00e8re d'assurer une restitution compl\u00e8te et(ou) de promouvoir les objectifs de la loi. (15-125)\nCependant, la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 est que la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est d\u00e9pourvue du genre de disposition explicite qu'exige la common law.\n[40] Dans Ontario (Liquor Control Board) v. Ontario (Ontario Human Rights Commission) (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e), la d\u00e9cision semble aller dans le sens contraire.\n[41] On m'a \u00e9galement soumis une copie d'une d\u00e9cision rendue r\u00e9cemment par une commission d'enqu\u00eate de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse - Johnson v. Halifax Regional Police Service (non publi\u00e9e; 28 mai 2004). Dans cette d\u00e9cision, la commission d'enqu\u00eate a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle avait le pouvoir d'accorder aux plaignants les frais li\u00e9s \u00e0 la r\u00e9tention des services d'un avocat ind\u00e9pendant. La commission d'enqu\u00eate a accord\u00e9 une attention particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 la jurisprudence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Toutefois, cette d\u00e9cision n'est pas \u00e0 mon avis utile. Bien que la Human Rights Act de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse soit muette sur la question des d\u00e9pens, les dispositions de l'article 8, celui qui porte sur les mesures de redressement, ont une port\u00e9e beaucoup plus vaste que les dispositions \u00e9quivalentes de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Selon Pentney, ces dispositions sont celles qui accordent le pouvoir r\u00e9parateur le plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et sans doute le plus vaste qui existe au Canada. Elles ne sont pas vraiment utiles pour l'interpr\u00e9tation de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\nVI. JURISPRUDENCE RELATIVE \u00c0 LA LOI CANADIENNE SUR LES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE [42] L'historique de la question \u00e0 savoir si le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens aux termes de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne remonte relativement loin dans la jurisprudence.\nA. D\u00e9cisions rendues au d\u00e9but (i) Morrell : Le Tribunal statue qu'il n'a pas le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens [43] Les affaires jug\u00e9es au d\u00e9but semblent plaider en faveur de l'intim\u00e9e. Dans Morrell c. Canada (Commission de l'emploi et de l'immigration) (1985), 6 C.H.R.R. D\/3021, le Tribunal soutient, au par. 24348, que l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)d) ne conf\u00e8re pas au Tribunal le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens :\n[L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)d)] vise les d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es directement au comportement discriminatoire et non pas celles qui d\u00e9coulent des instances introduites en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Dans ce dernier cas, il s'agit plut\u00f4t de co\u00fbts, dont la Loi ne pr\u00e9voit pas le recouvrement. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne crois pas \u00eatre habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 ordonner une indemnisation au titre des d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es \u00e0 l'audience.\nCet extrait de la d\u00e9cision Morrell est peut-\u00eatre l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de droit le plus simple et le plus direct qu'on retrouve dans la jurisprudence. Il \u00e9tablit une distinction entre les d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es \u00e0 l'instance et celles entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire, telles que les frais m\u00e9dicaux ou de consultation. Les d\u00e9penses faisant partie de la premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie ne d\u00e9coulent pas du pr\u00e9judice original et ne sont pas indemnisables aux termes de la Loi.\n(ii) Autres d\u00e9cisions [44] La d\u00e9cision Morrell a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie d'un certain nombre d'autres d\u00e9cisions dans lesquelles le Tribunal a recommand\u00e9 ou pri\u00e9 instamment la Commission d'assumer les d\u00e9pens de la partie plaignante. Dans Hinds c. Canada (Commission de l'emploi et de l'immigration), 1988 CHRT 88, par exemple, une d\u00e9nomm\u00e9e Me Mactavish agissait comme repr\u00e9sentante du plaignant. Dans sa plaidoirie finale, elle a soutenu que le Tribunal avait le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens. Bien qu'il ait reconnu sa remarquable contribution, le Tribunal a refus\u00e9 d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens, se contentant de prier instamment la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne d'indemniser le plaignant.\n[45] Le Tribunal a suivi la m\u00eame ligne de conduite dans Oliver c. Canada (Parcs Canada) (1989), 11 C.H.R.R. D\/456. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a critiqu\u00e9 la Commission, affirmant qu'il \u00e9tait injuste de tenir l'intim\u00e9e responsable des d\u00e9pens du plaignant.\nB. Thwaites : La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale soutient que le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens [46] La position du Tribunal a \u00e9volu\u00e9 au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 90. Dans Thwaites c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes (1993), D.T. 9\/93, une formation du Tribunal a mis \u00e0 la charge de l'intim\u00e9e les frais juridiques engag\u00e9s par le plaignant au cours de l'audience. \u00c0 la fin de la d\u00e9cision, les membres instructeurs ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n\u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la complexit\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce, le tribunal estime que Me Reierson a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le tr\u00e8s important et tr\u00e8s utile en repr\u00e9sentant M. Thwaites. Nous souscrivons \u00e0 l'opinion du tribunal ayant rendu jugement dans l'affaire Grover c. Conseil national de recherches (T.D. 12\/92) que le libell\u00e9 de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi, qui conf\u00e8re au tribunal le pouvoir d'indemniser la victime des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte, est assez large pour englober le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens. Dans l'affaire pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit \u00e0 la p. 91 :\nSi les r\u00e9parations ont pour but d'indemniser int\u00e9gralement et suffisamment le plaignant qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'actes discriminatoires, alors \u00e0 coup s\u00fbr la cons\u00e9quence que constituent les d\u00e9pens fait partie int\u00e9grante d'une r\u00e9paration ad\u00e9quate pour le plaignant qui a gain de cause.\nCompte tenu des circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce, le tribunal ordonne donc aux FAC de d\u00e9frayer le plaignant des d\u00e9pens raisonnables qu'il a assum\u00e9s, y compris des honoraires pay\u00e9s aux actuaires aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Si les parties ne peuvent s'entendre au sujet de ce montant, les d\u00e9pens seront \u00e9valu\u00e9s suivant le bar\u00e8me de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\nL'affaire a fait l'objet par la suite d'un contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[47] Dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Thwaites, [1994] 3 C.F. 38 (QL), le juge Gibson a souscrit, au par. 56, \u00e0 la position adopt\u00e9e par le Tribunal \u00e0 l'audience :\nLe fait que les avocats et les juges accordent une signification particuli\u00e8re au terme frais et \u00e0 l'expression frais d'avocat ne peut servir de fondement \u00e0 l'argument selon lequel l'expression d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es ne comprendrait pas ces frais \u00e0 moins qu'ils ne soient express\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9s par la loi. Partant du principe que les mots utilis\u00e9s par le l\u00e9gislateur doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s selon leur sens habituel \u00e0 moins que le contexte n'en dicte un autre, et consid\u00e9rant que le contexte de l'esp\u00e8ce ne dicte pas un autre sens, j'en conclus que le Tribunal n'a pas commis d'erreur de droit en accordant \u00e0 M. Thwaites les d\u00e9pens raisonnables, y compris les frais de l'expertise actuarielle.\nIl s'agissait du premier d'une s\u00e9rie de quatre arr\u00eats de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en la mati\u00e8re. On ne peut nier le fait qu'il va \u00e0 l'encontre de la common law, qui affirme qu'un organisme cr\u00e9\u00e9 par une loi n'a pas le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens s'il n'existe pas dans la loi une disposition explicite \u00e0 cet effet.\n[48] Ult\u00e9rieurement, dans Swan c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es), [1994] TCDP 15, le Tribunal, se fondant sur la d\u00e9cision Thwaites, a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de payer au plaignant les frais et d\u00e9pens de son avocat qui doivent \u00eatre tax\u00e9s selon les r\u00e8gles de la Cour de la province du Manitoba.\nC. Lambie : La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale statue que le Tribunal n'a pas le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens [49] Le deuxi\u00e8me arr\u00eat de la s\u00e9rie est Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Lambie, [1996] A.C.F. no 1695. Il s'agissait pour la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, en l'occurrence, de d\u00e9terminer si le plaignant avait droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 pour les cong\u00e9s et le temps pris pour \u00e9laborer et pr\u00e9parer sa plainte. La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 instruite par le juge Nadon, celui-l\u00e0 m\u00eame qui avait rendu l'arr\u00eat Big George (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9). Il semble qu'il n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 au courant de l'arr\u00eat Thwaites.\n[50] Dans Lambie, tout comme dans Big George, la Cour invoque \u00e0 nouveau la r\u00e8gle de common law. \u00c0 la fin, le juge Nadon cite le passage du par. 24348 de la d\u00e9cision Morrell c. Canada (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e) o\u00f9 le Tribunal soutient que l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)d) ne vise pas les d\u00e9penses qui d\u00e9coulent des instances introduites en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. La Loi ne renferme aucune disposition donnant express\u00e9ment au Tribunal le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal n'est pas habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire.\nD. Nouvelles d\u00e9cisions : Le Tribunal continue de soutenir qu'il n'a pas le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens [51] La d\u00e9cision Lambie allait dans le sens de la position initialement formul\u00e9e par le Tribunal dans Morrell. Malgr\u00e9 cela, le Tribunal a continu\u00e9 de soutenir dans ses nouvelles d\u00e9cisions que l'article 53 de la Loi lui donnait le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens. J'\u00e9tais l'un des membres instructeurs dans Koeppel c. minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale (1997), D.T. 5\/97, cas o\u00f9 le Tribunal a accord\u00e9 les d\u00e9pens au plaignant en s'inspirant de Grover et de Thwaites. Toutefois, nous ne nous sommes pas pench\u00e9s sur la question de fond et nous n'\u00e9tions pas au courant du jugement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Lambie. Dans Bernard c. Conseil scolaire de Waycobah, [1999] T.C.D.P. 2, le Tribunal a \u00e9galement ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e d'assumer les frais du conseiller juridique de Mme Bernard selon le tarif de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. La question de la comp\u00e9tence n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e.\nE. Green : La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale statue une deuxi\u00e8me fois que le Tribunal n'a pas le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens [52] La question de la comp\u00e9tence a refait surface dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Green, [2000] 4 C.F. 629 (QL). Dans cette affaire, le Tribunal a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante les frais juridiques qu'elle avait engag\u00e9s alors que la plainte \u00e9tait devant la Commission. La plaignante avait apparemment retenu les services d'un avocat afin de faire valoir que la plainte devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal.\n[53] \u00c0 l'instar du juge Nadon dans Lambie, le juge Lemieux ne s'est pas attard\u00e9 longtemps \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e que le Tribunal avait le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens. Aux par. 185 et 186, il affirme ce qui suit :\n[185] Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral cite Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Lambie (1996), 124 F.T.R. 303 (C.F., 1re inst.), o\u00f9 mon coll\u00e8gue le juge Nadon dit \u00e0 la page 315 que la Loi n'accorde pas le pouvoir d'adjuger des frais, bien que le l\u00e9gislateur aurait pu facilement l'accorder.\n[186] Je partage l'avis de mon coll\u00e8gue que si le l\u00e9gislateur avait voulu que le tribunal ait le pouvoir d'octroyer des frais de justice, il l'aurait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9. On peut citer ici l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)d), qui parle d'indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des frais suppl\u00e9mentaires occasionn\u00e9s par le recours \u00e0 d'autres biens, services, installations ou moyens d'h\u00e9bergement. Aucune mention n'est faite des frais juridiques, ce qui indique que le l\u00e9gislateur n'avait pas l'intention d'accorder au tribunal le droit d'ordonner le paiement de tels frais.\nCes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s sont conformes au principe expressio unius. Ils sont \u00e9galement conformes \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle de common law. La Cour a soutenu que le Tribunal n'a le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens que si la Loi l'habilite express\u00e9ment \u00e0 le faire. Les frais engag\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce semblent n\u00e9anmoins \u00eatre vis\u00e9s par l'exception relative aux frais li\u00e9s aux consultations initiales d'un avocat.\nF. Nkwazi : Le Tribunal continue de statuer qu'il a le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens [54] Les arr\u00eats Lambie et Green n'ont pas r\u00e9gl\u00e9 la question. Me Mactavish, devenue pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal, s'est \u00e0 nouveau pench\u00e9e sur cette question dans Nkwazi c. Canada (Service correctionnel), [2001] TCDP 29. Cette affaire est digne de mention en l'esp\u00e8ce, car elle comportait des faits similaires \u00e0 ceux dont je suis saisi. Le probl\u00e8me fondamental \u00e9tait le retrait de la Commission.\n[55] Essentiellement, l'intim\u00e9e a fait valoir que la Commission devrait assumer les d\u00e9pens de la plaignante. Au par. 20, Me Mactavish \u00e9crit :\nSelon l'avocat du SCC, les frais juridiques de Mme Nkwazi r\u00e9sultent enti\u00e8rement de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne de se retirer de l'affaire. Cette d\u00e9cision de la Commission constitue un novus actus interveniens qui rompt le lien de causalit\u00e9 entre les actes discriminatoires dont Mme Nkwazi a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet et sa d\u00e9cision de retenir les services de son propre avocat.\nCette th\u00e9orie est fond\u00e9e sur la common law. Cependant, elle s'applique plus particuli\u00e8rement aux dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qu'aux d\u00e9pens.\n[56] Me Mactavish signale, du moins implicitement, que l'arr\u00eat Green est peut-\u00eatre fond\u00e9 sur une mauvaise interpr\u00e9tation de l'arr\u00eat Lambie, qui portait sur le pouvoir du Tribunal d'accorder au plaignant une indemnit\u00e9 pour les cong\u00e9s et le temps pris pour \u00e9laborer et pr\u00e9parer sa plainte. Au par. 12, elle suit, par cons\u00e9quent, la tendance du juge Gibson dans Thwaites.\nJe ne souscris pas \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention du SCC voulant qu'il faille donner au mot d\u00e9penses un sens restreint, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle ejusdem generis qui s'applique \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation des lois. Je souscris \u00e0 l'opinion du juge Gibson, \u00e0 savoir que les termes d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es, dans leur sens courant, incluent les frais juridiques, et que le contexte dans lequel ces termes utilis\u00e9s \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) ne donne aucunement \u00e0 croire qu'on devrait les interpr\u00e9ter diff\u00e9remment.\nIl est \u00e9vident que je me trouve dans une position diff\u00e9rente. Si la r\u00e8gle de common law s'applique, on ne peut gu\u00e8re douter \u00e0 mon avis que les affaires Morrell, Lambie et Green ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es correctement. Les principes ejusdem generis et expressio unius s'appliquent.\n[57] Toutefois, dans Nkwazi, le Tribunal s'appuie \u00e9galement sur le principe de la restitution int\u00e9grale. Au par. 17, Me Mactavish \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n... l'interpr\u00e9tation que le juge Gibson donne au mot d\u00e9penses dans Thwaites est conforme au principe qui r\u00e9git les ordonnances en mati\u00e8re de redressement rendues en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Lorsqu'il juge que la plainte est fond\u00e9e, le Tribunal doit, sous r\u00e9serve des principes de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 des dommages et de l'att\u00e9nuation des pertes, tenter, dans la mesure du possible, de remettre la victime dans la position o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9, n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire. On pourrait difficilement affirmer que la victime a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d'un tel redressement si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de r\u00e9clamer le remboursement des frais juridiques li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audition de sa plainte.\nCette position est conforme au raisonnement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Banca Nazionale (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9).\n[58] Dans Nkwazi, le Tribunal exprime aussi l'avis que la d\u00e9cision de ne pas adjuger les d\u00e9pens dans les cas o\u00f9 la Commission ne compara\u00eet pas aurait essentiellement pour effet de priver les plaignants du droit de saisir le Tribunal d'une plainte. Au par. 15, Me Mactavish soutient ce qui suit :\n\u00c0 mon avis, si je donnais au mot frais un sens aussi \u00e9troit que celui que le juge Lemieux y a pr\u00eat\u00e9 dans Green, privant ainsi les victimes d'un acte discriminatoire du droit de recouvrer les frais juridiques raisonnables li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audition de la plainte, j'irais \u00e0 l'encontre du principe qui sous-tend la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, soit celui de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Dans la pratique, une telle interpr\u00e9tation aurait in\u00e9vitablement pour effet d'annuler les droits quasi constitutionnels garantis par la Loi dans les cas o\u00f9 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne se retire d'une audience : les plaignants de condition modeste comme Beryl Nkwazi ne pourraient tout simplement pas poursuivre les proc\u00e9dures.\nCela soul\u00e8ve de plus vastes consid\u00e9rations de principe.\nG. Premakumar et Milano : Le Tribunal s'inspire de la d\u00e9cision Nkwazi [59] Dans Premakumar c. Air Canada 2002 TCDP 04\/26, Me Mactavish s'inspire de la d\u00e9cision Nkwazi. Elle fait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au principe de la restitution int\u00e9grale. Au par. 31, elle affirme ce qui suit :\n[31] Lorsque le Tribunal estime qu'une plainte est bien fond\u00e9e, il lui revient alors d'essayer, autant que faire se peut, d'indemniser la victime d'un acte discriminatoire de fa\u00e7on int\u00e9grale, sous r\u00e9serve de l'application des principes de pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9, de faiblesse du lien causal et de limitation du pr\u00e9judice subi. En vertu des dispositions de l'alin\u00e9a c) du paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, le Tribunal peut ordonner d'indemniser la victime des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire en cause.\nL'argument est simple : refuser le remboursement de ses frais juridiques raisonnables serait lui rendre une victoire devant le Tribunal, certes, mais combien co\u00fbteuse.\n[60] Suivant le m\u00eame th\u00e9orie, Me Mactavish a aussi accord\u00e9 des frais juridiques raisonnables dans Milano c. Triple K Transport 2003 TCDP 30.\nH. Stevenson : La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s'aligne sur la d\u00e9cision Nkwazi [61] La question est revenue sur le tapis dans Stevenson c. Canada (Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9) [2003] 2003 FCT 341. Le juge Rouleau s'est attard\u00e9 aux deux \u00e9coles de pens\u00e9e. \u00c0 l'instar de Me Mactavish, qui a r\u00e9cemment \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e juge \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, il soutient que l'arr\u00eat Lambie limite simplement \u00e0 des cas exceptionnels la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal en mati\u00e8re d'attribution des d\u00e9pens. La difficult\u00e9 que je vois dans cette prise de position r\u00e9side dans l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 simple figurant au par. 42 de l'arr\u00eat Lambie : Le l\u00e9gislateur aurait pu facilement accorder dans la Loi le pouvoir d'adjuger des frais, mais il ne l'a pas fait. Il s'agit peut-\u00eatre d'une opinion incidente.\n[62] Chose plus importante, le juge Rouleau fait ensuite sienne la position \u00e9nonc\u00e9e par le juge Gibson dans Thwaites, puis par Me Mactavish dans Nkwazi. Je ne suis pas convaincu que la question soit compl\u00e8tement r\u00e9solue. D'une part, les frais juridiques accord\u00e9s dans Stevenson correspondaient aux frais li\u00e9s au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte et aux expos\u00e9s pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la Commission. Ce point ressort clairement de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal - [2001] D.C.D.P. no 40 - dans laquelle le membre instructeur affirme, au par. 108, ce qui suit :\nJe suis convaincu... que le plaignant avait le droit de consulter un avocat relativement \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 de porter plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et que l'aide juridique dont il a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 pour la pr\u00e9paration des expos\u00e9s soumis \u00e0 la Commission \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire. Ces d\u00e9penses \u00e9taient un r\u00e9sultat raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible de l'acte discriminatoire.\nLe membre instructeur n'aborde pas dans sa d\u00e9cision la question du recouvrement des frais engag\u00e9s dans le cours de l'audience.\n[63] Par cons\u00e9quent, l'adjudication des d\u00e9pens dans Stevenson s'inscrit plus particuli\u00e8rement dans le cadre de l'exception reconnue dans la jurisprudence en ce qui touche les frais li\u00e9s aux consultations initiales d'un avocat. Ainsi, au par. 25, le juge Rouleau d\u00e9clare :\nLes expressions frais juridiques ou frais d'avocat ne sont pas express\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9es dans les alin\u00e9as 53(2)c) ou d), mais cela ne veut pas dire que l'expression d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire exclut les frais juridiques engag\u00e9s par un plaignant \u00e0 l'occasion du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte de discrimination. Dans un cas comme celui-ci, o\u00f9 le plaignant consulte un avocat sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de sa plainte, des d\u00e9penses de cette nature sont parfaitement justifiables. (L'italique est de moi.)\nAu par. 26, il ajoute ce qui suit :\nPar cons\u00e9quent, les frais d'avocat ou autres frais juridiques entra\u00een\u00e9s par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte de discrimination constituent des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire, au sens de la loi, et le tribunal a donc exerc\u00e9 validement son pouvoir lorsqu'il a accord\u00e9 des frais juridiques au d\u00e9fendeur. (L'italique est de moi.)\nIl semble que ce type de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats soit \u00e0 juste titre vis\u00e9 par l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)d) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Le probl\u00e8me historique des d\u00e9pens intervient plus tard dans le processus et concerne les frais engag\u00e9s par le plaignant pour plaider sa cause.\n[64] Dans Boudreault c. Great Circle Marine Services, 2004 TCDP 21, le Tribunal s'aligne n\u00e9anmoins sur les d\u00e9cisions Stevenson et Nkwazi. Le membre instructeur, Me Doyon, accorde au plaignant des frais juridiques totalisant 6 000 $.\nI. La question pos\u00e9e dans Nkwazi [65] Les d\u00e9cisions Nkwazi et Stevenson ainsi que certaines autres soul\u00e8vent une question \u00e9vidente. Si le Tribunal a un certain pouvoir en mati\u00e8re d'adjudication des d\u00e9pens, pourquoi la Loi n'en fait-elle pas mention? \u00c0 mon avis, la r\u00e9ponse r\u00e9side dans le r\u00f4le de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, qui a \u00e9volu\u00e9 au fil des ann\u00e9es. La Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e il y a presque 20 ans - en 1985. \u00c0 mon avis, ni le l\u00e9gislateur ni la Commission ni aucune des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es n'a pr\u00e9vu la situation actuelle.\n[66] Au d\u00e9but, on tenait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pour acquis que la Commission participerait aux audiences du Tribunal. Je suis enclin \u00e0 penser que le l\u00e9gislateur pensait de m\u00eame lorsqu'il a adopt\u00e9 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Dans la pratique, la Commission prendrait \u00e0 sa charge les frais engag\u00e9s par le plaignant pour d\u00e9fendre sa cause. Il n'\u00e9tait point n\u00e9cessaire que le l\u00e9gislateur aborde express\u00e9ment la question des d\u00e9pens du plaignant. N\u00e9anmoins, la Loi s'articule d'abord et avant tout autour de l'id\u00e9e que, dans le cas o\u00f9 elle aurait gain de cause, la partie plaignante b\u00e9n\u00e9ficierait des indemnit\u00e9s auxquelles elle aurait droit sans que celles-ci ne soient contrebalanc\u00e9es par les frais juridiques.\n[67] La jurisprudence plus r\u00e9cente tient compte du fait que la Commission a r\u00e9vis\u00e9 sa position. Ainsi, au paragraphe 28 de la d\u00e9cision Premakumar, Me Mactavish \u00e9tablit une distinction entre le r\u00f4le de l'avocat de la Commission et celui de l'avocat du plaignant. Elle affirme ensuite ce qui suit :\n[29] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ma conclusion quant aux r\u00f4les respectifs incombant \u00e0 la Commission et au plaignant, j'ai de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 concilier le raisonnement du Tribunal adopt\u00e9 dans les dossiers Potapczyk et Pond. Dans ces deux affaires, les plaignants qui avaient par ailleurs eu gain de cause, se sont vu refuser le remboursement de leurs frais juridiques en l'absence de conflit entre la position adopt\u00e9e par la la Commission et celle de la plaignante. Dans l'affaire Potapczyk, tout en soulignant l'obligation incombant \u00e0 la Commission de faire valoir l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public, le Tribunal a affirm\u00e9 que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne [TRADUCTION] ... permet \u00e0 une personne qui d\u00e9pose une plainte de faire instruire cette plainte par un avocat comp\u00e9tent repr\u00e9sentant la Commission et ce, sans avoir \u00e0 en assumer personnellement les frais. Par la suite, dans l'affaire Pond, le Tribunal a repris ce commentaire en refusant d'ordonner le remboursement des frais juridiques engag\u00e9s par Mme Pond.\nCe sont des remarques r\u00e9v\u00e9latrices.\n[68] Je ne suis pas tout \u00e0 fait \u00e0 l'aise avec cette distinction entre les r\u00f4les des avocats. Il me semble que toute plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne comporte un \u00e9l\u00e9ment d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public, qui conf\u00e8re d'ailleurs \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation sa force particuli\u00e8re. Il ne s'agit pas l\u00e0 toutefois de l'objet du d\u00e9bat. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, la Commission ne compara\u00eet plus de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re devant le Tribunal, avec le r\u00e9sultat que, dans la plupart des cas, le fardeau incombe \u00e0 la partie plaignante plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 la Commission. Je souscris \u00e0 l'opinion de Me Mactavish voulant que le raisonnement suivi dans des affaires comme Potapcyzyk et Pond ne convienne plus.\n[69] Les changements survenus dans le d\u00e9roulement pratique des audiences du Tribunal font en sorte que la question des d\u00e9pens rev\u00eat une importance plus grande que par le pass\u00e9. Ils expliquent \u00e9galement pourquoi la Loi n'aborde pas une question aussi cruciale. Le raisonnement ant\u00e9rieur peut toujours s'appliquer dans les cas o\u00f9 la Commission compara\u00eet devant le Tribunal.\nVII. LA QUESTION EN LITIGE A. Le Tribunal n'a pas, en vertu de la common law, le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens [70] La question que posent les parties est la suivante : le Tribunal a-t-il le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens? \u00c0 mon avis, il y a deux r\u00e9ponses diff\u00e9rentes \u00e0 cette question. La premi\u00e8re est que le Tribunal ne jouit pas, en vertu de la common law, du pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens. Il ne sert pas \u00e0 grand-chose de pr\u00e9tendre que la Loi devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on lib\u00e9rale ou de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 favoriser les plaignants. La Loi ne fait pas mention du pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens. La question est tout simplement pass\u00e9e sous silence. Je souscris donc \u00e0 ce que dit la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Lambie et Green. Si le l\u00e9gislateur avait eu l'intention de donner au Tribunal le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens, il l'aurait fait conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles et conventions applicables.\nB. Le Tribunal a n\u00e9anmoins le pouvoir de prot\u00e9ger la viabilit\u00e9 des redressements pr\u00e9vus par la Loi [71] Le Tribunal a n\u00e9anmoins le pouvoir de se prononcer au sujet des mesures de redressement pr\u00e9vues par la Loi. Cette responsabilit\u00e9 est assortie de certains pouvoirs qui traduisent le caract\u00e8re r\u00e9parateur de la Loi et la nature fondamentale des droits de la personne. \u00c0 mon avis, la Loi conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir dont il a besoin pour prot\u00e9ger la viabilit\u00e9 et l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 des redressements pr\u00e9vus par la Loi.\n[72] Le m\u00eame genre de probl\u00e8me se pose dans d'autres contextes. Dans Day c. MDN, no 4, 2002\/12\/18, j'ai indiqu\u00e9 au paragraphe 20 qu'il fallait, pour jeter les fondements juridiques de certains aspects de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal, plus que la doctrine des pouvoirs n\u00e9cessaires mais moins que la doctrine de la comp\u00e9tence inh\u00e9rente.\n[73] \u00c0 mon avis, les arguments de l'intim\u00e9e au sujet de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal ont beaucoup de m\u00e9rite. Si je dis cela, c'est parce que, \u00e0 mon avis, le Tribunal tire davantage sa comp\u00e9tence de son mandat aux termes de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne que du libell\u00e9 de celle-ci \u00e0 proprement parler. Il s'agit d'un mandat vaste et quasi constitutionnel ax\u00e9 sur le redressement. \u00c0 mon avis, le Tribunal jouit de tous les pouvoirs subsidiaires qui sont n\u00e9cessaires pour remplir le r\u00f4le qui lui est d\u00e9volu conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation.\nJ'estime que ce genre de raisonnement implicite ou pratique est suffisant pour doter le Tribunal du pouvoir n\u00e9cessaire de prot\u00e9ger la viabilit\u00e9 des redressements pr\u00e9vus par la Loi.\n[74] La source de ces pouvoirs r\u00e9side dans les dispositions de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Le Tribunal demeure un organisme cr\u00e9\u00e9 par une loi qui ne poss\u00e8de que les pouvoirs que celle-ci lui conf\u00e8re. On peut m\u00eame dire que ces pouvoirs doivent \u00eatre explicites, comme le veut la common law. Cependant, l'arr\u00eat Banca Nazionale r\u00e9sout ces pr\u00e9occupations, et je pense que l'intention expresse d'indemniser compl\u00e8tement le plaignant qui a gain de cause est suffisante. On constate cette intention dans les dispositions de la Loi qui traitent des redressements individuels.\n[75] Le paragraphe pertinent se lit comme suit :\n53(2) \u00c0 l'issue de l'instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut, sous r\u00e9serve de l'article 54, ordonner, selon les circonstances, \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d'un acte discriminatoire :\nDans la version anglaise, le mot include pourrait laisser croire que le Tribunal poss\u00e8de des pouvoirs suppl\u00e9mentaires; toutefois, la version fran\u00e7aise laisse croire que l'\u00e9num\u00e9ration est restreinte. Il est ensuite pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le Tribunal peut ordonner :\nb) d'accorder \u00e0 la victime, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les droits, chances ou avantages dont l'acte l'a priv\u00e9e;\nc) d'indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire ou des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte;\nd) d'indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des frais suppl\u00e9mentaires occasionn\u00e9s par le recours \u00e0 d'autres biens, services, installations ou moyens d'h\u00e9bergement, et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte...\nJe crois que c'est l'effet cumulatif de ces dispositions qui est important. Le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'ordonner que l'auteur de l'acte discriminatoire accorde \u00e0 la victime les droits, chances ou avantages dont l'acte l'a priv\u00e9e; qu'il l'indemnise de ses pertes de salaire et des d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es au salaire; qu'il l'indemnise des frais occasionn\u00e9s par le recours \u00e0 d'autres biens, services, installations ou moyens d'h\u00e9bergement, et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte. Il n'est point n\u00e9cessaire d'analyser le sens pr\u00e9cis des diff\u00e9rentes dispositions. L'intention g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est de donner au Tribunal le pouvoir de d\u00e9dommager la victime de toute perte r\u00e9sultant de l'acte discriminatoire. L'intention du l\u00e9gislateur est d'assurer une indemnisation int\u00e9grale.\n[76] La jurisprudence dans le domaine milite en faveur d'une telle interpr\u00e9tation. La v\u00e9ritable question dans ce contexte consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si l'adjudication des d\u00e9pens est un pouvoir explicite du Tribunal. Autrement dit, il s'agit de d\u00e9terminer si la non-adjudication des d\u00e9pens par le Tribunal brimerait le droit \u00e0 la restitution du plaignant qui a gain de cause. \u00c0 mon avis, la r\u00e9ponse est simple. Les frais juridiques dans un cas comme celui qui nous occupe pourraient facilement \u00eatre sup\u00e9rieurs aux dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats accord\u00e9s \u00e0 la partie plaignante. Par ailleurs, comme l'a soulign\u00e9 Me Mactavish dans Nkwazi, il existe \u00e9galement des cas o\u00f9 la partie plaignante ne re\u00e7oit pas d'indemnit\u00e9 mon\u00e9taire.\n[77] J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit que le Tribunal n'est pas express\u00e9ment habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 adjuger les d\u00e9pens. Il a cependant le pouvoir de pr\u00e9server la viabilit\u00e9 de son processus. Cette responsabilit\u00e9 implique qu'il a le pouvoir d'ordonner le remboursement de d\u00e9pens afin de pr\u00e9server les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats auxquels la partie plaignante a droit. Le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est que le plaignant a droit \u00e0 ce que les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats soient pr\u00e9serv\u00e9s dans une large mesure, sans quoi il n'y aurait pas de restitution int\u00e9grale.\n[78] Il s'agit d'un pouvoir r\u00e9siduel en vertu duquel le Tribunal est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9server l'utilit\u00e9 des redressements pr\u00e9vus par la Loi. Le principe de la restitution int\u00e9grale comporte des limites. Il s'applique aux dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, et non aux d\u00e9pens, et ne donne pas au plaignant qui a gain de cause le droit de r\u00e9clamer un remboursement int\u00e9gral de ses frais juridiques. Il s'ensuit que tous les d\u00e9pens, y compris le co\u00fbt des rapports d'expert et les autres d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es au d\u00e9roulement de l'audience, sont assujettis aux r\u00e8gles normales de taxation.\n[79] Il est important de reconna\u00eetre que la Loi a notamment pour objet de soumettre la question de la discrimination \u00e0 l'examen du public. Dans cette optique, il faut que les victimes d\u00e9posent des plaintes de discrimination. Le Tribunal ne devrait pas interpr\u00e9ter la Loi de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 d\u00e9courager les personnes ayant une plainte l\u00e9gitime de chercher \u00e0 obtenir r\u00e9paration.\n[80] Il est \u00e9vident que cette affaire et d'autres sont susceptibles de sensibiliser le l\u00e9gislateur au fait que la pr\u00e9sente Loi m\u00e9rite son attention. Il ne semble pas tout \u00e0 fait juste, par exemple, de restreindre l'octroi de d\u00e9pens au plaignant qui a gain de cause. Toutefois, en l'esp\u00e8ce, il s'agit strictement de d\u00e9terminer si on devrait tol\u00e9rer qu'on aille \u00e0 l'encontre du but manifeste de la Loi parce que celle-ci ne traite pas express\u00e9ment de la question des d\u00e9pens - alors qu'il n'y a aucune v\u00e9ritable raison de le faire. La r\u00e9ponse est simple.\nC. Le plaignant a droit \u00e0 un redressement utile [81] Le probl\u00e8me comporte une autre facette. L'adoption de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne est attribuable en grande partie \u00e0 des initiatives internationales telles que la Charte des Nations Unies et la D\u00e9claration universelle des droits de l'homme. Il y a des obligations internationales dans le domaine. Le droit des droits de la personne est fondamental. Par ailleurs, l'interdiction de discrimination pr\u00e9vue par l'article 15 de la Charte canadienne des droits fait en sorte que les dispositions parall\u00e8les de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par la Constitution.\n[82] Il serait d\u00e9plorable que les dispositions de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne fassent \u00e9chec aux redressements qu'elle pr\u00e9voit. La plaignante m'a donn\u00e9 une copie d'un document d'information r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par Joanna Birenbaum et Bruce Porter (qu'on peut, semble-t-il, consulter sur le site Web du minist\u00e8re de la Justice) qui traite du droit de compara\u00eetre devant le tribunal en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Les auteurs de ce document ne traitent pas, \u00e0 proprement parler, de la question des d\u00e9pens. Toutefois, on y trouve le passage suivant :\n[TRADUCTION] Le d\u00e9ni du droit de compara\u00eetre devant le tribunal des droits de la personne va nettement \u00e0 l'encontre du droit international et particuli\u00e8rement de l'article 2 du Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques (PIRDCP) qui garantit que toute personne dont les droits et libert\u00e9s... auront \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9s disposera d'un recours utile et que l'autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente, judiciaire, administrative ou l\u00e9gislative... statuera sur les droits de la personne qui forme le recours.\nDans ce m\u00eame document, les auteurs pr\u00e9cisent que les articles 7 et 15 de la Charte des droits garantissent les m\u00eames droits.\n[83] Voil\u00e0 qui soul\u00e8ve des questions de principe importantes. On a toujours dit que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne avait un objectif r\u00e9parateur. Cet objectif doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9. Le Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques est particuli\u00e8rement \u00e9loquent \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, car il exige que les \u00c9tats parties au Pacte offrent des recours utiles aux personnes dont les droits ont \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9s. Le cas qui nous occupe porte sur l'\u00e9tat matrimonial et la situation de famille. \u00c0 mon avis, l'article 23 du Pacte reconna\u00eet l'importance particuli\u00e8re d'une telle situation, qui est vis\u00e9e, du moins implicitement, par l'interdiction de discrimination \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l'article 26.\n[84] Le droit \u00e0 un recours utile est par ailleurs un \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui fait partie int\u00e9grante de notre propre droit. Je ne puis dire s'il s'agit d'un \u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u00e9coulant de l'equity. Un recours utile est n\u00e9anmoins un recours v\u00e9ritable et concret qui n'est pas entrav\u00e9 par les circonstances qui existent en dehors du champ d'application imm\u00e9diat du processus. \u00c0 mon avis, le Tribunal a le pouvoir, voire l'obligation, de veiller \u00e0 ce que les recours pr\u00e9vus par une loi comme la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne soient pas entrav\u00e9s par des facteurs externes tels que les co\u00fbts aff\u00e9rents \u00e0 l'audience. Cela irait \u00e0 l'encontre de l'objet du litige, de l'intention sous-jacente \u00e0 la Loi et du droit fondamental des droits de la personne.\nVIII. QUESTIONS supPL\u00c9MENTAIRES A. Un repr\u00e9sentant non juriste peut-il compara\u00eetre devant le Tribunal? [85] Bien qu'il ne soit pas avocat, M. Finding a repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la plaignante au cours de l'audience. L'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait au courant de la chose, mais ne s'est pas oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 sa participation \u00e0 l'audience. N\u00e9anmoins, l'intim\u00e9e a fait valoir dans sa plaidoirie finale qu'il n'avait pas le droit de repr\u00e9senter la plaignante. Il a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu qu'il avait contrevenu \u00e0 la Legal Profession Act, R.S.B.C. 198, ch. 9, ce faisant.\n[86] La version fran\u00e7aise du par. 50(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9cise que le Tribunal doit donner aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations. La version anglaise de ce m\u00eame paragraphe indique que le Tribunal doit donner aux parties a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations.\n[87] Dans la version fran\u00e7aise, le mot avocat donne \u00e0 entendre que seul un avocat peut agir comme counsel. Malgr\u00e9 cela, dans une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente - Beaudet-Fortin c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des Postes, [2004] TCDP 23, le membre instructeur pr\u00e9cise que le Tribunal a habituellement permis \u00e0 des repr\u00e9sentants non juristes de compara\u00eetre. La question n'a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive et devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9solue dans une affaire o\u00f9 il existe une question importante.\n[88] L'intim\u00e9e m'a saisi d'un certain nombre de causes traitant des services de repr\u00e9sentants non juristes. On semble s'inqui\u00e9ter de ce que ces repr\u00e9sentants exercent le droit et contreviennent ainsi \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation provinciale r\u00e9gissant l'exercice de la profession. Je partage cette pr\u00e9occupation. Cependant, il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable d'aborder cette question lors d'une audience o\u00f9 celle-ci sera d\u00fbment soulev\u00e9e d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but.\nB. Les honoraires d'un repr\u00e9sentant non juriste sont-ils recouvrables? [89] La question plus imm\u00e9diate concerne le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens. Si le Tribunal jouit d'un tel pouvoir, soutient l'intim\u00e9e, il devrait se limiter aux honoraires d'avocats. \u00c0 son avis, la Loi ne renferme aucune disposition permettant d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens aff\u00e9rents aux honoraires d'un non-juriste.\n[90] Le conseiller de la plaignante a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il n'y a aucune raison de distinguer les repr\u00e9sentants qui sont des avocats de ceux qui n'en sont pas. Dans Graham (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e), par exemple, le Conseil des relations de travail reconna\u00eet que les honoraires de repr\u00e9sentants non juristes devraient \u00eatre recouvrables. Au par. 49, le Conseil affirme ce qui suit : [TRADUCTION] Peu importe la forme de repr\u00e9sentation choisie, l'adjudication des d\u00e9pens par le Conseil vise \u00e0 assurer au plaignant qui a gain de cause une pleine indemnisation des frais et d\u00e9pens raisonnablement engag\u00e9s. Il ne s'agit pas d'une v\u00e9ritable indemnit\u00e9, mais l'argument demeure valable. Au par. 50, le Conseil cite Orkin, The Law of Costs, 2e \u00e9d., p. 3-37 (par. 311), o\u00f9 sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s divers facteurs qui constituent un guide sommaire pour les d\u00e9pens procureur-client. Le conseiller de la plaignante propose que le Tribunal adopte la m\u00eame approche.\nC. Renonciation [91] Cependant, la v\u00e9ritable question est toute autre. Le conseil de la plaignante a fait valoir que l'intim\u00e9e avait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 tout droit de contester les honoraires de M. Finding. Apr\u00e8s tout, l'intim\u00e9e savait au d\u00e9part que M. Finding n'\u00e9tait pas avocat. Le conseil savait qu'il demandait des honoraires en \u00e9change de ses services. S'il voulait contester la question, il aurait d\u00fb le faire au d\u00e9but de l'audience.\n[92] L'intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9 en citant Saskatchewan River Bungalows Ltd. c. Maritime, Compagnie d'assurance-vie [1994] 2 R.C.S. 400, [1994] A.C.S. no 59 (QL), aux par. 19 et 20, \u00e0 l'appui de sa pr\u00e9tention voulant que la doctrine de la renonciation doive \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e9troite. Au par. 20, la Cour supr\u00eame affirme :\nOn ne conclura donc \u00e0 la renonciation que si la preuve d\u00e9montre que la partie qui renonce avait (1) parfaitement connaissance des droits en cause et (2) l'intention claire et consciente d'y renoncer.\nUne raison milite en faveur d'un langage aussi ferme :\nLe recours \u00e0 un crit\u00e8re aussi strict est justifi\u00e9 vu l'absence de contrepartie de la part de la partie en faveur de laquelle joue la renonciation.\nIl s'ensuit que la renonciation doit \u00eatre explicite.\n[93] L'intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9tendu qu'elle avait peut-\u00eatre renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 toute objection au recours \u00e0 un repr\u00e9sentant non juriste. Cependant, elle n'a pas pris position sur la question des honoraires. Cette affirmation est assez vraie. Rien n'indique qu'elle avait consciemment l'intention de renoncer \u00e0 son droit de contester la question des d\u00e9pens. Toutefois, la plaignante est d'avis que cela ne r\u00e9sout pas pour autant la question, qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e par la GRC plus t\u00f4t.\n[94] \u00c0 mon avis, l'intim\u00e9e a donn\u00e9 son consentement. La d\u00e9cision de ne pas s'opposer \u00e0 la participation de M. Finding \u00e0 l'audience constitue selon moi une renonciation qui s'applique \u00e0 la totalit\u00e9 de l'instance. Il est trop tard pour parler de retrait. L'intim\u00e9e ne peut pas non plus renoncer d'une mani\u00e8re fragment\u00e9e. Je ne vois pas comment elle peut dire qu'elle a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son droit de contester la question \u00e0 certains \u00e9gards et non \u00e0 d'autres. Rien dans le dossier n'\u00e9taye une telle prise de position.\n[95] Je ne vois aucune raison emp\u00eachant l'intim\u00e9e d'assortir sa renonciation initiale de conditions. Cependant, ces conditions doivent \u00eatre explicites et prospectives. Elles ne peuvent \u00eatre fix\u00e9es apr\u00e8s coup. Selon la jurisprudence, une renonciation doit \u00eatre explicite. Le m\u00eame principe s'applique aux modalit\u00e9s. Cependant, si une partie entend ajouter des exceptions et des conditions \u00e0 sa renonciation, celles-ci doivent \u00eatre explicites. L'intim\u00e9e doit donc assumer la responsabilit\u00e9 de son omission \u00e0 clarifier la question en l'esp\u00e8ce. Il s'ensuit que l'intim\u00e9e ne peut invoquer le fait que M. Finding ne soit pas membre de la profession pour emp\u00eacher la plaignante de recouvrer ses d\u00e9pens.\nIX. D\u00c9CISION [96] Pour tous les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-dessus, je rends la d\u00e9cision suivante :\n1. Alin\u00e9a 53(2)c)\n[97] Aucune question de comp\u00e9tence ne se pose en ce qui concerne les frais juridiques qui peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats ou une indemnit\u00e9. Les frais li\u00e9s aux consultations initiales visant \u00e0 obtenir des conseils juridiques peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte aux termes de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c). Il serait inadmissible de nier le r\u00e9flexe juridique naturel de la plaignante de demander l'avis d'un avocat.\n[98] Par cons\u00e9quent, la plaignante a droit de recouvrer les frais li\u00e9s aux consultations initiales d'un avocat. \u00c0 mon avis, ce droit s'\u00e9tend aux discussions pr\u00e9liminaires avec l'autre partie pour d\u00e9terminer s'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9poser une plainte.\n2. D\u00e9pens\n[99] Je suis convaincu que le Tribunal a le pouvoir r\u00e9siduel d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens afin de pr\u00e9server l'indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e \u00e0 un plaignant qui a gain de cause. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plaignante en l'esp\u00e8ce a droit au remboursement de ses frais raisonnables. L'intim\u00e9e a n\u00e9anmoins soulev\u00e9 une question l\u00e9gitime qui touche la question de comp\u00e9tence dont je suis saisi. Dans les circonstances, chaque partie assumera les frais qu'elle a engag\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n[100] Comme le Tribunal est sous la surveillance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, il est logique de se fonder sur les R\u00e8gles de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pour trancher cette question.

CONCLUSION\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Le plaignant, M. Ronald J. Howell, s'est enr\u00f4l\u00e9 dans les Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes (FAC) le 9 septembre 1983. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, il avait une vingtaine d'ann\u00e9es et il d\u00e9tenait une 11e ann\u00e9e. N\u00e9 le 15 d\u00e9cembre 1962, M. Howell est actuellement \u00e2g\u00e9 de 42 ans.\n[2] Apr\u00e8s avoir termin\u00e9 sa formation de base, M. Howell a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 la Base des Forces canadiennes (BFC) Winnipeg. Il a commenc\u00e9 sa formation sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e en f\u00e9vrier 1984 \u00e0 la BFC Borden, en Ontario. C'est \u00e0 cet endroit qu'il a suivi sa formation de base comme chauffeur. Il a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Toronto. Au d\u00e9but, il occupait le rang de soldat.\n[3] En septembre 1985, M. Howell est devenu membre r\u00e9gulier des FAC. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 une unit\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 la BFC Petawawa o\u00f9 il est demeur\u00e9 de 1985 \u00e0 1993. Au cours de son s\u00e9jour \u00e0 Petawawa, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 promu au rang de caporal. En 1987, il a suivi avec succ\u00e8s la formation de technicien de v\u00e9hicule.\n[4] M. Howell a obtenu des appr\u00e9ciations de rendement favorables jusqu'\u00e0 sa lib\u00e9ration.\n[5] Malheureusement, au cours de sa carri\u00e8re dans les FAC, M. Howell a subi une s\u00e9rie d'interventions chirurgicales au genou.\nII. PLAINTE DE DISCRIMINATION - INCIDENT CONCERNANT LE DRILL [6] M. Howell all\u00e8gue que ses sup\u00e9rieurs ont aggrav\u00e9 les probl\u00e8mes qu'il \u00e9prouvait avec son genou droit en l'obligeant \u00e0 prendre part \u00e0 un drill de peloton, le 23 mars 1995, sans son support pour le genou (l' incident concernant le drill ). Il pr\u00e9tend que, si les FAC avaient acquiesc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque \u00e0 sa demande d'aller chercher son support ou de se rendre \u00e0 l'infirmerie afin qu'il puisse \u00eatre excus\u00e9 des exercices de drill, son genou droit ne se serait pas d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9 \u00e0 un point tel qu'il a d\u00fb \u00eatre lib\u00e9r\u00e9. Enfin, il all\u00e8gue que, n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de l'incident concernant le drill, il ferait encore partie des FAC aujourd'hui.\nIII. FAITS A. Blessures au genou ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 l'incident concernant le drill [7] M. Howell a des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents longs et complexes de blessures et d'interventions chirurgicales au genou droit. Ces ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents sont d\u00e9crits dans le rapport du Dr Randall en date du 9 d\u00e9cembre 20031 ainsi que dans les annexes \u00e0 ce rapport et dans son dossier m\u00e9dical complet qui se trouve dans les volumes 1 \u00e0 42. Il suffit de dire que les blessures de M. Howell au genou droit ont d\u00e9but\u00e9 vers janvier 1982, alors qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00eal\u00e9 \u00e0 un grave accident de voiture. D\u00e8s mai 1984, M. Howell se plaignait de douleurs \u00e0 son genou droit, particuli\u00e8rement lorsqu'il s'adonnait \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s comme la course ou lorsqu'il faisait du sport. Il se plaignait \u00e9galement que son genou droit bloquait parfois le matin. En septembre 1989, il a subi une grave blessure, se faisant une entorse au genou droit en sautant sur une roche lors d'un concours d'athl\u00e9tisme - la Comp\u00e9tition de l'Ironman . Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 hospitalis\u00e9 et a re\u00e7u des soins \u00e0 la suite de cette grave blessure au ligament crois\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur du genou droit. C'est \u00e0 ce moment que ses probl\u00e8mes avec son genou droit ont commenc\u00e9.\n[8] En 1990, il a gliss\u00e9 en donnant un coup de pied sur un pneu et s'est \u00e0 nouveau bless\u00e9 au genou droit. Le 21 mai 1991, il a subi sa premi\u00e8re intervention de reconstruction du ligament crois\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur.\n[9] \u00c0 la suite de cette intervention, M. Howell s'est vu prescrire le port d'un support de deuxi\u00e8me g\u00e9n\u00e9ration, qu'il s'est procur\u00e9 vers novembre 1993.\n[10] Vers mai 1992, il s'est \u00e0 nouveau bless\u00e9 alors qu'il prenait part \u00e0 un d\u00e9fil\u00e9 militaire, se luxant le genou droit. En ao\u00fbt 1992, il a subi une deuxi\u00e8me intervention - une arthroscopie de ce m\u00eame genou.\n[11] Le 1er juin 1993, M. Howell a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 la BFC Shilo et promu caporal-chef int\u00e9rimaire. Afin d'obtenir sa promotion au grade de caporal-chef, il devait suivre le cours de chef subalterne. Ce cours visait \u00e0 inculquer aux sous-officiers des comp\u00e9tences en leadership. Peu apr\u00e8s son affectation \u00e0 Shilo, il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9prouver des probl\u00e8mes en ex\u00e9cutant des manuvres de drill. Le 16 juin 1993, il a consult\u00e9 un m\u00e9decin apr\u00e8s avoir ressenti de la douleur \u00e0 la suite d'exercices de drill. Le m\u00e9decin lui a alors conseill\u00e9 d'utiliser des b\u00e9quilles, de mettre de la glace sur son genou, de porter un support et de sur\u00e9lever son genou pendant un certain temps pour att\u00e9nuer les sympt\u00f4mes.\n[12] En janvier 1994, M. Howell a dit \u00e9prouver des douleurs lorsqu'il marchait, et particuli\u00e8rement lorsqu'il courait. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dirig\u00e9 vers un m\u00e9decin pour d\u00e9terminer s'il \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 suivre le cours de chef subalterne, qui comportait beaucoup d'activit\u00e9s physiques. Les FAC l'ont ensuite orient\u00e9 vers le Dr de Korompay, un chirurgien orthop\u00e9diste civil. M. Howell lui a dit que son genou droit bloquait \u00e0 l'occasion, qu'il ressentait de la douleur et des sensations de craquement , sympt\u00f4mes que son emploi semblait aggraver. Fortes de la recommandation du Dr de Korompay de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une nouvelle arthroscopie, les FAC ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 M. Howell inapte \u00e0 suivre le cours.\n[13] En f\u00e9vrier 1994, le Dr de Korompay a effectu\u00e9 une troisi\u00e8me intervention au genou droit de M. Howell apr\u00e8s que celui-ci eut gliss\u00e9 et fait une chute. Le Dr de Korompay a constat\u00e9 une l\u00e9sion du m\u00e9nisque interne qu'il a r\u00e9s\u00e9qu\u00e9. Le m\u00e9decin a \u00e9galement observ\u00e9 que, en d\u00e9pit d'une l\u00e9sion partielle de son ligament crois\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur, M. Howell affichait un degr\u00e9 de stabilit\u00e9 raisonnable. Il a jug\u00e9 qu'il pouvait continuer de remplir ses fonctions dans les FAC. En fait, en mars 1994, les superviseurs de M. Howell ont continu\u00e9 de recommander qu'on lui accorde une promotion.\n[14] En septembre 1994, M. Howell a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 suivre le cours de sous-officier subalterne, qui \u00e9tait semblable au cours de chef subalterne. En fait, le cours de sous-officier subalterne comportait les aspects administratifs du cours de chef subalterne avec, en plus, un volet infanterie. Durant ce cours, M. Howell a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes avec son ligament crois\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur, qui \u00e9tait endolori. Il a constat\u00e9 que l'\u00e9tat de son genou ne lui permettait pas de terminer le cours et a demand\u00e9 d'\u00eatre lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de celui-ci. On lui a remis un RTU ( retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 ) pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales, ce qui l'autorisait \u00e0 abandonner le cours et \u00e0 retourner \u00e0 son unit\u00e9 sans qu'on consid\u00e8re celui-ci comme un \u00e9chec. Les FAC ont recommand\u00e9 qu'on lui donne \u00e0 nouveau l'occasion de s'inscrire au cours, une fois ses probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9dicaux r\u00e9gl\u00e9s. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, son officier superviseur a jug\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pr\u00eat ni physiquement ni mentalement \u00e0 suivre une formation en leadership. M. Howell a souscrit \u00e0 cette opinion, car le cours de sous-officier subalterne, contrairement au cours initial de chef subalterne, comprenait un volet infanterie.\n[15] Apr\u00e8s son retour \u00e0 Shilo, M. Howell a entrepris un programme agressif de physioth\u00e9rapie pour combattre le syndrome f\u00e9moropatellaire, la plus fr\u00e9quente source de douleur \u00e0 la face ant\u00e9rieure du genou. Il a tent\u00e9 ainsi de gu\u00e9rir son genou en pr\u00e9vision du cours de sous-officier subalterne qui allait se donner \u00e0 la BFC Shilo en f\u00e9vrier 1995.\n[16] En d\u00e9cembre 1994, il a subi un test visant \u00e0 \u00e9valuer sa condition physique. Le m\u00e9decin de la base \u00e0 Shilo lui a conseill\u00e9 de porter des chaussures \u00e0 semelle matelass\u00e9e munies de fausses semelles coussin\u00e9es, de recourir \u00e0 un support pour son genou et d'\u00e9viter les sports violents. M. Howell a indiqu\u00e9 au m\u00e9decin qu'il ferait de son mieux lors du cours.\n[17] En janvier 1995, M. Howell a dit au m\u00e9decin de la base que le port des fausses semelles coussin\u00e9es et de son support donnaient de bons r\u00e9sultats. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, le m\u00e9decin de la base a inscrit dans une note m\u00e9dicale qu'il lui a remise qu'il \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 entreprendre un autre cours de sous-officier subalterne. Une note m\u00e9dicale \u00e9tait une note qu'un m\u00e9decin remettait aux membres des FAC jug\u00e9s inaptes \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter les t\u00e2ches des FAC en raison de probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9dicaux. Une telle note d\u00e9crivait \u00e0 l'intention des superviseurs les restrictions auxquelles le membre \u00e9tait soumis. Le membre devait remettre la note \u00e0 ses officiers superviseurs qui, \u00e0 leur tour, devaient la transmettre aux officiers dirigeant son unit\u00e9 d'attache.\nB. Acte discriminatoire pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 - mars 1995 - incident concernant le drill [18] M. Howell a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 suivre \u00e0 nouveau le cours de sous-officier subalterne, le 27 f\u00e9vrier 1995. D\u00e8s le d\u00e9but, il a dit au sgt Thompson qu'il devait porter un support en raison de sa blessure au genou, ce qui ne posait pas de difficult\u00e9 aux yeux du sgt Thompson.\n[19] Malheureusement, le 7 mars 1995, M. Howell a gliss\u00e9 sur une plaque de glace en se rendant \u00e0 un immeuble. On lui a alors diagnostiqu\u00e9 une entorse caus\u00e9e par une force exerc\u00e9e sur son genou droit en valgus. Le 13 mars 1995, l'\u00e9tat de son genou ne s'\u00e9tait gu\u00e8re am\u00e9lior\u00e9. Il prenait des comprim\u00e9s d'ibuprofen pour combattre la douleur, appliquait de la glace sur sa jambe et gardait celle-ci sur\u00e9lev\u00e9e. On lui a remis une note m\u00e9dicale indiquant qu'il devait porter son support.\n[20] Vers le 20 mars 1995, au cours de son entrevue hebdomadaire avec le sgt Thompson, M. Howell a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce dernier s'il pouvait l'excuser dor\u00e9navant des exercices de drill, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9ussi cette partie du cours. Les exercices de drill consistaient \u00e0 marcher, \u00e0 virer brusquement \u00e0 droite et \u00e0 gauche, \u00e0 claquer des talons, \u00e0 frapper du pied et \u00e0 demeurer au garde-\u00e0-vous pendant de longues p\u00e9riodes. M. Howell lui a indiqu\u00e9 que les manuvres de ce genre \u00e9taient dures pour son genou. Le 23 mars 1995, le sgt Thompson a accept\u00e9 de l'excuser de participer au volet drill du cours. Il a conseill\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Howell de laisser reposer son genou afin qu'il soit pr\u00eat \u00e0 participer \u00e0 la phase deux du cours, qui portait sur la tactique d'infanterie. Le sgt Thompson a obtenu le consentement d'autres membres du personnel militaire afin que M. Howell puisse obtenir plus facilement l'exemption demand\u00e9e.\n[21] Dans la matin\u00e9e du 23 mars 1995, M. Howell a pris part \u00e0 une activit\u00e9 de conditionnement physique dans le cadre du cours. Il portait un short et n'avait pas son support. Il a jou\u00e9 un match de basket-ball agressif du genre de ceux qu'on joue dans l'arm\u00e9e. Le sgt Thompson a observ\u00e9 M. Howell pendant le match.\n[22] Plus tard au cours de cette m\u00eame matin\u00e9e, apr\u00e8s le petit d\u00e9jeuner, M. Howell s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sur le terrain de parade sans son support, croyant qu'il \u00e9tait excus\u00e9 des exercices de drill. Le lt Hart a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Howell d'expliquer pourquoi il pouvait participer \u00e0 l'entra\u00eenement physique, et non aux manuvres de drill. M. Howell a r\u00e9pondu qu'il portait son support et des espadrilles. Le lt Hart a r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9 que, s'il pouvait jouer au basket-ball, il pouvait participer aux exercices de drill. M. Howell a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas son support, qui se trouvait \u00e0 Brandon, au Manitoba. Le lt Hart lui a ordonn\u00e9 de participer aux exercices d'une dur\u00e9e de 40 minutes sans son support. Alors que M. Howell rousp\u00e9tait, le sgt Thompson a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 prof\u00e9rer des jurons et exig\u00e9 qu'il explique pourquoi il ne participait pas aux exercices de drill. M. Howell a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau qu'il n'avait pas son support. Jurant de plus belle, le sgt Thompson a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Howell de se rendre sur le terrain de parade en d\u00e9pit du fait qu'il n'avait pas son support. M. Howell a ob\u00e9i aux ordres et a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re moiti\u00e9 de la s\u00e9rie de manuvres. Durant la pause, M. Howell a demand\u00e9 au sgt Houde la permission de se rendre \u00e0 la salle d'examen m\u00e9dical (SEM) afin de se faire excuser. Le sgt Houde s'est rendu \u00e0 cette demande. Cependant, lorsque le sgt Thompson a vu M. Howell rev\u00eatir sa veste, il lui a ordonn\u00e9, en prof\u00e9rant des jurons, de revenir sur le terrain de parade pour terminer les exercices. M. Howell lui a dit qu'il d\u00e9sirait se rendre \u00e0 la SEM. Le sgt Thompson lui a interdit de le faire, ajoutant qu'il pourrait s'y rendre le lendemain. M. Howell a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau de se rendre \u00e0 la SEM afin d'aller chercher une note m\u00e9dicale, ce que le sgt Thompson lui a encore une fois interdit de faire dans un langage moins que poli. M. Howell a termin\u00e9 la deuxi\u00e8me moiti\u00e9 de la s\u00e9rie de manuvres, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'ordre re\u00e7u.\n[23] Apr\u00e8s les exercices de drill, le genou de M. Howell \u00e9tait endolori et tum\u00e9fi\u00e9. Cependant, il ne s'est pas rendu \u00e0 la SEM tout de suite. En fait, il a continu\u00e9 de vaquer \u00e0 ses activit\u00e9s de la journ\u00e9e. Le lendemain, M. Howell s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au bureau du m\u00e9decin de la base.\nC. Ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents subs\u00e9quents \u00e0 l'incident concernant le drill [24] Le lendemain, soit le vendredi 24 mars 1995, le genou de M. Howell \u00e9tait enfl\u00e9. Le plaignant a indiqu\u00e9 aux m\u00e9decins de la base qu'il souffrait et avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 supporter le poids de son corps. On lui a administr\u00e9 une dose de st\u00e9ro\u00efdes et un anesth\u00e9sique afin de r\u00e9duire l'enflure et la douleur. M. Howell a indiqu\u00e9 que son genou se bloquait et lui faisait mal depuis environ quatre semaines. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dirig\u00e9 vers l'infirmerie de la base afin que son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 fasse l'objet d'une plus ample \u00e9valuation.\n[25] Aucune restriction m\u00e9dicale n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Howell. On lui a dit de retourner au cours, ce qu'il a fait. On l'a soumis \u00e0 un test de pratique en pr\u00e9vision de sa s\u00e9rie de t\u00e2ches combin\u00e9es pour de petites \u00e9quipes, test qu'il a \u00e9chou\u00e9. Toutefois, cet \u00e9chec n'a pas influ\u00e9 sur sa note, chaque membre ayant droit \u00e0 une chance de pratiquer.\n[26] M. Howell s'est rendu chez lui \u00e0 Brandon pour le week-end, les membres ayant re\u00e7u une autorisation de cong\u00e9. Il a mis de la glace sur son genou, qu'il a gard\u00e9 sur\u00e9lev\u00e9. Il avait bon espoir de pouvoir retourner au cours.\n[27] M. Howell est rentr\u00e9 \u00e0 la base dans la soir\u00e9e du dimanche 26 mars 1995. Le lundi 27 mars, il a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 un entra\u00eenement physique consistant \u00e0 marcher en portant un sac \u00e0 dos plein. Apr\u00e8s le petit d\u00e9jeuner, alors qu'il se rendait \u00e0 une salle de cours au sous-sol, son genou a bloqu\u00e9. Il a manqu\u00e9 un palier, tombant t\u00eate premi\u00e8re. Il s'est retrouv\u00e9 par-dessus un autre membre, incapable de se relever dans l'escalier. On l'a conduit \u00e0 la SEM o\u00f9 il s'est plaint de douleurs \u00e0 son genou droit et a racont\u00e9 les \u00e9pisodes de blocage. Le m\u00e9decin de la base a soup\u00e7onn\u00e9 une l\u00e9sion m\u00e9niscale, une blessure grave.\n[28] Un m\u00e9decin de la base a recommand\u00e9 d'attribuer \u00e0 M. Howell une cote m\u00e9dicale temporaire. Il \u00e9tait inapte au travail et incapable de suivre le cours. Il a recommand\u00e9 que M. Howell soit retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 (RTU). Un m\u00e9decin fait une telle recommandation dans les cas o\u00f9 un militaire est lib\u00e9r\u00e9 d'un cours pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales. Une telle mesure ne comporte pas de cons\u00e9quences sur le plan de la carri\u00e8re. Une fois le membre r\u00e9tabli, on lui permet de suivre \u00e0 nouveau le cours. M. Howell s'est vu remettre des b\u00e9quilles et prescrire du Tylenol 3 pour la douleur.\nD. S\u00e9rie de t\u00e2ches combin\u00e9es pour petites \u00e9quipes [29] Apr\u00e8s avoir pris les comprim\u00e9s de Tylenol 3, M. Howell \u00e9tait somnolent et \u00e9tourdi. Toutefois, ce soir-l\u00e0, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 un nouveau test - la s\u00e9rie de t\u00e2ches combin\u00e9es pour petites \u00e9quipes . Au cours de cette \u00e9preuve, le membre est \u00e9valu\u00e9 en fonction de sa capacit\u00e9 de commander d'autres membres dans l'ex\u00e9cution d'une t\u00e2che. M. Howell a particip\u00e9 volontairement \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve, apr\u00e8s avoir fait part \u00e0 l'adjudant Legge de son inqui\u00e9tude quant \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de subir le test en raison des m\u00e9dicaments qu'il avait pris. M. Howell a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 subir le test \u00e0 partir de son lit dans la caserne. Sa t\u00e2che consistait \u00e0 diriger les membres de son \u00e9quipe qui devaient d\u00e9m\u00e9nager des meubles d'une pi\u00e8ce \u00e0 une autre. Il a \u00e9chou\u00e9 le test en raison de l'effet des m\u00e9dicaments. Le lendemain, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9 du cours. Cependant, le lt Hart a indiqu\u00e9 dans le rapport de cours que M. Howell avait \u00e9chou\u00e9 du fait que son rendement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la norme, et en raison de sa pi\u00e8tre motivation et de sa mauvaise attitude. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9trograd\u00e9. En mars 1996, M. Howell a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un grief au sujet de ce rapport. Il a eu gain de cause et le rapport a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 pour indiquer qu'il avait \u00e9chou\u00e9 le cours pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales. Dans le rapport de cours r\u00e9vis\u00e9 \u00e9tabli \u00e0 la suite du grief, le lt Hart a maintenu que M. Howell avait affich\u00e9 une attitude irrespectueuse \u00e0 l'endroit de ses superviseurs. M. Howell a \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait du rapport de cours modifi\u00e9. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 au rang de caporal-chef int\u00e9rimaire et sa solde a \u00e9t\u00e9 rajust\u00e9e r\u00e9troactivement.\nE. Ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents m\u00e9dicaux post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 [30] M. Howell a \u00e9t\u00e9 dirig\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau vers le Dr de Korompay, qui l'a vu le 12 juin 1995. M. Howell a inform\u00e9 le Dr de Korompay de l'incident concernant le drill, mais non de sa chute du 27 mars 1995 dans l'escalier. M. Howell ressentait de la douleur au niveau de ses ligaments crois\u00e9s ant\u00e9rieur et post\u00e9rieur ainsi que de l'interligne articulaire interne. Le Dr de Korompay a recommand\u00e9 que M. Howell subisse une autre arthroscopie du genou droit, intervention qui a eu lieu en juillet 1995. Il s'agissait de la quatri\u00e8me intervention chirurgicale de M. Howell. Au cours de l'intervention, le Dr de Korompay a constat\u00e9 une l\u00e9sion m\u00e9niscale ainsi qu'une l\u00e9g\u00e8re l\u00e9sion de sa greffe du ligament crois\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur. Il a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ablation d'une bonne partie du m\u00e9nisque interne. Les blessures que le Dr de Korompay a observ\u00e9es en juin 1995 et au cours de l'intervention chirurgicale de juillet 1995 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9es par la chute du 27 mars 1995. En outre, le port du support demand\u00e9 durant les exercices de drill n'aurait pas emp\u00each\u00e9 ce type de blessures.\n[31] \u00c0 la suite de l'intervention, on a conseill\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Howell de porter des bottes \u00e0 semelle souple. Son \u00e9tat s'est am\u00e9lior\u00e9 au point que, en ao\u00fbt 1995, il a pris part \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s sportives plus exigeantes, notamment \u00e0 des matchs de handball europ\u00e9en. Il a ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s la marche forc\u00e9e faisant partie du programme d'agu\u00e9rrissement des FAC et s'est vu attribuer en octobre 1995 une nouvelle cote m\u00e9dicale ( G2O2 - service normal ) en remplacement de sa cote m\u00e9dicale temporaire assortie de restrictions. Ses t\u00e2ches n'\u00e9taient pas modifi\u00e9es et ses blessures au genou ne l'emp\u00eachaient pas d'effectuer de nombreuses heures suppl\u00e9mentaires comme il le faisait avant l'intervention chirurgicale. M. Howell et le Dr de Korompay ont conclu que l'intervention de juillet 1995 avait permis de r\u00e9soudre ses probl\u00e8mes de genou.\n[32] Toutefois, M. Howell a eu d'autres incidents qui ont mis \u00e0 mal son genou droit \u00e0 la suite de l'intervention de juillet 1995. Il a notamment subi une \u00e9longation musculaire vers avril 1996, alors qu'il soulevait une g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice. Son genou a \u00e9t\u00e9 en proie \u00e0 des spasmes, mais les sympt\u00f4mes se sont vite r\u00e9sorb\u00e9s. Malheureusement, sa douleur au genou a persist\u00e9, avec le r\u00e9sultat qu'il s'est vu attribuer, en ao\u00fbt 1996, une cote m\u00e9dicale temporaire en raison des douleurs qu'il ressentait aux deux genoux, le genou droit \u00e9tant plus mal en point que le genou gauche.\n[33] M. Howell a consult\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau le Dr de Korompay en septembre 1996, se plaignant de douleurs lorsqu'il courait. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Howell a indiqu\u00e9 que son \u00e9tat physique et mental s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9. Le Dr de Korompay a propos\u00e9 qu'il subisse une autre arthroscopie pour d\u00e9terminer si ses sympt\u00f4mes \u00e9taient attribuables \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9caniques. Il a dit que s'il ne r\u00e9ussissait pas \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier aux probl\u00e8mes, M. Howell serait contraint de songer \u00e0 prendre sa retraite des FAC, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le besoin de courir. Le Dr de Korompay a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une cinqui\u00e8me arthroscopie en janvier 1997. Il a alors conclu qu'en raison des modifications d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ratives dans son genou, M. Howell ne pourrait s'acquitter de ses t\u00e2ches dans les FAC, notamment courir. De l'avis du Dr de Korompay, M. Howell [TRADUCTION] devrait se voir interdire en permanence de courir pendant de longues p\u00e9riodes, particuli\u00e8rement en portant une charge (p. ex., un sac \u00e0 dos)3 . Apr\u00e8s l'intervention, le Dr de Korompay a eu un s\u00e9rieux entretien avec M. Howell au sujet de son inaptitude \u00e0 poursuivre sa carri\u00e8re dans les FAC. M. Howell a convenu qu'il devait prendre sa retraite des FAC afin de prot\u00e9ger son genou. Il souffrait \u00e9galement d'angoisse.\nF. Lib\u00e9ration des FAC - mars 1998 [34] Par cons\u00e9quent, le 20 f\u00e9vrier 1997, M. Howell a lui-m\u00eame estim\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait incapable d'ex\u00e9cuter un certain nombre de t\u00e2ches en raison de ses blessures au genou, particuli\u00e8rement les t\u00e2ches g\u00e9n\u00e9rales que comportait son travail de technicien de v\u00e9hicule. Il a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il ne pouvait pas effectuer de longues marches en terrain accident\u00e9, qu'il ne pouvait se tenir debout pendant plus de 10 heures d'affil\u00e9e et qu'il ne pouvait creuser une tranch\u00e9e individuelle. M. Howell a rempli le formulaire en sachant que ses r\u00e9ponses aux questions entra\u00eeneraient sa lib\u00e9ration pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales.\n[35] Le m\u00eame jour, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 class\u00e9 dans la cat\u00e9gorie permanente G4 et jug\u00e9 inapte \u00e0 servir en campagne ou dans le cadre de missions de l'ONU. On lui a attribu\u00e9 la cote 03 , ce qui signifiait qu'il \u00e9tait incapable de s'acquitter de ses fonctions professionnelles telles que courir, porter un sac \u00e0 dos, participer aux exercices de drill, marcher ou se livrer \u00e0 d'autres activit\u00e9s o\u00f9 les chocs sont fr\u00e9quents. Le Conseil m\u00e9dical de r\u00e9vision des carri\u00e8res des FAC s'est finalement pench\u00e9 sur le cas de M. Howell pour \u00e9valuer ses perspectives de carri\u00e8re. Le Conseil a estim\u00e9 que les restrictions professionnelles de M. Howell entravaient \u00e9norm\u00e9ment sa capacit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuter toute la gamme des fonctions des FAC. Il a jug\u00e9 qu'il ne satisfaisait pas au principe de l'universalit\u00e9 du service. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9 des Forces canadiennes \u00e0 compter du 31 mars 1998.\nG. L'apr\u00e8s-lib\u00e9ration [36] \u00c0 la suite de sa lib\u00e9ration des FAC, M. Howell a voulu profiter du r\u00e9gime d'assurance militaire pour se recycler. Il a termin\u00e9 sa 12e ann\u00e9e puis a entrepris un cours de radiographie au coll\u00e8ge. Comme ce cours exigeait d'\u00eatre souvent debout, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d'\u00e9pouser la vocation de technicien en radiologie. Apr\u00e8s avoir mis fin pr\u00e9matur\u00e9ment \u00e0 son programme de recyclage en mai 1999, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de d\u00e9marrer sa propre entreprise de r\u00e9paration de petits moteurs, qu'il a exploit\u00e9e de juin 1999 \u00e0 juin 2003 \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s. Il n'a pas fait de profits. En fait, l'entreprise a subi des pertes.\nH. Demande de pension en raison du SSPT [37] Au cours des ann\u00e9es qui se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9es entre la date o\u00f9 M. Howell a \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9 des FAC et la date de l'audience, le minist\u00e8re des Anciens Combattants Canada (ACC) lui a accord\u00e9 quatre pensions d'invalidit\u00e9. Les dates de d\u00e9but des prestations et les pourcentages pertinents sont indiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 la page 8 de l'onglet 13 de l'intim\u00e9e, qui est constitu\u00e9 des divulgations suppl\u00e9mentaires4. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, M. Howell touche actuellement une pension correspondant \u00e0 un pourcentage d'invalidit\u00e9 de 20 % de son genou droit. Cette pension lui est vers\u00e9e depuis le 2 avril 1998.\n[38] En f\u00e9vrier 2004, M. Howell a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de pension d'invalidit\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, all\u00e9guant qu'il souffrait du syndrome de stress post-traumatique (SSPT) par suite de l'incident concernant le drill, et que son \u00e9chec au cours et sa lib\u00e9ration subs\u00e9quente des FAC \u00e9taient attribuables \u00e0 cet incident. Un psychiatre, le Dr McIntryre, a appuy\u00e9 la demande de M. Howell en pr\u00e9sentant \u00e0 ACC un avis indiquant que l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e9tait atteint du SSPT et que l'incident concernant le drill semblait \u00eatre \u00e0 l'origine de l'angoisse et du syndrome de d\u00e9pression dont il souffrait. La pension a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite d'un appel. M. Howell n'avait pas servi dans des zones de combat. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir une deuxi\u00e8me pension -correspondant \u00e0 un pourcentage d'invalidit\u00e9 de 40 % - avec rajustement r\u00e9troactif au 24 septembre 2002.\n[39] La pension totale que touche M. Howell s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 2 162,63 $ par mois. Ce montant \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 72 % du montant total qu'il recevrait s'il \u00e9tait totalement invalide et tient compte du fait qu'il est mari\u00e9 et a trois enfants.\nIV. FONDEMENTS DE MES CONCLUSIONS DE FAIT [40] Les fondements de mes conclusions de fait sont d\u00e9crits ci-apr\u00e8s.\nA. T\u00e9moins ordinaires [41] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements sont survenus il y a plusieurs ann\u00e9es et que les notes \u00e0 leur sujet et les t\u00e9moignages oraux sont contradictoires, j'accorde plus de poids aux notes. De m\u00eame, dans les cas o\u00f9 il y a divergence entre le t\u00e9moignage de M. Howell et ceux du sgt Thompson et du capt Hart, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re ces deniers.\n[42] \u00c0 mon avis, le sgt Thompson a \u00e9t\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin franc. Selon moi, il a agi de fa\u00e7on raisonnable dans ses relations avec M. Howell avant l'incident concernant le drill. Il a acquiesc\u00e9 deux fois \u00e0 une demande de traitement sp\u00e9cial de M. Howell. Il a d'abord inform\u00e9 M. Howell qu'il ne voyait pas de probl\u00e8me \u00e0 ce qu'il porte son support pendant le cours. Par la suite, il a express\u00e9ment exempt\u00e9 M. Howell des exercices de drill \u00e0 sa demande. En fait, il a demand\u00e9 le consentement d'autres militaires pour obtenir cette exemption. Je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e9galement le t\u00e9moignage du capt Hart \u00e0 celui de M. Howell. \u00c0 mon avis, le capt Hart a \u00e9t\u00e9 le t\u00e9moin le plus franc, le plus direct et le plus cr\u00e9dible. \u00c0 mon avis, ces deux t\u00e9moins des FAC \u00e9taient plus ind\u00e9pendants que le plaignant. Ils ont tous deux indiqu\u00e9 que leurs relations avec le plaignant n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e.\n[43] D'autre part, un certain nombre d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments m'incitent \u00e0 conclure que le t\u00e9moignage oral de M. Howell n'est pas digne de foi. Premi\u00e8rement, il avait personnellement des int\u00e9r\u00eats en jeu. M. Howell a vu et revu l'incident concernant le drill de nombreuses fois dans sa t\u00eate, \u00e0 chaque fois dans un contexte diff\u00e9rent. Ainsi, il a affirm\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage que le Dr McIntyre lui avait dit que le sentiment que l'incident concernant le drill lui inspirait ressemblait \u00e0 celui que ressentent les victimes de viol5.\n[44] Deuxi\u00e8mement, il a volontiers admis qu'il avait un vague souvenir de certains \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Il y a eu certaines incoh\u00e9rences dans son t\u00e9moignage relativement \u00e0 des d\u00e9tails importants. Ainsi, il a dit avoir demand\u00e9 durant l'incident la permission de se rendre \u00e0 la caserne pour aller chercher son support et que cette demande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e. Cependant, ses notes et d'autres documents portant sur l'incident indiquent qu'il n'a pas demand\u00e9 la permission d'aller chercher son support \u00e0 la caserne. Il a plut\u00f4t demand\u00e9 la permission de se rendre \u00e0 la SEM pour obtenir une note l'excusant des manuvres de drill. En outre, il a dit qu'il avait d'abord refus\u00e9 de se soumettre \u00e0 l'ordre d'ex\u00e9cuter les manuvres. Or, ses notes, sa demande de r\u00e8glement de grief et sa plainte ne corroborent pas sa version des faits.\n[45] Troisi\u00e8mement, M. Howell souffre du SSPT et a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte dans laquelle il \u00e9voque le m\u00eame incident dans le but de recevoir une pension pour cette raison. Par cons\u00e9quent, on peut douter de sa capacit\u00e9 de se rem\u00e9morer les \u00e9v\u00e9nements de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9cise. On peut douter \u00e9galement de l'impartialit\u00e9 de sa description de l'incident.\n[46] \u00c0 mon avis, le t\u00e9moignage du capt Finokio n'est pas utile. Son souvenir de l'incident et de la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 il s'est produit \u00e9tait flou et il se trouvait \u00e0 une trentaine de pieds de M. Howell et du capt Hart au moment o\u00f9 l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement est survenu6.\nB. Notes de M. Howell [47] Les notes r\u00e9dig\u00e9es par M. Howell le jour m\u00eame de l'incident confirment qu'il a dit \u00e0 deux reprises au sgt Thompson et au lt Hart ce qui suit : [TRADUCTION] ...Je n'ai pas mon support... . Si son support se trouvait [TRADUCTION] \u00e0 cinq minutes de l\u00e0 dans la caserne \u00e0 Shilo, comme il l'a pr\u00e9tendu lors de son t\u00e9moignage, il aurait dit spontan\u00e9ment au sergent : [TRADUCTION] Je n'ai pas mon support, mais donnez-moi, s'il vous pla\u00eet, cinq minutes pour que j'aille le chercher. Il n'a rien dit de tel.\n[48] En outre, M. Howell a demand\u00e9 la permission de se rendre \u00e0 la SEM pour aller chercher une note l'excusant des exercices de drill. Si son support s'\u00e9tait trouv\u00e9 \u00e0 cinq minutes de l\u00e0, dans sa caserne, il aurait demand\u00e9 la permission d'aller le chercher plut\u00f4t que de se rendre \u00e0 la SEM afin de se faire excuser.\n[49] Il est vrai que, le 13 mars 1995, M. Howell a demand\u00e9 et re\u00e7u une note du m\u00e9decin de la base l'autorisant \u00e0 porter un support; cependant, j'accepte la pr\u00e9tention du sgt Thompson selon laquelle M. Howell ne lui a pas remis une telle note. Cette conclusion est conforme aux notes de M. Howell au sujet de l'incident selon lesquelles il a demand\u00e9 la permission de se rendre \u00e0 la SEM afin d'obtenir une note l'excusant des exercices de drill. Il n'a pas dit au sgt Thompson [TRADUCTION] Sergent, je vous ai donn\u00e9 une note m\u00e9dicale pr\u00e9cisant que je dois porter un support lors des exercices de drill , ou encore [TRADUCTION] Sergent, vous avez la note m\u00e9dicale , ou quelque chose du genre. S'il avait remis deux fois une note m\u00e9dicale au sgt Thompson, M. Howell aurait dit quelque chose comme cela. En fait, la note en question n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produite \u00e0 l'audience en tant qu'\u00e9l\u00e9ment du dossier des FAC. En outre, M. Howell a indiqu\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'il d\u00e9sirait obtenir une note \u00e0 jour parce qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas s\u00fbr que le personnel ait transmis les autres notes au sgt Thompson. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a admis, au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, qu'il n'avait pas remis les notes au sergent en mains propres.\n[50] Me Swayze me prie instamment de reconna\u00eetre que M. Howell a agi dans son int\u00e9r\u00eat et port\u00e9 le support durant le match de basket-ball qui s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 le matin o\u00f9 est survenu l'incident. Cependant, en ce qui concerne la p\u00e9riode comprise entre septembre 1994 et mars 1995, Me Swayze a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Howell quels conseils le Dr de Korompay lui avait donn\u00e9s au sujet de son genou. M. Howell a r\u00e9pondu que le Dr de Korompay lui avait express\u00e9ment dit qu'il devait porter son support durant les exercices de drill et s'efforcer d'\u00e9viter les sports de contact. Cependant, M. Howell, allant \u00e0 l'encontre de l'avis de son m\u00e9decin, a pris part \u00e0 un match agressif de basket-ball. Il n'a pas demand\u00e9 d'\u00eatre exempt\u00e9 de participer au match de basket-ball, comme il l'a fait pour les exercices de drill.\n[51] Le sgt Thompson a express\u00e9ment observ\u00e9 le genou de M. Howell pour d\u00e9terminer s'il portait un support ce matin-l\u00e0, compte tenu du fait qu'il avait demand\u00e9 un traitement sp\u00e9cial afin d'\u00eatre exempt\u00e9 des exercices de drill en raison de l'\u00e9tat de son genou. On peut pr\u00e9sumer que le sgt Thompson a soigneusement observ\u00e9 M. Howell et son genou ce matin-l\u00e0.\nC. T\u00e9moins experts [52] \u00c0 mon avis, le Dr de Korompay a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on franche et professionnelle. Son t\u00e9moignage a \u00e9t\u00e9 utile. Cependant, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re l'opinion du Dr Randall \u00e0 celle du Dr de Korompay en ce qui concerne la probabilit\u00e9 que l'incident concernant le drill ait caus\u00e9 les blessures qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 constat\u00e9es par le Dr de Korompay en juin 1995 et qui l'ont amen\u00e9 \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des interventions chirurgicales en juillet 1995. Certains de mes motifs \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s ci-dessous.\n[53] Lorsqu'il a \u00e9valu\u00e9 le cas de M. Howell en juin 1995 et formul\u00e9 ses opinions, le Dr de Korompay n'avait pas eu le loisir d'\u00e9valuer les blessures au regard de la chute du 13 mars 1995 sur une plaque de glace. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr de Korompay a dit que M. Howell ne l'avait pas inform\u00e9 de cette chute. Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 non plus de la chute du 27 mars 1995 de M. Howell, t\u00eate premi\u00e8re dans l'escalier, ni de l'incident du 10 mai 1995 o\u00f9 le genou a c\u00e9d\u00e9 et bloqu\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau. Dans son rapport du 12 septembre 2003, le Dr de Korompay a confirm\u00e9 ne pas \u00eatre au courant d'autres blessures qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 subies dans l'intervalle. Vu l'information restreinte que M. Howell et son avocat lui ont donn\u00e9e au sujet de l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du plaignant aux \u00e9poques qui nous int\u00e9ressent, le Dr de Korompay a \u00e9mis l'opinion que les conclusions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au sujet de l'ampleur des interventions chirurgicales de juillet 1995 pourraient \u00eatre attribu\u00e9es aux blessures de mars 1995.\n[54] Le Dr de Korompay a reconnu volontiers que, aux fins de l'\u00e9valuation des effets de l'incident concernant le drill sur l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de M. Howell, il s'\u00e9tait fi\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que le patient lui avait racont\u00e9 et \u00e0 ce qu'il avait vu dans son genou apr\u00e8s l'examen. M. Howell l'a inform\u00e9 que l'incident lui avait caus\u00e9 un important traumatisme et que son genou avait enfl\u00e9 et l'avait fait souffrir.\n[55] Le Dr Randall, pour sa part, a obtenu et examin\u00e9 le dossier complet de M. Howell, constitu\u00e9 de quatre volumes, ce que le Dr de Korompay n'a pas eu le loisir de faire. S'il est vrai que le Dr Randall n'a pas examin\u00e9 M. Howell avant de formuler son opinion, il reste que le Dr de Korompay ne l'a pas fait lui non plus apr\u00e8s les importantes blessures que le plaignant a subies au genou au cours de sa carri\u00e8re dans les FAC, et particuli\u00e8rement celles survenues entre mars et juin 1995.\n[56] Je rejette \u00e9galement, pour les m\u00eames motifs, l'opinion du Dr de Korompay voulant que, si M. Howell avait port\u00e9 son support lors de l'incident, il aurait probablement pu \u00e9viter les blessures qu'il a observ\u00e9es en juin et juillet 1995. Comme je ne crois pas que les blessures de juin et juillet 1995 aient \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9es par l'incident concernant le drill, les cons\u00e9quences du non-port d'un support lors de l'incident en question ne m'aident pas \u00e0 \u00e9valuer le rapport avec les blessures subs\u00e9quentes. En outre, je fais mienne l'opinion du Dr Randall voulant qu'un support antirotationnel n'aurait gu\u00e8re contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la stabilit\u00e9 de son genou ce jour-l\u00e0, et ce, pour toutes les raisons \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans son rapport d'expert. Le Dr de Korompay a lui-m\u00eame reconnu que la question \u00e0 savoir si le port d'un support aide \u00e0 la stabilit\u00e9 du membre \u00e0 la suite d'un bon programme de r\u00e9adaptation est controvers\u00e9e.\n[57] Enfin, en ce qui concerne les avantages psychologiques possibles du support, le plaignant et la Commission, bien que l'intim\u00e9 ait produit \u00e0 l'audience des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve indiquant que M. Howell souffrait du SSPT7, ont omis de citer le Dr McIntryre comme t\u00e9moin expert. Je ferai remarquer que ce dernier est demeur\u00e9 tout au cours de l'audience un t\u00e9moin susceptible de compara\u00eetre, ainsi qu'en atteste la liste de t\u00e9moins possibles du tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne saurais conclure que le fait de ne pas avoir port\u00e9 de support lors de l'incident ait pr\u00e9cipit\u00e9 la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de l'\u00e9tat psychologique de M. Howell ou contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 celui-ci. L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e m'a demand\u00e9 de tirer une conclusion d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 M. Howell parce qu'il n'a pas cit\u00e9 le Dr McIntyre. Cela n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour trancher l'esp\u00e8ce.\nV. LES QUESTIONS LITIGIEUSES [58] \u00c0 la lueur de ces conclusions de fait, passons maintenant \u00e0 l'examen des questions de droit.\n[59] La comp\u00e9tence de ce tribunal d\u00e9coule de la plainte en date du 20 juillet 1998 de M. Howell. L'avocat de M. Howell, Me Swayze, a confirm\u00e9 dans son expos\u00e9 d'ouverture que la plainte de M. Howell s'articule essentiellement autour de l'incident concernant le drill en date du 23 mars 19958. Me Swayze a pr\u00e9tendu que les FAC avaient refus\u00e9 que M. Howell puisse porter son support, un appareil dont il avait besoin pour \u00eatre bien fonctionnel, et que ce refus constituait un acte discriminatoire. Il a fait valoir que, \u00e0 la suite de cet incident, M. Howell a d\u00fb subir des interventions chirurgicales et a vu l'\u00e9tat de son genou se d\u00e9grader. N'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de cet incident, son genou ne se serait pas d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9 aussi rapidement et il aurait probablement pu demeurer plus longtemps au sein des FAC. Me Swayze a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nNous d\u00e9montrerons, Madame la pr\u00e9sidente, qu'une d\u00e9cision qui aurait pu \u00eatre prise en une fraction de seconde et qui aurait permis au plaignant d'obtenir cinq minutes de plus pour se rendre jusqu'\u00e0 la caserne pour aller chercher son support pour le genou nous aurait \u00e9vit\u00e9 d'\u00eatre ici aujourd'hui9.\n[60] Par cons\u00e9quent, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la plainte, aux arguments des avocats et au t\u00e9moignage de M. Howell lui-m\u00eame, les seules questions \u00e0 trancher en l'esp\u00e8ce sont celles ayant trait \u00e0 l'incident concernant le drill. Ces questions sont les suivantes :\nL'incident concernant le drill constitue-t-il un acte discriminatoire allant \u00e0 l'encontre du paragraphe 7a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne10? L'incident concernant le drill constitue-t-il un acte discriminatoire allant \u00e0 l'encontre du paragraphe 7b) de la Loi? Si la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l'une ou l'autre de ces questions est affirmative, les FAC ont-elles \u00e9tabli un moyen de d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9 sur une EPJ conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 15a) de la Loi? Dans la n\u00e9gative, quel redressement devrait-on accorder \u00e0 M. Howell?\nVI. LE DROIT A. Le droit des droits de la personne [61] M. Howell a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en date du 20 juillet 1998 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'art. 7 de la Loi - tel qu'il existait \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 - au sujet des \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus en mars 1995. Aux termes de l'art. 7 de la Loi actuelle, constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\nde refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu; de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi.\n[62] L'alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) d\u00e9crit ce qu'on entend par une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e ( EPJ ) :\nNe constituent pas des actes discriminatoires : les refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de l'employeur qui d\u00e9montre qu'ils d\u00e9coulent d'exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es;\nLe paragraphe 15(2) se lit comme suit :\nLes faits pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a (1)a) sont des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es ou un motif justifiable, au sens de l'alin\u00e9a (1)g), s'il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d'une personne ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\nLe paragraphe 15(8) confirme que l'article 15 s'applique \u00e0 la fois \u00e0 la discrimination directe et \u00e0 la discrimination par suite d'un effet pr\u00e9judiciable.\nLe paragraphe 15(9) se lit comme suit :\nLe paragraphe (2) s'applique sous r\u00e9serve de l'obligation de service impos\u00e9e aux membres des Forces canadiennes, c'est-\u00e0-dire celle d'accomplir en permanence et en toutes circonstances les fonctions auxquelles ils peuvent \u00eatre tenus.\n[63] La Loi, telle qu'elle existait en mars 1995, ne renfermait pas de dispositions \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 celles que renferment actuellement les paragraphes 15(2), 15(8) et 15(9). Ces modifications sont entr\u00e9es en vigueur le 30 juin 199811.\n[64] En 1999, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a rendu publics les arr\u00eats suivants : Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. Gouvernement de la Colombie-Britannique et Services Employees' Union (B.C.G.S.E.U.), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 [ Meiorin ] et Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868 [ Grismer ]. Dans l'un et l'autre cas, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a remplac\u00e9 par une approche unifi\u00e9e la distinction qui \u00e9tait faite ant\u00e9rieurement dans la jurisprudence entre la discrimination directe et la discrimination indirecte. En vertu de cette d\u00e9marche uniformis\u00e9e, il incombe encore \u00e0 la partie plaignante d'\u00e9tablir d'abord l'existence d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e. Une fois qu'une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il revient \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la politique ou norme discriminatoire comporte un motif justifiable. Dans cette optique, la partie intim\u00e9e doit d\u00e9sormais prouver :\nqu'elle a adopt\u00e9 la norme \u00e0 une fin ou dans un but qui est rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la fonction ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e. \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape, l'analyse porte non pas sur la validit\u00e9 de la norme particuli\u00e8re en cause, mais plut\u00f4t sur la validit\u00e9 de son objet plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, par exemple la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuter la t\u00e2che de mani\u00e8re s\u00fbre et efficace. Si l'objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est d'assurer l'ex\u00e9cution de la t\u00e2che de mani\u00e8re s\u00fbre et efficace, il ne sera pas n\u00e9cessaire de consacrer beaucoup de temps \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape; qu'elle a adopt\u00e9 la norme en question en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser le but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail, et sans qu'elle ait eu l'intention de faire preuve de discrimination envers le demandeur. \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape l'analyse passe de l'objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la norme \u00e0 la norme particuli\u00e8re elle-m\u00eame; que la norme contest\u00e9e est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre le but poursuivi, c.-\u00e0-d. l'ex\u00e9cution de la t\u00e2che de mani\u00e8re s\u00fbre et efficace. L'employeur doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il ne peut composer avec le demandeur et les autres personnes touch\u00e9es par la norme sans subir une contrainte excessive. Il doit veiller \u00e0 ce que la proc\u00e9dure, s'il en est, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e pour \u00e9tudier la question de l'accommodement tienne compte de la possibilit\u00e9 qu'elle puisse \u00eatre ind\u00fbment discriminatoire pour un motif de distinction illicite. En outre, la teneur r\u00e9elle d'une norme plus conciliable qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte par l'employeur doit \u00eatre adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 chaque cas. Subsidiairement, l'employeur doit justifier pourquoi il n'a pas offert une telle norme.\n[65] En outre, les arr\u00eats Meiorin et Grismer de la Cour supr\u00eame comportent des param\u00e8tres qui permettent de d\u00e9terminer si une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur une contrainte excessive a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. Dans Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame a fait observer que l'utilisation du mot excessive laisse supposer qu'une certaine contrainte est acceptable; pour satisfaire \u00e0 la norme, il faut absolument que la contrainte impos\u00e9e soit excessive 12. Il peut \u00eatre id\u00e9al, du point de vue de l'employeur, de choisir une norme d'une rigidit\u00e9 absolue. Encore est-il que, pour \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e en vertu de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne, cette norme doit tenir compte de facteurs concernant les capacit\u00e9s uniques ainsi que la valeur et la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rentes de chaque personne, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela n'impose aucune contrainte excessive. La Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9galement fait remarquer que le d\u00e9fendeur, afin de prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, a toujours la charge de d\u00e9montrer qu'elle inclut toute possibilit\u00e9 d'accommodement sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte une contrainte excessive. Il incombe au d\u00e9fendeur d'\u00e9tablir qu'il a examin\u00e9 et raisonnablement rejet\u00e9 toutes les formes viables d'accommodement. Le d\u00e9fendeur doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il \u00e9tait impossible d'incorporer dans la norme des aspects d'accommodement individuels sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte une contrainte excessive. Dans certains cas, le co\u00fbt excessif peut justifier le refus de composer avec les personnes atteintes de d\u00e9ficiences. Toutefois, il faut se garder de ne pas accorder suffisamment d'importance \u00e0 l'accommodement de la personne handicap\u00e9e. Il est beaucoup trop facile d'invoquer l'augmentation des co\u00fbts pour justifier le refus d'accorder un traitement \u00e9gal aux personnes handicap\u00e9es. L'adoption de la norme du d\u00e9fendeur doit \u00eatre \u00e9tay\u00e9e par des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve convaincants13. La preuve, constitu\u00e9e d'impression, d'une augmentation des d\u00e9penses ne suffit pas g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement. On devrait songer \u00e0 des moyens d'accommodement innovateurs et non p\u00e9cuniaires pratiques. Enfin, les facteurs tels que le co\u00fbt des m\u00e9thodes d'accommodement possibles devraient \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s d'une mani\u00e8re souple et conforme au bon sens, en fonction des faits de chaque cas14. Comme l'a fait observer le juge Cory dans Chambly c. Bergevin [1994] 2 R.C.S. 525, ce qui peut \u00eatre parfaitement raisonnable en p\u00e9riode de prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9 est susceptible d'imposer \u00e0 un employeur un fardeau financier d\u00e9raisonnable en p\u00e9riode de restrictions budg\u00e9taires ou de r\u00e9cession. Je constate que le terme contrainte excessive n'est pas d\u00e9fini dans la Loi.\n[66] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la question qu'il faut aborder franchement consiste d'abord et avant tout \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination? Conform\u00e9ment aux articles 49 et 50, ce tribunal doit instruire la plainte. L'instruction doit \u00eatre ind\u00e9pendante et impartiale et tenir d\u00fbment compte de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et de la jurisprudence pertinente. Ce tribunal est li\u00e9 par l'arr\u00eat rendu par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l'affaire Hutchinson c. Canada (ministre de l'Environnement) (C.A.) (2003), 4 C.F. 580. La Cour a confirm\u00e9 qu'on avait tenu compte, tant dans Meiorin que dans Grismer, des effets des normes ou politiques distinctes ayant servi d'outils de s\u00e9lection, c.-\u00e0-d. une norme a\u00e9robique d\u00e9favorisant les femmes et une norme d'acuit\u00e9 visuelle r\u00e9gissant la d\u00e9livrance de permis de conduire qui constituait une discrimination directe. La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a distingu\u00e9 ces affaires de celle dont elle \u00e9tait saisie, faisant remarquer que les rapports, en l'occurrence, n'\u00e9taient pas dict\u00e9s par une politique pr\u00e9existante. Il existait plut\u00f4t une ligne de conduite selon laquelle les parties se fondaient sur une interpr\u00e9tation des droits et des obligations qu'elles avaient respectivement. Dans Hutchinson, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 difficile d'isoler ou de cerner une politique ou norme particuli\u00e8re. Dans Meiorin, le point de d\u00e9part de l'analyse de la Cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 sa conclusion voulant que la politique en question fasse une distinction entre des personnes qui \u00e9taient touch\u00e9es pour un motif illicite. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a statu\u00e9 que lorsqu'il est question d'une ligne de conduite, la question la plus pertinente est de savoir si les rapports entre les parties, consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans leur ensemble, entra\u00eenent un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. Si les rapports, pris dans leur ensemble, ne r\u00e9v\u00e8lent pas un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable, alors l'examen prend fin. Dans le cas inverse, on proc\u00e8de \u00e0 l'examen des trois questions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans l'analyse faite par la Cour supr\u00eame dans Meiorin. Dans Hutchinson, la Cour a statu\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait raisonnablement loisible \u00e0 la Commission de conclure que les rapports entre l'appelante et l'intim\u00e9e, consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans leur ensemble, ne r\u00e9v\u00e9laient aucun traitement pr\u00e9judiciable.\n[67] En outre, dans Hutchinson, la Cour a affirm\u00e9 que la partie plaignante n'a pas le droit de tenir ferme quant \u00e0 la solution de rechange pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e. En l'occurrence, l'intim\u00e9e a fait des efforts pour composer avec la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante en lui offrant de travailler \u00e0 un autre endroit, l'employant sur une base saisonni\u00e8re, en favorisant un milieu exempt d'odeur ou en lui offrant d'effectuer du t\u00e9l\u00e9travail. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait sienne la d\u00e9cision rendue dans Ontario (Ministry of Community and Social Services) c. OPSEU (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 560, o\u00f9 la Cour d'appel de l'Ontario a conclu que la politique relative \u00e0 l'observation religieuse de l'employeur \u00e9tait suffisante pour tenir compte des besoins particuliers des personnes pratiquant une religion minoritaire. Un employ\u00e9 avait revendiqu\u00e9 le droit d'avoir un cong\u00e9 pay\u00e9 pour lui permettre d'observer onze f\u00eates religieuses. La politique de l'employeur pr\u00e9voyait deux jours de cong\u00e9 pay\u00e9s pour l'observation religieuse ainsi que des jours de cong\u00e9 suppl\u00e9mentaires au moyen de changements d'horaire et de jours de cong\u00e9 accumul\u00e9s gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la semaine de travail comprim\u00e9e. L'employ\u00e9 a exprim\u00e9 l'avis qu'il pouvait utiliser comme bon lui semblait les jours de cong\u00e9 qu'il avait accumul\u00e9s gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la semaine de travail comprim\u00e9e et que l'employeur pouvait lui accorder onze jours de cong\u00e9s pay\u00e9s pour l'observation religieuse sans contrainte excessive. La Cour a statu\u00e9 qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la politique de l'employeur \u00e9tait suffisamment inclusive pour tenir compte des besoins de l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9, la question de l'accommodement jusqu'\u00e0 la contrainte excessive ne se posait pas. L'un des corollaires de cette position, selon la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, est que le demandeur ne peut refuser une solution raisonnable pour le motif que la solution de rechange qu'il pr\u00e9f\u00e8re n'imposera pas une contrainte excessive \u00e0 l'employeur.\nB. Le droit des droits de la personne et le droit de la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9lictuelle [68] Les principes \u00e9tablis en droit de la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9lictuelle voulant que la victime soit remise dans la position o\u00f9 elle se serait trouv\u00e9e, n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de l'acte reproch\u00e9, s'appliquent aux plaintes relative aux droits de la personne. Aux fins de d\u00e9terminer les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats recouvrables, il faut faire abstraction des cons\u00e9quences de l'acte qui sont trop indirectes ou lointaines15. Suite aux arr\u00eats rendus par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans des affaires telles que Morgan, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9crit, dans l'arr\u00eat Athey c. Leonati, [1996] 3 R.C.S. 458, une d\u00e9marche fond\u00e9e sur un ensemble de principes servant \u00e0 \u00e9valuer la causalit\u00e9. La causalit\u00e9 est \u00e9tablie si le demandeur prouve que le d\u00e9fendeur a caus\u00e9 le pr\u00e9judice ou y a contribu\u00e9. Le crit\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, quoique non d\u00e9cisif, en mati\u00e8re de causalit\u00e9 est celui du facteur d\u00e9terminant ( but for test ), selon lequel le demandeur est tenu de prouver que le pr\u00e9judice ne serait pas survenu sans la n\u00e9gligence du d\u00e9fendeur. Dans les cas o\u00f9 le crit\u00e8re du facteur d\u00e9terminant n'est pas applicable, les tribunaux ont reconnu que la causalit\u00e9 \u00e9tait \u00e9tablie si la n\u00e9gligence du d\u00e9fendeur avait contribu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on appr\u00e9ciable au pr\u00e9judice. Un facteur concourant est important s'il a eu une incidence plus que minimale. La causalit\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e avec une pr\u00e9cision scientifique. Il s'agit essentiellement d'une question de fait pratique \u00e0 laquelle on peut mieux r\u00e9pondre par le bon sens ordinaire. Par ailleurs, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de mettre le demandeur dans une situation meilleure que celle o\u00f9 il se serait trouv\u00e9 avant le pr\u00e9judice. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est important non seulement d'\u00e9valuer la situation du demandeur apr\u00e8s le pr\u00e9judice, mais aussi de d\u00e9terminer quelle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 la situation originale . Le pr\u00e9judice subi par le demandeur correspond \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence entre la situation originale du d\u00e9fendeur et sa situation apr\u00e8s le pr\u00e9judice . Si un fait subs\u00e9quent n'avait aucun rapport avec le pr\u00e9judice et avait une incidence sur la situation originale du demandeur, la perte nette n'est pas aussi importante qu'elle semblait de sorte que les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats seraient r\u00e9duits pour tenir compte de cette diff\u00e9rence.\nVII. ANALYSE A. Absence de preuve prima facie [69] En l'esp\u00e8ce, je conclus que les rapports, consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans leur ensemble, entre M. Howell et les FAC au sujet de l'incident concernant le drill et de l'\u00e9chec subs\u00e9quent de l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9 au cours de sous-officier subalterne ne constituaient pas un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 son endroit.\n[70] En ce qui concerne le par. 7a) de la Loi, M. Howell avait \u00e9prouv\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes de genou avant l'incident concernant le drill. Par cons\u00e9quent, il pr\u00e9sentait une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi. Toutefois, les FAC n'ont pas refus\u00e9 de l'employer \u00e0 cause des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui sont survenus durant l'incident concernant le drill. M. Howell a volontairement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de prendre sa retraite des FAC en raison d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements qui se sont produits apr\u00e8s l'incident concernant le drill et pour lesquels il n'existait pas de lien causal avec l'incident en question. En octobre 1995, au moment o\u00f9 sa cote m\u00e9dicale a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9tablie, ce qui lui permettait de reprendre son service normal, M. Howell \u00e9tait dans une large mesure r\u00e9tabli des blessures subies en mars 1995. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, ses fonctions professionnelles n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9es et ses blessures au genou ne l'ont pas emp\u00each\u00e9 d'effectuer autant d'heures suppl\u00e9mentaires qu'il en faisait avant l'intervention. M. Howell et le Dr de Korompay \u00e9taient tous deux d'avis que l'intervention de juillet 1995 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 une r\u00e9ussite. En f\u00e9vrier 1997, bien apr\u00e8s qu'il se soit r\u00e9tabli de l'intervention d'octobre 1995, M. Howell a estim\u00e9 \u00eatre incapable, en raison de ses blessures permanentes au genou, d'ex\u00e9cuter certaines fonctions militaires g\u00e9n\u00e9rales. Au moment de remplir les formulaires n\u00e9cessaires, M. Howell \u00e9tait conscient du fait que les FAC mettraient fin \u00e0 son emploi parce qu'il ne satisferait plus au principe de l'universalit\u00e9 du service. M. Howell a voulu ce r\u00e9sultat, de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu'il a accept\u00e9 la recommandation de son m\u00e9decin de prendre sa retraite des FAC. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses attentes et d\u00e9sirs, les FAC l'ont finalement lib\u00e9r\u00e9 en mars 1998, pour le motif qu'il ne satisfaisait pas au principe de l'universalit\u00e9 du service. La question de l'applicabilit\u00e9 et de la teneur de l'obligation en mati\u00e8re d'universalit\u00e9 du service en mars 1995, ainsi que du contexte dans lequel elle s'inscrivait, ne se pose pas en l'esp\u00e8ce. Le plaignant n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Par ailleurs, m\u00eame s'il l'avait fait, le Tribunal est li\u00e9 par l'arr\u00eat Irvine c. FAC 2003 CFPI 660 (1re inst.), dans lequel la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a statu\u00e9 que l'arr\u00eat Meorin s'applique r\u00e9troactivement aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus avant son prononc\u00e9 en 1999, mais qu'il faut tenir compte, aux fins de son application, du contexte dans lequel s'inscrivait la politique de l'universalit\u00e9 du service en mars 1995. Par cons\u00e9quent, si l'on avait pouss\u00e9 l'analyse jusqu'au stade de l'\u00e9valuation de la d\u00e9fense de l'intim\u00e9e, j'estime, au regard des faits de l'esp\u00e8ce, que l'intim\u00e9e aurait eu du succ\u00e8s dans sa d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur l'universalit\u00e9 du service.\n[71] De plus, les FAC n'ont pas, \u00e0 mon avis, contrevenu au par. 7b) de la Loi. Elles n'ont pas d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 M. Howell en refusant d'acquiescer \u00e0 sa demande concernant le port de son support durant les exercices de drill ou en refusant de l'exempter de ces exercices. M. Howell voulait aller chercher un support dont il n'avait pas besoin, m\u00e9dicalement parlant, pour ex\u00e9cuter sans danger les manuvres. Les officiers des FAC n'ont pas permis \u00e0 M. Howell d'obtenir une note m\u00e9dicale l'excusant des exercices de drill parce qu'il n'avait pas son support, mais la preuve qui m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e est insuffisante pour d\u00e9montrer, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que M. Howell avait besoin du support pour ex\u00e9cuter les exercices en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Dans la matin\u00e9e du jour o\u00f9 l'incident est survenu, M. Howell, quelques heures seulement avant les exercices de drill, a pris part \u00e0 un match agressif de basket-ball sans son support. S'il \u00e9tait en mesure de s'adonner \u00e0 ce genre d'activit\u00e9 physique sans porter son support, il \u00e9tait tout aussi capable de participer aux exercices de drill sans cet appareil. Le fait que M. Howell ait jou\u00e9 un match agressif de basket-ball sans porter de support corrobore l'opinion d'expert des deux chirurgiens orthop\u00e9distes, le Dr Randall et le Dr de Korompay, qui ont tous les deux convenu que le port du support n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire si un d\u00e9lai d'un an s'\u00e9tait \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis l'intervention. Ils ont affirm\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s un tel d\u00e9lai, le support joue un r\u00f4le au niveau du soutien psychologique plut\u00f4t que du soutien m\u00e9canique.\n[72] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, M. Howell n'\u00e9tait pas en droit d'exiger de faire l'objet d'une mesure d'accommodement d'ordre m\u00e9dical r\u00e9sidant dans le port d'un support, en l'absence de fondement objectif. Dans les circonstances, il n'avait pas le droit de tenir bon pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de son moyen d'accommodement pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[73] \u00c0 mon avis, les FAC n'ont pas d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 M. Howell en lui faisant une \u00e9valuation n\u00e9gative dans le rapport concernant le cours de sous-officier subalterne. M. Howell a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un grief et a eu gain de cause. Le rapport a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 \u00e0 sa satisfaction. M. Howell a indiqu\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'il \u00e9tait satisfait de l'\u00e9valuation de cours r\u00e9vis\u00e9e dans laquelle son instructeur disait continuer de nourrir des pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son rendement et de son attitude. En fait, le grief de M. Howell ne portait pas sur l'\u00e9chec au cours, mais plut\u00f4t sur l'\u00e9valuation. En outre, je suis d'avis que, si l'incident concernant le drill n'avait pas eu lieu, M. Howell aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable, pour un certain nombre d'autres raisons, de r\u00e9ussir le cours de sous-officier subalterne. Bien qu'il ait re\u00e7u une note m\u00e9dicale indiquant qu'il \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 suivre le cours, M. Howell \u00e9tait lui-m\u00eame sceptique. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il allait [TRADUCTION] faire de [son] mieux . De plus, le cours de sous-officier subalterne, comparativement au cours de chef subalterne qu'il avait suivi auparavant, comportait un volet infanterie qui aurait exig\u00e9 beaucoup plus d'aptitudes physiques, et il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 son unit\u00e9 (RTU) lors du cours de sous-officier subalterne entrepris en septembre 1994. Enfin, la capacit\u00e9 de M. Howell de r\u00e9ussir les \u00e9l\u00e9ments physiques du cours ont \u00e9t\u00e9 compromises par sa chute du 7 mars 1995 sur une plaque de glace mais, avant tout et par-dessus tout, par sa chute du 27 mars 1995, t\u00eate premi\u00e8re, dans l'escalier.\n[74] Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant et la Commission n'ont pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination aux termes des paragraphes 7a) et 7b) de la Loi.\nB. Causalit\u00e9 - blessures de juillet 1995 [75] Enfin, m\u00eame si l'analyse nous avait amen\u00e9s jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de l'\u00e9valuation du quantum des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, M. Howell n'aurait pas, \u00e0 mon avis, r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer le bien-fond\u00e9 de l'indemnit\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e. Selon moi, M. Howell n'a pas subi un pr\u00e9judice important aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s avoir particip\u00e9 aux exercices de drill. Son genou lui faisait mal et \u00e9tait enfl\u00e9. Toutefois, il ne s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la SEM que le lendemain matin. En fait, il a vaqu\u00e9 \u00e0 ses activit\u00e9s de la journ\u00e9e sans porter de support. Son comportement lors de l'incident contraste avec celui qu'il a manifest\u00e9 lors de sa chute du 27 mars 1995, t\u00eate premi\u00e8re, dans l'escalier. Il s'agissait d'une blessure grave. M. Howell est all\u00e9 voir aussit\u00f4t un m\u00e9decin qui lui a dit qu'il \u00e9tait incapable de poursuivre le cours. Sa cote m\u00e9dicale a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e. Si M. Howell avait subi une blessure d\u00e9bilitante par suite d'exercices de drill de 40 minutes, il se serait aussit\u00f4t rendu \u00e0 la SEM. \u00c0 mon avis, l'incident n'a pas contribu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on appr\u00e9ciable aux probl\u00e8mes que M. Howell \u00e9prouvait d\u00e9j\u00e0 avec son genou droit. Si j'examine ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents m\u00e9dicaux complexes en me fondant sur le bon sens, je conclus que l'incident concernant le drill n'a eu qu'un effet minime sur l'\u00e9tat de son genou droit. N'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de l'incident concernant le drill, je conclus, compte tenu de ses blessures de genou, que M. Howell, m\u00e9dicalement parlant, se serait retrouv\u00e9 \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s dans la m\u00eame situation que celle o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait apr\u00e8s l'incident.\n[76] Le Dr Randall confirme que les personnes qui, comme M. Howell, subissent une chirurgie reconstructive du genou reconstatent ult\u00e9rieurement des modifications d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ratives ainsi qu'une usure attribuable \u00e0 la reprise des activit\u00e9s \u00e0 fort impact \u00e0 la suite de l'intervention. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Howell ind\u00e9pendamment de l'incident concernant le drill, aurait, compte tenu de la reconstruction de son ligament crois\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur en 1991 et de la nature de ses fonctions au sein des FAC, subi des modifications d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ratives dans sa carri\u00e8re subs\u00e9quente au sein des FAC. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que la blessure observ\u00e9e par le Dr de Korompay en juin et juillet 1995 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par sa chute du 27 mars 1995, t\u00eate premi\u00e8re, dans l'escalier. En fait, le Dr de Korompay a volontiers reconnu qu'une chute aurait pu entra\u00eener les dommages qu'il a observ\u00e9s en juin et juillet 1995. Je fais mienne l'opinion du Dr Randall selon laquelle il \u00e9tait peu probable que M. Howell ait pu souffrir d'une importante l\u00e9sion m\u00e9niscale sans un traumatisme aigu comme celui qu'il a subi lors de sa chute du 27 mars 1995.\nVIII. CONCLUSION [77] L'incident concernant le drill de 1995 et l'\u00e9chec subs\u00e9quent au cours de sous-officier subalterne ne constituaient pas des actes discriminatoires aux termes du par. 7a) de la Loi. Ces faits n'ont pas non plus entra\u00een\u00e9 la cessation d'emploi de M. Howell au sein des FAC en 1998, au regard des incidents survenus ant\u00e9rieurement ou dans l'intervalle. C'est plut\u00f4t la chute du 26 mars 1995 qui, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, a n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 l'intervention chirurgicale de juillet 1995. M. Howell \u00e9tait remis de cette intervention en octobre 1995. Par la suite, l'incident de la g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice (avril 1996) a aggrav\u00e9 ses blessures au genou et l'a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre volontairement des mesures pour obtenir sa lib\u00e9ration des FAC.\n[78] L'incident concernant le drill de 1995 et l'\u00e9chec au cours de sous-officier subalterne ne constituent pas des actes discriminatoires aux termes du par. 7b) de la Loi. Il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire, m\u00e9dicalement parlant, que M. Howell porte son support durant l'incident, et tout refus des FAC de lui permettre d'aller chercher son support ne constituait pas un acte discriminatoire. M. Howell \u00e9tait satisfait du rapport de cours qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sentation de son grief. \u00c0 mon avis, les FAC n'ont pas omis de composer avec la d\u00e9ficience de M. Howell. Au contraire, le sgt Thompson a fait au moins deux tentatives pour tenir compte des demandes de M. Howell avant l'incident concernant le drill. En outre, tout au cours de la carri\u00e8re de M. Howell, et durant les ann\u00e9es 1995 et 1996, les FAC ont tenu compte des soins physiques que son genou exigeait.\n[79] Par cons\u00e9quent, je rejette la plainte de M. Howell dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9.\n[80] \u00c0 la demande des avocats, je n'aborde pas dans la pr\u00e9sente la question des d\u00e9pens. Les parties peuvent en discuter entre elles. Je conserve ma comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard pour le cas o\u00f9 elles ne seraient pas en mesure d'en venir \u00e0 une entente.\nShirish P.

L'explication de l'intim\u00e9e\n[1] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que l'intim\u00e9e (Bell) a exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience (alcoolisme) en mettant fin \u00e0 son emploi, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l'art. 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. \u00c0 l'audience, le plaignant n'\u00e9tait pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat, contrairement \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (Commission) a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas participer \u00e0 l'audience.\nI. FAITS [2] Le plaignant a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler chez Bell en 1973 comme technicien. En 1990, il occupait le poste de directeur, Installations et r\u00e9parations.\n[3] En 1996, Bell a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une division appel\u00e9e Gateways qui traitait exclusivement avec les principaux clients de la compagnie. Le mandat de Gateways consistait \u00e0 vendre, installer et entretenir du mat\u00e9riel de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications. Gateways \u00e9tait exploit\u00e9e \u00e0 titre d'entreprise autonome au sein de Bell. Toutefois, son maintien \u00e9tait conditionnel \u00e0 ce que l'entreprise fasse des profits, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi Bell mettrait le projet au rancart. Afin d'am\u00e9liorer les chances de succ\u00e8s de l'entreprise, Bell y a mut\u00e9 un certain nombre de ses meilleurs techniciens et gestionnaires - des membres de l'\u00e9lite.\n[4] Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 mut\u00e9 \u00e0 la division Gateways en 1997. On distinguait au sein de Gateways quatre paliers de gestion allant de D (le moins \u00e9lev\u00e9) \u00e0 A (le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9). Le plaignant se situait au palier D. Ses fonctions impliquaient la surveillance de 10 \u00e0 15 techniciens qui installaient ou r\u00e9paraient du mat\u00e9riel chez les clients. Les directeurs au palier D travaillaient de fa\u00e7on autonome. Un grand nombre d'entre eux, dont le plaignant, \u00e9taient des t\u00e9l\u00e9travailleurs, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'ils travaillaient \u00e0 partir de leur r\u00e9sidence. Le plaignant s'\u00e9tait vu attribuer un espace dans un des immeubles de Bell, mais il ne s'y rendait qu'occasionnellement. La compagnie lui fournissait un v\u00e9hicule qu'il utilisait pour se rendre aux endroits o\u00f9 ses techniciens travaillaient. Les directeurs aux paliers C et D se r\u00e9unissaient p\u00e9riodiquement soit dans les bureaux de Bell, soit \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur (p. ex., dans des restaurants).\n[5] Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience qu'il avait eu un probl\u00e8me de d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'alcool pendant la majeure partie de sa vie adulte. Bell offre un programme d'aide \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s aux prises avec un certain nombre de probl\u00e8mes personnels comme l'abus d'alcool et d'autres drogues. En 1990, sous les auspices de ce programme, le plaignant a suivi sa premi\u00e8re cure de d\u00e9sintoxication, dont le co\u00fbt a \u00e9t\u00e9 assum\u00e9 par Bell. Il s'est absent\u00e9 du travail pendant environ trois mois. Le traitement a \u00e9t\u00e9 un succ\u00e8s.\n[6] En 1995, le plaignant a recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 boire. Il n'a pas averti Bell que son probl\u00e8me d'alcool avait refait surface; toutefois, en 1997, la haute direction a eu vent de rumeurs voulant qu'il consomme de l'alcool de fa\u00e7on excessive. Le plaignant a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 convoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 une rencontre avec un cadre sup\u00e9rieur de palier B, John Moon, au sujet de ces rumeurs. Il a convaincu M. Moon que les all\u00e9gations \u00e9taient fausses et non fond\u00e9es.\n[7] Peu apr\u00e8s, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 une \u00e9quipe de Gateways qui \u00e9tait sous la surveillance de Garry Pr\u00e9vost, un directeur de palier C. Le plaignant a inform\u00e9 M. Pr\u00e9vost qu'il avait r\u00e9cemment rencontr\u00e9 M. Moon \u00e0 propos d'un probl\u00e8me personnel sans pr\u00e9ciser de quoi il s'agissait. Le plaignant soup\u00e7onne M. Moon d'avoir divulgu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Pr\u00e9vost tous les d\u00e9tails au sujet de la rencontre, mais il n'a fourni aucune preuve directe \u00e0 l'appui de sa pr\u00e9tention. En fait, le plaignant reconna\u00eet que le seul probl\u00e8me personnel dont il ait jamais discut\u00e9 avec M. Pr\u00e9vost concernait certaines difficult\u00e9s d'ordre conjugal.\n[8] M. Pr\u00e9vost a ult\u00e9rieurement fait allusion \u00e0 ces probl\u00e8mes dans l'\u00e9valuation annuelle de 1998 du plaignant, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie en f\u00e9vrier 1999. M. Pr\u00e9vost a signal\u00e9 que le plaignant avait obtenu de tr\u00e8s bons r\u00e9sultats dans son secteur malgr\u00e9 une p\u00e9riode tr\u00e8s perturbante personnellement . Les \u00e9valuations de 1997 et de 1998 \u00e9taient bonnes dans l'ensemble. M. Pr\u00e9vost a fait remarquer que le plaignant \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 \u00eatre promu au palier suivant.\n[9] En 1999, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 mut\u00e9 \u00e0 une \u00e9quipe dirig\u00e9e par Jean-Guy Boucher, un directeur de palier C. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Boucher a dit avoir eu un entretien avec M. Pr\u00e9vost au sujet du plaignant \u00e0 l'occasion de sa mutation, pr\u00e9cisant que celui-ci avait port\u00e9 exclusivement sur le rendement de l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9. M. Pr\u00e9vost n'a aucunement fait mention, lors de cet entretien, des probl\u00e8mes personnels du plaignant. Tous les directeurs relevant de M. Pr\u00e9vost ont par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 mut\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9quipe de M. Boucher, selon lequel on n'a jamais abord\u00e9 de questions personnelles pour aucun d'entre eux.\n[10] En 1999, les techniciens syndiqu\u00e9s de Gateways ont d\u00e9clench\u00e9 une gr\u00e8ve. Les directeurs de palier D ont alors pris la rel\u00e8ve. Ils travaillaient en tandem, se rendant chez les clients pour installer ou r\u00e9parer du mat\u00e9riel. Un des directeurs s'est plaint \u00e0 M. Boucher que le plaignant sentait l'alcool et a demand\u00e9 qu'elle ne soit plus jumel\u00e9e \u00e0 lui. M. Boucher \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par la perspective qu'un membre de son \u00e9quipe conduise avec les facult\u00e9s affaiblies pendant le travail. Plut\u00f4t que de rencontrer le plaignant pour lui faire part de la plainte, M. Boucher a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de demander au service de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 interne de Bell de faire enqu\u00eate. Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 surveill\u00e9 \u00e0 son insu pendant plusieurs jours, puis un rapport indiquant qu'aucun probl\u00e8me d'alcool notable n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 constat\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni \u00e0 M. Boucher. On avait vu le plaignant boire une bi\u00e8re ou deux pendant le d\u00e9jeuner, mais sans plus. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Boucher a jug\u00e9 que l'affaire \u00e9tait close.\n[11] Le plaignant a confirm\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'il faisait alors des pieds et des mains pour dissimuler son alcoolisme. Il consommait beaucoup \u00e0 la maison, mais non lorsqu'il \u00e9tait au travail. Avant toute r\u00e9union pr\u00e9vue avec d'autres directeurs, il s'abstenait de boire et prenait des m\u00e9dicaments sp\u00e9ciaux contre le tremblement. Il a admis qu'il ne s'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au travail les yeux vitreux et que sa d\u00e9marche n'avait rien d'anormal. Il parlait de fa\u00e7on coh\u00e9rente. Essentiellement, il ne s'est jamais pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ivre au travail. Cependant, m\u00eame s'il ne buvait pas pendant le service, il d\u00e9gageait parfois une odeur r\u00e9siduelle d'alcool en raison de ses exc\u00e8s de la veille. C'est probablement ce qui avait mis la puce \u00e0 l'oreille de sa coll\u00e8gue durant la p\u00e9riode de gr\u00e8ve.\n[12] Au cours de 1999, certaines lacunes dans la mani\u00e8re dont le plaignant g\u00e9rait son \u00e9quipe ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 devenir \u00e9videntes. Il ne se rendait plus quotidiennement chez les clients pour y faire de la surveillance et, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, son style de gestion n'\u00e9tait pas serr\u00e9 , selon M. Boucher. Il arrivait en retard aux r\u00e9unions pr\u00e9vues avec d'autres directeurs ou, pire encore, brillait par son absence. Durant son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il s'effor\u00e7ait de ne pas assister aux r\u00e9unions qui avaient lieu dans des restaurants ou des brasseries afin de ne pas succomber \u00e0 la tentation de boire en pr\u00e9sence de ses coll\u00e8gues.\n[13] Au d\u00e9but de 2000, M. Boucher a rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant pour discuter de son \u00e9valuation de 1999, qui \u00e9tait en voie d'\u00eatre \u00e9tablie. M. Boucher a abord\u00e9 avec le plaignant ses probl\u00e8mes de rendement. Il a \u00e9galement avou\u00e9 en confidence au plaignant que des agents de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9s durant la gr\u00e8ve de faire enqu\u00eate pour d\u00e9terminer s'il faisait une consommation excessive d'alcool, mais que le rapport avait \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gatif. Le plaignant a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Boucher l'assurance que ce constat \u00e9tait exact et qu'il n'avait pas de probl\u00e8me d'alcool. Le plaignant a expliqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e9tait celle que donne normalement un alcoolique qui refuse de reconna\u00eetre sa d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 l'alcool.\n[14] \u00c0 l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2000, la situation du plaignant s'est d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e. Il s'occupait seul de sa fille, sa conjointe \u00e9tant absente du foyer pour une p\u00e9riode d'environ deux semaines; il avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9, par cons\u00e9quent, de s'abstenir totalement de boire pendant son absence. Le 9 ao\u00fbt, il \u00e9tait fort mal en point en raison des sympt\u00f4mes d'abstinence. Conscient du fait qu'il avait besoin d'aide, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de se tourner vers M. Boucher. T\u00f4t ce matin-l\u00e0, le plaignant lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 son domicile. M. Boucher a constat\u00e9 \u00e0 son ton de voix qu'il \u00e9tait en crise. Le plaignant a confi\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Boucher qu'il avait un probl\u00e8me d'alcool et qu'il d\u00e9sirait obtenir l'aide de Bell pour r\u00e9gler ce probl\u00e8me. M. Boucher a rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant et l'a amen\u00e9 directement voir le Groupe de gestion d'invalidit\u00e9 (GGI) de Bell, dont les bureaux \u00e9taient au centre-ville de Montr\u00e9al. Le GGI \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 de la gestion des avantages des employ\u00e9s de Bell au titre de la sant\u00e9, notamment du traitement des employ\u00e9s aux prises avec un probl\u00e8me d'abus d'alcool ou d'autres drogues.\n[15] Chemin faisant, le plaignant a avou\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Boucher qu'il \u00e9tait un alcoolique et qu'il avait besoin d'aide. Le plaignant a expliqu\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait par crainte qu'on remarque son probl\u00e8me d'alcool qu'il n'avait pas assist\u00e9 \u00e0 certaines r\u00e9unions avec ses coll\u00e8gues. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Boucher a indiqu\u00e9 que le plaignant avait aussi admis qu'il \u00e9prouvait certaines difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res en raison de son alcoolisme et que celles-ci l'avaient incit\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une fausse r\u00e9clamation de frais. Le plaignant a cat\u00e9goriquement ni\u00e9 cette all\u00e9gation lors de son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l'audience.\n[16] Le plaignant a rencontr\u00e9 un m\u00e9decin faisant partie du GGI qui l'a aussit\u00f4t orient\u00e9 vers un programme de traitement. Le programme consistait en un s\u00e9jour en \u00e9tablissement de trois semaines suivi de s\u00e9ances de traitements d'une demi-journ\u00e9e \u00e9chelonn\u00e9es sur quatre semaines auxquelles il se rendait \u00e0 partir de chez lui, puis de s\u00e9ances de th\u00e9rapie de groupe r\u00e9parties sur trois mois. Le traitement a \u00e9t\u00e9 couronn\u00e9 de succ\u00e8s et le plaignant a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 ce jour \u00e0 surmonter son probl\u00e8me d'alcool. Le co\u00fbt du traitement a \u00e9t\u00e9 assum\u00e9 par Bell.\n[17] Le centre de d\u00e9sintoxication avait donn\u00e9 instruction au plaignant de ne pas communiquer avec son employeur, y compris M. Boucher, au cours du traitement. \u00c0 la fin de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape, soit le 26 septembre 2000, le m\u00e9decin du plaignant a d\u00e9livr\u00e9 un certificat autorisant ce dernier \u00e0 retourner au travail le 2 octobre 2000. Le m\u00eame jour, le plaignant a \u00e9cout\u00e9 un message enregistr\u00e9 sur son r\u00e9pondeur provenant de Rachel Turcotte, une repr\u00e9sentante du Centre de d\u00e9veloppement des employ\u00e9s (CDE) de Bell, aussi appel\u00e9 Carrefour Carri\u00e8re. Le CDE offrait de la formation et des services de consultation aux employ\u00e9s de Bell qui avaient perdu leur emploi tout en agissant comme service d'aiguillage vers d'autres postes au sein de la compagnie. Mme Turcotte informait le plaignant qu'il pouvait recourir aux services du CDE \u00e0 compter du 10 octobre 2000. Cette nouvelle a abasourdi le plaignant qui a aussit\u00f4t communiqu\u00e9 avec M. Boucher. Ce dernier a rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant et lui a confirm\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi pour un d\u00e9part volontaire . Le plaignant allait \u00eatre r\u00e9affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Carrefour Carri\u00e8re pour une p\u00e9riode de trois mois. S'il ne r\u00e9ussissait pas \u00e0 d\u00e9nicher un autre emploi chez Bell au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, il n'aurait d'autre choix que de prendre une retraite anticip\u00e9e. Des avantages sp\u00e9ciaux bonifi\u00e9s lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts en \u00e9change d'une retraite pr\u00e9coce. On lui a dit que les prestations de retraite normalement consenties seraient sensiblement augment\u00e9es et qu'il recevrait une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 quatre mois de salaire. De toute \u00e9vidence, cette nouvelle a eu pour effet d'affoler le plaignant, alors qu'il venait tout juste de terminer avec succ\u00e8s le volet clinique du programme de traitement de sa toxicomanie alcoolique.\n[18] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Boucher a relat\u00e9 les circonstances qui ont men\u00e9 au renvoi du plaignant de chez Gateways. En 1996, on d\u00e9nombrait entre 550 et 600 employ\u00e9s au sein de la division Gateways du Qu\u00e9bec de Bell. En tant qu'entreprise, Gateways ne s'est pas r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e rentable. En 2003, ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 la division a \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement abolie, l'effectif ne comptait plus qu'environ 300 employ\u00e9s. L'\u00e9quipe de M. Boucher, qui comprenait \u00e0 une certaine \u00e9poque quelque 19 directeurs et 250 techniciens, n'\u00e9tait alors form\u00e9e que de 11 directeurs et 125 techniciens. Dans l'ensemble, selon des estimations mod\u00e9r\u00e9es de M. Boucher, plus de 20 000 employ\u00e9s de Bell ont quitt\u00e9 l'entreprise depuis 1995. Ayant d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu'elle avait trop de cadres, la compagnie s'est d'abord efforc\u00e9e de r\u00e9duire leur nombre au moyen d'un programme d'encouragement au d\u00e9part volontaire qui comprenait des prestations de retraite anticip\u00e9e et d'importants bonis. Cependant, comme le nombre de directeurs ayant d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'accepter ces offres \u00e9tait insuffisant, la compagnie a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de remercier certains de ses cadres. Les employ\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi cibl\u00e9s ont eu droit \u00e0 des avantages similaires et ont continu\u00e9, curieusement, d'\u00eatre qualifi\u00e9s de retrait\u00e9s volontaires dans la documentation fournie aux int\u00e9ress\u00e9s.\n[19] C'est dans ce contexte que M. Boucher a re\u00e7u \u00e0 sa r\u00e9sidence durant ses vacances d'\u00e9t\u00e9 en juillet 2000 un appel de son propre surveillant, un directeur de palier B nomm\u00e9 Pierre Moody. M. Moody lui a expliqu\u00e9 que cinq postes de cadre devaient \u00eatre supprim\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9gion du Qu\u00e9bec, dont deux au sein de l'\u00e9quipe de M. Boucher et deux autres dans une autre \u00e9quipe qu'il g\u00e9rait provisoirement. MM. Moody et Boucher ont indiqu\u00e9 lors de leur t\u00e9moignage qu'ils avaient rapidement examin\u00e9 la liste des directeurs et avaient choisi, en l'espace de cinq minutes, le plaignant comme premi\u00e8re personne \u00e0 renvoyer. Ils ont tous deux exprim\u00e9 l'avis que tous les directeurs, y compris le plaignant, \u00e9taient des employ\u00e9s dont le rendement \u00e9tait exceptionnel; apr\u00e8s tout, les employ\u00e9s de Gateways faisaient partie de l'\u00e9lite de Bell. Toutefois, ils ont \u00e9galement convenu que le plaignant \u00e9tait sans nul doute l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment le plus faible au sein du groupe d'\u00e9lite. MM. Boucher et Moody avaient discut\u00e9 par le pass\u00e9 du fait que le plaignant n'exer\u00e7ait pas une surveillance aussi serr\u00e9e que les autres directeurs sur son \u00e9quipe.\n[20] Toutefois, les deux directeurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incapables de s'entendre sur le choix du deuxi\u00e8me directeur \u00e0 remercier. M. Boucher a finalement convaincu la haute direction de tenir compte du fait qu'un autre directeur de palier D avait \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 quelques mois auparavant. M. Moody a \u00e9galement renvoy\u00e9 M. Pr\u00e9vost (palier C) et deux directeurs int\u00e9rimaires de palier D ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9s dans leur poste permanent de niveau inf\u00e9rieur. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'objectif de cinq employ\u00e9s de M. Moody a \u00e9t\u00e9 atteint. Dans l'\u00e9quipe de M. Boucher, seul le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 remerci\u00e9.\n[21] Il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu d'annoncer ces d\u00e9parts simultan\u00e9ment au cours de la deuxi\u00e8me semaine d'ao\u00fbt 2000. Toutefois, M. Boucher a inform\u00e9 M. Moody que le plaignant suivait un traitement pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 un probl\u00e8me personnel grave . Par cons\u00e9quent, MM. Boucher et Moody ont jug\u00e9 qu'il ne conviendrait pas de lui faire part de la nouvelle \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. On l'informerait de la d\u00e9cision lors de son retour au travail. MM. Moody et Boucher ont exprim\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience des regrets en ce qui concerne la mani\u00e8re brutale dont le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de son cong\u00e9diement. M. Boucher avait l'intention d'informer le plaignant de la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 son retour au travail lors d'une rencontre en t\u00eate \u00e0 t\u00eate. Malheureusement, Mme Turcotte, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9venue de l'orientation imminente du plaignant vers Carrefour Carri\u00e8re, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de lui donner un coup de fil pour lui souhaiter la bienvenue au centre. Elle ne savait pas qu'il n'avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de son renvoi.\n[22] Durant son affectation \u00e0 Carrefour Carri\u00e8re, le plaignant a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les ateliers obligatoires et aux s\u00e9ances de formation. Cependant, il a reconnu qu'il avait consult\u00e9 le service de placement professionnel de Carrefour Carri\u00e8re une fois par semaine tout au plus et qu'il lui \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 l'occasion de sauter une semaine. Durant son affectation de trois mois \u00e0 Carrefour Carri\u00e8re, il n'a pas postul\u00e9 d'autres postes chez Bell. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas les qualit\u00e9s requises pour occuper les postes affich\u00e9s. De plus, il \u00e9tait s\u00fbr qu'aucun autre cadre ne l'embaucherait, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que son dossier personnel indiquerait clairement qu'il venait de prendre un cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical prolong\u00e9. On ne manquerait pas au cours de l'entrevue d'emploi de s'enqu\u00e9rir du motif de son absence. Il aurait alors \u00e9t\u00e9 contraint de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler son probl\u00e8me d'alcool et le fait qu'il venait tout juste de suivre une cure de d\u00e9sintoxication. En outre, le cadre dont il relevait ant\u00e9rieurement ferait probablement part de son probl\u00e8me m\u00e9dical au gestionnaire recruteur et serait consult\u00e9 avant toute d\u00e9cision d'embauche. Par cons\u00e9quent, personne chez Bell n'allait jamais le r\u00e9embaucher.\n[23] L'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que les craintes du plaignant \u00e9taient non fond\u00e9es et injustifi\u00e9es. Durant son t\u00e9moignage, M. Boucher a indiqu\u00e9 qu'un directeur qui pose sa candidature \u00e0 un autre poste au sein de la compagnie n'a qu'\u00e0 produire son curriculum vitae. Le gestionnaire recruteur pourrait, \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de l'entrevue, demander de prendre connaissance des \u00e9valuations annuelles de rendement ant\u00e9rieures du candidat. Les absences de l'employ\u00e9 justifieraient de plus amples recherches uniquement dans le cas o\u00f9 celles-ci auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie de plusieurs absences r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es et de courte dur\u00e9e. Une seule absence prolong\u00e9e serait probablement consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant li\u00e9e \u00e0 des motifs m\u00e9dicaux et n'entrerait pas en ligne de compte dans la d\u00e9cision d'embauche. Le GGI ne divulgue jamais de d\u00e9tails au sujet du dossier m\u00e9dical d'un employ\u00e9. De surcro\u00eet, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la politique de la compagnie, il est interdit \u00e0 un cadre qui en vient d'une fa\u00e7on ou d'une autre \u00e0 \u00eatre au courant de l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 d'un candidat de tenir compte de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment dans la d\u00e9cision d'embauche.\n[24] Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que l'intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi en d\u00e9pit du fait qu'il existait d'autres mesures de dotation possibles, et que, par cons\u00e9quent, le principal facteur qui a motiv\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de le renvoyer \u00e9tait sa d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'alcool. Le plaignant a cit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement le cas d'un coll\u00e8gue, Michel Lecompte, qui occupait un poste de directeur de palier D chez Gateways. Alors que l'employeur songeait \u00e0 supprimer cinq postes de cadre au sein de la division du Qu\u00e9bec de Gateways, M. Lecompte avait demand\u00e9 d'\u00eatre mut\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre division de Bell - D\u00e9veloppement technologique et r\u00e9seau (Technology and Network - T&N) (DT et R). Cependant, la mutation de M. Lecompte a \u00e9t\u00e9 retard\u00e9e jusqu'en d\u00e9cembre 2000. Si elle avait eu lieu auparavant, M. Boucher aurait pu atteindre son objectif de r\u00e9duction de personnel sans renvoyer le plaignant. De plus, le d\u00e9part de M. Lecompte a eu pour effet de cr\u00e9er une vacance qui aurait pu \u00eatre combl\u00e9e en offrant le poste au plaignant, ce qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\n[25] L'intim\u00e9e conteste la pr\u00e9tention du plaignant. M. Boucher a fait remarquer que M. Lecompte g\u00e9rait l'\u00e9quipe la plus chevronn\u00e9e de la division Gateways, celle qu'on qualifiait officieusement d'\u00e9quipe-choc (SWAT Team). Son groupe \u00e9tait constitu\u00e9 des techniciens les plus comp\u00e9tents et sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s, ceux qui s'occupaient des travaux d'installation d'envergure. M. Lecompte se devait d'assurer une gestion tr\u00e8s rigoureuse de cette \u00e9quipe, qui exigeait une surveillance \u00e9troite \u00e0 tous les \u00e9gards. En outre, \u00e0 titre de chef de l'\u00e9quipe-choc, M. Lecompte devait chaque jour traiter directement avec des clients, contrairement aux autres directeurs. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Lecompte a indiqu\u00e9 que, \u00e0 son avis, tout directeur de palier D aurait pu faire son travail; toutefois, M. Boucher n'\u00e9tait pas de cet avis et a pr\u00e9tendu que M. Lecompte n'\u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre tout simplement pas conscient de ses propres talents. Au dire de M. Boucher, au plus trois directeurs parmi la quinzaine que comptait son service \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque avaient les qualit\u00e9s requises pour diriger l'\u00e9quipe-choc. Le plaignant n'\u00e9tait pas du nombre.\n[26] La demande de mutation de M. Lecompte a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue vers la fin d'ao\u00fbt ou au d\u00e9but de septembre, soit bien apr\u00e8s la date en juillet o\u00f9, selon l'intim\u00e9e, la d\u00e9cision de renvoyer le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise. M. Boucher a jug\u00e9 que M. Lecompte \u00e9tait un atout trop pr\u00e9cieux pour l'\u00e9quipe; par cons\u00e9quent, sa demande initiale de mutation a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. Vers le mois d'octobre 2000, un nouveau directeur de palier C, Christiane Fontaine, a officiellement remplac\u00e9 M. Boucher. M. Lecompte a profit\u00e9 de l'occasion pour pr\u00e9senter une nouvelle demande de mutation, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2000. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Boucher a affirm\u00e9 que, m\u00eame s'il ne g\u00e9rait plus cette \u00e9quipe, il a activement aid\u00e9 Mme Fontaine durant la p\u00e9riode de transition. Par cons\u00e9quent, c'est lui qui a approuv\u00e9 la mutation de M. Lecompte. C'est \u00e9galement M. Boucher qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de remplacer M. Lecompte par un autre directeur qui faisait d\u00e9j\u00e0 partie de l'\u00e9quipe, Ronald Gagnon, l'un des rares directeurs de palier D qui, selon M. Boucher, \u00e9taient en mesure de diriger l'\u00e9quipe-choc. M. Boucher a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 question de rappeler le plaignant pour remplacer M. Lecompte. Le plaignant n'avait tout simplement pas les qualit\u00e9s requises.\n[27] \u00c0 l'automne 2000, Bell a diffus\u00e9 une nouvelle directive pour 2001. Cette directive exigeait de retrancher cinq autres postes de cadre dans la section de M. Moody. C'est la raison pour laquelle l'abolition officielle de l'ancien poste de M. Gagnon, qui \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, a \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e \u00e0 janvier 2001 afin qu'elle puisse \u00eatre comptabilis\u00e9e parmi les postes supprim\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n'y avait au sein de la division aucun poste vacant auquel le plaignant aurait pu \u00eatre r\u00e9affect\u00e9. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la directive, quatre autres directeurs de niveau D faisant partie de la section de M. Boucher ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remerci\u00e9s en 2001. Au dire de M. Boucher, il s'agissait de cadres chevronn\u00e9s et exceptionnels. Aucun d'entre eux n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9 apr\u00e8s les d\u00e9parts forc\u00e9s.\n[28] L'affectation du plaignant \u00e0 Carrefour Carri\u00e8re a pris fin le 2 janvier 2001. Comme il n'avait alors pas trouv\u00e9 un autre poste chez Bell, le seul choix qui s'offrait \u00e0 lui \u00e9tait d'accepter les primes de retraite bonifi\u00e9es. Entre janvier et mai 2001, il a fourni certains services \u00e0 Bell \u00e0 titre d'entrepreneur priv\u00e9. En novembre 2001, le Casino de Montr\u00e9al l'a embauch\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux machines \u00e0 sous. Il travaille encore au Casino, mais uniquement \u00e0 titre d'employ\u00e9 occasionnel. Ses postes de travail de douze heures sont plus longs que ceux qu'il effectuait chez Bell et il travaille souvent en soir\u00e9e ou la fin de semaine. Selon le plaignant, les employ\u00e9s du Casino ont peu de chances d'avancement.\nII. CADRE JURIDIQUE [29] Le fait de renvoyer un employ\u00e9 pour un motif de distinction illicite constitue un acte discriminatoire, aux termes de l'art. 7 de la Loi. L'alcoolisme est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une d\u00e9ficience et constitue, par cons\u00e9quent, un motif de distinction illicite (voir Crouse c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 maritime C.S.L. Inc., [2001] D.C.D.P. no 12, au par.56 (T.C.D.P.) (QL).\n[30] Comme la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada l'a indiqu\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O'Malley c. Simpson Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536 au par. 28, il incombe \u00e0 la partie plaignante d'\u00e9tablir l'existence d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Dans ce contexte, la preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e. Une fois que l'existence d'une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il appartient \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de fournir une explication raisonnable de l'acte qui lui est reproch\u00e9. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, il revient \u00e0 la partie plaignante de d\u00e9montrer que l'explication n'est qu'un pr\u00e9texte (voir Basi c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (no 1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 au par. 38474 (T.C.D.P.); Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204 aux par. 17 \u00e0 23)).\n[31] Dans l'arr\u00eat Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale fait remarquer au par. 7 que, pour que la plainte soit fond\u00e9e, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la discrimination constitue le seul motif des actes reproch\u00e9s. Il suffit qu'elle soit l'un des facteurs qui ont jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de l'employeur.\nIII. ANALYSE A. Preuve prima facie [32] Le plaignant a prouv\u00e9 l'all\u00e9gation formul\u00e9e dans sa plainte, \u00e0 savoir qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de son renvoi alors qu'il suivait un cure de d\u00e9sintoxication. L'information que Bell poss\u00e9dait au sujet des probl\u00e8mes d'alcoolisme du plaignant remontaient \u00e0 1990, l'ann\u00e9e de sa premi\u00e8re cure de d\u00e9sintoxication. Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul membre de l'\u00e9quipe de M. Boucher qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 dans le cadre de la vague de suppressions d'emplois de 2000. Le renvoi a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 dans les semaines qui ont suivi l'aveu d'alcoolisme fait \u00e0 M. Boucher par le plaignant. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Lecompte a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il avait demand\u00e9 d'\u00eatre mut\u00e9 du poste qu'il occupait chez Gateways, mais que sa demande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e quelques jours seulement avant que le plaignant soit inform\u00e9 de son renvoi. Le plaignant soutient que Bell aurait pu d\u00e9cider d'accepter la demande de M. Lecompte et d'annuler le projet de renvoi dans son cas. Au dire du plaignant, la d\u00e9cision de proc\u00e9der autrement d\u00e9montre que les motifs sous-jacents aux actes pos\u00e9s par Bell n'\u00e9taient pas vraiment li\u00e9s \u00e0 la r\u00e9duction du personnel et que la d\u00e9cision de la compagnie de le renvoyer \u00e9tait attribuable, du moins en partie, \u00e0 son probl\u00e8me d'alcool.\n[33] Je suis convaincu que ces all\u00e9gations, si on leur ajoute foi, seraient compl\u00e8tes et suffisantes pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9e. L'existence d'une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\nB. L'explication de l'intim\u00e9e [34] L'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 dans le cadre de vastes suppressions d'emploi chez Bell. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi en raison de certaines lacunes dans son rendement par rapport \u00e0 celui de ses coll\u00e8gues. MM. Boucher et Moody ont tous deux affirm\u00e9 lors de leur t\u00e9moignage que la d\u00e9cision de renvoyer le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par eux exclusivement et que son probl\u00e8me d'alcool n'avait pas du tout jou\u00e9 dans cette d\u00e9cision. \u00c0 mon avis, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins cr\u00e9dibles et francs et j'ai conclu, pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-dessous, que leur explication \u00e9tait raisonnable. Cela ne veut pas dire pour autant que le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant \u00e9tait faux ou trompeur. Au contraire, j'ai trouv\u00e9 que le plaignant \u00e9tait une personne sinc\u00e8re et d'une candeur qui fait plaisir \u00e0 voir. Mais, \u00e0 vrai dire, les faits, tels qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience, ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 corroborer l'explication de l'intim\u00e9e.\n[35] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le, sans conteste, que Bell, dans sa tentative pour faire face \u00e0 une concurrence sans cesse croissante, a sensiblement r\u00e9duit ses effectifs au fil des ann\u00e9es. Le personnel cadre n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9pargn\u00e9 par ces r\u00e9ductions. Le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul \u00e0 \u00eatre vis\u00e9 par cette strat\u00e9gie de d\u00e9parts forc\u00e9s. Un directeur de palier C a lui aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps que lui, et deux directeurs int\u00e9rimaires de palier D ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9s dans le poste de rang inf\u00e9rieur qu'ils occupaient auparavant. Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus au cours des mois et des ann\u00e9es qui ont suivi sont encore plus r\u00e9v\u00e9lateurs : chez Gateways, cinq autres postes de cadre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 supprim\u00e9s en 2001 puis cinq ou six autres en 2002. En 2003, M. Moody a lui-m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de la strat\u00e9gie de l'employeur, \u00e9tant renvoy\u00e9 de son poste de palier B et affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Carrefour Carri\u00e8re. Il est \u00e9vident que le plaignant n'est pas le seul employ\u00e9 dont on a mis fin \u00e0 l'emploi. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'une des nombreuses personnes touch\u00e9es par les vastes changements au sein de la compagnie.\n[36] En tout \u00e9tat de cause, j'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de MM. Boucher et Moody selon lequel ils n'\u00e9taient aucunement au courant du probl\u00e8me de d\u00e9pendance du plaignant \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'alcool avant leur d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise des semaines avant que le plaignant demande l'aide de M. Boucher pour \u00eatre admis dans un centre de d\u00e9sintoxication. Le plaignant lui-m\u00eame a dit lors de son t\u00e9moignage avoir expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Boucher la nature et l'ampleur de son probl\u00e8me d'alcool lors de son appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 9 ao\u00fbt 2000 et du trajet subs\u00e9quent dans la voiture de M. Boucher. Si M. Boucher \u00e9tait au courant du probl\u00e8me, pourquoi l'explication \u00e9tait-elle n\u00e9cessaire?\n[37] Le plaignant a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 l'incident au cours duquel un coll\u00e8gue a refus\u00e9 de faire \u00e9quipe avec lui durant la gr\u00e8ve en raison de l'odeur d'alcool qu'il d\u00e9gageait. Le plaignant soutient que M. Boucher connaissait, ou aurait d\u00fb conna\u00eetre, son probl\u00e8me \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Cependant, M. Boucher a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 par une source ind\u00e9pendante - le service de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de Bell - que le plaignant ne consommait pas d'alcool de fa\u00e7on excessive. En fait, le plaignant a fait la m\u00eame affirmation directement \u00e0 M. Boucher au cours d'une entrevue d'\u00e9valuation de rendement, et il a admis lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'il r\u00e9ussissait \u00e0 dissimuler sa d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 tous les autres employ\u00e9s et m\u00eame aux membres de sa famille lorsqu'il \u00e9tait \u00e0 la maison. La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les directeurs de Gateways travaillaient de fa\u00e7on autonome et ne se rencontraient que p\u00e9riodiquement. Il y avait peu de chances que M. Boucher tire personnellement une conclusion autre que celle voulant que le plaignant soit en bonne sant\u00e9.\n[38] Il se peut tr\u00e8s bien que Bell, en tant qu'entreprise, ait eu connaissance du fait que le plaignant avait suivi une cure de d\u00e9sintoxication en 1990. Toutefois, si l'on fait abstraction du fait que le Groupe de gestion d'invalidit\u00e9 de la compagnie consid\u00e9rait cette information comme confidentielle et que le renseignement n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 \u00e0 d'autres employ\u00e9s de Bell, presque une d\u00e9cennie s'\u00e9tait \u00e9coul\u00e9e depuis et le plaignant n'avait formul\u00e9 aucune autre demande officielle d'aide. En outre, le plaignant a lui-m\u00eame dit avoir convaincu M. Moon, au cours de leur rencontre de 1997, qu'il n'avait pas de probl\u00e8me d'alcool. Le plaignant a \u00e9galement reconnu ne pas avoir fait part non plus \u00e0 son directeur, M. Pr\u00e9vost, de son alcoolisme. En somme, il n'existe aucune preuve d\u00e9montrant que M. Boucher ou M. Moody ont pu de quelque fa\u00e7on avoir connaissance du probl\u00e8me d'alcool du plaignant.\n[39] \u00c0 l'audience, le plaignant a produit un document qui semble \u00e9maner de Bell et qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 par la Commission dans le cadre de sa divulgation. Personne \u00e0 l'audience n'a pu expliquer clairement l'origine de ce document, intitul\u00e9 Feuille de route . Les directeurs avaient l'habitude de consigner sur des feuilles de route leurs notes de travail concernant le rendement de leurs employ\u00e9s. Le document en question fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux rumeurs de consommation d'alcool \u00e0 l'origine de la rencontre du plaignant avec M. Moon. On y \u00e9voque \u00e9galement certaines lacunes dans le rendement professionnel du plaignant. M. Boucher a reconnu qu'il avait l'habitude de r\u00e9diger des feuilles de route pour ses directeurs mais nie avoir contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction du document que le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience. En fait, le document semble \u00eatre une compilation de nombreuses feuilles de route remontant au d\u00e9but de 1998, soit au moins un an avant que M. Boucher ne devienne le surveillant du plaignant. M. Boucher affirme n'avoir jamais vu le document avant l'audience et soutient n'avoir eu connaissance d'aucun incident li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'alcool mettant en cause le plaignant. Ayant examin\u00e9 de pr\u00e8s le document de m\u00eame que toute la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience, je suis persuad\u00e9 que M. Boucher n'est pas l'auteur du document. La pr\u00e9sentation et la syntaxe du texte donnent \u00e0 croire que celui-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par un tiers qui a compil\u00e9 les renseignements \u00e0 partir de nombreuses feuilles de route. Par cons\u00e9quent, on ne peut se baser sur ce document pour faire avancer la proposition \u00e0 l'effet que M. Boucher \u00e9tait au courant de l'alcoolisme du plaignant avant la d\u00e9cision du mois de juillet 2000 de le cong\u00e9dier.\n[40] Le plaignant a pr\u00e9tendu que l'intim\u00e9e avait obtenu au fil des ann\u00e9es suffisamment d'indices de sa d\u00e9ficience et qu'elle aurait d\u00fb, de ce fait, intervenir plus activement dans son cas. Il a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que, si Bell l'avait orient\u00e9 vers un programme de traitement plus t\u00f4t, sa sant\u00e9 et son rendement professionnels ne se seraient pas autant d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9s. S'il avait eu un meilleur bilan de travail, il n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re personne choisie pour \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2000.\n[41] Voil\u00e0 qui nous am\u00e8ne \u00e0 un point connexe. M. Boucher et Moody ont pr\u00e9tendu qu'ils avaient d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de renvoyer le plaignant en raison de son pi\u00e8tre rendement professionnel comparativement aux autres cadres. Le plaignant a sembl\u00e9 donner \u00e0 entendre dans son argumentation que les lacunes dans son rendement \u00e9taient li\u00e9es \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience, l'alcoolisme. En pareilles circonstances, le fait de d\u00e9cider de mettre fin \u00e0 l'emploi de quelqu'un en raison de son pi\u00e8tre rendement peut constituer, en fait, un acte discriminatoire puisque la d\u00e9ficience devient un facteur qui intervient dans la d\u00e9cision de renvoi (voir, par exemple, Desormeaux c. Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d'Ottawa-Carleton, 2003 TCDP 2 au par. 72; Parisien c. Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d'Ottawa-Carleton, 2003 TCDP 10 au par. 46).\n[42] Toutefois, en l'esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant, de son propre aveu, a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment induit en erreur les directeurs dont il relevait en les amenant \u00e0 croire sinc\u00e8rement qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas un alcoolique. S'il est du devoir d'un employeur de s'informer au sujet d'une d\u00e9ficience d'un employ\u00e9 et de la fa\u00e7on dont il peut composer avec cet employ\u00e9, il ne semble que logique et \u00e9quitable de ne pas \u00e9tendre cette obligation aux situations o\u00f9 l'employeur n'a en toute bonne foi aucune connaissance de la d\u00e9ficience de l'employ\u00e9.\n[43] C'est certes le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce. Le plaignant a fait un excellent travail de camouflage des indices qu'il a donn\u00e9s, pr\u00e9tend-il, \u00e0 son employeur. S'il a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 garder son secret, c'est en partie parce qu'il ne rencontrait qu'occasionnellement M. Boucher et que ce dernier n'avait gu\u00e8re l'occasion, de ce fait, de d\u00e9celer les sympt\u00f4mes externes de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[44] Le plaignant, en affirmant que l'intim\u00e9e aurait d\u00fb le contraindre \u00e0 suivre un traitement plusieurs ann\u00e9es avant son renvoi, semble impliquer que Bell a failli \u00e0 son devoir de tenir compte de ses besoins et de sa d\u00e9ficience. Il se peut fort bien que, comme l'a pr\u00e9tendu le plaignant dans son t\u00e9moignage, son d\u00e9ni de l'existence d'un probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait un sympt\u00f4me de la maladie et qu'on ne devrait pas, par cons\u00e9quent, rejeter la faute sur lui. Toutefois, ce principe comporte une limite. L'employeur avait mis en place un m\u00e9canisme pour tenir compte de la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant, lequel \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s efficace, ainsi qu'en atteste le fait que le plaignant y a eu recours deux fois au cours de sa carri\u00e8re chez Bell. Cependant, l'obligation d'adaptation \u00e9tait assujettie \u00e0 une condition fondamentale, \u00e0 savoir la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'employ\u00e9 de prendre les choses en main et de demander de l'aide. Comme l'a fait remarquer la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l'arr\u00eat Central Okanagan School District No. 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970, la recherche d'un compromis fait intervenir plusieurs parties et exige une participation active du plaignant. En l'esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant n'a pas fait de tels efforts avant son appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 9 ao\u00fbt 2000 \u00e0 M. Boucher. Au contraire, il a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment induit en erreur l'employeur au sujet de sa sant\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne suis pas convaincu par ces arguments.\n[45] Le plaignant a invoqu\u00e9 la mutation de M. Lecompte \u00e0 DT et R pour d\u00e9montrer que l'explication de l'intim\u00e9e n'\u00e9tait qu'un pr\u00e9texte. Si, en renvoyant le plaignant, Bell avait simplement l'intention de retrancher un seul poste de cadre dans l'\u00e9quipe de M. Boucher, la compagnie aurait pu atteindre ce but en acquies\u00e7ant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re demande de mutation de M. Lecompte. Cependant, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, j'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de MM. Boucher et Moody voulant que leur d\u00e9cision de renvoyer le plaignant ait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en juillet, soit au moins un mois avant la demande de mutation de M. Lecompte. \u00c0 titre de cadres sup\u00e9rieurs, ils \u00e9taient tout \u00e0 fait en droit de refuser de muter M. Lecompte. Je ne vois aucune raison d'attaquer cette d\u00e9cision dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente instruction. En ce qui touche l'affirmation du plaignant selon laquelle on aurait d\u00fb faire appel \u00e0 lui pour remplacer M. Lecompte, je trouve la r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9e convaincante -- le plaignant n'avait pas les qualit\u00e9s requises pour remplacer M. Lecompte. On n'a pas contest\u00e9 le fait que M. Lecompte dirigeait l'\u00e9quipe la plus chevronn\u00e9e de Gateways. En revanche, on avait d\u00e9cel\u00e9 des lacunes dans le style de gestion du plaignant. Il \u00e9tait raisonnable que l'intim\u00e9e ne voie pas dans le plaignant une personne apte \u00e0 remplacer M. Lecompte.\n[46] Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-dessus, je ne suis pas convaincu que le probl\u00e8me d'alcool du plaignant ait jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi et je consid\u00e8re raisonnable l'explication fournie par l'intim\u00e9e. Je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 que cette explication constituait un pr\u00e9texte.\n[47] La plainte est donc rejet\u00e9e.\nAthanasios D.

Conclusion\n[1] Le Tribunal est saisi de plusieurs questions pr\u00e9liminaires soulev\u00e9es par les parties relativement \u00e0 une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 23 septembre 2002, par Johanne Guay (la plaignante) devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commisssion) dans laquelle elle all\u00e8gue que la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (l\u2019intim\u00e9e) a commis \u00e0 son \u00e9gard une discrimination contrairement aux articles 7 et 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne L.R.C. 1985, chap. H-6 (la Loi).\n[2] Dans leurs requ\u00eates, la plaignante et la Commission sollicitent une modification au formulaire de la plainte afin d\u2019y ajouter des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne L.R.C. 1985, chap. H- et une ordonnance modifiant la plainte afin d\u2019y ajouter trois nouveaux intim\u00e9s.\n[3] Pour sa part l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 que l\u2019intitul\u00e9 de la plainte soit modifi\u00e9 afin que le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada soit d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9 au lieu de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada. Elle sollicite \u00e9galement une ordonnance visant l\u2019obtention de subpoena duces tecum \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un certain nombre de m\u00e9decins ainsi que des services de sant\u00e9 de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada, leur ordonnant de divulguer les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, notes d\u2019\u00e9tude clinique, rapports de consultations, r\u00e9sultats de test et r\u00e9sultats d\u2019examen de laboratoire de la plaignante entre le 1er janvier 2000 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent. Subsidiairement, elle demande une ordonnance ayant pour effet d\u2019obliger la plaignante \u00e0 consentir \u00e0 cette divulgation. Elle sollicite \u00e9galement une ordonnance obligeant la plaignante \u00e0 divulguer les noms de toutes les professionnels de la sant\u00e9 qui l\u2019ont trait\u00e9 entre le 1er janvier 2000 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent et un subpoena duces tecum \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard.\n[4] L\u2019intim\u00e9e sollicite aussi une ordonnance obligeant la plaignante \u00e0 divulguer les notes qu\u2019elle a prise lors de ses conversations avec l\u2019inspecteur Marc Proulx ainsi que toute autre note qui serait pertinente et en sa possession.\n[5] Finalement, elle sollicite une ordonnance de prorogation du d\u00e9lai de communication prescrit \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoire du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne de 30 jours suivant la r\u00e9ception des renseignements de sant\u00e9 recherch\u00e9s.\nI. LES QUESTIONS PR\u00c9LIMINAIRES SOULEV\u00c9ES PAR LA PLAIGNANTE ET LA COMMISSION A. La premi\u00e8re question : modifications au formulaire de la plainte afin d\u2019y ajouter des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi [6] La plaignante et la Commission ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vertu de la R\u00e8gle 3(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoire du Tribunal des droits de la personne. La requ\u00eate a pour objet la modification de la plainte afin d\u2019y ajouter le motif de repr\u00e9sailles pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi. En effet, elles all\u00e8guent que, suite au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte sign\u00e9e le 23 septembre 2002, par la plaignante, l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait, par les actes de ses employ\u00e9s, commis envers la plaignante des actes de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[7] Dans la d\u00e9cision Schnell c. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc et Micka, rendu le 25 avril 2001, le Tribunal a \u00e9nonc\u00e9, au paragraphe 12, les crit\u00e8res \u00e0 appliquer dans un tel cas:\nEn ce qui concerne la requ\u00eate de la Commission visant \u00e0 modifier la plainte, le crit\u00e8re, tel qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 par ce Tribunal, consiste \u00e0 se demander si la nature des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles est li\u00e9e, du moins par le plaignant, \u00e0 celle des all\u00e9gations ayant donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte initiale. Le fait que la modification propos\u00e9e porte sur un article diff\u00e9rent de la Loi en cause dans la plainte initiale ne prive pas le Tribunal de son pouvoir d\u2019autoriser une telle modification. Le Tribunal a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de modifier la plainte de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 y inclure d\u2019autres all\u00e9gations, pourvu que les intim\u00e9s re\u00e7oivent un pr\u00e9avis suffisant pour leur permettre de r\u00e9pliquer.\n[8] Dans ses repr\u00e9sentations \u00e9crites, l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne s\u2019est pas object\u00e9e aux modifications demand\u00e9es par la plaignante et la Commission pourvu qu\u2019elle re\u00e7oive un pr\u00e9avis suffisant lui permettant de r\u00e9pondre aux nouvelles all\u00e9gations.\n[9] L\u2019audience dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 remise au 8 mars 2005, il ne fait aucun doute que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a suffisant de temps pour r\u00e9pondre aux nouvelles all\u00e9gations.\n[10] Le Tribunal acquiesce donc \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la plaignante et de la Commission. Elle donne \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e 21 jours \u00e0 partir de la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision pour soumettre, si elle le d\u00e9sir, une r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite \u00e0 ces nouvelles all\u00e9gations.\n[11] La plainte est par la pr\u00e9sente modifi\u00e9e afin d\u2019y inclure l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 14.1 de la Loi.\nB. Deuxi\u00e8me question : ordonnance modifiant la plainte afin d\u2019y ajouter trois nouveaux intim\u00e9s. [12] La Commission et la plaignante sollicitent une ordonnance afin que MM. Marc Proulx, Normand Goulet et Denis Fortin soient ajout\u00e9s comme intim\u00e9s. Selon les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante et de la Commission ces individus seraient les auteurs pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s du harc\u00e8lement dont la plaignante se dit victime et ils auraient commis des actes de repr\u00e9sailles contre la plaignante apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte \u00e0 la Commission.\n[13] En appui de sa requ\u00eate, la Commission soutient que Marc Proulx et Normand Goulet on \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9s dans la plainte et ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9es par l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice de la Commission. Elle ajoute que l\u2019adjonction de ces nouvelles parties, en ce qui a trait aux repr\u00e9sailles, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible lors du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte mais qu\u2019elle est maintenant devenue n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de cet aspect de la plainte.\n[14] Selon la Commission, s\u2019il est vrai que l\u2019intim\u00e9e, en tant qu\u2019employeur des ces individus, est responsable des actes discriminatoires qu\u2019ils auraient pu poser dans le cadre de leur emploi aux termes de l\u2019article 65 de la Loi, il n\u2019en demeure pas moins qu\u2019ils sont des personnes distinctes de celle-ci.\n[15] Pour sa part, l\u2019intim\u00e9e argumente que l\u2019adjonction des trois membres de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada est inutile et n\u2019aura pour effet que de compliquer la proc\u00e9dure et de prolonger inutilement l\u2019audience.\n[16] Dans la d\u00e9cision Desormeaux c. Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d\u2019Ottawa-Carleton, T701\/0602, 2 octobre 2002, vol. 1, p. 46, le Tribunal fait remarquer que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 48.9(2)b) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment l\u2019adjonction de parties aux instances devant le Tribunal. Le paragraphe 48.9(2) pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement que le Tribunal peut \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de pratique r\u00e9gissant la proc\u00e9dure devant le lui.\n[17] Deux d\u00e9cisions relativement r\u00e9centes du Tribunal se sont directement pench\u00e9es sur cette question: Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone, Section Locale 5044 du SCFP c. Telus Communication (Qu\u00e9bec) Inc., 2003 TCDP 31 (ci-apr\u00e8s Telus) et Brown c. Commission de la capitale nationale, 2003 TCDP 43 (ci-apr\u00e8s Brown)\n[18] Dans la d\u00e9cision Telus, le Tribunal indique que bien que la Loi conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir d\u2019ajouter des parties \u00e0 une instance lorsqu\u2019il le juge appropri\u00e9, le contexte l\u00e9gislatif entourant ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire milite en faveur d\u2019une certaine retenue ou prudence. Le Tribunal fait remarquer que la Loi pr\u00e9voit, dans le traitement des plaintes de discrimination, un processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate et d\u2019instruction fort \u00e9labor\u00e9e o\u00f9 tant la Commission que le Tribunal ont des r\u00f4les bien d\u00e9finis. L\u2019ajout de parties en cours d\u2019instance devant le Tribunal prive le nouvel intim\u00e9 du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de certains moyens de d\u00e9fense qu\u2019il peut normalement faire valoir au stade de l\u2019examen d\u2019une plainte par la Commission, notamment la possibilit\u00e9 de faire rejeter la plainte sans qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait besoin d\u2019instituer une instruction.\n[19] Le Tribunal conclut, au paragraphe 30, que l\u2019adjonction forc\u00e9e d\u2019un nouvel intim\u00e9 une fois que le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 d\u2019instruire une plainte est appropri\u00e9e\u2026s\u2019il est \u00e9tabli que la pr\u00e9sence de cette nouvelle partie est n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte dont il est saisi et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible une fois la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission que l\u2019adjonction d\u2019un nouvel intim\u00e9 serait n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte. Dans Telus, le Tribunal refusa l\u2019adjonction de la partie tierce, soit le Syndicat des agents de ma\u00eetrise de Qu\u00e9bec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone (le SAQT). Pour le Tribunal, la mise en cause du SAQT serait pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 ce dernier d\u2019un point de vue d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[20] Dans la d\u00e9cision Brown, le Tribunal indique qu\u2019il peut ajouter une partie lorsqu\u2019une telle mesure est n\u00e9cessaire pour trancher toutes les questions en litige et r\u00e9soudre efficacement et compl\u00e8tement l\u2019affaire dont il est saisi. Le membre instructeur poursuit en ajoutant un \u00e9l\u00e9ment suppl\u00e9mentaire qui est, selon lui, plus important que la question de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9. Il indique que la Loi a pour objet de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la discrimination et que le pouvoir du Tribunal d\u2019ajouter des parties doit \u00eatre subordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 cet objet. Les instances en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne comportent un volet constitutionnel qui est souvent absent dans les instances civiles. Puisque les litiges que tranche le Tribunal sont des affaires d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, les r\u00e8gles concernant l\u2019adjonction des parties doivent tenir compte du mandat du Tribunal qui est d\u2019assurer une r\u00e9paration efficace en cas de discrimination. Dans Brown, l\u2019adjonction d\u2019une nouvelle partie n\u2019\u00e9tait pas demand\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme directement responsable de l\u2019acte discriminatoire mais plut\u00f4t parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme essentielle afin de permettre une ex\u00e9cution plus appropri\u00e9e de la d\u00e9cision qui serait prise contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e initiale.\n[21] La partie initiale \u00e9tait dans Brown la Commission de la capitale nationale (la CNN). Pendant l\u2019audience il est devenu \u00e9vident que la solution au probl\u00e8me que le Tribunal avait \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre se trouvait probablement dans un immeuble adjacent qui appartenait au minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics. Bien que le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics et la CNN soient distincts en droit, il s\u2019agit de deux cr\u00e9atures de la Couronne f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. L\u2019adjonction du minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics fut donc permise car elle allait permettre une ex\u00e9cution plus appropri\u00e9e de la d\u00e9cision.\n[22] Dans le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les trois nouveaux intim\u00e9s, dont la Commission et la plaignante demandent l\u2019adjonction, sont des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. \u00c0 cet effet, l\u2019article 65 de la Loi pr\u00e9voit:\n65. (1) Sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (2), les 65. (1) Subject to subsection (2), any act or actes ou omissions commis par un employ\u00e9, un omission committed by an officer, a director, an mandataire, un administrateur ou un dirigeant employee or an agent of any person, association or dans le cadre de son emploi sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s, pour organization in the course of the employment of l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 commis the officer, director, employee or agent shall, for par la personne, l\u2019organisme ou l\u2019association qui the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be an act or l\u2019emploie. omission committed by that person, association or organization.\n(2) La personne, l\u2019organisme ou l\u2019association (2) An act or omission shall not, by virtue of vis\u00e9 au paragraphe (1) peut se soustraire \u00e0 son subsection (1), be deemed to be an act or omission application s\u2019il \u00e9tablit que l\u2019acte ou l\u2019ommission committed by a person, association or a eu lieu sans son consentement, qu\u2019il avait pris organization if it is established that the person, toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour l\u2019emp\u00eacher association or organization did not consent to the et que, par la suite, il a tent\u00e9 d\u2019en att\u00e9nuer ou commission of the act or omission and exercised d\u2019en annuler les effets. all due diligence to prevent the act or omission from being committed and, subsequently, to mitigate or avoid the effect thereof.\n[23] Dans son argumentation \u00e9crite, la Commission indique que ces employ\u00e9s sont des personnes distinctes de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Elle ajoute que selon l\u2019article 4 de la Loi, toute personne reconnue coupable d\u2019actes discriminatoires peut faire l\u2019objet d\u2019ordonnances sp\u00e9cifiques.\n[24] La plaignante ne sollicite aucun redressement particulier \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de ces demandeurs. Pour sa part, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur le paragraphe 65(2). \u00c9videmment, si une telle d\u00e9fense \u00e9tait soulev\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ma d\u00e9cision sur l\u2019adjonction des parties pourraient \u00eatre diff\u00e9rentes.\n[25] Les actes de discrimination qui leur sont reproch\u00e9s sont exactement les m\u00eames que ceux qui sont all\u00e9gu\u00e9s contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e et aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise d\u00e9montrant que ces actes auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 commis \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de leur emploi. Ainsi, s\u2019il est \u00e9tabli que les actes ou omissions de ses employ\u00e9s sont discriminatoire puisqu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commis dans le cadre de leur emploi, ils seront r\u00e9put\u00e9s, pour l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[26] Par ailleurs, le Tribunal ne peut ignorer que la Commission et la plaignante auraient pu raisonnablement pr\u00e9voir au moment du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte et lors de l\u2019enqu\u00eate l\u2019adjonction de ces parties. Ils ont choisi alors de ne pas les ajouter. Leur adjonction maintenant sans qu\u2019ils n\u2019aient \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet d\u2019une plainte formelle, les priverait de la possibilit\u00e9 de faire valoir certains moyens de d\u00e9fense devant la Commission en vertu des articles 41 et 44 de la Loi.\n[27] Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas convaincu que l\u2019adjonction de ces intim\u00e9s est n\u00e9cessaires pour disposer de la plainte et contrairement \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire Brown leur pr\u00e9sence n\u2019est pas essentielle afin de permettre une ex\u00e9cution plus appropri\u00e9e de la d\u00e9cision qui serait prise contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[28] La demande de la Commission et la plaignante pour l\u2019adjonction de trois nouvelles parties est refus\u00e9e.\nII. LES QUESTIONS PR\u00c9LIMINAIRES SOULEV\u00c9ES PAR L\u2019INTIM\u00c9E A. La premi\u00e8re question : modification de l\u2019intitul\u00e9 de la plainte [29] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pour la modification de l\u2019intitul\u00e9 de la plainte afin qu\u2019elle soit d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada. L\u2019intitul\u00e9 actuel de la plainte identifie la Gendarmerie royale du Canada comme intim\u00e9e. Selon les pr\u00e9tentions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e seul le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada peut ester en justice pour r\u00e9pondre des actes commis par les membres de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada.\n[30] Elle ajoute que la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019ester en justice est r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux seules personnes naturelles et aux personnes morales. La Gendarmerie royale du Canada n\u2019ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 dot\u00e9 d\u2019une personnalit\u00e9 juridique distincte par la Loi sur la Gendarmerie royale du Canada, L.R.C. 1985, c. R-10, elle ne poss\u00e8de donc pas la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019ester en justice. Elle ajoute que la GRC n\u2019\u00e9tant pas une personne, elle ne peut constituer une partie \u00e0 une plainte sous la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[31] L\u2019article 3 de la Loi sur la Gendarmerie royale du Canada pr\u00e9voit:\n3. Est maintenue pour le Canada une force de 3. There shall continue to be a police force for police compos\u00e9e d\u2019officiers et autres membres Canada, which shall consist of officers and other et appel\u00e9e Gendarmerie royale du Canada. members and be known as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n[32] La Commission ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate. Pour sa part, la plaignante soutien que le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada n\u2019est pas son employeur et que la modification ne devrait pas \u00eatre accord\u00e9e.\n[33] Dans la d\u00e9cision Plante c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2003 CHRT 28, le Tribunal avait devant lui une requ\u00eate tout a fait similaire \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente. En accordant la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans cette affaire le Tribunal indique qu\u2019un examen de la jurisprudence cit\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ainsi que les dispositions pertinentes de la Loi sur la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00c9tat r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a raison et que la proc\u00e9dure de la plaignante devrait en bonne et due forme \u00eatre intent\u00e9e contre le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada).\n[34] Je comprends comment la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut appara\u00eetre \u00e0 la plaignante mais je consid\u00e8re que la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e porte uniquement sur des formalit\u00e9s judiciaires de litiges auxquels le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral est partie et qu\u2019elle ne pose aucun pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la plaignante. Le changement de l\u2019intitul\u00e9 de la cause n\u2019entravera pas la capacit\u00e9 de la plaignante de faire valoir ses arguments et le redressement qui devrait lui \u00eatre accord\u00e9 dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 sa plainte serait accueillie.\n[35] J\u2019ordonne donc que le nom de l\u2019intim\u00e9e soit remplac\u00e9 par le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant la Gendarmerie royale du Canada).\nB. Deuxi\u00e8me question : les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux [36] Le 23 septembre 2002, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission all\u00e9guant qu\u2019elle est victime d\u2019actes discriminatoires de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Elle all\u00e8gue, entre autres, que l\u2019intim\u00e9e refuse de l\u2019accommoder en vue de sa condition m\u00e9dicale et qu\u2019elle est harcel\u00e9e en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Dans sa divulgation, la plaignante soutien que ses superviseurs l\u2019obligent \u00e0 travailler des journ\u00e9es ou des quarts de travail qui ne tiennent pas compte des recommandations de son m\u00e9decin et qu\u2019ils lui refusent une mutation \u00e0 un poste qui serait plus adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 sa condition de sant\u00e9.\n[37] Sa divulgation de documents r\u00e9v\u00e8le, qu\u2019en plus de son m\u00e9decin traitant, le docteur Mireille Belzile, elle a consult\u00e9 les docteurs John Gosselin, Bruno Laplante et Jocelyn Aubut. Dans l\u2019Expos\u00e9 des questions de faits et de droit, les mesures de redressement sollicit\u00e9es par la plaignante incluent une demande de compensation financi\u00e8re de 20 000$ pour pr\u00e9judices physiques et moraux. Elle soutient que les actes de l\u2019intim\u00e9e lui occasionne un stress indu et lui cr\u00e9e des probl\u00e8mes d\u2019insomnie, d\u2019\u00e9puisement, des migraines et des troubles de digestion.\n[38] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e8s qu\u2019une partie met son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 en litige, elle renonce implicitement \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 qui prot\u00e9gerait autrement son dossier m\u00e9dical et que, dans le mesure o\u00f9 ce dossier contient des renseignements potentiellement pertinents aux faits en litige, il doit \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ajoute que l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la d\u00e9ficience est en litige, de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que l\u2019existence et l\u2019\u00e9tendue des manifestations psychologiques et physiologique du stress pr\u00e9tendument souffert par la plaignante. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle en conclut que les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de la plaignante sont pertinents.\n[39] La Commission et la plaignante all\u00e8guent pour leur part que la divulgation des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux de la plaignante n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire puisque l\u2019intim\u00e9e conna\u00eet son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es.\n[40] La Loi et les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoire du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne codifient la r\u00e8gle de justice naturelle accordant \u00e0 chaque partie le droit \u00e0 une audition pleine et enti\u00e8re. Ce droit comporte \u00e9galement le droit \u00e0 la divulgation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents en la possession ou sous le contr\u00f4le de la partie adverse. Toutefois dans une requ\u00eate comme la pr\u00e9sente, le Tribunal doit soupeser les divers int\u00e9r\u00eats qui s\u2019opposent \u2013 les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice au regard du droit d\u2019une personne au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e et \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9.\n[41] Dans son avis de requ\u00eate amend\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e sollicite une ordonnance visant l\u2019obtention de subpoena duces tecum \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des m\u00e9decins traitant de la plaignante. Le but de la partie duces tecum du subpoena est d\u2019enjoindre des tierces parties, qui ne sont pas parties au litige, de produire des documents qu\u2019elles ont en leur possession.\n[42] D\u2019autres principes sont \u00e9galement pertinents et doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s avant que je puisse rendre ma d\u00e9cision. Premi\u00e8rement, il est important qu\u2019un lien rationnel existe entre les documents demand\u00e9s et les questions contenues dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate; c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que l\u2019on puisse pr\u00e9tendre \u00e0 la pertinence probable de l\u2019information recherch\u00e9e.\n[43] La demande ne doit pas \u00eatre sp\u00e9culative ou \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une partie de p\u00eache. La description des documents ne devrait pas \u00eatre trop large ou trop g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et devrait \u00eatre identifi\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on minutieuse. Finalement, la demande ne devrait pas \u00eatre oppressive, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, qu\u2019elle ne devrait pas obliger un \u00e9tranger partie au litige \u00e0 se soumettre \u00e0 une recherche on\u00e9reuse et fort \u00e9tendue de documentation. (Voir CTEA c. Bell Canada, T503\/2098, d\u00e9cision n\u00b0 2.)\n[44] Dans la d\u00e9cision Day c. Minist\u00e8re de la d\u00e9fense nationale et Hortie, d\u00e9cision n\u00b0 3, 2002\/ 12\/06 , le Tribunal a retenu un processus \u00e0 trois \u00e9tapes pour d\u00e9cider si des documents devraient \u00eatre ou non divulgu\u00e9:\nLe Tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer si les renseignements sont d'une pertinence possible, lequel ne constitue pas une norme particuli\u00e8rement \u00e9lev\u00e9e. Il doit y avoir une certaine pertinence et la partie qui demande la production des renseignements ou des documents doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il existe un lien entre les renseignements ou documents demand\u00e9s et les questions en litige. Il doit s'agir de documents probants qui pourraient \u00eatre pertinents \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une question \u00e0 trancher. Le but est d'emp\u00eacher qu'on se lance dans des demandes de production qui reposent sur la conjecture et qui sont fantaisistes, perturbatrices, mal fond\u00e9es, obstructionnistes et dilatoires. Le Tribunal doit ensuite se pencher sur toute autre question susceptible d'influer sur la divulgation, sans examiner les documents. S'il n'existe pas de raisons imp\u00e9rieuses de pr\u00e9server le caract\u00e8re confidentiel des documents, ceux-ci doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s. Si le Tribunal n'est pas en mesure de r\u00e9soudre la question sans examiner les documents, il y a alors lieu de le faire. Lors de la derni\u00e8re \u00e9tape du processus, il serait peut-\u00eatre utile que la partie qui d\u00e9sire que les documents soient prot\u00e9g\u00e9s attire l'attention du Tribunal sur les passages ou les documents particuliers qui suscitent de l'inqui\u00e9tude.\n[45] Je me dois ici de conclure que les documents sollicit\u00e9s ont une pertinence probable et qu\u2019ils pourraient \u00eatre pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une question \u00e0 trancher. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il existait un lien entre les documents demand\u00e9s et les questions en litiges notamment en ce qui concerne les redressements sollicit\u00e9s. Dans des proc\u00e9dures en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, la plaignante, lorsqu'elle r\u00e9clame une indemnisation pour des pr\u00e9judices physiques et moraux, accepte implicitement que l'intim\u00e9e puisse avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ses dossiers m\u00e9dicaux ou, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, \u00e0 des renseignements personnels sur sa sant\u00e9. Le droit \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux cesse alors d'exister. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la plaignante demande une compensation financi\u00e8re pour pr\u00e9judices physiques et moraux. Le droit \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 est alors \u00e9clips\u00e9 par le droit du d\u00e9fendeur de conna\u00eetre les motifs et la port\u00e9e de la plainte dont il fait l'objet. La justice, dans des proc\u00e9dures en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, exige que l'on permette \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de pr\u00e9senter une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re \u00e0 l'argumentation de la partie plaignante. Si la plaignante plaide sa cause en se fondant sur son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9e a le droit d'obtenir les renseignements de sant\u00e9 pertinents qui peuvent avoir trait \u00e0 la r\u00e9clamation.\n[46] La plaignante et la Commission n\u2019ont soulev\u00e9 aucun argument qui serait susceptible d\u2019influer sur ma d\u00e9cision d\u2019ordonner la divulgation des documents recherch\u00e9s.\n[47] Eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, le tribunal \u00e9mettra des subpoenae duces tecum \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des docteurs Mireille Belzile, John Gosselin, Bruno Laplante, Jocelyn Aubut, ainsi que des services de sant\u00e9 de la Gendarmerie Royale du Canada, leur ordonnant de divulguer aux procureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9 les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, notes d\u2019\u00e9tude clinique, rapports de consultations, r\u00e9sultats de tests et ou r\u00e9sultats d\u2019examen de laboratoire de la plaignante entre le 1er janvier 2000 et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent.\n[48] Afin de pr\u00e9server le droit \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 de la plaignante, il est \u00e9galement convenu que les procureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9 consulteront eux-m\u00eames ces documents et n\u2019en divulgueront le contenu \u00e0 aucune autre personne sans l\u2019autorisation au pr\u00e9alable du Tribunal et sans en avoir donn\u00e9 avis \u00e0 la plaignante. Il est \u00e9galement attendu que la divulgation de ces documents ne signifie pas leur admission \u00e0 titre de preuve et que toutes questions \u00e0 ce sujet seront trait\u00e9es lors de l\u2019audience. De plus, si la plaignante voulait soulever certaines questions relativement \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 de certaines informations qui pourraient \u00eatre contenues dans ces documents et qui ne concerneraient pas la pr\u00e9sente affaire, elle est pri\u00e9e d\u2019en faire part au Tribunal dans les plus brefs d\u00e9lais. Dans ce cas, sur avis aux parties, le Tribunal examinera les dossiers afin d\u2019\u00e9valuer quelles informations devraient \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9es en raison de leur pertinence avec les questions soulev\u00e9es dans le pr\u00e9sent litige et quelles informations ne devraient pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9es.\n[49] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour une prorogation du d\u00e9lai de communication prescrit au paragraphe 6(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoire, le Tribunal ne voit aucune raison d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 cette demande et ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de proc\u00e9der, si ce n\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait, avec celle-ci dans les sept jours qui suivront la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. S\u2019il devait s\u2019av\u00e9rer, suite au d\u00e9p\u00f4t des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, que l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit apporter des modifications \u00e0 sa communication, elle pourra pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 ce moment une requ\u00eate en ce sens au Tribunal.\nC. Troisi\u00e8me question : production des notes prises par la plaignante suite \u00e0 des conversations avec l\u2019inspecteur Marc Proulx [50] Dans sa divulgation, il semble que la plaignante a identifi\u00e9e des notes personnelles qu\u2019elle aurait prises lors de ses conversations avec l\u2019inspecteur Marc Proulx. Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, elle ajoute que ces notes constituent presque int\u00e9gralement l\u2019information contenue dans les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles dont il est fait mention plus haut.\n[51] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) des R\u00e8gles Provisoire de proc\u00e9dure impose aux parties l\u2019obligation de divulguer tout document en leur possession, sur lesquels ils ne revendiquent aucun privil\u00e8ge, et qui sont pertinent aux questions en cause. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, aucun privil\u00e8ge n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 revendiqu\u00e9 sur les notes dont il est question.\n[52] J\u2019ordonne donc que la plaignante divulgue \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e les notes prises lors de ses conversations avec l\u2019inspecteur Marc Proulx et dont il est fait mention dans sa divulgation.\n[53] Le fait que j\u2019ordonne la divulgation de ces documents ne veut pas dire que celles-ci seront recevables en preuve. Cette question sera d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\nIII. CONCLUSION [54] Le Tribunal acquiesce \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la plaignante et de la Commission et ordonne que la plainte soit modifi\u00e9e afin d\u2019y inclure l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 14.1 de la Loi.\n[55] Le Tribunal donne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e 21 jours \u00e0 partir de la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision pour soumettre une r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite \u00e0 ces nouvelles all\u00e9gations.\n[56] La demande de la Commission et la plaignante pour l\u2019adjonction de trois nouvelles parties est refus\u00e9e.\n[57] La requ\u00eate pour que le nom de l\u2019intim\u00e9e soit remplac\u00e9 par le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant la Gendarmerie royale du Canada) est accord\u00e9e.\n[58] Le Tribunal accepte d\u2019\u00e9mettre des subpoenae duces tecum \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des docteurs Mireille Belzile, John Gosselin, Bruno Laplante, Jocelyn Aubut, ainsi que des services de sant\u00e9 de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada, leur ordonnant de divulguer aux procureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9 les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, notes d\u2019\u00e9tude clinique, rapports de consultations, r\u00e9sultats de tests et ou r\u00e9sultats d\u2019examen de laboratoire de la plaignante entre le 1er janvier 2000 et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent.\n[59] Le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 la plaignante de divulguer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e les notes prises lors de ses conversations avec l\u2019inspecteur Marc Proulx.\noriginale sign\u00e9e par\nMichel Doucet\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 18 novembre 2004\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT914\/3404\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nJohanne Guay c.

D\u00e9fense des int\u00e9r\u00eats\nE. Question ultime\nF. Sources\nIV. D\u00e9cision\n[1] La Commission a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal de son d\u00e9sir de pr\u00e9senter un rapport d'expert. L'intim\u00e9e a soulev\u00e9 un certain nombre d'objections \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du rapport. Des observations orales et \u00e9crites m'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les deux parties.\nI. RETARD [2] La premi\u00e8re objection a trait au retard \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter le rapport. Initialement, le plaignant et la Commission avaient jusqu'au 17 mai pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 leur divulgation en l'esp\u00e8ce. La divulgation comprenait les rapports d'expert. La date de l'audience avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e au 13 septembre. Le d\u00e9lai accord\u00e9 pour la divulgation a \u00e9t\u00e9 prorog\u00e9 jusqu'au 4 juin, \u00e0 la demande du plaignant, puis il a fait l'objet d'une deuxi\u00e8me prorogation jusqu'au 28 juin.\n[3] Il n'y avait pas de rapport d'expert. Le 3 septembre, les parties ont demand\u00e9 une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence, qui a eu lieu le 8 septembre. La Commission a demand\u00e9 l'ajournement de l'audience, requ\u00eate que j'ai rejet\u00e9e.\n[4] Une autre t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue en catastrophe le 10 septembre, jour o\u00f9 le rapport a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9. L'intim\u00e9e a naturellement \u00e9t\u00e9 choqu\u00e9e par la divulgation tardive du rapport. Toutes les parties ont demand\u00e9 le report de l'audience. Comme les avocats m'avaient indiqu\u00e9 que le rapport d'expert rev\u00eatait une importance cruciale, j'ai accept\u00e9 de reporter au 20 septembre la premi\u00e8re semaine de l'audience, afin de permettre aux parties de traiter du rapport d'expert lors d'une s\u00e9ance subs\u00e9quente.\n[5] L'intim\u00e9e a fait valoir que la remise tardive du rapport [TRADUCTION] \u00e9quivalait \u00e0 une instance en embuscade. Il \u00e9tait impossible \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e d'examiner le rapport et d'y r\u00e9pondre avant la date initiale du d\u00e9but de l'audience. Le d\u00e9lai subs\u00e9quent a caus\u00e9 des inconv\u00e9nients \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e et, peut-on pr\u00e9sumer, entra\u00een\u00e9 certaines d\u00e9penses suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[6] Bien que je comprenne parfaitement la position de l'intim\u00e9e, il reste que cette derni\u00e8re a en main le rapport de la Commission depuis un certain temps. \u00c0 mon avis, l'intim\u00e9e dispose d'un d\u00e9lai suffisant pour r\u00e9pondre au rapport de l'expert, compte tenu du report de l'audience. Le plaignant et la Commission ont droit \u00e0 une instruction pleine et enti\u00e8re et \u00e0 une analyse ad\u00e9quate de la plainte; ils ne devraient pas \u00eatre priv\u00e9s de la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter leur cause \u00e0 l'audience.\n[7] Je souscris \u00e0 l'opinion de l'intim\u00e9e selon laquelle la Commission devrait \u00eatre bl\u00e2m\u00e9e pour sa conduite. Il n'y aura pas d'instance en embuscade. Je pense qu'il y a cependant d'autres fa\u00e7ons d'intervenir dans le cas d'une divulgation in\u00e9quitable de rapport. Une telle intervention peut se situer au niveau de l'allocation des frais. On peut aussi envisager d'imposer des limites \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des mesures de r\u00e9paration en faveur du plaignant ou de d\u00e9duire, en guise de compensation, un certain montant de l'indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e. C'est la position qu'a adopt\u00e9e le membre instructeur dans l'affaire Charlton c. International Longshoremen's Association, Local 269, 2004 TCDP 12.\n[8] Il est loisible \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de soulever la question \u00e0 la fin de l'audience.\nII. M. WORTLEY PEUT-IL T\u00c9MOIGNER? [9] L'intim\u00e9e s'oppose aussi \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de citer M. Wortley \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner comme expert. Cela exige une explication.\n[10] La Commission m'a inform\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e avait accept\u00e9, lors du r\u00e8glement dans une autre affaire, de laisser la Commission faire enqu\u00eate sur les aspects racistes des politiques d'inspection de l'intim\u00e9e. \u00c0 cette fin, il faut, semble-t-il, obtenir de l'information au sujet des taux d'occurrence ou, si l'on pr\u00e9f\u00e8re, du nombre de fois que les membres d'un groupe identifiable sont interpell\u00e9s. La Commission affirme que les renseignements demand\u00e9s \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission est incapable de d\u00e9terminer s'il y a lieu de d\u00e9poser une plainte syst\u00e9mique contre l'intim\u00e9e. Elle demande donc au Tribunal de rendre en l'esp\u00e8ce une ordonnance exigeant de fournir l'information. C'est une des mesures de redressement qu'elle a demand\u00e9es.\n[11] L'intervention de M. Underhill \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard m\u00e9rite d'\u00eatre cit\u00e9e int\u00e9gralement :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLa Commission admet que ce tribunal pourrait instruire la plainte sans se pencher sur le rapport Wortley et le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne du profilage racial. Cependant, une telle fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der minerait l'objet et la raison d'\u00eatre du Tribunal et de sa loi habilitante. Si la Commission participe \u00e0 cette audience, c'est parce que les exp\u00e9riences de M. Orughu avec l'intim\u00e9e semblent accr\u00e9diter la th\u00e8se du profilage racial (tel que d\u00e9fini dans les ouvrages de sciences sociales), et aussi parce qu'il existe des indications pr\u00e9liminaires qui donnent \u00e0 croire que la plainte de M. Orughu ne serait que l'illustration d'un probl\u00e8me g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (l'Agence). La Commission n'est pas en mesure de d\u00e9poser une plainte de profilage racial syst\u00e9mique devant ce tribunal et demande au TCDP, par cons\u00e9quent, d'instruire la plainte de M. Orughu comme cas unique de profilage racial et d'ordonner, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'objectif fondamental \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la loi, \u00e0 savoir l'\u00e9limination des pratiques discriminatoires, une vaste enqu\u00eate \u00e0 ce sujet.\nCes observations soul\u00e8vent un certain nombre de questions de droit que je ne saurais trancher sans avoir entendu toutes les observations des diverses parties.\n[12] \u00c0 ce stade, il est suffisant selon moi de se concentrer sur la preuve. M. Wortley est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme un t\u00e9moin en mesure de t\u00e9moigner au sujet du [TRADUCTION] probl\u00e8me g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du profilage racial au sein de l'Agence. Ce t\u00e9moignage est pertinent \u00e0 la plainte de M. Orughu, qui peut gagner en cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du fait que les politiques des Douanes sont dans un certain sens pr\u00e9judiciables. Le droit des droits de la personne reconna\u00eet que le contexte dans lequel se situe une plainte est pertinent par rapport \u00e0 l'instruction de celle-ci. La production de certaines preuves relativement aux politiques et aux pratiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de la partie intim\u00e9e est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de ce contexte.\n[13] Par ailleurs, il est \u00e9tabli en droit que la preuve de probl\u00e8mes syst\u00e9miques peut servir \u00e0 \u00e9tayer la preuve d'un particulier. Dans Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social) (re Chopra), [1998] A.C.F. no 432 (QL), par exemple, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale affirme, au paragraphe 22, que le tribunal a commis une erreur en ne permettant pas aux requ\u00e9rants de produire la preuve g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'un probl\u00e8me syst\u00e9matique comme preuve circonstancielle permettant de conclure qu'il y avait probablement eu discrimination dans cette affaire en particulier. Dans Chopra, la Cour s'est pench\u00e9e sur la question de la preuve statistique, qui exige l'intervention d'un expert.\n[14] Je conc\u00e8de \u00e9galement que la Commission est en droit de demander au Tribunal d'examiner l'all\u00e9gation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale voulant que la fa\u00e7on dont M. Orughu a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 suscite des pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 l'existence possible de plus vastes probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 l'Agence. Je souscris \u00e0 l'opinion de la Commission selon laquelle l'instruction d'une plainte exige jusqu'\u00e0 un certain point d'explorer et a une port\u00e9e beaucoup plus \u00e9tendue qu'un proc\u00e8s. Il est par ailleurs significatif que le Tribunal soit tenu, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, de donner \u00e0 toutes les parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. L'intim\u00e9e aura la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re d'aborder toute question de droit qui se pose dans le contexte des mesures de redressement demand\u00e9es \u00e0 la fin de l'audience par la Commission.\n[15] Je crois qu'il est juste de consid\u00e9rer cet aspect de l'audience comme un ajout in\u00e9vitable et n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate sur la plainte de M. Orughu, qui soul\u00e8ve des questions plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rales pour la Commission. C'est une question de degr\u00e9. La Commission a reconnu que le Tribunal n'est pas saisi d'une plainte syst\u00e9mique. Le Tribunal n'a pas \u00e0 se pencher directement sur les politiques et les pratiques de l'Agence. Les politiques et les pratiques de l'Agence ont n\u00e9anmoins \u00e9t\u00e9 remises en question par M. Orughu. Il est probablement impossible \u00e0 mon avis de dissocier nettement ces deux aspects de la plainte. Il s'agit davantage de faire en sorte de garder la preuve \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur des limites appropri\u00e9es.\n[16] La seule question de droit \u00e0 ce stade de la proc\u00e9dure consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le t\u00e9moignage de l'expert est pertinent et n\u00e9cessaire, dans la mesure o\u00f9 la Commission entend soumettre la plainte pour instruction. Je crois que c'est le cas. Le droit des droits de la personne reconna\u00eet depuis longtemps que l'analyse selon les m\u00e9thodes de recherche habituelles peut \u00eatre indispensable pour d\u00e9terminer si les politiques de la partie intim\u00e9e ont des cons\u00e9quences discriminatoires. Si M. Wortley est d'avis que la Commission ne dispose pas de l'information dont elle a besoin pour d\u00e9terminer en quoi consistent les pratiques de l'intim\u00e9e, cela constitue en soi une preuve l\u00e9gitime fond\u00e9e sur une opinion.\n[17] Toutefois, la situation n'est pas aussi simple puisque M. Wortley est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner des faits. Si je dis cela, c'est parce que la Commission a fait valoir qu'il conna\u00eet bien les pratiques de l'Agence et peut parler des protocoles couramment appliqu\u00e9s aux points d'inspection. Je suis conscient du fait que l'intim\u00e9e conteste cette all\u00e9gation. Nous examinerons ce point lorsque nous d\u00e9terminerons s'il peut \u00eatre reconnu comme t\u00e9moin expert. Nous ne pouvons pas nous prononcer l\u00e0-dessus pour l'instant.\n[18] M\u00eame si M. Wortley ne peut commenter les protocoles appliqu\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9e, il semble avoir une certaine connaissance des normes internationales dans le domaine ainsi que des pratiques qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es dans d'autres pays. Il appert que les ouvrages de sciences sociales traitent de ces questions. En outre, il semble exister des \u00e9tudes sur ce qu'on a appel\u00e9 le profilage racial. Il est \u00e9vident que l'emploi de ce terme est risqu\u00e9, car il comporte des connotations p\u00e9joratives. Il faut donc l'utiliser avec prudence. La recherche dans le domaine peut n\u00e9anmoins nous aider \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si M. Orughu a fait l'objet de discrimination.\n[19] On pourrait faire valoir un certain nombre de points. Toutefois, si l'on r\u00e9duit la chose \u00e0 sa plus simple expression, la Commission cite M. Wortley comme expert pouvant t\u00e9moigner au sujet de l'utilisation d'identificateurs ethniques, aux Douanes ou ailleurs. Cela touche \u00e0 l'essence m\u00eame de la plainte voulant que M. Orughu ait fait l'objet d'un traitement diff\u00e9rent \u00e0 la fronti\u00e8re en raison de sa race. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 M. Wortley a la qualification requise, je ne vois pas pourquoi il ne devrait pas t\u00e9moigner.\nIII. LA TENEUR DU RAPPORT [20] Je souscris n\u00e9anmoins \u00e0 un grand nombre des critiques formul\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9e dans le rapport. Ces critiques peuvent \u00eatre regroup\u00e9es sous un certain nombre de rubriques.\nA. N\u00e9cessit\u00e9 [21] La premi\u00e8re est la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9. L'intim\u00e9e a cit\u00e9 R. c. B\u00e9land, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 24, o\u00f9 la Cour, \u00e0 la page 42, cite Davie v. Magistrates of Edinburgh [1953] S.C. 34, o\u00f9 lord Cooper affirme, \u00e0 la page 40, qu'aucun t\u00e9moignage d'expert ne devrait \u00eatre admis relativement \u00e0 une question qui rel\u00e8ve de la comp\u00e9tence et de l'exp\u00e9rience du juge des faits. Il incombe au Tribunal de tirer les conclusions qui s'imposent et de statuer sur les questions de droit. Le Tribunal ferait une erreur en acceptant des instructions relativement \u00e0 l'exercice de ses attributions dans un cas particulier.\n[22] Le rapport de M. Wortley ne respecte pas ce principe fondamental. Il expose une th\u00e9orie du cas et \u00e9nonce m\u00eame des commentaires sur la strat\u00e9gie juridique de l'intim\u00e9e. Cela va au-del\u00e0 du r\u00f4le d'un t\u00e9moin expert. Il n'appartient pas \u00e0 l'expert d'examiner et de cerner les faits. Si une opinion d'expert est fond\u00e9e sur certaines hypoth\u00e8ses de fait, celles-ci doivent \u00eatre \u00e9nonc\u00e9es clairement, de fa\u00e7on neutre, tout en pr\u00e9cisant qu'il s'agit d'hypoth\u00e8ses.\n[23] La r\u00e9ticence \u00e0 admettre des t\u00e9moignages d'expert s'explique en partie par le fait qu'on a facilement tendance \u00e0 exag\u00e9rer le poids de ces t\u00e9moignages. Ainsi, M. Wortley indique que les exp\u00e9riences de M. Orughu rejoignent certaines hypoth\u00e8ses formul\u00e9es dans les ouvrages de sciences sociales. C'est peut-\u00eatre un fait important. Cependant, la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 est qu'un certain nombre d'observations \u00e9nonc\u00e9es par M. Wortley ne sont qu'une reformulation dans le langage des sciences sociales de certaines obsevations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales \u00e0 propos de la vie, ce qui leur conf\u00e8re une aura de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 scientifique qui en exag\u00e8re la port\u00e9e.\nB. Cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 [24] Il s'agit d'une pr\u00e9occupation plus concr\u00e8te. L'intim\u00e9e a fait valoir que le rapport renferme des observations \u00e0 propos de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du plaignant. Me Burnet a cit\u00e9 R. c. Marquard [1993] 4 R.C.S. 223, o\u00f9 on soutient \u00e0 la page 248, que le juge devrait se fonder sur sa propre connaissance de l'affaire pour se prononcer sur une telle question. J'irais m\u00eame plus loin. L'appr\u00e9ciation du poids et de l'importance du t\u00e9moignage d'un t\u00e9moin, conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles de droit pertinentes, est nettement du ressort du Tribunal.\n[25] L'expert n'est pas bien plac\u00e9 pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve produite devant le Tribunal, et ce, pour de nombreuses raisons. Il y a notamment des raisons de principe. Le droit est lourd de cons\u00e9quences, d'o\u00f9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de prendre en compte des consid\u00e9rations qui ne se posent pas dans le domaine de l'enseignement. D'autres raisons ont trait \u00e0 l'expertise. Le r\u00f4le d'appr\u00e9cier et d'interpr\u00e9ter la preuve ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 des experts, car ceux-ci n'ont pas la formation, la sensibilit\u00e9 ou l'exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re d'arbitrage des membres du Tribunal. D'autres raisons sont simplement d'ordre pratique. L'expert n'est pas dans la position du juge des faits, qui a forc\u00e9ment une meilleure vue d'ensemble de l'affaire et du contexte juridique dans lequel elle s'inscrit. Une question d'ind\u00e9pendance ou de partialit\u00e9 peut aussi se poser.\n[26] Rien n'emp\u00eache les avocats de soulever dans leurs plaidoiries les questions d'int\u00e9r\u00eat dans ce contexte. Je souscris \u00e0 l'opinion de l'intim\u00e9e voulant que les paragraphes 19 et 20 du rapport interpr\u00e8tent les faits et soient offensants. Il en est de m\u00eame du paragraphe 39 et de beaucoup d'autres passages.\nC. Commentaires d'ordre juridique [27] M. Wortley se permet \u00e9galement des commentaires d'ordre juridique. Le rapport montre qu'il a de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 comprendre la justification de certains aspects du droit. Il s'aventure n\u00e9anmoins sur le terrain juridique, faisant valoir, par exemple, que le fardeau de la preuve devrait incomber \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e. M. Wortley n'est pas en position de donner des instructions au Tribunal relativement \u00e0 de telles questions.\n[28] Le paragraphe 14 du rapport est offensant.\nD. D\u00e9fense des int\u00e9r\u00eats [29] Il y a aussi la question de la d\u00e9fense des int\u00e9r\u00eats. Me Burnet m'a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Yewdale v. Insurance Corporation of B.C. (1995), 3 B.C.L.R. (3d) 240 (C.S.C.-B.), dans laquelle le juge Newbury affirme, au paragraphe 4, que les experts [TRADUCTION] ne doivent pas devenir des d\u00e9fenseurs. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'expert devrait exprimer sa propre opinion de fa\u00e7on objective et impartiale. Il ne doit pas pr\u00e9senter d'arguments sous le couvert d'un t\u00e9moignage d'expert.\n[30] Le rapport traverse souvent cette ligne de d\u00e9marcation et verse dans l'argumentation. Le paragraphe 37 du rapport est offensant. En outre, le rapport pr\u00e9sente de s\u00e9rieux signes de partialit\u00e9. C'est inqui\u00e9tant. Bien que les experts aient pour r\u00f4le d'avancer une th\u00e8se particuli\u00e8re, le Tribunal est en droit de s'attendre \u00e0 une certaine neutralit\u00e9 de leur part. Si on permet aux t\u00e9moins experts de fournir une preuve bas\u00e9e sur des opinions, c'est en raison du bagage de connaissances qu'ils ont accumul\u00e9 ainsi que de la clairvoyance que conf\u00e8re l'exercice d'une activit\u00e9 professionnelle. C'est parce qu'elles comportent un volet objectif que les connaissances acquises rev\u00eatent un caract\u00e8re convaincant.\nE. Question ultime [31] Ensuite, il y a la r\u00e8gle concernant la question ultime dont l'organisme juridictionnel est saisi. On permet \u00e0 l'expert de fournir une preuve bas\u00e9e sur son opinion afin d'aider le Tribunal. Ce n'est pas dans le but d'orienter les d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Tribunal ou de pr\u00eater \u00e0 ce dernier des intentions \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Le Tribunal doit tirer ses propres conclusions dans l'affaire. Je partage l'opinion de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 savoir que les paragraphes 16 et 17 du rapport sont offensants \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[32] Le Tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer si M. Orughu a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination. C'est une question de droit. Il n'appartient pas \u00e0 M. Wortley de dire au Tribunal ce qui constitue de la discrimination, ou si M. Orughu a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination. Malheureusement, une grande partie du rapport, qui est tr\u00e8s empes\u00e9 et plut\u00f4t didactique, semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans ce but. \u00c0 mon avis, l'auteur ne respecte pas le r\u00f4le du Tribunal en tant que d\u00e9cideur en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[33] La Commission tente de d\u00e9samorcer cette critique en affirmant que M. Wortley s'est content\u00e9 de faire remarquer que la fa\u00e7on dont M. Orughu a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 correspond bien au profilage racial. Cette remarque d\u00e9montre justement l'argument. C'est exactement ce que la Commission tente de prouver lorsqu'elle soutient qu'elle doit obtenir de l'Agence les donn\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires pour faire enqu\u00eate sur les aspects syst\u00e9miques de l'affaire. Il appartient au Tribunal de tirer ses propres conclusions au regard de la preuve et de d\u00e9terminer si les pr\u00e9occupations de la Commission sont justifi\u00e9es.\nF. Sources [34] Il convient de souligner un aspect secondaire relativement aux sources de M. Wortley. Des documents comme des articles de journaux peuvent \u00eatre utiles pour illustrer un point. Toutefois, il ne convient pas de s'en servir comme fondements d'un t\u00e9moignage d'expert. Ce n'est pas l\u00e0 une question qu'on peut aborder dans l'abstrait et il vaut mieux garder cela pour une autre fois. Toute la documentation sur laquelle l'expert se fonde devrait, cela va sans dire, \u00eatre fournie \u00e0 l'autre partie. Cette remarque ne s'applique pas aux trait\u00e9s, aux ouvrages de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ou aux autres ouvrages que les autres experts connaissent bien.\nIV. D\u00e9cision [35] Le rapport est irrecevable sous sa forme actuelle. La Commission a propos\u00e9 que, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, il soit admis en preuve en ne tenant pas compte des passages offensants. \u00c0 mon avis, ce serait une erreur. Le rapport est fondamentalement vici\u00e9 et exige une r\u00e9vision en profondeur. Dans les circonstances, il serait \u00e0 mon avis pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de permettre \u00e0 la Commission de soumettre un rapport r\u00e9vis\u00e9, si elle le d\u00e9sire.\n[36] La question n'est pas n\u00e9cessairement close. L'intim\u00e9e est en droit de soulever d'autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments lorsque M. Wortley se pr\u00e9sentera \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins.\nDr. Paul Groarke\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 25 novembre 2004\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT886\/0604\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nIdris Orughu c.

L'affaire dans son ensemble\nIV. LA D\u00c9CISION\nI. INTRODUCTION A. Les positions des parties [1] Cecil Brooks est de race noire. Il fait trois all\u00e9gations, toutes en vertu de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. La premi\u00e8re all\u00e9gation est tout simplement qu'il a fait l'objet d'un traitement injuste au cours de la dur\u00e9e de son emploi.\n[2] La deuxi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation a trait \u00e0 une liste d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dress\u00e9e en 1989. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que l'intim\u00e9 a nomm\u00e9 deux stewards dont les noms figuraient sur la liste, et ce, apr\u00e8s que celle-ci fut expir\u00e9e. Les deux stewards \u00e9taient de race blanche.\n[3] La troisi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation a trait \u00e0 un concours qui a eu lieu en 1992 et en 1993. Le plaignant est arriv\u00e9 treizi\u00e8me. Il pr\u00e9tend que le processus a \u00e9t\u00e9 entach\u00e9 de graves irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s. Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination.\n[4] L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que M. Brooks a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable durant toute la dur\u00e9e de son emploi. Il pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que les concours de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re sont soumis \u00e0 des r\u00e8glements. Les promotions sont fond\u00e9es sur le m\u00e9rite. Bien que des irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s aient pu \u00eatre commises lors du concours de 1992, rien ne prouve qu'il y a eu discrimination.\nB. Le dossier [5] La principale difficult\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce a trait au temps qui s'est \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis les \u00e9v\u00e8nements. La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1996. Les \u00e9v\u00e8nements qui sont \u00e0 l'origine de l'audience se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s aussi t\u00f4t que 1988, il y a seize ans. Il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un retard abusif.\n[6] Le dossier comporte des lacunes. La plupart des documents pertinents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truits. Je n'ai entendu les t\u00e9moignages que de quelques-unes des personnes qui ont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui me sont relat\u00e9s. Dans les circonstances, je ne crois pas qu'il soit possible d'\u00e9tablir plus que les principaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l'affaire. Ceux-ci suffisent n\u00e9anmoins \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que, \u00e0 au moins une occasion, il y a eu quelque chose qui clochait s\u00e9rieusement.\nII. LES FAITS A. Le contexte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [7] Un certain nombre de questions ne sont pas contest\u00e9es. M. Brooks a postul\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois \u00e0 la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re en 1988. Il s'est rendu \u00e0 l'\u00e9difice de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re, il s'est inscrit \u00e0 un concours puis a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 comme steward \u00e0 titre temporaire. Il a plus tard d\u00e9couvert qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 dans le cadre du Programme d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi.\n[8] En tant que steward, M. Brooks devait entretenir le mess, nettoyer la vaisselle, servir les repas et entretenir les cabines. Il devait \u00e9galement passer les commandes d'approvisionnement. Il s'acquittait bien de sa t\u00e2che. Il enseignait aux autres stewards comment vider et nettoyer le lave-vaisselle, comment faire un lit d'h\u00f4pital et enseignait \u00e9galement d'autres t\u00e2ches usuelles.\n[9] Le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve de moralit\u00e9. Tim Clayton et Tyrone Saunders, tous les deux cuisiniers de leur m\u00e9tier, ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Brooks \u00e9tait un homme jovial, qu'il faisait du travail suppl\u00e9mentaire et qu'il [Traduction] s'entendait bien avec les autres. Charles Roy Hamilton, un matelot de pont, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Brooks [Traduction] \u00e9tait appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 sur les navires . Il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s simple et facile \u00e0 vivre, tout \u00e0 fait le genre de personne dont on a besoin en mer.\n[10] Cela m\u00e9rite d'\u00eatre expliqu\u00e9 plus en d\u00e9tails. En tant qu'officiers d'approvisionnement, les stewards ont la responsabilit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re de prendre le pouls du moral de l'\u00e9quipage et de le maintenir \u00e9lev\u00e9. J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Brooks selon lequel il [Traduction] excellait dans cette t\u00e2che . Il avait le don d'encourager les autres.\n[11] Il y avait cependant un aspect moins reluisant. M. Brooks ne s'entendait pas avec ses superviseurs. Il aimait faire les choses \u00e0 sa fa\u00e7on. Par exemple, un incident s'est produit en rapport avec le d\u00e9capage et le cirage des planchers sur le Henry Larsen. Il y a eu des probl\u00e8mes beaucoup plus tard \u00e0 la biblioth\u00e8que. Il \u00e9tait irrit\u00e9 par son rang de subordonn\u00e9 et avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter la cha\u00eene normale de commandement.\n[12] M. Brooks a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux plaintes. La deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tait semble-t-il une plainte concernant les pratiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de l'intim\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'embauche et de traitement du personnel. Cette plainte n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal.\n[13] L'avocat du plaignant a pr\u00e9tendu que la preuve concernant le contexte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'emploi dans la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 l'instruction de la plainte de M. Brooks. Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les deux parties, j'ai autoris\u00e9 la production d'un certain nombre d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve quant \u00e0 cette question, au motif qu'elle aiderait \u00e0 \u00e9tablir le contexte qui a donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 la plainte.\n[14] La jurisprudence \u00e9tablit de plus que cette preuve peut \u00eatre pertinente quant \u00e0 la question principale de la discrimination. Dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social) (re Chopra), [1998] A.C.F. no 432 (QL), paragraphe 22, le juge Richard a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'un autre tribunal avait commis une erreur en interdisant aux requ\u00e9rants de produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 caract\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'un probl\u00e8me syst\u00e9mique comme preuve circonstancielle permettant de conclure qu'il y a probablement eu de la discrimination dans ce cas particulier \u00e9galement . Bien que la d\u00e9cision rendue dans Chopra traitait de la preuve statistique, je crois que le m\u00eame principe s'applique dans l'affaire dont je suis saisi.\n[15] Le climat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui r\u00e9gnait au cours de la p\u00e9riode pertinente \u00e0 la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re en ce qui a trait aux minorit\u00e9s visibles n'\u00e9tait pas particuli\u00e8rement sain. La Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re en \u00e9tait consciente et d\u00e9sirait r\u00e9gler ce probl\u00e8me. En 1991, son directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Joan Jones, une activiste communautaire, de r\u00e9diger un rapport sur le racisme dans la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re. James Fran\u00e7ois, un agent de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9, a \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 de l'aider.\n[16] Le plaignant a soumis le rapport. L'intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que l'on n'avait pas vraiment utilis\u00e9 de m\u00e9thodologie pour r\u00e9diger ce rapport. Le rapport est fondamentalement un recueil d'all\u00e9gations non fond\u00e9es. Je partage cette opinion quant \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation du rapport.\n[17] Je ne vois pas comment cela importe. Mme Jones a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que son rapport ne visait qu'\u00e0 prouver que les employ\u00e9s appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s avaient l'impression qu'il y avait des probl\u00e8mes syst\u00e9miques \u00e0 la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re. M. Brooks a donn\u00e9 des exemples lors de son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 la barre. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que des postes permanents \u00e9taient, \u00e0 tout le moins, implicitement r\u00e9serv\u00e9s \u00e0 des membres de la majorit\u00e9 blanche.\n[18] J'ai permis que le rapport soit d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve. \u00c0 tout le moins, il \u00e9tablit qu'un certain nombre d'employ\u00e9s croyaient que la race \u00e9tait un facteur qui \u00e9tait pris en compte dans les d\u00e9cisions prises au sein de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re. D'autres t\u00e9moins se sont exprim\u00e9s dans le m\u00eame sens.\nB. La premi\u00e8re all\u00e9gation : iniquit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale [19] M. Brooks croit qu'il a continuellement \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination au cours de son emploi. Un nombre consid\u00e9rable d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en rapport avec les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de travail de M. Brooks. \u00c0 certains moments, l'audience a plut\u00f4t servi d'interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable que de proc\u00e8s.\n[20] Il s'est av\u00e9r\u00e9 que la plus grande partie de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur une compr\u00e9hension erron\u00e9e du processus de dotation en personnel. Le meilleur t\u00e9moignage a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par Brenda DeBaie, une adjointe aux ressources humaines, qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour le compte de l'intim\u00e9. Elle poss\u00e8de une longue exp\u00e9rience dans le domaine.\n[21] Mme DeBaie a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il y avait trois sortes de nominations \u00e0 la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re. Certaines nominations \u00e9taient faites \u00e0 la suite d'un concours ouvert. Certaines nominations \u00e9taient en vertu d'un d\u00e9cret d'exclusion. De plus, il y avait des nominations d'urgence.\n[22] M. Brooks avait initialement \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 en vertu d'un d\u00e9cret d'exclusion d\u00e9livr\u00e9 par la Commission de la fonction publique en vertu du paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi sur l'emploi dans la fonction publique, L.R.C. 1985, ch. P-33 (la Loi). Cette disposition permet \u00e0 la Commission d'exempter des employ\u00e9s de l'application de la Loi. L'ordonnance pertinente est entr\u00e9e en vigueur en 1988 au terme du d\u00e9cret DORS\/90-198.\n[23] L'utilisation de nominations faites en vertu d'un d\u00e9cret d'exclusion a permis \u00e0 la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins saisonniers et aux besoins \u00e0 court terme de la flotte. Ces nominations ont toutefois \u00e9t\u00e9 faites en nombre limit\u00e9 et leur dur\u00e9e ne pouvait pas exc\u00e9der six mois. Cette dur\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duite \u00e0 trois mois en 1992.\n[24] Comme les employ\u00e9s embauch\u00e9s en vertu du d\u00e9cret d'exclusion ne pouvaient travailler que pour une p\u00e9riode de temps limit\u00e9e, il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de conserver un dossier de la p\u00e9riode de temps pendant laquelle ils avaient travaill\u00e9 en vertu de ce d\u00e9cret d'exclusion. Cela explique les cartes de pr\u00e9sence conserv\u00e9es par Mme DeBaie, lesquelles figuraient au premier plan dans la preuve. Ces cartes ne devraient pas \u00eatre trait\u00e9es comme relev\u00e9s d'emploi officiel.\n[25] Puis il y a eu les nominations faites \u00e0 la suite d'un concours ouvert. Ces nominations pouvaient \u00eatre des nominations pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e ou des nominations pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, c'est-\u00e0-dire des nominations permanentes. Ces nominations \u00e9taient faites en conformit\u00e9 avec la liste d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 jour. Cette liste \u00e9tait dress\u00e9e en vertu des dispositions de la Loi sur l'emploi dans la fonction publique.\n[26] Les nominations pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e9taient connues sous le nom de nomination \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e . Les nominations \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e de plus de six mois \u00e9taient appel\u00e9es nominations pour une p\u00e9riode de plus de six mois ou nominations pour une p\u00e9riode exc\u00e9dant six mois . Les lettres de nomination du plaignant ont \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9es en f\u00e9vrier 1990 et elles ne faisaient plus r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au d\u00e9cret d'exclusion. Ces lettres lui accordaient un emploi \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[27] Les nominations ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 beaucoup d'amertume. Les nominations faites en vertu du d\u00e9cret d'exclusion semblent avoir comport\u00e9 diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9chelles de salaire. Une nomination pour une p\u00e9riode exc\u00e9dant six mois assujettissait un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 la convention collective. Ce genre de nomination \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9e d'un r\u00e9gime d'assurance m\u00e9dicale et dentaire. Il comportait le droit d'un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 demander une r\u00e9vision de son \u00e9chelon et de son statut si l'employ\u00e9 effectuait des t\u00e2ches suppl\u00e9mentaires. Il comportait le droit de participer \u00e0 des concours internes.\n[28] M. Fox, le repr\u00e9sentant syndical, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le processus de nomination avait [Traduction] traditionnellement fait l'objet d'abus de la part de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re. Il semblait croire que les nominations faites en vertu d'un d\u00e9cret d'exclusion \u00e9taient utilis\u00e9es pour combler des postes qui devaient \u00eatre combl\u00e9s sur une base plus r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Il croyait \u00e9galement qu'un certain nombre d'employ\u00e9s jouissaient d'un traitement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel. Ceux-ci recevaient fr\u00e9quemment des contrats, presque sans r\u00e9pits, et se voyaient occasionnellement attribuer des postes int\u00e9rimaires. Ces postes \u00e9taient avantageux au point de vue financier. Ils permettaient aux employ\u00e9s d'acqu\u00e9rir une pr\u00e9cieuse exp\u00e9rience qui leur permettrait d'avancer.\n[29] Mme DeBaie tenait une liste d'employ\u00e9s r\u00e9guliers avec lesquels on entrait en communication lorsque les nominations faites en vertu d'un d\u00e9cret d'exclusion avaient lieu. Cette liste \u00e9tait dress\u00e9e \u00e0 partir des listes d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieures et de la liste d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi. On faisait cela plut\u00f4t pour des raisons d'ordre pratique que pour toute autre raison \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que ces employ\u00e9s avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9s pour l'emploi et n'avaient besoin d'aucune formation.\n[30] Le processus d'attribution des contrats conclus en vertu d'un d\u00e9cret d'exclusion \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s interne. On manquait de temps, les demandes \u00e9taient nombreuses et Mme DeBaie regardait tout simplement ses listes jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle trouve une personne qui \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 accepter la nomination. Elle reconnaissait qu'elle tenait compte du lieu de r\u00e9sidence de l'employ\u00e9 ainsi que du lieu o\u00f9 se trouvait le navire lorsqu'elle faisait ses appels. Elle \u00e9vitait \u00e9galement d'affecter une personne \u00e0 un commandant si ce commandant ne voulait pas de cette personne. Il s'agissait l\u00e0 d'une question de bon sens et elle \u00e9tait tout simplement heureuse de trouver une personne qui voulait une nomination.\n[31] Mme DeBaie a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait trait\u00e9 M. Brooks [Traduction] avec \u00e9quit\u00e9 et avec cordialit\u00e9 . Il \u00e9tait [Traduction] un homme tr\u00e8s aimable et \u00e9tait l'un des employ\u00e9s les plus fiables. Malgr\u00e9 cela, il arrivait au bureau et se plaignait de l'emploi qu'on lui donnait. Il n'\u00e9tait pas trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment des 40 ou 50 autres employ\u00e9s \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Il n'aimait pas les affectations dans l'arctique et se plaignait que les autres employ\u00e9s obtenaient des emplois plus pr\u00e8s de leur lieu de r\u00e9sidence.\n[32] Je dois dire qu'il y avait beaucoup de place au favoritisme dans le syst\u00e8me. Malgr\u00e9 cela, je ne dispose d'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui donne \u00e0 penser que Mme DeBaie exer\u00e7ait son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d'une fa\u00e7on discriminatoire. Cette question ne se pose pas en ce qui concerne les nominations \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e car ces nominations \u00e9taient faites en fonction d'une liste d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9.\n[33] Je dois mentionner certaines des all\u00e9gations les plus pr\u00e9cises. M. Brooks a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il avait exc\u00e9d\u00e9 six mois le 26 novembre 1988 et qu'il aurait d\u00fb tomber pendant cinq jours sous le r\u00e9gime d'une nomination pour une p\u00e9riode exc\u00e9dant six mois. Je ne crois pas que cela soit important. Selon les r\u00e8glements en mati\u00e8re du service de la paie, les d\u00e9ductions auraient d\u00fb lui \u00eatre retourn\u00e9es.\n[34] M. Brooks semblait croire que les nominations \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e devraient \u00eatre comprises dans le calcul effectu\u00e9 sous le r\u00e9gime du d\u00e9cret d'exclusion. Il a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que les nominations faites en vertu d'un d\u00e9cret d'exclusion accord\u00e9es \u00e0 certains employ\u00e9s avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 converties en nominations pour une p\u00e9riode exc\u00e9dant six mois apr\u00e8s que l'employ\u00e9 eut servi pendant six mois. Il avait tort dans les deux cas.\n[35] M. Brooks \u00e9tait convaincu qu'il \u00e9tait trait\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re injuste et est devenu de plus en plus amer quant au fait qu'il n'avait pas un emploi permanent. Cela a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir des effets n\u00e9gatifs sur lui. D\u00e8s 1990, \u00e0 coup s\u00fbr, il sentait que ses pairs croyaient qu'il y avait quelque chose qui n'allait pas chez lui. Les gens commen\u00e7aient \u00e0 le regarder avec un dr\u00f4le d'air . Cela a empir\u00e9 le probl\u00e8me.\n[36] En 1991, M. Brooks est all\u00e9 d\u00eener avec l'\u00e9quipage du Henry Larsen et on lui a dit que deux stewards avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s. On lui a \u00e9galement dit que le bureau avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de le rejoindre. Il a trouv\u00e9 cela suspect et \u00e9ventuellement il est all\u00e9 voir Mme Mahar, l'agente de recrutement d'\u00e9quipage, concernant les nominations \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Elle a affirm\u00e9 qu'ils embauchaient \u00e0 partir des listes . Il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 voir les listes. Il y a eu un \u00e9change anim\u00e9. M. Brooks a eu le sentiment qu'on l'avait par la suite puni pour avoir soulev\u00e9 cette question. Il n'a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 que de huit semaines d'emploi sur un navire d\u00e9sarm\u00e9 pour le reste de l'ann\u00e9e.\n[37] Il y a eu d'autres all\u00e9gations. M. Brooks a re\u00e7u un avis d'urgence de nomination en 1992 en raison de r\u00e9parations effectu\u00e9es sur le Henry Larsen, lequel avait semble-t-il recul\u00e9 sur de la glace en marche. La dur\u00e9e de la nomination de M. Brooks a d\u00e9pass\u00e9 le temps pr\u00e9vu au contrat qu'il avait sign\u00e9 et plus que les 182 jours pr\u00e9vus au d\u00e9cret d'exclusion. Il semble toujours croire que la nomination d'urgence \u00e9tait une fa\u00e7on de lui refuser une nomination pour une p\u00e9riode exc\u00e9dant six mois.\n[38] Je crois que cela en dit plus que tout quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration des relations entre les parties. Le v\u00e9ritable probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait que M. Brooks voulait absolument obtenir un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Toutefois, rien dans le d\u00e9cret d'exclusion ou dans les nominations \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e ne lui donnait droit \u00e0 un tel poste. Cela ne signifie pas que le syst\u00e8me \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement \u00e9quitable. Il \u00e9tait in\u00e9vitable que l'utilisation des nominations faites en vertu d'un d\u00e9cret d'exclusion ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 l'utilisation des nominations \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e et aux nominations \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e9veilleraient les soup\u00e7ons de ceux qui n'avaient pas obtenu d'emploi permanent.\n[39] Il n'y a aucune raison d'aller plus loin. Peu importe les iniquit\u00e9s qui existaient \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, la preuve \u00e0 l'appui de ces all\u00e9gations ne suffit pas pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie. J'accepte les pr\u00e9tentions de Mme Cameron, pour le compte de l'intim\u00e9, quant \u00e0 cet aspect de la plainte.\nC. La deuxi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation : la liste d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 de 1989 [40] La deuxi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation a trait \u00e0 la liste d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 de 1989. Il existe une lettre dat\u00e9e d'ao\u00fbt 1989 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Brooks pour l'informer qu'il figurait au huiti\u00e8me rang sur cette liste. Il existe \u00e9galement des lettres dat\u00e9es de janvier 1992 dans lesquelles on offrait des postes \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 deux personnes dont les noms figuraient sur la liste.\n[41] L'all\u00e9gation de discrimination est plut\u00f4t vague. Elle est n\u00e9anmoins fond\u00e9e sur le fait que la liste d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 ne valait que pour deux ans. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend donc que la liste \u00e9tait p\u00e9rim\u00e9e lorsque les nominations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites. Les deux personnes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9es en 1992 \u00e9taient de race blanche.\n[42] L'intim\u00e9 invoque que les noms des deux candidats figuraient sur la liste avant celui de M. Brooks. Il pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que la liste a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9e apr\u00e8s que M. Brooks eut re\u00e7u sa lettre. Des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9tayeraient cette conclusion. Le cas du plaignant est tout \u00e0 fait conjectural. Il n'y a aucune preuve d'un acte r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible. Le concours a eu lieu il y a environ quinze ans et je ne crois pas qu'il soit possible de reconstituer ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 \u00e0 partir du dossier de l'esp\u00e8ce. La preuve est tout simplement trop faible pour \u00e9tayer une quelconque conclusion de fait.\nD. La troisi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation : le concours de 1992 [43] La troisi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation concerne le concours qui a eu lieu en 1992 et qui visait \u00e0 dresser une liste d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 quant aux stewards. C'est l\u00e0 que repose la principale question en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n(i) Le comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection [44] Steve Saboury, un superviseur \u00e0 la logistique, \u00e9tait la personne responsable du concours de 1992. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait nomm\u00e9 Don Smith et Rose Lucas sur le comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection. Il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Lucas de si\u00e9ger sur le comit\u00e9 parce qu'elle \u00e9tait de race noire. Cette mesure visait \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux inqui\u00e9tudes des minorit\u00e9s.\n[45] M. Smith poss\u00e9dait une exp\u00e9rience importante en mati\u00e8re de gestion et avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 pr\u00e9sident du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection. Il a ainsi d\u00e9crit le processus en cinq ou six \u00e9tapes qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi par le comit\u00e9 :\nLe comit\u00e9 a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 quelles \u00e9taient les qualifications requises. Il a \u00e9limin\u00e9 les candidats qui n'\u00e9taient pas qualifi\u00e9s. Il a convenu d'une liste de questions qui v\u00e9rifiait les connaissances, les comp\u00e9tences et les qualit\u00e9s personnelles de chaque candidat. Il a convenu des r\u00e9ponses. Le comit\u00e9 a ensuite tenu les entrevues. Les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences ont \u00e9t\u00e9 v\u00e9rifi\u00e9es. Le pointage obtenu quant aux r\u00e9f\u00e9rences a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 au pointage obtenu \u00e0 l'entrevue. Enfin, le comit\u00e9 a class\u00e9 les candidats selon le pointage qu'ils avaient obtenu, puis a dress\u00e9 une liste d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9.\nL'ensemble du processus s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 par consensus.\n(ii) L'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de qualit\u00e9s [46] Les parties ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve deux \u00e9nonc\u00e9s de qualit\u00e9s. Ils sont tr\u00e8s semblables. Chacun comprend une liste des qualit\u00e9s, lesquelles sont marqu\u00e9es d'un (P) ou d'un (C) afin d'indiquer si elles faisaient partie du processus de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection ou du processus de cotation . Les candidats qui ne poss\u00e9daient pas les qualit\u00e9s marqu\u00e9es d'un (P) auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre \u00e9limin\u00e9s du concours.\n[47] Le premier \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de qualit\u00e9s mentionnait que les candidats devaient poss\u00e9der :\n(P) de l'exp\u00e9rience de travail comme steward \u00e0 bord d'un navire de haute mer.\n[48] Le deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de qualit\u00e9s mentionnait que les candidats devaient poss\u00e9der :\n(P) de l'exp\u00e9rience de travail pertinente au travail de steward \u00e0 bord d'un navire de haute mer.\nCela est important parce que le candidat qui s'\u00e9tait class\u00e9 premier au concours n'avait jamais travaill\u00e9 comme steward sur un navire de haute mer. Il en va de m\u00eame pour le candidat qui s'\u00e9tait class\u00e9 second.\n[49] M. Bagambiire et M. Flaherty ont discut\u00e9 du premier \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de qualit\u00e9s. Ils ont attir\u00e9 mon attention sur le rapport de l'enqu\u00eateur de la fonction publique dans lequel il est mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nM. Savoury a convenu que l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de qualit\u00e9s figurant dans le dossier du concours \u00e9tait ainsi libell\u00e9 : exp\u00e9rience de travail comme steward \u00e0 bord d'un navire de haute mer. [Malgr\u00e9 ceci, il a d'abord d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que :] Le comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection demandait que l'on ait, soit de l'exp\u00e9rience en haute mer, soit de l'exp\u00e9rience de travail comme steward. Il n'exigeait pas les deux. Mme Boggs a \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9e car elle avait de l'exp\u00e9rience en haute mer comme commis et avait travaill\u00e9 comme serveuse. Il a [ensuite] \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 son attention qu'un candidat qui avait de l'exp\u00e9rience au MDN comme pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service alimentaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9 du processus. Il a modifi\u00e9 son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 originel mentionnant que de l'exp\u00e9rience sur un navire de haute mer ainsi que de l'exp\u00e9rience comme steward \u00e9taient exig\u00e9es. Le candidat avec de l'exp\u00e9rience au MDN n'avait aucune exp\u00e9rience en haute mer. (17)\nJe crois que cela est conforme au t\u00e9moignage rendu par M. Savoury \u00e0 l'audience, lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 adapt\u00e9 et s\u00e9lectif. Toutefois, la v\u00e9ritable force du rapport repose dans la proposition que le premier \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de qualit\u00e9s a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris dans le dossier du concours.\n[50] M. McCrossin a discut\u00e9 du deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9nonc\u00e9. Il s'est fond\u00e9 sur une fiche d'acheminement dat\u00e9e du 12 mai 1992 envoy\u00e9e par Mme Mahar \u00e0 M. Savoury. La fiche comprend une liste de points. L'un d'eux se lit comme suit : [Traduction] Devrait refaire l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de Q afin de diminuer le nombre de demandes . Un autre point se lit comme suit : [Traduction] J'ai des renseignements pour l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de Q . La fiche donne \u00e0 entendre que le premier \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de qualit\u00e9s est une r\u00e9vision du deuxi\u00e8me.\n[51] La v\u00e9ritable question est de savoir quand la r\u00e9vision a eu lieu. M. Savoury a cat\u00e9goriquement affirm\u00e9 qu'elle ne faisait pas r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au concours de juin. Cela ne fait que servir ses propres int\u00e9r\u00eats. Le contenu de la fiche donne fortement \u00e0 entendre qu'il s'agissait l\u00e0 d'une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie de questions concernant le concours \u00e0 venir. La fiche pourrait plut\u00f4t \u00eatre d\u00e9crite comme \u00e9tant un ensemble de directives. Le ton est imp\u00e9ratif. M\u00eame M. Savoury a convenu que les agents de dotation en personnel avaient le dernier mot quant au concours.\n[52] Je conclus que le premier \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de qualit\u00e9s est le bon. La logique de la fiche d'acheminement privil\u00e9gie cette conclusion. S'il y avait eu suffisamment de candidats poss\u00e9dant de l'exp\u00e9rience comme steward, pourquoi aurait-on voulu recevoir des demandes provenant d'autres personnes?\n(iii) La date limite d'inscription au concours [53] La date limite d'inscription au concours est \u00e9galement importante. Bien que nous ne disposions pas de l'avis de dotation, le rapport de s\u00e9lection mentionne que la demande de Stephen Aubut a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e le 15 juin, au motif qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue apr\u00e8s la fermeture de la poste. Les demandes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ues plus t\u00f4t dans la journ\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9es. La date limite d'inscription \u00e9tait donc le 15 juin.\n[54] Il est vrai qu'un certain nombre de candidats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9s le 16. Il existe toutefois une autre explication pour cela. Le Centre d'Emploi et Immigration Canada recevait \u00e9galement des demandes. Il a clairement recueilli les demandes qu'il avait re\u00e7ues avant la fermeture de la poste le 15 juin et les a exp\u00e9di\u00e9es \u00e0 la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re le 16.\n(iv) La pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection [55] La pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par M. Savoury plut\u00f4t que par le comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection. M. Smith n'a fait que signer les fiches. Mme Lucas n'a pas particip\u00e9 au processus.\n[56] Le formulaire de demande d'emploi de Mme Boggs est dat\u00e9 du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1992, soit six mois apr\u00e8s la date limite d'inscription au concours. M. Savoury a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait trouv\u00e9 la demande de Mme Boggs sur son bureau un ou deux jours apr\u00e8s que la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection fut termin\u00e9e. Il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'agent de dotation en personnel si sa demande devait \u00eatre trait\u00e9e et il s'est fait r\u00e9pondre de la s\u00e9lectionner pour le concours. Il a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de mentionner que Mme Boggs travaillait pour lui \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0.\n[57] Les fiches de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection ne faisaient aucunement mention de cela et je ne crois pas que Mme Boggs ait jamais fait l'objet d'une pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection. Je tiens pour av\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'elle s'est inscrite tardivement au concours. Il est clair que la candidature de Mme Boggs aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e comme ce fut le cas de celle de M. Aubut, lequel a tout simplement rat\u00e9 la poste.\n[58] Danny Greenough, qui s'est class\u00e9 au second rang au concours, a pu b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier du m\u00eame traitement de faveur. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait mention de la liste des demandes \u00e0 la fin des fiches de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection qui sont arriv\u00e9es du Centre d'Emploi et Immigration Canada. Viennent ensuite trois demandes qui ont d\u00fb arriver seules. Le dernier nom figurant sur la liste est Greenough, Daniel , et le 23 juin figure comme \u00e9tant la date de r\u00e9ception . Il s'ensuit que la demande de M. Greenough a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en retard.\n[59] Il est r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur que M. Smith ne voulait accepter aucune responsabilit\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision d'admettre Mme Boggs et M. Greenough aux entrevues. Il a soulign\u00e9 que le nom de M. Greenough a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 la fiche de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection apr\u00e8s qu'il eut approuv\u00e9 la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection. Il s'est \u00e9coul\u00e9 beaucoup de temps entre la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection et les entrevues. Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne savait pas que les demandes de Mme Boggs et de M. Greenough avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en retard. Il s'agit-l\u00e0 d'une excuse boiteuse.\n[60] M. Smith n'\u00e9tait pas le seul \u00e0 tenter de se dissocier de ce qui est arriv\u00e9. Je crois que le fait que M. Savoury ne veuille pas non plus accepter aucune responsabilit\u00e9 est important. Il jette le bl\u00e2me sur l'agent de dotation, lequel n'a jamais t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Les autres t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9vit\u00e9 la question.\n[61] Il y a \u00e9galement un certain nombre de questions importantes. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9 clairement que Mme Boggs ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux exigences mentionn\u00e9es dans l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de qualit\u00e9s. Elle n'avait aucune exp\u00e9rience en tant que steward sur un navire de haute mer. M. Savoury a tent\u00e9 de s'en sortir en affirmant qu'elle poss\u00e9dait de l'exp\u00e9rience comme serveuse et de l'exp\u00e9rience sur un navire de haute mer. Selon moi, il s'agissait l\u00e0 d'une tentative \u00e9vidente d'\u00e9tirer les exigences du poste au-del\u00e0 de ce qui est permis par la loi. \u00catre \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 n'est pas comme \u00eatre vraiment l\u00e0.\n[62] La m\u00eame question se pose avec le candidat qui s'est class\u00e9 au second rang. M. Greenough poss\u00e9dait une exp\u00e9rience sur les navires en tant que huileur, c'est-\u00e0-dire quelqu'un qui s'occupe de la r\u00e9paration et de l'entretien des navires. Il ne poss\u00e9dait pas d'exp\u00e9rience comme steward sur un navire de haute mer.\n[63] Le plaignant a soulev\u00e9 un certain nombre de questions. Il a pr\u00e9tendu, par exemple, que le niveau d'instruction de M. Greenough \u00e9tait insuffisant. Le m\u00eame probl\u00e8me se posait quant \u00e0 M. Strickland qui s'\u00e9tait class\u00e9 au 11e rang. Cela a men\u00e9 \u00e0 un d\u00e9bat quant \u00e0 savoir s'il poss\u00e9dait des \u00e9quivalences approuv\u00e9es par la CFP . Je ne vois pas comment je peux me prononcer sur ce genre de questions compte tenu de la preuve dont je suis saisi. La preuve donne n\u00e9anmoins \u00e0 penser qu'il y a eu de nombreux probl\u00e8mes en rapport avec le concours.\n(v) Le processus de l'entrevue [64] Rose Lucas a refait surface dans le concours lors des entrevues. Elle a pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que les candidats avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 soigneusement pr\u00e9s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s. M. Smith avait \u00e9crit les questions et les r\u00e9ponses. Il s'agissait de questions comme les suivantes : Comment nettoyez-vous une cabine? Comment pr\u00e9parez-vous le mess pour le souper? Les candidats recevaient des points en fonction de leurs r\u00e9ponses.\n[65] M. Smith et Mme Lucas ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'ils avaient tent\u00e9 de mettre les candidats \u00e0 l'aise. Ils ont pos\u00e9 des questions \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le. Les r\u00e9ponses \u00e9taient \u00e9valu\u00e9es imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s l'entrevue, et ce, en fonction des r\u00e9ponses pr\u00e9par\u00e9es \u00e0 l'avance. Mme Lucas a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, elle et M. Smith, avaient jou\u00e9 le m\u00eame r\u00f4le quant au pointage. Ils \u00e9taient arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 un consensus.\n[66] M. Smith et Mme Lucas \u00e9taient pr\u00eats \u00e0 admettre qu'il y avait peut-\u00eatre eu des probl\u00e8mes avec le processus de l'entrevue. Ils ont laiss\u00e9 entendre que les candidats qui avaient \u00e9tudi\u00e9 \u00e0 fond le manuel ont pu jouir d'un avantage sur les candidats qui poss\u00e9daient de l'exp\u00e9rience de travail car ceux-ci ont pu donner des r\u00e9ponses qui ne figuraient pas dans le manuel. Cela fait ressortir les lacunes qui existaient dans le processus.\n[67] Mme Boggs a pass\u00e9 une excellente entrevue et cela s'est refl\u00e9t\u00e9 dans son pointage. Il y a un probl\u00e8me ici. M\u00eame si elle a satisfait aux exigences mentionn\u00e9es dans l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de qualit\u00e9s, le succ\u00e8s qu'elle a obtenu lors de l'entrevue est difficile \u00e0 expliquer. Elle ne poss\u00e9dait pas l'exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 laquelle on pourrait s'attendre de la part d'un candidat qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi. Je crois que le reste de la preuve donne \u00e0 penser qu'il y a pu y avoir des irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s.\n[68] Le fait que Mme Boggs ait re\u00e7u des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences de la part de M. Savoury renforce l'apparence d'irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 qui entoure le processus. Je r\u00e9alise que Mme DeBaie n'a rien vu d'irr\u00e9gulier dans cela \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que M. Savoury ne s'est occup\u00e9 que de la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection. Cela ne tient pas compte du fait \u00e9vident qu'il aurait d\u00fb \u00e9carter sa candidature.\n(vi) M. Brooks [69] M. Smith a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Brooks et lui a demand\u00e9 de participer au concours. J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Brooks qu'on \u00e9tait \u00e0 la recherche de candidats appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s. En novembre, il a re\u00e7u une lettre l'informant qu'une entrevue avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e. L'entrevue a eu lieu le 7 d\u00e9cembre 1992 \u00e0 l'\u00e9difice de la garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re. Elle a dur\u00e9 entre 45 minutes et une heure. M. Brooks affirme que c'est Don Smith qui a pos\u00e9 toutes les questions. Rose Lucas a \u00e9crit les r\u00e9ponses.\n[70] M. Smith et Mme Lucas ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l'entrevue de M. Brooks s'\u00e9tait bien d\u00e9roul\u00e9. Ce fut une entrevue amicale, il \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'aise avec les questions et il s'\u00e9tait bien pr\u00e9sent\u00e9. On a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Brooks s'il s'entendait bien avec les autres. Il a r\u00e9pondu par l'affirmative. Ses r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e9taient toutefois insuffisantes. On demandait trois r\u00e9f\u00e9rences de la part de ses sup\u00e9rieurs imm\u00e9diats. M. Brooks a donn\u00e9 les noms de Karen Jewett et de Murray McLean. Don Smith a donn\u00e9 le nom de Perry West.\n[71] M. West a affirm\u00e9 que M. Brooks \u00e9tait un homme qui travaillait dur. Il avait toutefois eu un petit probl\u00e8me dans le nord , c'est-\u00e0-dire un probl\u00e8me de boisson . Ce probl\u00e8me aurait men\u00e9 \u00e0 une accusation voulant que M. Brooks aurait urin\u00e9 dans l'\u00e9vier de quelqu'un. M. Smith s'est montr\u00e9 compr\u00e9hensible. Il a affirm\u00e9 que ce genre de choses se produit lors de longs voyages et il n'a fait qu'accorder qu'un petit peu moins de points \u00e0 la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Cela n'a pas affect\u00e9 l'\u00e9valuation de M. Brooks, c'est-\u00e0-dire Tr\u00e8s Bien , laquelle \u00e9tait l'\u00e9valuation plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e.\n[72] M. Brooks a contest\u00e9 le compte rendu de M. West ainsi que le pointage qu'il avait re\u00e7u pour l'entrevue. Selon lui, le pointage quant \u00e0 l'habilet\u00e9 en communications interpersonnelles \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement injuste. Il croit qu'il aurait d\u00fb recevoir 20 points sur 20.\n(vii) Mme Howe [73] Lisa Howe est \u00e9galement de race noire. Elle a particip\u00e9 au concours de 1992 et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il lui avait fallu 14 ans pour obtenir son statut d'employ\u00e9 \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Bien qu'elle soit un peu am\u00e8re quant \u00e0 cette question, j'ai estim\u00e9 que son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait convaincant.\n[74] Mme Howe a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que votre demande devait \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en temps. Si votre demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en retard, vous auriez d\u00fb \u00eatre disqualifi\u00e9 du concours. Vous deviez \u00e9galement avoir de l'exp\u00e9rience.\n[75] Mme Howe s'est class\u00e9e cinqui\u00e8me au concours. Elle connaissait certains autres candidats et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 surprise par les r\u00e9sultats. Elle estimait qu'elle aurait d\u00fb arriver premi\u00e8re. M. Brooks aurait d\u00fb se classer dans les trois premiers. Je ne crois pas qu'elle \u00e9tait en position de juger quel rang aurait d\u00fb pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00eatre donn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Brooks. Le point est qu'elle croyait que le concours \u00e9tait une parodie. Elle croit toujours qu'il y a eu du racisme au fond de cela.\n[76] Mme Howe a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu son statut d'employ\u00e9 permanent Mme Boggs n'avait jamais travaill\u00e9 comme steward. Il n'\u00e9tait question que de lui donner un emploi \u00e0 temps plein afin de lui permettre d'obtenir \u00e9ventuellement une meilleure situation. Elle savait \u00e9galement que M. Savoury \u00e9tait le superviseur de Terry Boggs. Il \u00e9tait responsable du concours. Mme Howe a conclu que le processus avait \u00e9t\u00e9 truqu\u00e9. Cela l'avait rendu furieuse . Une personne du bureau obtenait l'emploi qu'elle aurait d\u00fb obtenir.\n(viii) La liste d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 [77] Le 25 f\u00e9vrier 1993, les candidats qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 choisis--Terry Boggs, Danny Greenough et Rick Starr--se sont vu offrir des postes \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Ils ont \u00e9ventuellement tous quitt\u00e9 pour occuper d'autres postes. M. Greenough a abouti dans la salle des machines. M. Starr est devenu officier de pont.\n[78] M. Brooks a \u00e9t\u00e9 grandement vex\u00e9 par la liste d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9. Il s'\u00e9tait class\u00e9 au 8e rang au concours de 1989; il poss\u00e9dait trois ann\u00e9es suppl\u00e9mentaires d'anciennet\u00e9 et maintenant il se retrouvait au treizi\u00e8me rang, en dessous de personnes qui ne poss\u00e9daient aucune exp\u00e9rience. Il s'est particuli\u00e8rement indign\u00e9 du fait que Mme Boggs avait re\u00e7u une note plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e pour sa connaissance des t\u00e2ches et des responsabilit\u00e9s de steward. Elle n'avait jamais fait fonctionner un lave-vaisselle.\n[79] M. Brooks a critiqu\u00e9 l'attitude de M. Greenough. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Starr avait un probl\u00e8me de boisson. Mme Howe a confirm\u00e9 cela. Je crois qu'il serait injuste de faire des commentaires sur cet aspect de l'affaire sans entendre M. Greenough ainsi que M. Starr. Selon certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, M. Starr poss\u00e9dait plus d'exp\u00e9rience que M. Brooks.\n[80] M. Brooks a \u00e9t\u00e9 injuste \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de certains candidats. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 vex\u00e9, par exemple, que Graeme Garrett prenne rang avant lui sur la liste d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Garrett poss\u00e9dait moins d'une ann\u00e9e de service et s'\u00e9tait class\u00e9 au sixi\u00e8me rang au concours. Il ne s'agit pas d'une \u00e9valuation juste de la situation. M. Garrett poss\u00e9dait 18 ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience comme steward dans la marine et avait gravi les \u00e9chelons jusqu'\u00e0 un poste de niveau 6 (steward). Il poss\u00e9dait des attestations. Il avait termin\u00e9 une formation comme steward navigant. Il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire d'un restaurant et en avait g\u00e9r\u00e9 un.\n[81] Je ne suis pas en mesure de d\u00e9terminer avec pr\u00e9cision le classement des candidats. La preuve n'\u00e9taye toutefois pas l'opinion de M. Brooks qu'il aurait obtenu un rang suffisamment \u00e9lev\u00e9 sur la liste d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 pour se voir accorder une nomination \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n(ix) La preuve de M. Fox [82] M. Fox est actuellement le pr\u00e9sident du syndicat. Il croit que les gagnants du concours de 1992 avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 choisis \u00e0 l'avance . Le concours avait \u00e9t\u00e9 arrang\u00e9 . Ses motifs sont simples. Le processus \u00e9tait partial. Le processus d'\u00e9valuation \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s superficiel. Il n'y a pas eu de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences ad\u00e9quates. Les \u00e9valuations de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies. Un g\u00e2chis complet.\n(x) Les \u00e9v\u00e8nements subs\u00e9quents [83] M. Brooks a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 penser qu'il avait perdu un certain statut en \u00e9tant class\u00e9 au treizi\u00e8me rang sur la liste d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ses coll\u00e8ges de travail ne l'\u00e9coutaient pas. Il ne pouvait rien leur enseigner . Il a n\u00e9anmoins continu\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler comme steward. Il a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d'une nomination pour une p\u00e9riode exc\u00e9dant six mois entre 1994 et1996. En f\u00e9vrier 1996, il a re\u00e7u une lettre type l'informant que son emploi prendrait fin le 31 mars pour des motifs de compressions. La lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s nomm\u00e9s pour une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[84] M. Brooks \u00e9tait alors devenu membre du syndicat et a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser un grief. On lui a dit quelques semaines plus tard que Kelly Carvery, l'agente de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 pour la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re, s'occuperait du grief. \u00c0 un certain moment, il y a eu une r\u00e9union avec John Thomas, le commissaire pour la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re, et cette r\u00e9union a eu trait aux inqui\u00e9tudes des minorit\u00e9s. La r\u00e9union a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par Mme Carvery. Apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union, M. Brooks l'a rencontr\u00e9e personnellement. Elle n'\u00e9tait pas au courant de son grief. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 quelque chose qui donnait \u00e0 penser qu'il serait prolong\u00e9 comme employ\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 pour une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[85] Je suis convaincu que M. Brooks a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le grief original. De toute mani\u00e8re, il ne s'est rien pass\u00e9. Il a \u00e9ventuellement \u00e9crit un autre grief, lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve. Le formulaire de grief est dat\u00e9 du 29 mars 1996 et mentionne ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nJe d\u00e9pose un grief parce que je crois que, en vertu de la convention collective, j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination en raison de menaces quant \u00e0 mon emploi, de pratiques de dotation en personnel injustes et en raison \u00e9galement du fait que Kelly Carvey m'avait promis un poste permanent.\nIl a demand\u00e9 qu'on lui accorde un poste permanent comme l'avait promis Kelly Carvey .\n[86] Le probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait que M. Brooks n'\u00e9tait plus un employ\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 pour une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Il n'appartenait donc plus au syndicat. Il semble y avoir eu un certain d\u00e9saccord quant \u00e0 savoir si l'on pouvait aller de l'avant avec le grief.\n[87] Le 25 avril 1996, le directeur des Services maritimes a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 M. Brooks l'informant qu'il n'avait pas le droit de d\u00e9poser un grief \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait plus employ\u00e9. La lettre mentionnait que les embauches se faisaient en fonction du m\u00e9rite, qu'il y avait trop de stewards et que la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re faisait l'objet de compressions. Elle mentionnait ensuite que la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re ferait une enqu\u00eate sur ses pr\u00e9tentions concernant les pratiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales en mati\u00e8re de dotation en personnel. On aurait pu aller plus loin avec le grief, mais il n'y a pas eu de suite.\n[88] Le directeur a par la suite \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 M. Brooks dans laquelle il d\u00e9clarait que la Commission de la fonction publique examinerait les proc\u00e9dures de dotation en personnel au sein de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re.\n(xi) L'enqu\u00eate de la Commission de la fonction publique [89] La Commission de la fonction publique a nomm\u00e9 Ella Coffill pour enqu\u00eater sur les pr\u00e9tentions de processus de dotation en personnel inad\u00e9quat. Elle a remis son rapport le 9 juillet 1997 et celui-ci ne traite pas directement des questions raciales. Il comprend n\u00e9anmoins un relev\u00e9 des conversations que Mme Coffill avait entretenues avec divers t\u00e9moins et a constitu\u00e9 le fondement d'un contre-interrogatoire important. Il comprend \u00e9galement un ensemble de conclusions. Celles-ci sont partag\u00e9es. M. Brooks n'\u00e9tait pas satisfait du rapport et a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en ao\u00fbt une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[90] Mme Coffill a conclu qu'il y avait eu des irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s importantes dans le concours de 1992. Elle a confirm\u00e9 certaines des all\u00e9gations de M. Brooks. Il y a eu un certain suivi. On a tenu une r\u00e9union afin que l'on discute du rapport. La Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re a \u00e9galement propos\u00e9 une mesure corrective dans une lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eateur. Cette mesure comprenait la tenue d'un nouveau concours ainsi que la confection d'une nouvelle liste d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9.\n[91] M. Fox a eu l'obligeance d'\u00e9crire une lettre, laquelle fut sign\u00e9e par M. Brooks, proposant un r\u00e8glement de l'affaire. La Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re a propos\u00e9 ses propres mesures. Les deux parties ont r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une entente de conciliation le 22 septembre 1997. La Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re l'a sign\u00e9e. M. Fox a attest\u00e9 le document en pr\u00e9vision de la signature de M. Brooks. M. Brooks a alors protest\u00e9 et a refus\u00e9 de signer.\n[92] Cela a entra\u00een\u00e9 un certain nombre de cons\u00e9quences. M. Savoury, M. Smith et Mme Lucas ont d\u00fb suivre un cours de trois jours sur la dotation en personnel. Ils n'ont pas eu le droit de participer \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s de dotation en personnel tant qu'ils n'ont pas eu compl\u00e9t\u00e9 le cours. Mme Lucas a \u00e9t\u00e9 irrit\u00e9e par l'hostilit\u00e9 engendr\u00e9e par le concours et elle a choisi de ne pas suivre le cours. Il semble y avoir eu une enqu\u00eate plus pouss\u00e9e quant \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation de discrimination raciale, laquelle enqu\u00eate n'a fait que retarder la plainte concernant les droits de la personne.\n[93] Le directeur r\u00e9gional int\u00e9rimaire de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Brooks une lettre d'excuse en avril 1998. Cela n'a pas donn\u00e9 grand-chose. M. Brooks a \u00e9t\u00e9 insult\u00e9 du fait qu'on lui offre des excuses sans lui offrir un emploi. Je ne crois pas que cela \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9. Rien n'indique qu'il avait droit \u00e0 une nomination \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e par pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur les autres candidats au concours. Je r\u00e9alise que les candidats qui ont remport\u00e9 le concours de 1992 ont conserv\u00e9 leurs postes. M. Brooks a d\u00fb mal prendre cela. M. Savoury a fait du favoritisme et il s'en est tir\u00e9.\n(xii) Le d\u00e9nouement [94] Dans l'intervalle, M. Brooks a travaill\u00e9 comme commis de soutien dans une biblioth\u00e8que et s'est occup\u00e9 de la fusion de deux biblioth\u00e8ques de minist\u00e8re. Le salaire de base \u00e9tait semblable \u00e0 celui d'un steward mais il n'y avait aucune heure suppl\u00e9mentaire. Maureen Martin a travaill\u00e9 avec M. Brooks. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'ils classaient les p\u00e9riodiques dans un nouveau syst\u00e8me de rangement compact. Ils recevaient des ensembles provenant des deux biblioth\u00e8ques et ne conservaient que l'ensemble qui \u00e9tait dans le meilleur \u00e9tat. C'est \u00e0 M. Oxley qu'incombait la responsabilit\u00e9 finale de d\u00e9cider o\u00f9 seraient conserv\u00e9s les p\u00e9riodiques.\n[95] M. Brooks et Mme Martin \u00e9taient tous deux fumeurs et ils allaient souvent fumer ensemble durant les pauses. Ils se moquaient de M. Oxley. Les choses se sont mal d\u00e9roul\u00e9es. M. Brooks s'est plaint qu'il avait d\u00fb prendre le contr\u00f4le du projet et trouver une mani\u00e8re de le r\u00e9aliser \u00e0 sa mani\u00e8re. Je crois qu'il \u00e9tait alors tout simplement irrit\u00e9 par l'autorit\u00e9.\n[96] M. Brooks a quitt\u00e9 son travail \u00e0 la biblioth\u00e8que en ao\u00fbt 1997, sans donner aucun pr\u00e9avis. Il avait l'impression qu'il allait nulle part. Il y avait un certain nombre de probl\u00e8mes dans sa vie et tout s'est \u00e9croul\u00e9. Il y a eu rupture mentale . Il s'est effondr\u00e9 .\nIII. LES QUESTIONS DE DROIT A. La preuve prima facie [97] La jurisprudence fait \u00e9tat d'une d\u00e9marche en deux \u00e9tapes qu'il convient d'adopter lorsque l'on rend une d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 une plainte concernant les droits de la personne. Le plaignant doit prouver prima facie qu'il y a eu discrimination. C'est \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 qu'incombe alors le fardeau de fournir une explication raisonnable quant \u00e0 ce qui s'est produit. Cette analyse pr\u00e9voit la m\u00e9thode qui devrait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e lors de l'examen de la preuve dont le Tribunal est saisi.\n[98] Il y a une qualification importante. Si je comprends bien, cela n'a aucune incidence sur le fardeau fondamental de la preuve en l'esp\u00e8ce, lequel incombe au plaignant. Il semble donc s'ensuivre que le fardeau qui incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 est un fardeau qui rel\u00e8ve de la rh\u00e9torique ou de l'explication plut\u00f4t qu'un fardeau qui rel\u00e8ve strictement de la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve.\n[99] La nature de la preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite dans l'arr\u00eat Ontario (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne) c. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, paragraphe 28, comme \u00e9tant une preuve qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant. Cette description semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 emprunt\u00e9e au crit\u00e8re du non-lieu, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'elle donne \u00e0 penser que la preuve ne devrait pas \u00eatre appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e.\n[100] Il s'agit d'une mani\u00e8re simple d'examiner l'affaire. La question dans le crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie est de savoir s'il y a une preuve, qui, en soi, \u00e9tablirait selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination. C'est de cette mani\u00e8re que la question a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9, lequel a pr\u00e9tendu que je ne suis saisi d'aucune preuve positive. Il n'y a par cons\u00e9quent aucune preuve \u00e0 r\u00e9futer. La plainte devrait tout simplement \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[101] L'intim\u00e9 a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Kibale c. Transport Canada (1985), 6 C.H.R.R. D\/3033, paragraphe 24369, \u00e0 l'appui de sa position. Le Tribunal dans cette affaire a conclu qu'il n'est pas possible de tirer une inf\u00e9rence de discrimination lorsqu'il y a irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 ou m\u00eame ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 absolu dans l'administration du processus de dotation en personnel de la fonction publique du Canada sans d'autre preuve rattachant cette irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 \u00e0 un motif de discrimination. Ce principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi dans d'autres affaires, notamment dans Chopra c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social) (no 5) (2001), 40 C.H.R.R. D\/396, paragraphe 268, (CCDP) et dans Singh c. Statistique Canada (1998) 34 C.H.R.R. D\/203 (CCDP), paragraphe 241.\n[102] Le plaignant, pour sa part, a invoqu\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision rendue par la commission d'enqu\u00eate de l'Ontario dans la d\u00e9cision Shakes c. Rex Pak Limited (1981), 3 CHHR D\/1001 (Ont. B. of Inq.), dans laquelle elle a conclu au paragraphe 8918 que la discrimination est presque toujours \u00e9tablie par preuve circonstancielle. Le plaignant n'a tout simplement qu'\u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu'il \u00e9tait aussi qualifi\u00e9 que les autres candidats. Ceci suffit pour satisfaire au crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie et transf\u00e9rer le fardeau de la preuve sur l'intim\u00e9.\n[103] M. McCrossin n'\u00e9tait visiblement pas confortable avec la position du plaignant. Je crois qu'il croyait que l'intim\u00e9 a le droit de choisir entre des candidats poss\u00e9dant les m\u00eames qualifications. Il a \u00e9galement tent\u00e9 de limiter Shakes aux faits de l'esp\u00e8ce. Dans ses pr\u00e9tentions, il a pr\u00e9tendu que M. Brooks n'\u00e9tait pas aussi qualifi\u00e9 que les autres candidats. Cela ressort des r\u00e9sultats du concours. M. Brooks a termin\u00e9 au bas de la liste d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9. La preuve \u00e9tablit \u00e9galement que certains des autres candidats \u00e9taient mieux qualifi\u00e9s.\n[104] Il y a toujours le fait que le plaignant \u00e9tait mieux qualifi\u00e9 que les candidats qui se sont class\u00e9s au premier ou au deuxi\u00e8me rang. M. McCrossin a toutefois une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 donner quant \u00e0 ceci. Il affirme que l'on peut dire la m\u00eame chose des autres candidats au concours qui \u00e9taient de race blanche. Il s'ensuit qu'il n'y a rien de racial dans ce fait. Cela est utile mais l\u00e0 n'est pas la question. La question que doit trancher le Tribunal est de savoir si M. Brooks et Mme Howe ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on in\u00e9quitable parce qu'ils \u00e9taient de race noire. Le fait que les autres candidats aient \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on in\u00e9quitable ne permet pas de trancher la question.\n[105] Dans un certain sens je suis d'accord avec l'intim\u00e9. Je ne crois pas que le raisonnement suivi dans Shakes soit d'une grande utilit\u00e9 pour r\u00e9soudre la question dont je suis saisi. La question fondamentale dans Shakes \u00e9tait de savoir si le concours avait \u00e9t\u00e9 injuste. En l'esp\u00e8ce, le concours a manifestement \u00e9t\u00e9 injuste. La seule question qui se pose est de savoir s'il y avait un aspect discriminatoire dans le comportement fautif. Cela exige une analyse d'un type diff\u00e9rent.\n[106] Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que je suis saisi d'une preuve qui permet d'inf\u00e9rer qu'il y a eu discrimination. Elle consiste en partie des perceptions de M. Brooks, de Mme Howe et d'un certain nombre d'employ\u00e9s appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s qui croyaient que le racisme avait envahi le milieu de travail. L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend qu'il existe peu de preuve objective \u00e0 l'appui de leurs convictions. Cela est en partie attribuable au fait que les \u00e9v\u00e8nements en l'esp\u00e8ce se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s il y a de nombreuses ann\u00e9es. L'affaire va cependant plus loin que \u00e7a.\n[107] La preuve de discrimination poss\u00e8de des difficult\u00e9s qui lui sont propres. La plus importante est le fait que des circonstances semblables peuvent se pr\u00eater \u00e0 des interpr\u00e9tations diff\u00e9rentes. On pourrait affirmer que l'acte de discrimination r\u00e9side dans la diff\u00e9renciation. Le probl\u00e8me est que cette diff\u00e9renciation n'existe pas ind\u00e9pendamment des actions des parties. Elle doit \u00eatre inf\u00e9r\u00e9e. Il s'ensuit que l'on doit se servir de son jugement dans toute appr\u00e9ciation des circonstances qui donnent naissance \u00e0 une plainte de discrimination.\n[108] Cela nous am\u00e8ne aux impressions des parties. Je crois qu'il y a un point important ici pour le plaignant. Le probl\u00e8me n'est pas que la discrimination est difficile \u00e0 constater. Le plaignant d\u00e9clare que les personnes qui sont victimes de discrimination n'ont aucune difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 la constater. Elles y sont constamment confront\u00e9es. Le probl\u00e8me est que leurs perceptions sont r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement \u00e9cart\u00e9es car elles sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant injustifi\u00e9es.\n[109] Cela tient de la nature de la discrimination. Il est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement reconnu que la discrimination est invisible. Les personnes qui font de la discrimination ne se rendent habituellement pas compte qu'elles font de la discrimination. Cela ne signifie pas que les autres ne s'en rendent pas compte : en effet, on pr\u00e9tend que le racisme dans la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait \u00e9vident pour les personnes qui \u00e9taient victimes de discrimination.\n[110] Il y a des pr\u00e9occupations l\u00e9gitimes de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9. Dans Shakes, au paragraphe 8918, la commission d'enqu\u00eate reconna\u00eet les limites quant \u00e0 ce genre de preuve constitu\u00e9e d'impressions lorsqu'elle cite le professeur Borins dans Kennedy c. Mohawk College (1973):\n[Traduction]\nIl faut aussi ajouter que la commission doit examiner la conduite dont on se plaint d'une mani\u00e8re objective et non pas du point de vue subjectif de la personne qui all\u00e8gue la discrimination dont l'interpr\u00e9tation de la conduite reproch\u00e9e pourrait bien \u00eatre d\u00e9form\u00e9e en raison des caract\u00e9ristiques inn\u00e9es de la personnalit\u00e9 comme un degr\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 de sensibilit\u00e9 ou une personnalit\u00e9 d\u00e9fensive importante.\nLe mot inn\u00e9es semble malencontreux. Le point en l'esp\u00e8ce est qu'un Tribunal doit \u00eatre prudent en se fiant aux perceptions des parties.\n[111] Il y a quelque chose de valable dans les deux positions. Ce serait une erreur que de r\u00e9duire le processus d\u00e9cisionnel \u00e0 un affrontement entre les perceptions de chacune des parties \u00e0 l'instance. Je crois n\u00e9anmoins que les impressions, m\u00eame de simples impressions, peuvent avoir une certaine valeur probante. Les convictions de Mme Howe, en particulier, m\u00e9ritent qu'on leur accorde un certain poids. Mme Howe n'est pas une partie \u00e0 l'instance et travaille toujours pour la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re. Elle n'a pas laiss\u00e9 ses sentiments brouiller ses relations avec son employeur. J'ai jug\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage cr\u00e9dible et convaincant.\n[112] Je crois que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Howe fournit une certaine preuve de discrimination. Il y a le t\u00e9moignage de M. Brooks et d'un certain nombre d'autres employ\u00e9s appartenant \u00e0 des minorit\u00e9s visibles qui l'\u00e9tayent. Il y a le contexte dans lequel le concours s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 et ce contexte est rempli d'une appr\u00e9hension que la race \u00e9tait un facteur dont tenait compte l'intim\u00e9 dans ses d\u00e9cisions en mati\u00e8re d'emploi. Personne n'a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 penser que cela \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement explicite. Il s'agissait n\u00e9anmoins d'une partie int\u00e9grale de la sociologie de la situation. On a reconnu qu'il y avait des griefs l\u00e9gitimes dans ce domaine.\n[113] La Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re partageait ces craintes. Cela explique pourquoi il y avait une liste d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 et une agente de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9. Cela explique pourquoi le rapport Jones a \u00e9t\u00e9 command\u00e9. Cela explique pourquoi Rose Lucas a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e au comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection. Cela explique pourquoi M. Brooks a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 participer au concours. Cela explique la r\u00e9union que M. Brooks a d\u00e9crite, o\u00f9 le directeur de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re a r\u00e9pondu aux pr\u00e9occupations des minorit\u00e9s. Je crois que cette sorte de preuve circonstancielle ajoute de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 au point de vue de M. Brooks que lui et Mme Howe ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes de discrimination.\n[114] Il existe une r\u00e8gle concernant la preuve circonstancielle. Si je comprends bien, il ne suffit pas que la preuve circonstancielle soit compatible avec une inf\u00e9rence de discrimination. Cela ne fait qu'\u00e9tablir la possibilit\u00e9 de discrimination, ce qui ne suffit pas \u00e0 prouver le bien-fond\u00e9 de la cause. La preuve doit \u00eatre incompatible avec d'autres possibilit\u00e9s.\n[115] Je r\u00e9alise que la r\u00e8gle a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on quelque peu diff\u00e9rente dans certaines causes de jurisprudence. Il ne convient gu\u00e8re de discuter ici de cette question. Le point est tout simplement que l'intim\u00e9 affirme qu'il existe une autre possibilit\u00e9. Cette possibilit\u00e9 est que le processus a \u00e9t\u00e9 entach\u00e9 de favoritisme. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 affirm\u00e9 que ce genre d'all\u00e9gation est fallacieux. Il n'y a rien dans le fait du favoritisme qui \u00e9carte la possibilit\u00e9 de discrimination. En effet, il est dans l'ordre du favoritisme d'avantager certaines personnes au d\u00e9triment d'autres personnes.\nB. L'affaire dans son ensemble [116] La preuve dont je suis saisi est plus que suffisante pour satisfaire au crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie. Il incombe par cons\u00e9quent \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de fournir une explication plausible quant \u00e0 ce qui s'est produit. Il est clair que le Tribunal devrait examiner l'ensemble de la preuve en d\u00e9cidant une telle question.\n[117] La d\u00e9cision rendue dans l'arr\u00eat O'Malley c. Simpsons Sears, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 28, reconna\u00eet qu'il y a un aspect de responsabilit\u00e9 stricte dans la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame d'imposer le fardeau de l'explication \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9. Dans l'ensemble, le plaignant \u00e9tait un spectateur en ce qui a trait aux \u00e9v\u00e8nements qui se sont produits et sur lesquels il n'avait aucune emprise. C'est l'intim\u00e9 qui est le mieux plac\u00e9 pour expliquer ce qui s'est pass\u00e9. Il \u00e9tait responsable du concours de 1992 et il a un acc\u00e8s complet aux sources de renseignements n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'analyse de ce qui s'est pass\u00e9.\n[118] L'intim\u00e9 est le mieux plac\u00e9 pour fournir une explication quant \u00e0 ce qui s'est produit. Il ne l'a tout simplement pas fait. La seule explication que j'ai vraiment entendue est qu'il y avait du favoritisme au minist\u00e8re. Cela d\u00e9place tout simplement l'objet principal de l'instruction. S'il y a eu favoritisme, comme ce fut clairement le cas, la question est de savoir s'il y avait un \u00e9l\u00e9ment racial dans ce favoritisme. Je crois que c'est l\u00e0 que le fardeau incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9.\n[119] La preuve \u00e9taye la pr\u00e9tention du plaignant que la question de la race est entr\u00e9e en consid\u00e9ration dans le processus de l'emploi. Ce n'\u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre pas le facteur le plus important, mais c'\u00e9tait l\u00e0, \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re-plan. La jurisprudence a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, depuis Holden c. Canadian National Railway Co. (1990) 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (C.A.F.), page 397, que cela suffit pour \u00e9tablir la discrimination.\n[120] L'intim\u00e9 n'a fourni aucune v\u00e9ritable explication des circonstances en l'esp\u00e8ce. La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 a essentiellement \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e de d\u00e9mentis. Les t\u00e9moins de l'intim\u00e9 ont rejet\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations de racisme. Mais, \u00e9videmment, ils ont \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9 l'id\u00e9e que le concours de 1992 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fauss\u00e9 par les politiques qui pr\u00e9valaient au sein du minist\u00e8re. M. Savoury n'a pas fait part de ses motifs.\n[121] L'intim\u00e9 ne s'est pas acquitt\u00e9 de l'obligation qui lui incombait en l'esp\u00e8ce. La plainte est par cons\u00e9quent fond\u00e9e.\nIV. LA D\u00c9CISION [122] M. Brooks a attendu longtemps pour que l'on commence \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre les probl\u00e8mes qui existaient en 1992. Il existe peut-\u00eatre toujours des diff\u00e9rences quant \u00e0 sa version des \u00e9v\u00e8nements. Le point fondamental est n\u00e9anmoins clair. Le plaignant a \u00e9tabli qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination.\n[123] Je dois ajouter que l'all\u00e9gation concernant le concours de 1992 ne concernait pas uniquement M. Brooks. Ce sont les candidats de race noire au concours qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes de discrimination. Il s'ensuit que Mme Howe a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de la m\u00eame discrimination. En fait, elle avait plus raison de se plaindre que M. Brooks \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'elle s'\u00e9tait class\u00e9e cinqui\u00e8me au concours.\n[124] Les parties sont invit\u00e9es \u00e0 formuler des observations quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration. Il est peut-\u00eatre utile d'affirmer que je suis convaincu, compte tenu de la preuve qui m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise, que M. Brooks n'aurait pas obtenu un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, m\u00eame si le concours s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9roul\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Il est \u00e9galement clair qu'il a refus\u00e9 de signer le projet d'entente de conciliation. Je crois donc que la question principale a trait au pr\u00e9judice moral. Il y a \u00e9galement la question des d\u00e9pens.\nSign\u00e9 par\nM.

INTRODUCTION [1] Robert Coulter ( le plaignant ), all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience, en ce que l'intim\u00e9e, Courrier Purolator Lt\u00e9e ( Purolator ), aurait refus\u00e9 de l'accommoder et de continuer de l'employer contrairement \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, chap. H-6 ( la Loi ).\nII. LES FAITS A. Historique de la maladie et de l'emploi chez Purolator [2] Le plaignant est mari\u00e9 et a un fils de 11 ans. Il est porteur d'une maladie appel\u00e9e dystrophie myotonique. Les premiers sympt\u00f4mes de sa maladie remontent \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 27 ou 28 ans, alors qu'il constate une perte de sa force musculaire au niveau des mains et une difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 rel\u00e2cher la contraction musculaire.\n[3] En 1990, le Dr Pierre-Paul Noiseux, un neurologue, a diagnostiqu\u00e9 chez le plaignant une dystrophie myotonique de Steinert c'est-\u00e0-dire une alt\u00e9ration d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rative des facult\u00e9s motrices apparaissant normalement \u00e0 l'adolescence. Plus sp\u00e9cifiquement, la dystrophie myotonique de Steinert est une maladie des muscles stri\u00e9s qui fait que la contraction et la d\u00e9contraction de tous les muscles ne se font pas de fa\u00e7on rapide et efficace. Parfois, la maladie peut avoir un effet sur les muscles du coeur. Cette maladie est h\u00e9r\u00e9ditaire et cong\u00e9nitale, c'est-\u00e0-dire que la personne na\u00eet avec. Dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, cette maladie peut affecter trois personnes sur 10 000.\n[4] La dystrophie ou myopathie myotonique de Steinert peut demeurer stable pour une longue p\u00e9riode ou l'\u00e9tat de la personne atteinte peut se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer progressivement pendant les ann\u00e9es, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle ne puisse plus effectuer son travail.\n[5] L'effet de cette maladie se constate par la lenteur des mouvements qui affectent la parole, l'\u00e9locution, l'ouverture et la fermeture des yeux et la d\u00e9contraction des muscles. Au niveau de la parole, on constate une dysphonie, c'est-\u00e0-dire une variation dans l'ex\u00e9cution du langage caus\u00e9e par le fait que les muscles qui modulent la parole, les muscles de la respiration, du larynx et du pharynx, fonctionnent avec un certain handicap. Ainsi, le timbre de la voix peut \u00eatre chang\u00e9 et m\u00eame devenir quasiment aphone. Une personne qui a une dysphonie peut-\u00eatre difficile \u00e0 comprendre.\n[6] Il existe entre les individus atteints des degr\u00e9s de variation ou des degr\u00e9s de s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 diff\u00e9rents. La maladie peut se manifester \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9tapes de la vie. Les individus peuvent \u00eatre porteurs de la maladie d\u00e8s la naissance et devenir symptomatique \u00e0 l'enfance alors que d'autres ne le deviennent qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge adulte. La maladie n'affecte pas tous les individus avec la m\u00eame intensit\u00e9. Il peut y avoir des manifestations l\u00e9g\u00e8res de la maladie dans le groupe d'\u00e2ge de 0 \u00e0 18 ans, une manifestation moyenne de 18 ans \u00e0 40 ans et une manifestation plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re dans le groupe de 40 ans et plus.\n[7] Selon le Dr Noiseux, le plaignant est atteint de fa\u00e7on mod\u00e9r\u00e9e, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il a de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 marcher - il marche avec lenteur - et il a les pieds tombants de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9. Sa force musculaire est r\u00e9duite en contraction et la d\u00e9contraction est assez lente. Il a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 op\u00e9r\u00e9 pour des cataractes aux yeux.\n[8] Apr\u00e8s avoir diagnostiqu\u00e9 la myopathie chez le plaignant, le Dr Noiseux ne l'aurait revu qu'en 1997. Depuis 1997, il dit le revoir occasionnellement, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s une fois par ann\u00e9e, mais pas pour des traitements car il n'existe pas de traitement pour cette maladie. Entre 1990 et 1997, il a constat\u00e9 une certaine d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration surtout au niveau des paupi\u00e8res et des yeux. De 1997 \u00e0 2003, il \u00e9value que le plaignant perd \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 3 \u00e0 4% de sa capacit\u00e9 physique par ann\u00e9e.\n[9] En 1991, le plaignant est embauch\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e comme courrier (chauffeur-livreur). Il dit avoir mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 son nouvel employeur qu'il \u00e9tait porteur d'une dystrophie myotonique de Steinert. Lors de son embauche son superviseur est George Foster. C'est lui qui lui fait passer son \u00e9preuve routi\u00e8re et son entrevue. Le plaignant restera \u00e0 l'emploi de Purolator pour 7 ans et demi.\n[10] Selon la description qu'en a fait Guy Wilson, le directeur divisionnaire pour le service des Ressources humaines pour le Qu\u00e9bec chez Purolator, celle-ci est une entreprise de services dans le domaine du transport qui fait la cueillette et la livraison des messageries c'est-\u00e0-dire des petits colis et des enveloppes. Au Qu\u00e9bec, elle poss\u00e8de trois centres de tri et une vingtaine de d\u00e9p\u00f4ts ou de sous-d\u00e9p\u00f4ts.\n[11] Selon la convention collective entre Purolator et les Teamsters, dans les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts il y a trois cat\u00e9gories de groupes fonctionnels. Un groupe fonctionnel permet de rassembler les classifications dont les activit\u00e9s ont une certaine ressemblance. Dans le groupe fonctionnel, il y a la classification de chauffeur linehaul qui regroupe tous les conducteurs de v\u00e9hicules lourds c'est-\u00e0-dire les v\u00e9hicules dont la masse nette est de cinq tonnes et plus.\n[12] Ensuite, il y a les courriers o\u00f9 l'on retrouve les courriers conventionnels , les courriers utilit\u00e9s , les courriers \u00e0 pieds conventionnels et les courriers \u00e0 pieds utilit\u00e9s . Au Qu\u00e9bec, les deux derni\u00e8res classifications n'existent plus. La diff\u00e9rence entre un courrier conventionnel et un courrier utilit\u00e9 est que ce dernier est utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de rempla\u00e7ant ou dans les p\u00e9riodes de pointe. Il n'a pas de route d\u00e9di\u00e9e et son horaire peut varier de jour en jour en fonction des besoins de la compagnie. Il a une garantie de 25 heures de travail hebdomadaire qu'il peut bonifier par des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[13] Jusqu'en 1998, les courriers conventionnels et utilit\u00e9s devaient d\u00e9tenir un permis de conduire de classe 5 . En f\u00e9vrier 1998, Purolator a \u00e9lev\u00e9 ses exigences en mati\u00e8re de permis de conduire pour ces postes \u00e0 une classe 3 . Elle a continu\u00e9 toutefois \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre la qualification des courriers qui avaient une classe 5 avant le changement d'exigences. \u00c0 la m\u00eame \u00e9poque, Purolator a \u00e9galement adopt\u00e9 une politique \u00e0 l'effet qu'un employ\u00e9 qui n'aurait pas conduit un v\u00e9hicule de Purolator pendant une ann\u00e9e devait se requalifier pour la conduite des v\u00e9hicules de Purolator. La requalification impliquait de repasser l'examen \u00e9crit et l'\u00e9preuve de conduite sur route. Les examens \u00e9taient administr\u00e9s par un chauffeur\/instructeur ou un chef d'unit\u00e9 de Purolator. Selon M. Wilson, ces diff\u00e9rentes mesures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es dans l'optique de se conformer \u00e0 l'esprit de la Loi concernant les propri\u00e9taires et exploitants de v\u00e9hicules lourds , L.Q. 1998, c. 40, que venait d'adopter le gouvernement provincial.\n[14] Au d\u00e9but de son embauche, le plaignant travaillait sur appel . En 1993, il obtient un poste permanent de 32.5 heures par semaine, mais il ajoute que les semaines o\u00f9 il ne travaillait que 32.5 heures \u00e9taient rares puisqu'il se portait toujours volontaire pour le surtemps et travaillait souvent 45 heures par semaine. Son quart de travail r\u00e9gulier d\u00e9butait \u00e0 13 h pour se terminer \u00e0 19 h 30. Dans une journ\u00e9e r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, il effectuait des livraisons de 13 h \u00e0 15 h et le reste de la journ\u00e9e \u00e9tait consacr\u00e9 aux cueillettes. En 1998, son salaire \u00e9tait de 17.26 $ l'heure.\n[15] Les courriers sont soumis dans l'ex\u00e9cution de leurs t\u00e2ches \u00e0 certaines normes comme par exemple \u00eatre en mesure de faire une livraison aux 6 minutes et une cueillette par 7 minutes. Le travail n\u00e9cessite \u00e9galement un certain effort physique. Ils sont requis de manipuler des paquets pouvant aller jusqu'\u00e0 un poids de 70 livres. Ils doivent \u00e9galement \u00eatre en mesure de monter et de descendre des rampes et des escaliers et de s'accroupir afin de ramasser des colis. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant remarque qu'il devait, dans une journ\u00e9e ordinaire, s'accroupir et se relever entre 60 et 80 fois pour soulever des paquets ou des colis.\n[16] Le plaignant travaillait \u00e0 partir du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de Ville Saint-Pierre. Ce d\u00e9p\u00f4t couvre la majeure partie du centre-ville de Montr\u00e9al, c'est-\u00e0-dire les rues Sainte-Catherine, Sherbrooke, De Maisonneuve, Ren\u00e9-L\u00e9vesque et McGill College. Cette partie du centre-ville de Montr\u00e9al est tr\u00e8s achaland\u00e9e avec \u00e9galement de nombreux pi\u00e9tons. L'itin\u00e9raire comprend le Vieux-Montr\u00e9al avec ses rues \u00e9troites, ses pi\u00e9tons et ses cal\u00e8ches.\n[17] Sur ce trajet, il y avait deux ou trois emplacements o\u00f9 le courrier, pour effectuer les livraisons ou pour ramasser des colis, devait reculer son camion jusqu'\u00e0 un quai d'embarquement. Pour les autres endroits, il devait transporter \u00e0 pied les colis. Il y a peu d'ascenseurs dans les \u00e9difices du Vieux-Montr\u00e9al donc les colis doivent \u00eatre mont\u00e9s par les escaliers. Cet itin\u00e9raire est tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent et plus exigeant sur le plan de la conduite qu'un itin\u00e9raire dans un quartier industriel o\u00f9 vous avez des quais d'embarquement pratiquement \u00e0 chaque \u00e9difice.\n[18] Pour son travail, le plaignant conduisait un camion de type Curb Masters d'\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 14 pieds et entre 3 100 et 3 500 livres. Le permis de conduire requis pour conduire ce type de camion \u00e9tait, au moment de l'embauche du plaignant, un permis de classe 5, soit le permis de conduire ordinaire.\n[19] Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effet que durant son emploi, autre que celui de 1998 qui est particuli\u00e8rement pertinent en l'esp\u00e8ce, il a eu deux \u00e9preuves sur route. Les deux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites sous la surveillance de Ferrier Caron, un chauffeur\/instructeur qui chez Purolator s'occupait, entre autres, de faire passer les examens aux nouveaux chauffeurs et qui \u00e9tait \u00e9galement coordonnateur de la formation routi\u00e8re. L'une de ces \u00e9preuves a eu lieu en 1997 et l'autre \u00e0 l'automne de 1998, quelques mois avant celle qui sera effectu\u00e9e par George Foster. Dans les deux cas, le plaignant mentionne que M. Caron n'a \u00e9mis aucun commentaire n\u00e9gatif sur sa conduite du v\u00e9hicule.\n[20] Le plaignant a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, suite \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve sur route de 1998, il a re\u00e7u un Certificat d'excellence de conduite automobile . Ce certificat mentionne que Purolator a l'honneur de d\u00e9cerner \u00e0 Robert Coulter pour deux ann\u00e9e(s) un certificat d'excellence de conduite automobile. En reconnaissance de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, de la courtoisie, de la responsabilit\u00e9 envers autrui et de la vigilance dont il a fait preuve en conduisant, sans accident, des v\u00e9hicules automobiles sur les grandes routes et voies publiques. Le certificat est sign\u00e9 par Mark Tilden et Daniel Qu\u00e9villon , le directeur de l'exploitation \u00e0 Ville Saint-Pierre.\nB. Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements menant \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du 15 d\u00e9cembre 1998 [21] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Guy Wilson affirme qu'au d\u00e9but de d\u00e9cembre 1998, Ferrier Caron l'a inform\u00e9 qu'il avait constat\u00e9 que le plaignant \u00e9prouvait certaines difficult\u00e9s dans la conduite de son v\u00e9hicule. M. Wilson dit qu'il a alors contact\u00e9 le directeur de l'exploitation \u00e0 Ville Saint-Pierre, Daniel Qu\u00e9villon, pour le sensibiliser \u00e0 la situation et lui sugg\u00e9rer de faire un audit sur route du plaignant. C'est ce que M. Qu\u00e9villon fit en confiant cette t\u00e2che \u00e0 M. Foster. Ni M. Caron, ni M. Qu\u00e9villon ne furent appel\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l'audience.\n[22] Le 7 d\u00e9cembre 1998, George Foster a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une v\u00e9rification sur route du plaignant pour \u00e9valuer sa conduite du camion. D'apr\u00e8s George Foster, l'objectif d'une telle v\u00e9rification est d'\u00e9tablir les crit\u00e8res pour le nombre d'arr\u00eats qui peuvent \u00eatre fait dans un certains lapse de temps sur une certaine route. Il y a g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement deux v\u00e9rifications routi\u00e8res par ann\u00e9e pour chacune des routes. Il ajoute que le but de ces v\u00e9rifications est beaucoup plus pour \u00e9valuer la productivit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s que leur habilit\u00e9 de conduire un camion. Ce t\u00e9moignage est en contradiction avec celui de M. Wilson, selon qui l'\u00e9valuation a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9e en raison des pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es par M. Caron.\n[23] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Paul Oc\u00e9an, le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 en chef du d\u00e9p\u00f4t pour le syndicat, M. Foster lui aurait dit qu'il avait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 cette v\u00e9rification sur route parce qu'il avait constat\u00e9 que le plaignant prenait plus longtemps que pr\u00e9vu pour compl\u00e9ter sa route. Son t\u00e9moignage semble donc confirmer la version de M. Foster.\n[24] Le 7 d\u00e9cembre 1998, M. Foster accompagne le plaignant sur son itin\u00e9raire. De 13 h \u00e0 15 h, le plaignant effectue ses livraisons. Il affirme avoir effectu\u00e9 une quinzaine de livraisons et avoir termin\u00e9 celles-ci vers 15 h. Ensuite, il proc\u00e8de, comme c'est normalement le cas, \u00e0 la cueillette des colis et des lettres. Chez un client, rue Ste-Catherine, il reconna\u00eet avoir re\u00e7u de l'aide pour charger des bo\u00eetes dans le camion mais affirme ne pas avoir sollicit\u00e9 cette aide. Il ajoute que ce client lui donne toujours un coup de main quand vient le temps de charger les colis dans le camion m\u00eame s'il n'a jamais demand\u00e9 d'aide.\n[25] Le plaignant affirme que pendant cette journ\u00e9e, George Foster n'a fait aucun commentaire n\u00e9gatif concernant sa conduite du v\u00e9hicule ou concernant la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Ils sont retourn\u00e9s au d\u00e9p\u00f4t vers 19 h 45. Il ajoute qu'il n'y a eu aucun accident ou incident durant cette journ\u00e9e.\n[26] Dans le Formulaire de certification de route que George Foster a rempli lors de cette \u00e9valuation, il note \u00e0 deux endroits, lors des livraisons, certains incidents. Le premier qui se serait produit, \u00e0 14 h 18, se lit comme suit Heurter l'entr\u00e9e. Heurter durement le quai d'embarquement [Traduction]; le deuxi\u00e8me qui s'est produit \u00e0 14 h 38, mentionne Heurter durement le quai d'embarquement. [Traduction] L'\u00e9valuation qui avait d\u00e9but\u00e9 \u00e0 13 h s'est termin\u00e9e \u00e0 20 h 15.\n[27] Suite \u00e0 cette \u00e9valuation sur route, M. Foster a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9par\u00e9, le 15 d\u00e9cembre 1998, un rapport \u00e9crit, parce que selon lui Il y avait un probl\u00e8me en ce qui concerne la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du camion conduit par M. Coulter. [Traduction]\n[28] Dans ce rapport \u00e9crit, il note que le plaignant avait eu, \u00e0 plusieurs occasions, de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 garder le contr\u00f4le du volant ce qui est d\u00fb selon lui au fait qu'il ne tient pas le volant avec ses doigts mais avec la paume de sa main. Il note ensuite l'incident de 14 h 18, au 1250, Ren\u00e9-L\u00e9vesque, o\u00f9 le plaignant aurait frapp\u00e9 un poteau de ciment. Il ajoute: En quelques occasions, les pi\u00e9tons traversant les rues par m\u00e9garde ont fait qu'il a d\u00fb tourner mais de fa\u00e7on dangeureuse \u00e0 cause de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9agir rapidement. [Traduction] Ensuite, il ajoute un autre incident, qu'il n'avait pas not\u00e9 dans son Formulaire de certification de route survenu au 1, Place du Canada, et finalement, il mentionne l'incident de 14 h 38, au 1800, McGill College. Dans ces deux cas, le plaignant aurait frapp\u00e9 le quai d'embarquement et, selon M. Foster, l'impact fut si violent qu'il s'est fait mal au dos. Dans aucun de ces cas, n'y a-t-il eu des rapports d'accidents de compl\u00e9t\u00e9s tel qu'il est pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'Article 25.03 de la Convention collective.\n[29] M. Foster ajoute \u00e9galement que pendant la partie cueillette de colis, qu'il marchait \u00e0 un rythme normal et qu'il devait continuellement attendre pour le plaignant : Il semble avoir beaucoup de difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 marcher rapidement. [Traduction] En ce qui concerne ses capacit\u00e9s de porter les colis, celles-ci semblent \u00e9galement \u00eatre inad\u00e9quates selon l'appr\u00e9ciation qu'en fait M. Foster. Une des proc\u00e9dures utilis\u00e9es par le plaignant qui n'\u00e9tait pas conforme \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de Purolator, selon M. Foster, \u00e9tait celle que le plaignant avait adopt\u00e9e pour transporter un colis d'un quai d'embarquement au camion. Au lieu de porter le colis dans ses bras et de descendre les escaliers, le plaignant posait le colis sur le quai, descendait les marches et ensuite il allait r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer le colis sur le quai. Une telle m\u00e9thode n'\u00e9tait pas productive selon M. Foster. Il note qu'\u00e0 certaines occasions le plaignant a \u00e9chapp\u00e9 les colis et qu'\u00e0 d'autres il a demand\u00e9 l'aide du client pour soulever les colis, dans ce dernier cas il dit ne pas se souvenir o\u00f9 et combien de fois le plaignant aurait demand\u00e9 cette aide.\n[30] Dans sa conclusion il remarque : Bien que ces probl\u00e8mes ont une incidence sur la productivit\u00e9 de la compagnie, la principale raison de ces incidents est que Robert est atteint de dystrophie myotonique de Steinert, une maladie d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rative. Je suis d'avis qu'il existe un probl\u00e8me s\u00e9rieux de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et d'image et je ne crois pas que Robert puisse accomplir les t\u00e2ches de courrier selon les normes \u00e9tablies par la compagnie.

Aucune preuve concr\u00e8te n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal concernant le probl\u00e8me de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re que posait le plaignant, autre que les incidents mineurs dont M. Foster fait mention dans son rapport \u00e9crit. Aucune preuve en ce qui concerne les dommages au v\u00e9hicule, s'il y en avait, ou quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tendu des blessures au dos qu'aurait subies M. Foster. Aucune preuve de plaintes de clients quant au travail du plaignant. Tout est fond\u00e9 sur les perceptions de Monsieur Foster. Questionn\u00e9 \u00e0 savoir si d'autres v\u00e9rifications routi\u00e8res du plaignant avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es, M. Foster r\u00e9pondra qu'il ne se souvient pas. Pourtant, puisqu'il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que deux v\u00e9rifications routi\u00e8res par ann\u00e9e \u00e9taient faites, il est fort probable que le plaignant ait eu \u00e0 passer par cette proc\u00e9dure auparavant. D'ailleurs, le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effet que Ferrier Caron avait effectu\u00e9 une telle v\u00e9rification \u00e0 peine deux mois avant.\n[31] Louise Fillion, la conseill\u00e8re principale en Ressources humaines, et Marie-Claude Pilon, alors la conseill\u00e8re en Ressources humaines \u00e0 l'entrep\u00f4t de Ville Saint-Pierre, ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir discut\u00e9 de la v\u00e9rification routi\u00e8re du plaignant. Madame Pilon aurait fait \u00e9tat des probl\u00e8mes que le plaignant avait connu sur la route. Madame Fillion dit l'avoir conseill\u00e9 de rencontrer l'employ\u00e9 avec Monsieur Foster et de lui faire part des constatations et ensuite de le suspendre de la route avec r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il puisse \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 par un m\u00e9decin.\n[32] Le 14 d\u00e9cembre, une semaine apr\u00e8s la v\u00e9rification sur route, le plaignant, qui avait continu\u00e9 pendant cette p\u00e9riode \u00e0 faire son travail r\u00e9gulier, re\u00e7oit un appel de son employeur pour qu'il rentre le matin afin d'effectuer des livraisons car on \u00e9tait \u00e0 court de chauffeurs. Demande pour le moins \u00e9tonnante vu le probl\u00e8me de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 que le plaignant \u00e9tait sens\u00e9 repr\u00e9senter.\n[33] Vers 11 h 30, apr\u00e8s qu'il eut termin\u00e9 ses livraisons, on lui demande de revenir au d\u00e9p\u00f4t. Une fois arriv\u00e9, on l'informe que le superviseur voulait le voir dans la salle de conf\u00e9rence. George Foster, Marie-Claude Pilon, Richard Marques, un superviseur \u00e0 Ville Saint-Pierre, et Paul Oc\u00e9an, le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 en chef du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de Ville Saint-Pierre pour le syndicat, sont pr\u00e9sents. Dans son t\u00e9moignage George Foster dit n'avoir aucun souvenir de cette rencontre alors que tous ceux qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 la rencontre et qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 confirment qu'il y \u00e9tait.\n[34] Lors de cette rencontre M. Foster informe le plaignant que sa conduite du camion est inad\u00e9quate et que sa fa\u00e7on de porter les colis n'est pas correcte. Il lui reproche d'avoir frapp\u00e9 deux poteaux et de faire rouler les colis au lieu de les lever et de les transporter. Il l'informe ensuite qu'il ne retournerait pas sur la route pour les cueillettes et qu'une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 son sujet serait prise le lendemain. Il l'assigne \u00e0 l'inventaire des pi\u00e8ces dans le garage. On l'informe qu'il doit se pr\u00e9senter au travail le lendemain matin vers 8 h et poursuivre cet inventaire.\nC. La r\u00e9union du 15 d\u00e9cembre 1998 [35] Le 15 d\u00e9cembre 1998, une autre r\u00e9union a lieu pour discuter du cas du plaignant. Autre que le plaignant, George Foster (il dira encore une fois n'avoir aucun souvenir de cette r\u00e9union), Louise Fillion, Richard Marques et Paul Oc\u00e9an sont pr\u00e9sents. Selon le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant, c'est George Foster qui a parl\u00e9 en premier. M. Foster dit que le plaignant est un danger sur la route, qu'il ne peut pas tenir correctement son volant et qu'il ne devrait m\u00eame pas avoir un permis de conduire.\n[36] Selon les notes prises par Marie-Claude Pilon lors de cette r\u00e9union, M. Foster aurait ajout\u00e9 Je t'ai vu \u00e9chapper une bo\u00eete qui ne faisait m\u00eame pas cinq livres. Que penses le client, que tu es ivre? [Traduction] Le plaignant est inform\u00e9 qu'il est relev\u00e9 de ses fonctions de courrier avec solde en attendant une expertise neurologique.\n[37] Le plaignant affirme avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris et insult\u00e9 par les commentaires de M. Foster, d'autant plus que deux mois plus t\u00f4t il avait subi une \u00e9preuve sur route et qu'aucun commentaire n\u00e9gatif n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait relativement \u00e0 sa conduite du camion.\n[38] Le plaignant dit que lors de la r\u00e9union du 15 d\u00e9cembre il a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 faire n'importe quoi pour continuer \u00e0 travailler. Il affirme avoir demand\u00e9 s'il ne pouvait pas effectuer d'autres t\u00e2ches, tel que poursuivre l'inventaire qu'on lui avait demand\u00e9. M. Foster lui aurait r\u00e9pondu dans la n\u00e9gative et aurait ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 pour conduire des camions et que puisqu'il ne pouvait effectuer ses t\u00e2ches qu'il devait retourner \u00e0 la maison. Le plaignant aurait demand\u00e9 s'il ne pouvait pas faire les t\u00e2ches d'un courrier \u00e0 pieds et M. Foster lui r\u00e9pond qu'il ne pouvait pas en raison des exigences physiques de ce poste.\n[39] Paul Oc\u00e9an, qui \u00e9tait \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du 15 d\u00e9cembre ajoute que M. Foster a inform\u00e9 le plaignant que la d\u00e9cision qu'il avait prise n'\u00e9tait pas facile mais qu'il devait mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi car il n'\u00e9tait plus qualifi\u00e9 pour le faire. M. Oc\u00e9an lui aurait alors demand\u00e9 ce qui allait advenir du plaignant. M. Foster lui aurait r\u00e9pondu qu'il n'avait rien de disponible pour lui et Marie-Claude Pilon aurait ajout\u00e9 que le plaignant irait sur l'assurance et apr\u00e8s on verrait. Toujours selon M. Oc\u00e9an, le plaignant a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 argumenter qu'il pouvait faire son travail et c'est \u00e0 ce moment que M. Foster aurait dit: \u00c9coute, on ne te veut plus ici, tu es atteint d'une d\u00e9ficience. [Traduction]\n[40] Apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union, M. Oc\u00e9an a inform\u00e9 le plaignant que le syndicat allait d\u00e9poser un grief contestant la d\u00e9cision de Purolator. Le 22 d\u00e9cembre 1998, le syndicat d\u00e9posait un grief et r\u00e9clamait que l'employeur r\u00e9int\u00e8gre le plaignant dans son poste de courrier et qu'il lui verse les salaires qu'il all\u00e8gue avoir perdus.\n[41] Apr\u00e8s la rencontre du 15 d\u00e9cembre 1998, le plaignant est retourn\u00e9 chez lui. Purolator a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 lui verser son salaire sur la base de 32.5 heures par semaine.\n[42] Le 24 d\u00e9cembre 1998, le plaignant re\u00e7oit une lettre de Purolator le convoquant, le 19 janvier 1999, \u00e0 un rendez-vous pour une expertise m\u00e9dicale avec le Dr Suzanne Rousseau, une neurologue.\nD. La p\u00e9riode entre janvier \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 1999 [43] Apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union du 15 d\u00e9cembre 1998, le plaignant prend contact avec son neurologue, le Dr Pierre-Paul Noiseux. Ce dernier pr\u00e9pare une lettre dat\u00e9e du 5 janvier 1999, dans laquelle il dit que le plaignant est capable de faire son travail de courrier mais, avec l'observation qu'en raison de sa myopathie, l'ex\u00e9cution sera plus lente que pour une personne qui n'est pas atteinte par cette maladie.\n[44] Le plaignant affirme avoir remis une copie de cette lettre \u00e0 Marie-Claude Pilon le lendemain, soit le 6 janvier 1999. Selon le plaignant, Madame Pilon lui indique que cette lettre n'est pas suffisante et qu'il devra se soumettre \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation neurologique aupr\u00e8s d'un neurologue d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par Purolator.\n[45] Le 19 janvier 1999, le plaignant se pr\u00e9sente chez Dr Suzanne Rousseau, \u00e0 la clinique priv\u00e9e Les neurologues de Maisonneuve . Il est int\u00e9ressant de noter que dans sa lettre du 22 d\u00e9cembre 1998, adress\u00e9e au Dr Rousseau, Marie-Claude Pilon mentionne que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9 depuis 1993 dans 19 accidents de la route mais elle ajoute imm\u00e9diatement que chacun des accidents de la route est banal, un accrochage en tournant, un autre en reculant....aucun dommages tr\u00e8s dispendieux mais tous ensembles, ils nous d\u00e9montrent un manque de coordination de la part de Monsieur Coulter. (C'est moi qui souligne.) Elle pr\u00e9cise \u00e9galement que [l]e g\u00e9rant [M. Foster] porte \u00e0 notre attention le fait que Monsieur Coulter conduit avec ses poignets [dans son rapport, M. Foster \u00e9crit que le plaignant conduit avec la paume de ses mains] et non avec ses mains, qu'il circule pli\u00e9 presque \u00e0 90\u00b0, qu'il entre dans le camion la t\u00eate premi\u00e8re [j'ai de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 comprendre qu'est-ce que ces deux constatations ont \u00e0 voir avec la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans la conduite d'un v\u00e9hicule]. Elle demande finalement au Dr Rousseau d'\u00e9valuer les capacit\u00e9s du plaignant d'effectuer son travail : Peut-il conduire un camion de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire? La force de pr\u00e9hension au niveau des mains est-elle suffisamment grande pour bien tenir le volant? A-t-il subi une d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de son \u00e9tat depuis votre dernier examen en juillet 1997?\n[46] Comme l'indique la lettre de Madame Pilon, le Dr. Rousseau avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un examen neurologique du plaignant le 23 juillet 1997, dans le but de d\u00e9terminer sa condition neurologique. Suite \u00e0 cet examen, elle avait \u00e9mis l'opinion que la faiblesse musculaire du plaignant, quoique lui permettant de se livrer \u00e0 la plupart des activit\u00e9s quotidiennes normales, est tout de m\u00eame suffisante pour le mettre en position de risque que je juge excessif \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de l'emploi qu'il occupe. En effet, bien qu'il soit probablement capable de conduire un v\u00e9hicule priv\u00e9, son emploi le met en situation de devoir conduire un v\u00e9hicule plus lourd sur une p\u00e9riode de 8 heures de travail par jour et accentue donc le risque d'accidents. (Je souligne)\n[47] Elle ajoute par la suite que la maladie est lentement progressive et que l'on peut s'attendre \u00e0 une d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration \u00e9ventuelle et une accentuation du risque . Ainsi, l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait au courrant d\u00e8s 1997, de l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du plaignant. Dans son contre-interrogatoire, Madame Fillion dira qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas au courant de l'expertise de 1997 avant de l'avoir lu dans le rapport du Dr Rousseau. Pourtant, Marie-Claude Pilon \u00e9tait, elle, au courant puisqu'elle en fait mention dans sa lettre du 22 d\u00e9cembre 1998.\n[48] Dans son rapport de 1997, le Dr Rousseau constate : Donc, je consid\u00e8re que le requ\u00e9rant est \u00e0 risque d'accidents \u00e0 cause de la dystrophie myotonique dont il souffre. Toutefois, par souci d'\u00e9quit\u00e9, je sugg\u00e8re qu'il serait probablement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de faire \u00e9valuer ses capacit\u00e9 r\u00e9elles de conducteur soit par exemple au Centre Constance-Lethbridge ou au Centre de R\u00e9adaptation Lucie-Bruneau (en ergoth\u00e9rapie). (Je souligne.) L'intim\u00e9 ne donnera suite \u00e0 cette recommandation que deux ans plus tard soit le 31 mai 1999. Entre 1997 et 1998, rien ne sera fait pour donner suite \u00e0 ce rapport. La question de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans la conduite du camion par le plaignant, ne semblait pas \u00e0 ce moment inqui\u00e9ter Purolator.\n[49] Suite \u00e0 son deuxi\u00e8me examen, le Dr Rousseau transmet, le 26 janvier 1999, un rapport \u00e0 Purolator. Dans la lettre couverture, elle insiste, comme elle l'avait fait en 1997, pour que le plaignant subisse une \u00e9valuation de ses capacit\u00e9s de conduire un v\u00e9hicule aupr\u00e8s d'un ergoth\u00e9rapeute qualifi\u00e9.\n[50] Dans son rapport de 1999, elle dit conserver essentiellement la m\u00eame opinion que celle qu'elle avait \u00e9mise dans celui de juillet 1997. Elle ajoute que la faiblesse musculaire actuellement \u00e9vidente \u00e0 l'examen objectif, quoique permettant au requ\u00e9rant de se livrer \u00e0 la plupart des activit\u00e9s quotidiennes normales, est suffisante pour le mettre en position de risque excessif \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de l'emploi qu'il occupe. Il est int\u00e9ressant de constater que cette conclusion n'est pas n\u00e9cessairement due, selon son rapport, au fait que le plaignant ait \u00e0 conduire un camion lourd mais plut\u00f4t au fait qu'il ait \u00e0 le faire sur une p\u00e9riode de huit heures de travail par jour ce qui selon elle accentue ind\u00e9niablement le risque d'accidents.\n[51] Ensuite, elle ajoute n'avoir constat\u00e9 aucune d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration \u00e9vidente ou grossi\u00e8re de sa force musculaire depuis son \u00e9valuation pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Toutefois, elle tient \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que puisqu'il s'agit d'une maladie lentement progressive on peut s'attendre \u00e0 une d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration \u00e9ventuelle et donc \u00e0 une accentuation du risque.\n[52] En r\u00e9ponse aux questions sp\u00e9cifiques qui lui sont pos\u00e9es, le Dr Rousseau conclut que le plaignant est apte \u00e0 occuper un travail r\u00e9mun\u00e9rateur mais elle le juge \u00e0 risque de conduire un camion de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire et \u00e0 occuper un emploi de chauffeur \u00e0 temps plein. Selon ses constatations, le plaignant est capable de tenir un volant avec ses mains mais le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne myotonique limite sa capacit\u00e9 de rel\u00e2cher le volant lorsqu'il doit effectuer des gestes r\u00e9p\u00e9titifs. Selon elle, le plaignant pourrait \u00eatre relocalis\u00e9 \u00e0 un travail plus appropri\u00e9, pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiellement un travail de bureau.\n[53] Madame Fillion reconna\u00eetra dans son contre-interrogatoire qu'il ne sera jamais question de la relocalisation du plaignant \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque. Purolator pr\u00e9f\u00e8re s'en remettre \u00e0 une autre recommandation du Dr Rousseau soit de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation des capacit\u00e9s r\u00e9elles de conduite, par une mise en situation et une \u00e9valuation en ergoth\u00e9rapie , une recommandation qui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en 1997.\n[54] Le Dr Noiseux, le t\u00e9moin expert de la Commission et du plaignant, a \u00e9galement effectu\u00e9, le 28 juillet 2003, \u00e0 la demande de la Commission, une expertise neurologique du plaignant. Il constate qu'en raison de la dysfonction des muscles stri\u00e9s que le plaignant a une fonction d'ex\u00e9cution musculaire au ralenti que ce soit dans la contraction ou dans la d\u00e9contraction et que ceci affecte sa bouche, sa langue, ses yeux, ses mains, ses bras, ses pieds, son bassin, les quadriceps et tous les muscles impliqu\u00e9s dans la marche. En cons\u00e9quence, avec une vitesse de contraction qui est soutenue et une vitesse de d\u00e9contraction qui se fait au ralenti et avec la myotonie au niveau des muscles, le docteur conclut, que le plaignant fonctionne au ralenti.\n[55] En ce qui concerne la force, il dit que le plaignant ne peut pas soulever des poids sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 40 livres. Il pr\u00e9cise que c'est la fr\u00e9quence qui est importante dans ce cas. Le plaignant pourrait soulever un objet de ce poids mais si cela \u00e9tait trop fr\u00e9quent, il serait probablement dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 de le faire.\n[56] Il indique que lorsqu'il est accroupi, le plaignant ne peut pas se relever sans se tenir sur un meuble ou sur un p\u00f4le d'appui. Au niveau du cervelet, ses mouvements sont lents, mais ils ne sont pas d\u00e9compos\u00e9s. La d\u00e9marche se fait un peu en steppage .\n[57] Dans son rapport d'expertise, le Dr Noiseux conclut que les muscles du plaignant fonctionnent au ralenti dans tout le corps. L'ex\u00e9cution des mouvements \u00e0 vitesse rapide n'est pas possible puisque les muscles ne se d\u00e9contractent pas assez rapidement. \u00c0 son avis, la condition m\u00e9dicale du plaignant ne l'emp\u00eache pas de conduire un camion de livraison m\u00eame si ses manuvres musculaires sont plus ralentis que ceux d'une personne qui n'est pas atteinte de cette maladie. Il est donc, selon son \u00e9valuation, apte \u00e0 faire son travail normal.\n[58] Selon le Dr Noiseux, l'ex\u00e9cution de mouvements \u00e0 vitesse rapide n'est pas possible puisque les muscles ne se d\u00e9contractent pas assez rapidement. Il ajoute qu'il y a une par\u00e9sie (une faiblesse) de manipulation. Le seul muscle qui n'est pas atteint actuellement est le cur. Il reconna\u00eet qu'en raison de la condition m\u00e9dicale du plaignant, tourner un volant rapidement en utilisant des mouvements de contractions et de d\u00e9contractions serait difficile. Il accepte que lors des virages le plaignant sera plus lent avec un rayon de braquage plus grand. Il admet \u00e9galement que l'absence totale de r\u00e9flexe au niveau des achill\u00e9ens emp\u00eache les mouvements de mise en garde ou de pr\u00e9paration de contraction et de d\u00e9contraction qui sont n\u00e9cessaires pour l'acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration et la d\u00e9c\u00e9l\u00e9ration lorsqu'une personne conduit un v\u00e9hicule. Le r\u00e9flexe monosynaptique, un r\u00e9flexe involontaire ou un automatisme, n'est pas l\u00e0, mais le Dr Noiseux ajoute imm\u00e9diatement que cela n'emp\u00eache pas le plaignant de donner une commande volontaire \u00e0 son pied d'acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer ou de ralentir, mais encore une fois avec une certaine lenteur.\n[59] Il ajoute d'ailleurs que les seules restrictions du plaignant sont de ne pas lever des poids sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 40 livres, de courir, de faire du sport, de faire de l'activit\u00e9 physique ext\u00e9nuante et de monter des escaliers rapidement.\n[60] Autre que ces restrictions, le plaignant est, de son avis, capable d'accomplir toutes les t\u00e2ches d'un courrier, mais au ralenti. Il admet qu'il est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 cette conclusion en se fondant sur la description des t\u00e2ches que le plaignant lui a fournie et non sur une description de t\u00e2ches formelle de l'intim\u00e9e. Il dit avoir tenu compte du fait que le plaignant avait ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 son travail sans probl\u00e8me de 1991 \u00e0 1998. \u00c0 son avis ce patient aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre relocalis\u00e9...pour faire un autre travail compatible avec sa condition. Une recommandation similaire \u00e0 celle faite par le Dr Rousseau dans ses rapports de 1997 et 1999.\n[61] Le Dr Noiseux dit ne rien voir de contradictoire dans l'affirmation que le plaignant \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 faire son travail et le commentaire qu'on aurait d\u00fb [le] relocalis\u00e9. Une fois que le retrait du plaignant de son poste \u00e9tait acquis, l'intim\u00e9 devait, selon le Dr Noiseux lui trouver un travail compatible avec sa condition c'est-\u00e0-dire un travail qui peut \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 avec une certaine lenteur d'ex\u00e9cution, un travail de bureau, par exemple.\n[62] Le Dr Noiseux a \u00e9galement pris connaissance des deux rapports du Dr Rousseau afin de pr\u00e9parer son rapport d'expertise. Il affirme ne pas partager les conclusions du Dr Rousseau quant au risque que constitue le plaignant dans ses fonctions de conducteur de camion. Selon lui cette conclusion ne d\u00e9coule pas logiquement des pr\u00e9misses des rapports. En ce qui concerne les \u00e9valuations des Drs Noiseux et Rousseau, puisque le Dr Noiseux a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner et qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet d'un contre-interrogatoire et qu'il m'est apparu comme un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible, j'ai tendance, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il y a des contradictions dans les rapports, \u00e0 pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer les conclusions du Dr Noiseux.\n[63] Suite au rapport du Dr Rousseau, le plaignant a une nouvelle rencontre, le 29 janvier 1999 avec Louise Fillion et Marie-Claude Pilon. Elles l'auraient alors inform\u00e9 des conclusions du rapport du Dr Rousseau et lui auraient sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter une demande sous le r\u00e9gime d' assurance-maladie long terme de Purolator. Madame Fillion a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effet qu'elle aurait mentionn\u00e9 au plaignant qu'il devait faire remplir rapidement les formulaires, en y joignant une copie d'un rapport m\u00e9dical, puisque \u00e0 partir de ce moment il ne serait plus r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 par Purolator. Madame Fillion indique \u00e9galement qu'elle a alors inform\u00e9 le plaignant que des d\u00e9marches seraient prises pour qu'une expertise soit faite par un ergoth\u00e9rapeute.\n[64] Le formulaire d'assurance-maladie sera d\u00fbment rempli et exp\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0 l'assureur qui refusera la demande du plaignant. La raison de ce refus est que le Dr Drainville, le m\u00e9decin de famille du plaignant, indiquait dans son rapport qu'il n'avait pas plac\u00e9 le plaignant en arr\u00eat de travail. Le plaignant n'a pas fait appel de la d\u00e9cision. Madame Fillion t\u00e9moigne que suite \u00e0 ce refus de la compagnie d'assurance, elle leur a fait parvenir une copie du rapport du Dr Rousseau, mais la d\u00e9cision est demeur\u00e9e inchang\u00e9e.\n[65] Questionn\u00e9 \u00e0 savoir pourquoi elle n'avait pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 assigner le plaignant \u00e0 un autre poste au moment o\u00f9 elle a re\u00e7u le rapport du Dr Rousseau, Madame Fillion r\u00e9pondra que ce n'\u00e9tait pas la politique de l'intim\u00e9e d'assigner \u00e0 un autre poste un employ\u00e9 qui recevait l'assurance-maladie d'autant plus que le plaignant demandait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer son poste de courrier.\n[66] Le 15 f\u00e9vrier 1999, le plaignant re\u00e7oit son Relev\u00e9 d'emploi . Selon ce relev\u00e9, Purolator a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement puisque dans la case indiquant la raison du pr\u00e9sent relev\u00e9 d'emploi , on avait inscrit le code M qui signifie cong\u00e9diement . D'apr\u00e8s Marie-Claude Pilon, la mention du code M \u00e9tait une erreur. Selon elle, le 16 f\u00e9vrier 1999, des directives sont donn\u00e9es pour d\u00e9sactiver le plaignant parce qu'il ne recevrait plus de paies. Elle ajoute cependant qu'il \u00e9tait toujours consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un employ\u00e9. Le 21 juin 1999, apr\u00e8s son \u00e9valuation au centre Lucie Bruneau sur lequel nous reviendrons plus loin, le plaignant re\u00e7oit un relev\u00e9 d'emploi modifi\u00e9 sur lequel la raison indiquait maintenant un code D , qui signifie maladie ou blessure . Je ne met aucunement en doute le t\u00e9moignage de Madame Pilon mais je me questionne sur le d\u00e9lai qui s'est \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre l'erreur et sa correction.\n[67] Le plaignant mentionne qu'il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9, le 25 f\u00e9vrier 1999 suite \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission du premier Relev\u00e9 d'emploi , un nouveau grief. Dans ce grief, il contestait son cong\u00e9diement. Il est surprenant que Purolator, en prenant connaissance de ce grief, n'ait pas corrig\u00e9 ce qu'elle consid\u00e9rait comme une erreur sur le relev\u00e9 d'emploi du 15 f\u00e9vrier 1999.\n[68] Apr\u00e8s son \u00e9valuation par le Dr Rousseau, le plaignant est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 une ergoth\u00e9rapeute, France Duhamel, du Centre Lucie Bruneau. Selon Louise Fillion, il devait y avoir deux \u00e9tapes \u00e0 cette expertise. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tait une \u00e9valuation routi\u00e8re avec une voiture et, plus tard, si n\u00e9cessaire, une deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9valuation serait faite avec cette fois un camion. Cette proc\u00e9dure aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e par le Centre Lucie Bruneau. S'il y avait des probl\u00e8mes avec la voiture alors il n'y aurait pas de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 \u00e0 proc\u00e9der avec une deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9valuation.\n[69] L'\u00e9valuation de la conduite automobile du plaignant par l'ergoth\u00e9rapeute s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e le 31 mai 1999. Le plaignant s'est dit surpris que cette \u00e9valuation soit faite avec une voiture \u00e0 transmission manuelle \u00e0 cinq vitesses sans servo-direction alors que chez l'intim\u00e9 il est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 conduire des camions. L'\u00e9valuation a pris deux heures et demie et a suivi l'itin\u00e9raire du plaignant.\n[70] Le rapport de l'ergoth\u00e9rapeute fut produit le 7 juin 1999. De l'\u00e9valuation routi\u00e8re du plaignant, les seuls commentaires qui peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme n\u00e9gatifs sont ceux concernant les virages qui sont ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, selon l'\u00e9valuateur, plus lentement que normale. L'\u00e9valuateur constate une tendance \u00e0 tourner en suivant un rayon de braquage un peu plus grand et que les virages en t\u00eate d'\u00e9pingle sont un peu plus difficiles. Elle remarque \u00e9galement que les manuvres ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es pour reculer en tournant doivent \u00eatre faites \u00e0 une vitesse un peu plus lente \u00e0 cause de la d\u00e9ficience motrice, mais que le plaignant recule ad\u00e9quatement en se servant des miroirs. Aucune mention de manuvre pouvant mettre en danger la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du plaignant ou celle des pi\u00e9tons.\n[71] De son \u00e9valuation, elle conclut que le plaignant peut conduire un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire. Elle sugg\u00e8re qu'il modifie certaines manuvres afin de compenser sa d\u00e9ficience motrice, comme par exemple tourner un peu plus lentement. Elle ajoute \u00e9galement que le plaignant pr\u00e9sente des limitations fonctionnelles et propose l'ajout d'une boule (ou autre type de poign\u00e9e) au volant afin de faciliter les virages en raison du nombre d'heures de conduite par jour.\n[72] Selon le Dr Noiseux, la suggestion d'ajouter une boule sur le volant est inutile. Il note que le plaignant doit ex\u00e9cuter ses t\u00e2ches de conducteur avec les deux mains, alors l'ajout d'une boule ne ferait pas de diff\u00e9rence Il ajoute que le plaignant n'a pas de probl\u00e8me avec sa prise ( grip ) sur le volant. Il n'a pas de probl\u00e8me avec la contraction de ses muscles; son probl\u00e8me, c'est la d\u00e9contraction.\n[73] \u00c0 la question \u00e0 savoir si le plaignant peut ex\u00e9cuter tous les aspects de la t\u00e2che de courrier chez Purolator, Madame Duhamel r\u00e9pond : Concernant la conduite du v\u00e9hicule, monsieur Coulter, peut s'acquitter de tous les aspects de cette partie de la t\u00e2che. Pour la livraison des colis, il est possible que monsieur pr\u00e9sente certaines difficult\u00e9s mais il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable qu'il soit \u00e9valu\u00e9 par les ergoth\u00e9rapeutes en \u00e9valuation des capacit\u00e9s de travail. Aucun suivi ne fut donn\u00e9 \u00e0 cette recommandation.\n[74] Finalement, elle constate que pour le moment et d'apr\u00e8s les tests routiers, le plaignant ne constitue pas un danger imminent. Malgr\u00e9 l'utilisation d'une automobile, cette conclusion est tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente de celle de George Foster qui affirmait que si ce n'\u00e9tait que de lui que le plaignant n'aurait pas de permis de conduire.\n[75] Selon Madame Fillion, Purolator avait certains probl\u00e8mes avec la recommandation concernant la boule puisque son installation repr\u00e9sentait une restriction sur le permis de conduire. De plus, Purolator n'\u00e9tait toujours pas convaincue de la capacit\u00e9 du plaignant de conduire un camion. La d\u00e9cision fut donc prise de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me expertise sur route avec un camion. Le 5 ao\u00fbt 1999, deux mois apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t du rapport de Madame Duhamel, Madame Fillion a une conversation \u00e0 ce sujet avec Isabelle Fontaine de S\u00e9curiMed. Ce n'est toutefois que le 14 octobre 1999, que S\u00e9curiMed fera parvenir \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e une \u00e9valuation des co\u00fbts reli\u00e9s \u00e0 une \u00e9preuve sur route avec un camion. Finalement, l'\u00e9valuation avec un camion n'aura jamais lieu.\n[76] Selon les t\u00e9moins de Purolator, deux raisons expliqueraient pourquoi cette expertise n'a jamais eu lieu. Premi\u00e8rement, il semblerait qu'il \u00e9tait difficile de trouver un moniteur capable d'effectuer cette expertise avec un camion. Toutefois, aucune preuve ne fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e quant aux d\u00e9marches entreprises en ce sens autre que l'\u00e9valuation des co\u00fbts pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par S\u00e9curiMed en octobre 1999. La deuxi\u00e8me a trait \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la SAAQ du 1er octobre 1999, d'\u00e9mettre des restrictions sur le permis de conduire du plaignant qui l'emp\u00eacheront de conduire un camion.\n[77] En effet, vers le mois de septembre 1999, le plaignant a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'appliquer pour son permis de conduire de classe 1 afin, selon lui, de pouvoir se trouver un autre emploi de chauffeur. Le 1er octobre 1999, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'assurance automobile du Qu\u00e9bec l'avise par lettre qu'elle refuse de lui d\u00e9livrer un permis de conduire de classe 1 en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Le plaignant conservait toutefois, le privil\u00e8ge de conduire des v\u00e9hicules correspondant au permis de classes 5 et 6A mais avec certaines restrictions dont une restriction sur le poids des v\u00e9hicules. Selon ces nouvelles restrictions, le plaignant ne peut pas conduire des v\u00e9hicules exc\u00e9dent 2 500 kilogrammes, ce qui lui enl\u00e8ve de nombreuses possibilit\u00e9s d'emploi, notamment chez Purolator o\u00f9 les camions exc\u00e8dent ce poids.\n[78] Le plaignant affirme qu'il aurait pu faire appel de cette d\u00e9cision de la SAAQ mais qu'il avait choisi de ne pas le faire en raison de l'existence de l'article 11.04b) de la Convention collective. Il croyait qu'il pourrait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de cet article et \u00eatre d\u00e9plac\u00e9 dans une autre classification. Un grief sera d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le 8 d\u00e9cembre 1999, demandant \u00e0 l'employeur d'appliquer l'Article 11.04b).\n[79] Jimmy Mansell, t\u00e9moignera qu'il a eu apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ce grief, des discussions avec Louise Fillion afin de voir s'il \u00e9tait possible de d\u00e9placer le plaignant au sein de l'entreprise. Il est important de noter que l'Article 11.04b) ne pr\u00e9voit pas la cr\u00e9ation d'un nouveau poste mais le d\u00e9placement de l'employ\u00e9 au sein de l'entreprise selon la proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'Article 15.02 de la Convention collective. Selon Monsieur Wilson, cette disposition ne s'appliquait pas au cas du plaignant parce que son permis de conduire n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 mais il avait uniquement \u00e9t\u00e9 reclassifi\u00e9 .\n[80] Une rencontre entre le plaignant, M. Mansell, M. Wilson et Mme Fillion a lieu le 22 d\u00e9cembre 1999. Lors de cette rencontre les parties discutent de la possibilit\u00e9 de relocaliser le plaignant. D'apr\u00e8s M. Wilson, le poste de marqueur semblait \u00eatre le seul poste au niveau des op\u00e9rations qui aurait pu convenir au plaignant car ce poste est l'un des rares o\u00f9 l'employ\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e0 d\u00e9ployer de grands efforts physiques. M. Wilson affirme qu'il \u00e9tait convaincu que le plaignant pouvait exercer l'essentiel des fonctions de marqueur et qu'il \u00e9tait possible de trouver un environnement qui conviendrait \u00e0 sa situation.\n[81] Le marqueur est la personne charg\u00e9e d'identifier sur les colis leur destination pour en faciliter le triage et l'acheminement. Le salaire se compare \u00e0 celui d'un courrier.\n[82] Les repr\u00e9sentants de Purolator ont fourni au plaignant un livre pour qu'il puisse \u00e9tudier les codes pour devenir marqueur car le plaignant devait se qualifier pour ce poste. S'il r\u00e9ussissait, l'employeur devait alors proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des v\u00e9rifications pour trouver un poste en se conformant aux dispositions de la convention collective. Selon M. Wilson, Purolator avait manifest\u00e9 au syndicat son ouverture \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer des opportunit\u00e9s qui pouvaient ne pas se conformer \u00e0 ces dispositions. Pour y arriver, il fallait toutefois conclure une lettre d'entente avec le syndicat.\n[83] Le plaignant a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas postuler pour le poste de marqueur car Monsieur Mansell lui aurait dit que m\u00eame s'il se qualifiait, il ne pourrait \u00eatre d\u00e9plac\u00e9 vers un tel poste car il n'avait pas suffisamment d'anciennet\u00e9. M. Mansell pr\u00e9cise que le plaignant aurait pu \u00eatre d\u00e9plac\u00e9 vers un poste de marqueur mais qu'il n'aurait pu avoir suffisamment d'heures pour subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins en raison de son peu d'anciennet\u00e9 Toutefois, le plaignant reconna\u00eet que l'intim\u00e9e lui aurait dit lors de la r\u00e9union du 22 d\u00e9cembre : Si tu r\u00e9ussis \u00e0 passer la position de marqueur nous verrons si nous pouvons te trouver un emploi quelque part. [Traduction]\n[84] Purolator et le syndicat ne se sont jamais rendus au point dans leur discussion o\u00f9 ils auraient envisag\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 d'une entente sp\u00e9ciale qui aurait permis de d\u00e9roger \u00e0 la convention collective afin de d\u00e9placer le plaignant vers un poste de marqueur .\n[85] Une deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9union a lieu le 7 janvier 2000. Sont pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 cette r\u00e9union, le plaignant, Jimmy Mansell, Guy Wilson et Louise Fillion. Lors de la rencontre, ils discutent, dans un premier temps, des possibilit\u00e9s de relocaliser le plaignant au niveau des op\u00e9rations mais, selon le t\u00e9moignage de Madame Fillion, la condition m\u00e9dicale du plaignant fait en sorte que la seule possibilit\u00e9 dans les op\u00e9rations \u00e9tait un poste de marqueur . Il est donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de se concentrer sur les postes cl\u00e9ricaux.\n[86] Le plaignant indique son d\u00e9sir de passer les tests de comp\u00e9tence pour les postes d'agent de soutien au RRP (le centre de contr\u00f4le des documents) et de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniste au centre d'appels. Le plaignant r\u00e9ussira les tests de comp\u00e9tences pour les deux postes. Ces deux postes se trouvent dans une unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation diff\u00e9rente de celle des courriers soit le Syndicat canadien de l'\u00c9nergie et du Papier. Le plaignant choisira finalement le poste de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniste au centre d'appels parce que c'est celui qui paie le mieux. Les possibilit\u00e9s d'avancement dans ce poste sont \u00e9galement plus int\u00e9ressantes selon le plaignant.\nE. Son poste au centre d'appel [87] Le plaignant commence \u00e0 travailler au centre d'appel le 25 janvier 2000. Son salaire est de 13.24 $ l'heure.\n[88] Le plaignant, m\u00eame s'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 l'emploi de Purolator \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9, pour les fins de ce poste, comme un nouvel employ\u00e9 puisqu'il arrivait d'une autre unit\u00e9 d'accr\u00e9ditation. Il \u00e9tait donc soumis \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode de probation de 60 jours.\n[89] Le 8 f\u00e9vrier 2000, Jos\u00e9e Nadon dit avoir rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant afin de lui expliquer, entre autres, les \u00e9valuations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res qui sont faites des employ\u00e9s. En ce qui \u00e0 trait aux \u00e9valuations, \u00e0 tous les mois les employ\u00e9s doivent se soumettre \u00e0 des tests de connaissance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Des \u00e9coutes mensuelles des communications des employ\u00e9s avec la client\u00e8le sont \u00e9galement effectu\u00e9s et \u00e9valu\u00e9s par les superviseurs. \u00c0 partir de ces \u00e9valuations, des rapports de qualit\u00e9 sont pr\u00e9par\u00e9s pour chaque employ\u00e9.\n[90] Lors de son premier rapport de qualit\u00e9 en f\u00e9vrier 2000, le plaignant a obtenu une note de 84%. Selon Jos\u00e9e Nadon, les plus grandes difficult\u00e9s du plaignant lors de cette \u00e9valuation sont qu'il parle trop vite, qu'il omet de confirmer certains renseignements et qu'il tutoie la client\u00e8le. Au mois de mars 2000, son rapport de qualit\u00e9 montre que sa note augmente \u00e0 94%; au mois d'avril sa note est de 91%. On lui fait les m\u00eames critiques concernant son d\u00e9bit, son tutoiement et le fait qu'il omet parfois de confirmer certains renseignements.\n[91] Le rapport de qualit\u00e9 pour le mois de mai 2000 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produit en preuve et aucune raison n'ait donn\u00e9 pour expliquer son absence.\n[92] Selon Madame Nadon, la moyenne pour les quatre \u00e9valuations d'appels du plaignant \u00e9tait de 89%. Elle ajoute qu'elle ne voyait aucune progression dans ses r\u00e9sultats, sauf entre f\u00e9vrier et mars. Toutefois, n'ayant pas le r\u00e9sultat pour mai, il est difficile pour moi de tirer cette conclusion.\n[93] Pour les tests de connaissance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ses notes sont de 85% pour f\u00e9vrier 2000, 60% pour mars 2000 et 85% pour avril 2000. Notons que pour le mois d'avril, seule la note a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en preuve car les documents du test n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s. Au test de connaissance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, du mois de mai 2000, le plaignant re\u00e7oit une note de 100%. Au niveau des examens sa moyenne pour les quatre mois \u00e9tait de 83%.\n[94] Selon Madame Nadon, l'employeur exigeait que ses employ\u00e9s atteignent la note de 95% dans les deux \u00e9valuations. Elle ajoute que les \u00e9valuations de rendement du plaignant ne sont pas tr\u00e8s bonnes. Elle dit qu'elle a rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant le 26 avril 2000 et lui a expliqu\u00e9 ce que l'employeur attendait de lui, les objectifs qu'il devait atteindre et qu'il avait un mois pour s'am\u00e9liorer. Elle ajoute lui avoir indiqu\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait en probation et que s'il ne rencontrait pas ces attentes alors Purolator mettrait fin \u00e0 son emploi.\n[95] Le rendement du plaignant ne s'\u00e9tant pas am\u00e9lior\u00e9, Madame Nadon dit avoir discut\u00e9 de son cas avec Madame Fillion qui elle en a discut\u00e9 avec Monsieur Wilson. La d\u00e9cision est alors prise de mettre fin \u00e0 l'emploi du plaignant. Selon leurs \u00e9valuations, le plaignant n'a pas les comp\u00e9tences pour occuper un poste de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniste au centre d'appels.\n[96] Le 9 juin 2000, Jos\u00e9e Nadon rencontre le plaignant et lui dit qu'il est cong\u00e9di\u00e9 en raison de la qualit\u00e9 de son travail.\n[97] Le plaignant affirme que son cong\u00e9diement du centre d'appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour lui une surprise puisqu'il ne s'attendait aucunement \u00e0 cela. Il s'est dit choqu\u00e9 et d\u00e9courag\u00e9 par cette d\u00e9cision de son employeur. Puisqu'il \u00e9tait en p\u00e9riode d'essai et qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas permanent, il lui \u00e9tait impossible de d\u00e9poser un grief. L'intim\u00e9e n'a jamais consid\u00e9r\u00e9 de le relocaliser dans un autre poste. Comme l'a soulign\u00e9 Madame Fillion Quand une personne, en p\u00e9riode probatoire ... est termin\u00e9e, on ne pense pas \u00e0 le relocaliser dans un autre poste. S'il n'a pas les comp\u00e9tences pour faire une fonction ou un poste pr\u00e9cis, \u00e9coutez, il n'a pas plus les comp\u00e9tences pour faire un autre.\n[98] Apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9diement, le plaignant dit avoir rencontr\u00e9 des responsables d'Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec. Par leur entremise, il r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 se faire accepter, pour septembre 2000, dans un cours d'agent de support technique pour ordinateur au coll\u00e8ge John Abbott, \u00e0 Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue. Emploi-Qu\u00e9bec paie pour le cours.\n[99] Le 12 septembre 2000, le plaignant d\u00e9pose une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. C'est \u00e9galement vers cette p\u00e9riode que le plaignant pr\u00e9sente au R\u00e9gime des rentes du Qu\u00e9bec une demande de prestation d'invalidit\u00e9, rente qu'il recevra du mois d'octobre 2000 jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il retourne sur le march\u00e9 du travail apr\u00e8s avoir termin\u00e9 son cours au coll\u00e8ge John Abbott. Il dit avoir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 cette demande en raison de sa situation financi\u00e8re pr\u00e9caire. Les sommes qu'il recevait pour ses \u00e9tudes \u00e9taient insuffisantes pour qu'il puisse subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins et \u00e0 ceux de sa famille.\n[100] \u00c0 la mi-septembre 2000, il d\u00e9bute son cours au coll\u00e8ge John Abbott. Il r\u00e9ussit avec succ\u00e8s les examens finaux. Il suit par la suite trois mois d'entra\u00eenement. Il se trouve un emploi avec une compagnie du nom de Gexel Telecom, un centre d'appel qui offre le support technique pour les utilisateurs de services haute-vitesse. En f\u00e9vrier 2002, il se trouve un nouvel emploi avec un autre centre d'appel, Sodema T\u00e9l\u00e9-Performance o\u00f9 son travail consiste \u00e0 offrir aux clients le support technique qu'ils ont besoin. Il travaille toujours pour cette entreprise.\nIII. QUESTIONS EN LITIGE Les questions que j'ai \u00e0 trancher peuvent se r\u00e9sumer ainsi :\nLe plaignant a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience, de la part de l'intim\u00e9e, Courrier Purolator Lt\u00e9e? Si le Tribunal r\u00e9pond dans l'affirmative \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question, alors l'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle contrevenu \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne en refusant d'accommoder et de continuer d'employer le plaignant? Si le Tribunal r\u00e9pond dans l'affirmative \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me question, alors quels sont les redressements auxquels a droit le plaignant?\nIV. DISPOSITIONS PERTINENTES DE LA LOI CANADIENNE SUR LES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE Les disposition pertinentes de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne sont les suivantes :\n3. (1) Pour l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\nde refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu; de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi.\n15. (1) Ne constituent pas des actes discriminatoires :\na) les refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de l'employeur qui d\u00e9montre qu'ils d\u00e9coulent d'exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es;\n(2) Les faits pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a (1)a) sont des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es ou un motif justifiable, au sens de l'alin\u00e9a (1)g), s'il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d'une personne ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\nV. ANALYSE ET D\u00c9CISION [101] Depuis les d\u00e9cisions de la Cour supr\u00eame dans les arr\u00eats Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 [appel\u00e9 \u00e9galement Meiorin ] et Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868 [appel\u00e9 \u00e9galement Grismer ], la distinction classique entre la discrimination directe et la discrimination indirecte fait place \u00e0 une m\u00e9thode unifi\u00e9e de traitement des plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne. Selon cette m\u00e9thode, il incombe d'abord \u00e0 la partie plaignante d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e.\n[102] Une fois qu'une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il revient \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la politique ou norme discriminatoire comporte un motif justifiable. Dans cette optique, la partie intim\u00e9e doit prouver :\nqu'elle a adopt\u00e9e la norme \u00e0 une fin ou dans un but qui est rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la fonction ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e; qu'elle a adopt\u00e9 la norme en question en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser le but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail, et sans qu'elle ait eu l'intention de faire preuve de discrimination envers le demandeur; que la norme contest\u00e9e est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre le but poursuivi, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'ex\u00e9cution de la t\u00e2che de mani\u00e8re s\u00fbre et efficace. L'employeur doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il ne peut composer avec le demandeur et les autres personnes touch\u00e9es par la norme sans subir une contrainte excessive.\n[103] Les arr\u00eats Meiorin et Grismer comportent des param\u00e8tres qui permettent de d\u00e9terminer si une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur une contrainte excessive a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. Dans Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame fait observer que l'utilisation du mot excessive laisse supposer qu'une certaine contrainte est acceptable. Pour satisfaire \u00e0 la norme, il faut absolument que la contrainte impos\u00e9e soit excessive . Il peut \u00eatre id\u00e9al, du point de vue de l'employeur de choisir une norme d'une rigidit\u00e9 absolue. Encore est-il que, pour \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e en vertu de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne, cette norme doit tenir compte de facteurs concernant les capacit\u00e9s uniques ainsi que la valeur et la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rentes de chaque personne, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela n'impose aucune contrainte excessive.\n[104] La Cour supr\u00eame fait \u00e9galement remarquer que l'intim\u00e9, afin de prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, a toujours la charge de d\u00e9montrer qu'elle inclut toute possibilit\u00e9 d'accommodement sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte une contrainte excessive. [Voir Grismer, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 32.] Il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir qu'il a examin\u00e9 et raisonnablement rejet\u00e9 toutes les formes viables d'accommodement. L'intim\u00e9 doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il \u00e9tait impossible d'incorporer dans la norme des aspects d'accommodement individuels sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte une contrainte excessive. [Voir Grismer, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, par. 42.]\n[105] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, il ne fait aucun doute que le plaignant souffre d'une d\u00e9ficience physique, la dystrophie myotonique de Steinert et je ne crois pas que j'ai besoin d'\u00e9laborer plus sur cette question. Cette d\u00e9ficience physique \u00e9tait d'ailleurs connue de l'intim\u00e9e depuis l'embauche du plaignant.\n[106] Une fois l'existence de cette d\u00e9ficience \u00e9tablie, il appartient maintenant \u00e0 la Commission et au plaignant d'\u00e9tablir qu'il existe une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Si cette preuve est \u00e9tablie, le fardeau sera alors renvers\u00e9 sur l'intim\u00e9e pour qu'elle justifie sa d\u00e9cision sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e.\n[107] Afin de d\u00e9terminer si une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il est important de revenir sur la preuve entourant la r\u00e9union du 15 d\u00e9cembre 1998. Dans la conclusion du rapport \u00e9crit qu'il a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 suite \u00e0 son \u00e9valuation routi\u00e8re, George Foster \u00e9crit : Bien que ces probl\u00e8mes ont une incidence sur la productivit\u00e9 de la compagnie, la principale raison de ces incidents est que Robert est atteint d'une maladie d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rative appel\u00e9e distrophie myotonique de Steinert. Je crois qu'il y a un s\u00e9rieux probl\u00e8me de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et d'image et que Robert ne peut accomplir les t\u00e2ches de courrier selon les normes \u00e9tablies par la compagnie. [Traduction] (C'est moi qui souligne) Il est clair \u00e0 la lecture de cet extrait que les raisons pour lesquelles Purolator retire le plaignant de son poste est sa d\u00e9ficience. Si cela n'\u00e9tait pas suffisant pour nous convaincre, il suffit de s'en remettre aux notes prises par Marie-Claude Pilon lors de la r\u00e9union du 15 d\u00e9cembre 1999, o\u00f9 elle \u00e9crit que M. Foster aurait dit Je t'ai vu \u00e9chapper une bo\u00eete qui ne faisait m\u00eame pas cinq livres. Que pense le client, que tu es ivre? [Traduction]\n[108] Je suis d'avis que ces seuls \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sont suffisants pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e. J'en conclus donc qu'une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie et qu'il revient maintenant \u00e0 Purolator de justifier sa d\u00e9cision sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e.\n[109] Sur ce point, si nous nous en tenons au t\u00e9moignage de M. Wilson, la norme adopt\u00e9e par Purolator a pour objectif la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re de ses employ\u00e9s, du public et des marchandises. Cette pr\u00e9occupation pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re surviendrait, selon lui, dans le cadre de la Loi concernant les propri\u00e9taires et exploitants de v\u00e9hicules lourds, sanctionn\u00e9e le 20 juin 1998 par le gouvernement qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. \u00c9videmment, il est impossible de fixer un objectif de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re absolue car le conducteur parfait n'existe pas. Comme la Cour supr\u00eame le fait remarquer dans l'arr\u00eat Grismer, la capacit\u00e9 de conduire varie m\u00eame chez les conducteurs dont la vision, l'ou\u00efe et les r\u00e9flexes sont excellents. [Grismer, supra, par. 26.] Nous sommes donc en pr\u00e9sence d'un objectif de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re que je qualifierai de raisonnable . De plus, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la nature des services offerts par Purolator, nous pouvons \u00e9galement identifier une autre norme dont l'objectif est l'efficacit\u00e9 dans l'ex\u00e9cution des t\u00e2ches d'un courrier.\n[110] Ayant d\u00e9termin\u00e9 la nature des objectifs que s'est donn\u00e9e Purolator, il faut ensuite se demander si elle a \u00e9tabli, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que ces objectifs de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re et d'efficacit\u00e9 sont rationnellement li\u00e9s aux fonctions qu'elle exerce. En d'autres mots, il s'agit de savoir si le but vis\u00e9 (s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et efficacit\u00e9) est rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause (la livraison de messagerie). Je suis d'avis qu'un lien rationnel a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9. Il existe indubitablement un lien entre la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re et l'efficacit\u00e9 et la livraison de messagerie par une entreprise priv\u00e9e de messagerie. En effet, l'entreprise qui utilise pour exercer son commerce des v\u00e9hicules doit \u00eatre consciente de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de ses employ\u00e9s, de celle du public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et de la marchandise qu'elle a \u00e0 transporter. \u00c9galement, afin de maintenir sa position sur le march\u00e9, elle doit s'assurer que ses services soient offerts de la mani\u00e8re la plus efficiente possible.\n[111] La troisi\u00e8me question est de savoir si la norme choisie par Purolator est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de l'objectif l\u00e9gitime vis\u00e9. Pour satisfaire \u00e0 cette exigence, elle doit d\u00e9montrer que, pour r\u00e9aliser ses objectifs, elle \u00e9tait incapable de composer avec des personnes comme le plaignant sans que cela lui impose une contrainte excessive.\n[112] La Cour supr\u00eame nous propose dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, une d\u00e9marche afin de tenir compte des diverses mani\u00e8res dont il est possible de composer avec les capacit\u00e9s d'un individu. Outre les \u00e9valuations individuelles visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la personne a les aptitudes ou les comp\u00e9tences requises pour ex\u00e9cuter le travail, il y aurait eu lieu pour l'intim\u00e9e de prendre en consid\u00e9ration la possibilit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuter le travail de diff\u00e9rentes mani\u00e8res tout en r\u00e9alisant l'objet l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'emploi. Cette \u00e9valuation n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par Purolator.\n[113] Sur la question du risque que pr\u00e9sentait le plaignant dans la conduite d'un v\u00e9hicule, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience ne m'appara\u00eet pas concluante. Dans le Formulaire de certification de route que George Foster a rempli lors de l'\u00e9valuation sur route, il n'a not\u00e9 que deux incidents pour lesquels aucun rapport ne fut pr\u00e9par\u00e9.\n[114] Dans sa lettre du 22 d\u00e9cembre 1998, adress\u00e9e au Dr Rousseau, Marie-Claude Pilon mentionne, pour sa part, que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9 depuis 1993 dans 19 accidents de la route, mais elle ajoute imm\u00e9diatement que chacun des accidents de la route est banal, un accrochage en tournant, un autre en reculant....aucun dommages tr\u00e8s dispendieux .\n[115] En 1997, le Dr Rousseau avait examin\u00e9 pour une premi\u00e8re fois le plaignant et elle constate qu'il est \u00e0 risque d'accidents \u00e0 cause de la dystrophie myotonique . Elle sugg\u00e8re qu'il serait probablement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de faire \u00e9valuer ses capacit\u00e9 r\u00e9elles de conducteur par un ergoth\u00e9rapeute. La question de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans la conduite du camion par le plaignant, ne semblait pas \u00e0 ce moment inqui\u00e9ter outre mesure Purolator puisqu'elle n'a pas donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 cette recommandation du Dr Rousseau et n'a pas retir\u00e9 le plaignant de la route.\n[116] Dans son deuxi\u00e8me rapport en 1999, le Dr Rousseau reprend sa recommandation de 1997 et sugg\u00e8re que le plaignant subisse une \u00e9valuation de ses capacit\u00e9s de conduite automobile aupr\u00e8s d'un ergoth\u00e9rapeute qualifi\u00e9. Elle constate ce qu'elle qualifie de nombreux accidents dans lesquels le requ\u00e9rant a \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9e et ajoute que dans l'ensemble, ces accidents d\u00e9montrent des difficult\u00e9s fonctionnelles de la part du requ\u00e9rant. J'ai de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 comprendre sur quels fondements s'appuie la Dr Rousseau pour arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion. Puisqu'elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, je n'ai devant moi aucune preuve qui me permette d'appr\u00e9cier les raisons qui l'ont amen\u00e9e \u00e0 porter ce jugement. Je dois sur ce point \u00eatre d'accord avec l'opinion du t\u00e9moin expert de la Commission et du plaignant, le Dr Noiseux et je conclus que cette conclusion ne d\u00e9coule pas logiquement des pr\u00e9misses du rapport du Dr Rousseau.\n[117] Je trouve \u00e9galement int\u00e9ressante une autre conclusion du rapport du Dr Rousseau o\u00f9 elle affirme que la faiblesse musculaire actuellement \u00e9vidente \u00e0 l'examen objectif, quoique permettant au requ\u00e9rant de se livrer \u00e0 la plupart des activit\u00e9s quotidiennes normales, est suffisante pour le mettre en position de risque excessif \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de l'emploi qu'il occupe. Cette conclusion n'est pas n\u00e9cessairement due, selon son rapport, au fait que le plaignant ait \u00e0 conduire un camion lourd mais plut\u00f4t au fait qu'il ait \u00e0 le faire sur une p\u00e9riode de huit heures de travail par jour ce qui selon elle accentue ind\u00e9niablement le risque d'accidents.\n[118] Constatation int\u00e9ressante \u00e9galement, elle ajoute n'avoir constat\u00e9 aucune d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration \u00e9vidente ou grossi\u00e8re de la force musculaire du plaignant depuis son \u00e9valuation pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Alors pourquoi, Purolator d\u00e9cide-t-elle maintenant de prendre action alors qu'en 1997 devant l'\u00e9tat plus ou moins similaire du plaignant, elle n'avait pas jug\u00e9 la situation suffisamment s\u00e9rieuse pour agir? La seule diff\u00e9rence serait selon M. Wilson l'adoption en 1998, de la loi qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise mais la preuve sur cette question est trop fragmentaire pour en faire une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e dans le pr\u00e9sent cas.\n[119] Il n'y a aucune preuve \u00e9galement d'une tentative de la part de Purolator de chercher \u00e0 voir s'il ne serait pas possible d'accommoder le plaignant dans sa fonction de courrier ou dans une autre fonction sans que cela ne lui pose une contrainte excessive.\n[120] Dans son argumentation l'avocate de Purolator fait mention de la d\u00e9cision Brimacombe c. Norhtland Road Services Ltd, British Columbia Human Rights Council, rendue le 17 juin 1998, pour justifier la requ\u00eate de Purolator de retirer le plaignant de la route dans l'attente de son examen m\u00e9dical. Toutefois dans la d\u00e9cision Brimacombe, une fois la note m\u00e9dicale demand\u00e9e fournie, Norhtland, l'employeur, a accommod\u00e9 la d\u00e9ficience de Brimacombe en l'affectant \u00e0 un autre poste. [Voir par, 84]. Dans le cas qui nous int\u00e9resse, Purolator n'a pas agi ainsi mais a plut\u00f4t cess\u00e9 de verser son salaire au plaignant et lui a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 d'appliquer pour l'assurance-invalidit\u00e9.\n[121] En ce qui concerne les probl\u00e8mes d'efficacit\u00e9 du plaignant, Purolator n'a soumis au tribunal aucune preuve de plaintes de clients par rapport au travail du plaignant. Seule George Foster trouve \u00e0 se plaindre de l' image que projette le plaignant, de sa mani\u00e8re de marcher qui est trop lente, de sa fa\u00e7on de transporter les colis. Ici \u00e9galement aucune tentative d'accommodement, m\u00eame que Monsieur Foster trouve le moyen de critiquer la mani\u00e8re dont le plaignant proc\u00e8de pour transporter des colis du quai d'embarquement au camion et qui lui permet d' accommoder sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[122] A-t-on r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu'il \u00e9tait absolument impossible \u00e0 une personne atteinte de la d\u00e9ficience en cause de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l'objectif souhait\u00e9 de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re raisonnable et \u00e0 celui d'efficacit\u00e9? A-t-on r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que tout accommodement imposait une contrainte excessive? La r\u00e9ponse est \u00e9videmment non. La preuve de Purolator est loin d'\u00eatre suffisante.\n[123] Je conclus donc que, entre le 15 d\u00e9cembre 1998 et 25 janvier 2000, Purolator n'a pu d\u00e9montrer de mani\u00e8re satisfaisante qu'en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience le plaignant ne pouvait r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l'objectif de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re raisonnable et \u00e0 celui d'efficacit\u00e9 sans que cela lui impose une contrainte excessive et qu'elle avait donc l'obligation de chercher \u00e0 accommoder le plaignant dans l'exercice de ses fonctions. Renvoyer le plaignant chez-lui, sans solde \u00e0 partir de la fin janvier et lui sugg\u00e9rer de demander pour l'assurance-invalidit\u00e9 n'est certainement pas une forme d'accommodement acceptable.\n[124] Il faut plus que des efforts n\u00e9gligeables de la part de l'employeur pour satisfaire \u00e0 son obligation d'accommodement. L'accommodement ne se limite pas au seul fait de d\u00e9terminer si le plaignant peut faire son travail actuel. La responsabilit\u00e9 d'amorcer le processus d'accommodement revient \u00e0 l'employeur. [Voir Conte c. Rogers Cablesystems Ltd., D.T. 4\/99, d\u00e9cision rendue le 10 novembre 1999.]\n[125] L'avocate de Purolator a fait \u00e9tat \u00e0 plusieurs reprises dans son argumentation finale de ce qu'elle qualifie de la strat\u00e9gie que le syndicat et le plaignant avaient adopt\u00e9e pendant cette p\u00e9riode et qui consistait \u00e0 revendiquer la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration du plaignant dans son poste de courrier. Je n'accorde que peu d'importance \u00e0 cet argument. Le plaignant devant la situation difficile qu'avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de Purolator de le retirer de son poste n'avait d'autre choix que de chercher \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger ses droits en vertu de la convention collective. Devant cette d\u00e9cision, rien n'emp\u00eachait Purolator d'entamer imm\u00e9diatement le processus d'accommodement du plaignant comme Monsieur Oc\u00e9an et le plaignant l'avaient demand\u00e9 d\u00e8s la r\u00e9union du 15 d\u00e9cembre. Nous nous souviendrons qu'\u00e0 ce moment M. Foster aurait r\u00e9pondu qu'il n'avait rien de disponible pour lui et que Marie-Claude Pilon aurait ajout\u00e9 que le plaignant irait sur l'assurance et apr\u00e8s on verrait.\n[126] Qu'en est-il cependant de la p\u00e9riode s'\u00e9tendant entre janvier 2000 et juin 2000, p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle le plaignant travaillait au centre d'appel de Purolator? Je conviens que l'obligation d'accommodement impose \u00e0 l'employeur de consid\u00e9rer des alternatives incluant le remaniement des fonctions essentielles, le replacement de l'employ\u00e9 dans un autre poste et m\u00eame la cr\u00e9ation d'un poste adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 la condition de l'employ\u00e9. Cette obligation est toujours sujette \u00e9videmment \u00e0 la notion de contrainte excessive .\n[127] La preuve d\u00e9montre qu'\u00e0 partir de d\u00e9cembre 1999, un effort raisonnable a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 entrepris par Purolator pour accommoder le plaignant. Monsieur Wilson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effet qu'il avait fait une \u00e9valuation des diff\u00e9rents postes disponibles aux op\u00e9rations et qu'il en \u00e9tait venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le poste qui serait le plus appropri\u00e9 pour le plaignant, puisqu'il exigeait un effort physique moins important, \u00e9tait le poste de marqueur . Il a de plus indiqu\u00e9 que Purolator \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer un arrangement particulier avec le syndicat afin de trouver un tel poste pour le plaignant. Toutefois, sur l'avis de son repr\u00e9sentant syndical Monsieur Mansell, le plaignant a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rejeter cette possibilit\u00e9.\n[128] Lors de son argument final, l'avocat de la Commission a soulev\u00e9 le fait que Purolator n'avait pas regard\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 d'accommoder le plaignant dans un autre poste tel que les postes de trieurs ou encore de concierge. Je consid\u00e8re que la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par M. Wilson d\u00e9montre que Purolator a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 ces autres possibilit\u00e9s mais qu'elle les a rejet\u00e9es car elle \u00e9tait d'avis qu'il exigerait un effort physique trop important pour le plaignant. Les autres possibilit\u00e9s se trouvaient dans les services cl\u00e9ricaux et notamment dans les services \u00e0 la client\u00e8le. Finalement, le plaignant a accept\u00e9 un poste au centre d'appel.\n[129] L'avocat de la Commission nous invite cependant \u00e0 tenir compte des conditions dans lesquelles le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans ce nouveau poste, notamment le fait qu'il \u00e9tait soumis \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode de probation de six mois. Je tiens \u00e0 rappeler que le devoir d'accommodement ne requiert pas qu'une partie s'\u00e9carte de mani\u00e8re importante des dispositions de la convention collective. [Brimacombe - par. 75] Dans le contexte, pr\u00e9sent le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 des conditions dans lesquelles se pr\u00e9sentait ce nouveau poste et il les a accept\u00e9es.\n[130] Le droit d'accommodement impose-t-il que l'on maintienne le lien d'emploi \u00e0 tout prix? Il faut que l'on approche l'obligation d'accommodement avec un certain bon sens. \u00c0 compter du moment o\u00f9 le plaignant a accept\u00e9 un poste qui respecte enti\u00e8rement ses capacit\u00e9s, il ne requ\u00e9rait plus d'am\u00e9nagement particulier pour satisfaire \u00e0 ses limitations. La preuve ne d\u00e9montre pas que le plaignant avait des limitations \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du poste de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniste. Ses probl\u00e8mes dans ce poste \u00e9taient essentiellement des probl\u00e8mes de performance. \u00c0 partir de ce moment, il devient assujetti aux m\u00eame r\u00e8gles et \u00e9valuation de performance que tous les autres employ\u00e9s.\n[131] Je consid\u00e8re qu'il faut \u00eatre prudent et se garder de reconna\u00eetre un droit \u00e0 l'accommodement qui conf\u00e8re le privil\u00e8ge de conserver un lien d'emploi pour un employ\u00e9 handicap\u00e9 pour aussi longtemps qu'il demeure dans l'entreprise. L'obligation d'accommodement doit \u00eatre de permettre \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 handicap\u00e9 de conserver son emploi, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il demeure capable d'en exercer les t\u00e2ches.\n[132] L'id\u00e9e que l'obligation d'accommodement conf\u00e9rerait aux employ\u00e9s comme le plaignant un v\u00e9ritable droit au maintien du lien d'emploi est en contradiction flagrante avec l'existence m\u00eame de la d\u00e9fense d' une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e . De plus, comme le souligne le Professeur Laflamme dans son article L'obligation d'accommodement conf\u00e8re-t-elle aux personnes handicap\u00e9es un droit \u00e0 l'emploi? (2002) 62 Rev. du B. 125, \u00e0 la page 156 elle risque de nuire \u00e0 une v\u00e9ritable et durable int\u00e9gration des personnes handicap\u00e9es sur le march\u00e9 du travail.\n[133] En cons\u00e9quence, je conclus que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience, en ce que Purolator a refus\u00e9 de l'accommoder et de continuer de l'employer contrairement \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne pendant la p\u00e9riode s'\u00e9tendant du 15 d\u00e9cembre 1998 au 25 janvier 2000 et que pour cette violation, il a droit aux redressements suivants.\nVI. REDRESSEMENT [134] Selon l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi, \u00e0 l'issu de l'instruction le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e peut indemniser la victime pour la perte de salaire et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte.\n[135] Dans le cas du plaignant, je consid\u00e8re qu'il a droit \u00e0 \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 pour la perte de salaire qu'il a subie entre le 15 d\u00e9cembre 1998 et le 25 janvier 2000. Selon la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience, le dernier jour de paie du plaignant chez Purolator \u00e9tait le 5 f\u00e9vrier 1999 et son premier jour de travail au centre d'appel \u00e9tait le 25 janvier 2000. Je comprend qu'\u00e0 partir d'octobre 1999, le plaignant avait une restriction sur son permis l'emp\u00eachant de conduire un camion. Toutefois, je conclus que Purolator avait toujours \u00e0 ce moment un devoir d'accommodement \u00e0 son endroit.\n[136] J'ordonne donc que Purolator verse au plaignant les revenus qu'il a perdus en salaire entre le 5 f\u00e9vrier 1999 et le 25 janvier 2000. Ce montant sera calcul\u00e9 selon le taux horaire de salaire pr\u00e9vu par la Convention collective alors en vigueur pour un courrier avec l'anciennet\u00e9 du plaignant. Afin de tenir compte du temps suppl\u00e9mentaire que le plaignant aurait pu faire durant cette p\u00e9riode, j'ordonne que le salaire soit calcul\u00e9 sur une base de 37.5 heures de travail par semaine.\n[137] En vertu des pouvoirs qui me sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par l'alin\u00e9a 53(2) e) de la loi, j'ordonne \u00e9galement que l'intim\u00e9 verse la somme de 5 000 $ pour le pr\u00e9judice morale que sa conduite a caus\u00e9 au plaignant.\n[138] Comme l'a indiqu\u00e9 le plaignant lors de l'audience, il devra \u00e0 partir de cette somme rembourser les revenus qu'il a re\u00e7us du programme d'assurance-emploi pendant cette p\u00e9riode.\n[139] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la r\u00e9clamation pour la perte de salaire future, je consid\u00e8re qu'il n'y pas lieu d'\u00e9mettre d'ordonnance en ce sens.\n[140] J'accepte la r\u00e9clamation pour le montant en p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 que le plaignant a d\u00fb payer le 18 f\u00e9vrier 1999 au terme du contrat de location de sa voiture qu'il a d\u00fb terminer pr\u00e9matur\u00e9ment. J'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de rembourser au plaignant la somme de 24 449.82 $\n[141] Je ne retiens pas, faute de preuve, les r\u00e9clamations du plaignant au terme de l'assurance m\u00e9dicaments, les frais de m\u00e9diateur, le pr\u00eat qu'il aurait pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment fait aupr\u00e8s de son p\u00e8re et les pertes \u00e0 son fonds de pension.\n[142] Selon les pouvoirs qui me sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le par. 53(3) de la Loi, j'ordonne \u00e0 Purolator de payer au plaignant une compensation de 7 500 $ pour la nature inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e de son acte. Je consid\u00e8re que l'attitude de George Foster lors de la r\u00e9union du 15 d\u00e9cembre 1998, justifie \u00e0 elle seule cette ordonnance. Je pourrais \u00e9galement ajouter la lenteur avec laquelle les responsables de Purolator ont proc\u00e9d\u00e9 dans ce dossier, du moins jusqu'\u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 1999 et leur attitude de tout simplement croire qu'il suffisait de renvoyer le plaignant sur l'assurance-invalidit\u00e9 pour rencontrer leurs obligations.\n[143] Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi et \u00e0 la R\u00e8gle 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure provisoires du Tribunal, j'accorde au plaignant les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les montants ci-haut mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s au taux simple sur une base annuelle en utilisant le taux applicable aujourd'hui aux obligations d'\u00e9pargne du Canada. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats commencent \u00e0 courir \u00e0 partir du 12 septembre 2000 date \u00e0 laquelle une plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant \u00e0 la Commission.\n[144] Purolator est responsable de faire le calcul de ces montants dans les meilleurs d\u00e9lais et d'en informer aussit\u00f4t par \u00e9crit le plaignant et la Commission en fournissant les d\u00e9tails de ceux-ci.\n[145] J'ordonne \u00e9galement que Purolator en consultation avec la Commission prenne des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables \u00e0 l'avenir.\n[146] Finalement, j'accepte de maintenir ma comp\u00e9tence en ce qui concerne les incidences fiscales de mon ordonnance relative aux pertes de revenu et concernant la mise en uvre des mesures de redressement que je viens d'ordonner.\nSign\u00e9 par\nMichel Doucet\nFait \u00e0 Ottawa (Ontario)\nLe 7 d\u00e9cembre 2004\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT768\/1803\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nRobert Coulter c.

Grant Sinclair\n[TRADUCTION]\nI. LES FAITS 1\nII. ANALYSE 3\nIII. ORDONNANCE 5\nI. LES FAITS [1] La plaignante, l'Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada (section locale 70396) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) une plainte dat\u00e9e du 6 mars 2000 par laquelle elle all\u00e8gue que l'intim\u00e9e, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Mus\u00e9e canadien des civilisations (le Mus\u00e9e), a contrevenu aux articles 10 et 11 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi) lorsqu'elle a appliqu\u00e9 un plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois sexiste \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation de la plaignante.\n[2] Dans sa demande de divulgation, la plaignante a demand\u00e9 au Mus\u00e9e quelles pond\u00e9rations des facteurs num\u00e9riques et quelle \u00e9chelle de pond\u00e9ration des sous-facteurs \u00e9taient utilis\u00e9es dans le plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois pour calculer les points attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 un poste en particulier et pour d\u00e9terminer la classification du poste. Les points et la classification sont par la suite utilis\u00e9s pour \u00e9tablir le niveau de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration du poste.\n[3] La plaignante a en outre demand\u00e9 que le programme informatique produisant les points et les niveaux de classification \u00e0 partir des donn\u00e9es entr\u00e9es par les employ\u00e9s des Ressources humaines du Mus\u00e9e soit d\u00e9pos\u00e9. Selon ce que je comprends de la demande de la plaignante, le programme informatique est n\u00e9cessaire pour la validation ou la v\u00e9rification des points attribu\u00e9s aux postes et des classifications des postes. Le Mus\u00e9e utilise le programme informatique afin d'\u00e9viter les erreurs humaines qui pourraient r\u00e9sulter du calcul \u00e0 la main des points et des classifications d'emplois.\n[4] Le Mus\u00e9e reconna\u00eet que les notations des facteurs num\u00e9riques et l'\u00e9chelle de pond\u00e9ration des sous-facteurs sont pertinentes \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plainte et qu'elles sont n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la plaignante pour qu'elle puisse \u00e9tayer sa th\u00e8se. Mais, le Mus\u00e9e est s\u00e9rieusement pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le fait que s'il divulgue les pond\u00e9rations des facteurs num\u00e9riques et l'\u00e9chelle de pond\u00e9ration des sous-facteurs, la plaignante pourrait utiliser ces renseignements \u00e0 des fins autres que la plainte, au pr\u00e9judice du Mus\u00e9e.\n[5] Le Mus\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal un avis de requ\u00eate, dat\u00e9 du 18 ao\u00fbt 2004, en vue d'obtenir une ordonnance restreignant le nombre de personnes qui peuvent recevoir ces renseignements et la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle ces renseignements peuvent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s et exigeant que des engagements personnels soient pris \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la divulgation. Le Mus\u00e9e s'oppose en outre au d\u00e9p\u00f4t du programme informatique parce qu'il existe un contrat de licence entre lui et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Watson Wyatt & Company, propri\u00e9taire du programme informatique. Le contrat interdit au Mus\u00e9e de copier le programme ou de le donner \u00e0 un tiers et le fait de le d\u00e9poser pourrait porter atteinte aux obligations contractuelles du Mus\u00e9e. De plus, selon le Mus\u00e9e, les calculs effectu\u00e9s par le programme informatique peuvent \u00eatre effectu\u00e9s par d'autres logiciels qui peuvent \u00eatre facilement obtenus ou \u00eatre effectu\u00e9s \u00e0 la main.\n[6] Les pr\u00e9occupations du Mus\u00e9e sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans l'affidavit de Rh\u00e9al Bouvier, gestionnaire, dotation, programmes et politiques en ressources humaines, au Mus\u00e9e, lequel affidavit a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 lors de l'audition de la requ\u00eate. Selon M. Bouvier, apr\u00e8s que la plainte eut \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission, les parties ont form\u00e9 un comit\u00e9 d'examen du syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation des emplois pour tenter de cr\u00e9er un nouveau plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois.\n[7] \u00c0 ce comit\u00e9 si\u00e9geaient M. Bouvier, Maggie Arbour-Doucet et Denise Corbett, toutes deux membres de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation de la plaignante, Robert Lamoureux, un agent de classification et parit\u00e9 salariale de l'AFPC, quatre repr\u00e9sentants de l'IPFPC et trois membres non syndiqu\u00e9s du Mus\u00e9e.\n[8] \u00c0 ce moment, les fonctions de M. Lamoureux incluaient les questions d'\u00e9valuation des emplois, de classification et de parit\u00e9 salariale \u00e0 la section locale 70396 de la plaignante. Il a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler dans cette section jusqu'en mai 2004, moment auquel Bonnie Carroll, \u00e9galement une agente de classification et parit\u00e9 salariale qui travaillait chez la plaignante et qui avait exerc\u00e9 ces fonctions de 1988 \u00e0 1997, a \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9e de ces fonctions.\n[9] Le comit\u00e9 a tenu une r\u00e9union le 1er novembre 2004. Lors de la r\u00e9union, M. Lamoureux a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Bouvier si le Mus\u00e9e fournirait aux membres du comit\u00e9 les pond\u00e9rations des facteurs num\u00e9riques. M. Bouvier a r\u00e9pondu en demandant que M. Lamoureux lui garantisse que s'ils \u00e9taient divulgu\u00e9s, ces renseignements demeureraient confidentiels. M. Lamoureux ne lui a pas donn\u00e9 cette garantie et il a en outre dit que de tels renseignements seraient probablement divulgu\u00e9s. Selon M. Bouvier, Mme Arbour-Doucet et Mme Corbett ont manifest\u00e9 leur assentiment \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de cette position.\n[10] M. Bouvier a en outre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Lamoureux, lors de conversations subs\u00e9quentes, lui a dit qu'il ne pouvait pas garantir la confidentialit\u00e9 des renseignements s'ils \u00e9taient divulgu\u00e9s et qu'il donnerait ces renseignements \u00e0 tous les membres de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation qui les demanderaient.\n[11] Mme Carroll, dans son affidavit d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au nom de la plaignante, a confirm\u00e9 la position de M. Lamoureux et elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait d'avis que ces renseignements devraient \u00eatre partag\u00e9s avec les employ\u00e9s dont les postes sont \u00e9valu\u00e9s selon le plan afin qu'ils puissent comprendre de quelle fa\u00e7on les points ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis. De plus, Mme Carroll a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ces renseignements devraient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s par la plaignante, en tant qu'agente de n\u00e9gociation certifi\u00e9e, \u00e0 des fins de n\u00e9gociation collective.\nII. ANALYSE [12] Les parties conviennent que la r\u00e8gle de l'engagement implicite s'applique \u00e0 tous les documents ou renseignements divulgu\u00e9s par le Mus\u00e9e. La justification de cette r\u00e8gle est qu'une partie \u00e0 un litige devrait avoir le plein droit \u00e0 une divulgation et \u00e0 un examen des renseignements pertinents, y compris de ceux qui sont confidentiels, comme cela est n\u00e9cessaire pour trancher \u00e9quitablement l'affaire. Cependant, une partie ne peut pas utiliser ce droit \u00e0 la divulgation pour une fin autre que le litige. S'il existe un v\u00e9ritable risque d'une telle utilisation en d\u00e9pit de l'engagement, des restrictions additionnelles peuvent \u00eatre impos\u00e9es quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle les renseignements divulgu\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s. (Voir Zellers Inc. c. Venta Investments Ltd. [1998] O.J. no 2118, (C.J.O.); Reichmann c. Toronto Life Publishing Co. [1990], 44 C.P.C. (2d) 206, aux pages 207 \u00e0 210 (H.C.J.); Alberta (Treasury Branches) c. Leahy [2000] A.J. no 993, aux pages 54 et 55 (B.R.).\n[13] Le Mus\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que la r\u00e8gle de l'engagement implicite n'est pas suffisante pour prot\u00e9ger la confidentialit\u00e9 des renseignements divulgu\u00e9s, renseignements qui selon ce qu'il affirme ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 confidentiels et n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 la plaignante. Le risque d'utilisation de renseignements \u00e0 une autre fin, selon ce que pr\u00e9tend le Mus\u00e9e, se retrouve dans les d\u00e9clarations de M. Lamoureux et de Mme Carroll et dans l'assentiment apparent de Mme Corbett et de Mme Arbour-Doucet.\n[14] Toutefois, ces personnes n'ont pas exprim\u00e9 une intention de manquer \u00e0 un engagement. Plut\u00f4t, elles ont exprim\u00e9 une absence de volont\u00e9 de prendre un engagement \u00e0 ce moment. Cela ne constitue pas une preuve donnant \u00e0 penser qu'elles ne respecteraient pas un engagement si elles en prenaient un.\n[15] Quant \u00e0 la plaignante, sa position est que la r\u00e8gle de l'engagement implicite est suffisante pour prot\u00e9ger la confidentialit\u00e9. Je ne suis pas d'accord avec la plaignante. Une divulgation illimit\u00e9e dans l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation de la plaignante est incompatible avec la confidentialit\u00e9 malgr\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle de l'engagement implicite.\n[16] Pour que la plaignante ait l'enti\u00e8re possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter sa cause, la divulgation n'a qu'\u00e0 \u00eatre partag\u00e9e avec les avocats, le ou les donneurs d'ordre de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation de la plaignante et tous les consultants engag\u00e9s par la plaignante pour obtenir des avis ou des opinions d'experts. La divulgation devrait \u00eatre limit\u00e9e \u00e0 ces personnes seulement. \u00c0 l'exception des avocats, qui sont soumis \u00e0 des obligations et \u00e0 des r\u00e8gles de conduite professionnelles, ces personnes devraient \u00eatre tenues de prendre des engagements \u00e9crits \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la non-divulgation des documents. \u00c0 mon avis, ces mesures devraient r\u00e9pondre tant aux pr\u00e9occupations du Mus\u00e9e qu'aux besoins de la plaignante.\n[17] La Commission est satisfaite des conditions de l'ordonnance sollicit\u00e9e par le Mus\u00e9e, sauf \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des conditions se rapportant au programme informatique.\n[18] La plaignante demande que le programme informatique soit d\u00e9pos\u00e9. La Commission partage l'opinion selon laquelle le programme devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9. Cette opinion pose quelque peu un probl\u00e8me. Bien que le Tribunal puisse ordonner la divulgation par le Mus\u00e9e \u00e0 titre d'intervention visant \u00e0 garantir une audience juste suivant la Loi, une telle ordonnance pourrait nuire au droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Watson Wyatt & Company.

Paul Groarke\n2004 TCDP 39\n2004\/12\/23\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] L'avocat des intim\u00e9s a demand\u00e9 que l'intitul\u00e9 de la cause soit modifi\u00e9 pour se lire comme suit :\nStephanie Reid c. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant le minist\u00e8re de l'Agriculture et de l'Agroalimentaire Canada) et l'Agence canadienne d'inspection des aliments\nEt ce, en remplacement de l'intitul\u00e9 actuel qui se lit comme suit :\nStephanie Reid c. Agriculture et Agroalimentaire Canada et l'Agence canadienne d'inspection des aliments.\n[2] Dans sa lettre de demande de modification, l'avocat d\u00e9clare ce qui suit :\nLa capacit\u00e9 d'ester en justice appartient aux personnes physiques et aux personnes morales. Les seuls organismes qui constituent des personnes morales pouvant ester en justice sont ceux qui se sont vu conf\u00e9rer par la loi une personnalit\u00e9 juridique distincte. Le minist\u00e8re de l'Agriculture et de l'Agroalimentaire ne poss\u00e8de pas une personnalit\u00e9 juridique distincte. Il s'agit tout simplement d'un minist\u00e8re du gouvernement du Canada.\n[3] La question ne se pose pas avec l'Agence canadienne d'inspection des aliments car, en vertu de l'article 3 et de l'article 15 de la Loi sur l'Agence canadienne d'inspection des aliments, L.C. 1997, ch. 6, elle peut ester en justice.\n[4] L'avocat pr\u00e9tend que l'intim\u00e9 comp\u00e9tent est la Couronne, laquelle emploie les personnes qui ont particip\u00e9 aux \u00e9v\u00e8nements qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 la plainte. La Reine ne peut toutefois pas \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme partie \u00e0 l'instance. Selon la Common Law, semble-t-il que c'est le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9, et ce, en tant que repr\u00e9sentant de la Couronne. Rien de tout cela n'est mis en doute dans la demande.\n[5] Il me semble qu'il est dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat commun de l'ensemble des parties ainsi que dans celui du Tribunal de voir \u00e0 ce que les personnes comp\u00e9tentes comparaissent devant le Tribunal. C'est une question de clart\u00e9 et cela est important quant \u00e0 savoir qui a le droit d'\u00eatre entendu en l'esp\u00e8ce. Cela peut, du moins implicitement, d\u00e9terminer qui a le droit de donner des instructions en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[6] L'avocat de la Commission accepte la modification. La plaignante a \u00e9crit une lettre dans laquelle elle accepte la modification sous r\u00e9serve de l'assurance donn\u00e9e par le Tribunal que [Traduction] cela ne porte nullement atteinte \u00e0 [sa] cause et que les deux intim\u00e9es Agriculture et Agroalimentaire Canada et l'Agence canadienne d'inspection des aliments sont toujours parties dans la pr\u00e9sente instance . Je ne suis pas tout \u00e0 fait certain de comprendre la signification de cette d\u00e9claration.\n[7] La plaignante a raison de penser que je ne vois pas quel pr\u00e9judice elle pourrait subir si je permets que la modification soit faite. Si je comprends bien, les questions dont le Tribunal est saisi demeureront les m\u00eames qu'avant la modification. En effet, le pr\u00e9judice se trouve de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la demande \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la plaignante ne sera pas capable de se faire indemniser par Agriculture et Agroalimentaire Canada.\n[8] Je suis n\u00e9anmoins oblig\u00e9 de d\u00e9clarer que ce n'est pas l'affaire du Tribunal de donner des garanties \u00e0 la plaignante. La Dre Reid est enti\u00e8rement responsable des d\u00e9cisions qu'elle prend concernant sa cause. Elle ne peut pas se soustraire \u00e0 cette responsabilit\u00e9 en imposant des conditions quant \u00e0 son consentement. Elle ne peut pas non plus transf\u00e9rer cette responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 quelqu'un d'autre, qu'il s'agisse du Tribunal, de ses fonctionnaires ou des autres parties \u00e0 l'instance.\n[9] La demande de modification n'est pas contest\u00e9e. La Dre Reid a eu pleinement la possibilit\u00e9 d'obtenir un avis juridique et de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande. Dans les circonstances, je suis dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 accueillir la demande, avec ou sans le consentement de la plaignante. L'intitul\u00e9 de la cause sera par cons\u00e9quent modifi\u00e9 pour se lire comme suit :\nStephanie Reid c. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant le minist\u00e8re de l'Agriculture et de l'agroalimentaire Canada) et l'Agence canadienne d'inspection des aliments\n[10] Je dois ajouter que la Dre Reid semble irrit\u00e9e du fait que la question fut soulev\u00e9e durant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique. Plut\u00f4t que d'aller dans les d\u00e9tails de l'affaire, je lui rappellerai tout simplement que le Tribunal est responsable de la gestion de l'instruction. Il s'agit d'un aspect essentiel de la proc\u00e9dure. C'est l'arbitre et non pas les parties qui contr\u00f4le le processus. Les parties ont le droit de traiter toute question qui les concerne. Toutefois, c'est le Tribunal qui, en bout de ligne, d\u00e9cide quelles affaires doivent \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es lors d'une conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire. Toutes les parties sont tenues de respecter les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nM.

INTRODUCTION\n[1] Le plaignant, Michel Beauregard ( Beauregard ) all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience en ce que l'intim\u00e9e, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes ( la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ), aurait refus\u00e9 de l'accommoder et de continuer de l'employer contrairement \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, chap. H-6 ( la Loi ).\nII. LES FAITS A. Les relations entre le plaignant et l'intim\u00e9e [2] Beauregard a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour l'intim\u00e9e en 1993. Il a occup\u00e9, durant son emploi, diff\u00e9rents postes dont ceux de chauffeur, de facteur et de commis. Le 31 ao\u00fbt 1997, il applique pour un poste \u00e0 la section m\u00e9canis\u00e9e de l'\u00e9tablissement de traitement de lettres (ETL) de St-Laurent1. Il obtient ce poste et est affect\u00e9 au quart de travail du soir avec un horaire de 15 h 30 \u00e0 23 h 30.\n[3] Le 7 septembre 1997, il obtient une affectation temporaire dans l'\u00e9quipe de rel\u00e8ve de jour \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement de traitement en vrac (ETV) dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement. Son affectation devait durer jusqu'au retour de l'employ\u00e9 affect\u00e9 ordinairement \u00e0 ce poste ou au plus tard, jusqu'au 5 septembre 1998. \u00c0 ce poste, il travaille sur le quart de jour avec un horaire de travail de 7 h 30 \u00e0 15 h 30.\n[4] Le 2 juillet 1998, il est pr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9quipe de rel\u00e8ve de la direction des op\u00e9rations de vente aux d\u00e9tails. La lettre qui confirme son pr\u00eat \u00e0 cette direction indique vous \u00eates consid\u00e9r\u00e9 pr\u00eat\u00e9 et demeurez titulaire de votre poste . Beauregard affirme avoir compris qu'il demeurait titulaire de son poste sur l'\u00e9quipe de rel\u00e8ve de jour, ce qui est pour le moins surprenant puisque cette affectation \u00e9tait temporaire et devait se terminer, au plus tard, le 5 septembre 1998.\n[5] Le 14 septembre 1998, son employeur lui demande de retourner \u00e0 son ancien poste \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement de St-Laurent. Beauregard affirme qu'\u00e0 son retour, il n'a pas r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 son poste dans la section des colis (ETV) mais qu'il s'est plut\u00f4t retrouv\u00e9 dans la section des lettres (ETL).\n[6] Il dit s'\u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au travail le matin du 14 septembre 1998, \u00e0 la section ETV, \u00e0 7 h 30, et que les superviseurs lui ont indiqu\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas d'affaire dans cette section mais que puisqu'il \u00e9tait l\u00e0 qu'il allait le garder pour la journ\u00e9e mais que le lendemain il devait retourner dans son poste \u00e0 l'ETL, sur le quart de soir.\n[7] Le lendemain, le 15 septembre, il s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 son travail, \u00e0 l'ETL, \u00e0 15 h 30 mais affirme avoir peu apr\u00e8s quitt\u00e9 le travail. Il t\u00e9moigne qu'au d\u00e9but de son quart de travail le 15 septembre, R\u00e9al Caron, le surintendant du quart du soir, serait venu le voir et lui aurait dit Tu n'es pas ici pour venir faire le trouble, tu es ici pour venir travailler et j'esp\u00e8re que tu vas travailler pour que mes chiffres soient bons.\n[8] R\u00e9al Caron t\u00e9moignera qu'il ne connaissait pas le plaignant et qu'il n'avait jamais eu \u00e0 travailler avec lui avant. Il affirme n'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de son dossier que le 1er octobre 1998, lorsque Beauregard a laiss\u00e9 un message sur le r\u00e9pondeur indiquant qu'il ne rentrerait pas au travail en raison de maladie.\n[9] Beauregard d\u00e9crit ses conditions de travail \u00e0 l'ETL comme suit: Ils nous surveillaient constamment. Il y avait des petits commentaires quand ils passaient dans ma section qu'ils me disaient. Il y avait une atmosph\u00e8re, c'\u00e9tait tr\u00e8s froid, il n'y a pas de fen\u00eatres, il y a du bruit, il y a de la poussi\u00e8re, beaucoup de chaleur proche des machines o\u00f9 est-ce que les lettres sont trait\u00e9es. Il y avait beaucoup de probl\u00e8mes puis je ne me sentais vraiment pas bien \u00e0 partir... le 14, le retour a \u00e9t\u00e9 p\u00e9nible, mais le 15 a fait d\u00e9border qu'est-ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 le 14 aussi. Il ajoute qu'il rentrait dans le plan \u00e0 reculons et qu'il ne se sentait bien que le soir lorsqu'il en sortait : Quand je sortais le soir apr\u00e8s le travail du plan, c'\u00e9tait tr\u00e8s relaxant de sortir du plan comme tel. Un peu plus loin il ajoute : Bien, c'\u00e9tait un soulagement. On avait un terme entre employ\u00e9 qui se disait, c'est qu'\u00e0 l'interne, c'est pratiquement une prison, mais pas de barreau. Alors, tout le monde employait ces m\u00eames termes-l\u00e0 et je pense m\u00eame qu'un docteur a dit en dedans et en dehors. C'est un terme aussi, la m\u00eame chose, qui veut d\u00e9crire la diff\u00e9rence de mentalit\u00e9 de travail entre le secteur des plans et le secteur des succursales postales. Alors, en dedans veut dire les plans et le dehors veut dire les succursales postales. Et on avait le terme employ\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait une prison pas de barreau, c'\u00e9tait le terme employ\u00e9 par tout le monde. En contre-interrogatoire, il pr\u00e9cise : J'aurais pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 rester dans les succursales, bien \u00e9videmment. Alors, c'est un choix de carri\u00e8re de travailler soit dans les succursales ou dans le plan. Dans les plans, il y en a du personnel qui adore \u00e7a. Moi, j'\u00e9tais peut-\u00eatre plus une personne faite pour l'ext\u00e9rieur.\n[10] Apr\u00e8s avoir quitt\u00e9 son travail le 15 septembre 1998, Beauregard n'y est pas retourn\u00e9 avant le 7 octobre 1998.\n[11] Selon R\u00e9al Caron, rien de particulier ne fut port\u00e9 \u00e0 son attention concernant le plaignant entre le 15 septembre et le 1er octobre 1998. Le 5 octobre 1998, le plaignant indiquant toujours qu'il est malade, sa superviseure, Ren\u00e9e D'Amours, a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 le rejoindre, mais sans succ\u00e8s.\n[12] Le 6 octobre 1998, le plaignant consulte un m\u00e9decin, le docteur Allen Payne, en raison d'un probl\u00e8me de sinus mais \u00e9galement, selon lui, en raison d'un manque de sommeil, d'app\u00e9tit et en raison de stress.\n[13] Le 7 octobre 1998 il se pr\u00e9sente au travail. Durant une partie de cette journ\u00e9e, il est en formation \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du secteur m\u00e9canis\u00e9. Vers 19 h 00, apr\u00e8s avoir termin\u00e9 sa formation, il remet un certificat m\u00e9dical \u00e0 sa superviseure. Dans les dix minutes qui suivent, Caron affirme que D'Amours l'a contact\u00e9. Caron est alors descendu sur le plancher pour rencontrer Beauregard puisque le document qu'il avait remis \u00e0 D'Amours est un document d'accident de travail et que certains formulaires doivent dans ces cas \u00eatre remplis. Le document est en fait un document officiel de la Commission de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du travail du Qu\u00e9bec (la CSST ). Il a pour objet d'ouvrir un dossier de r\u00e9clamation aupr\u00e8s de la CSST.\n[14] Selon Caron, l'employeur doit remplir un rapport d\u00e9taillant l'accident de travail. Il dit s'\u00eatre rendu sur le plancher accompagn\u00e9 de D'Amours pour cette fin et avoir contact\u00e9 le syndicat pour les informer de la situation. Richard Gagnon, un d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical, s'est donc rendu sur les lieux. Beauregard ne s'est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9. Caron, D'Amours et Gagnon furent inform\u00e9s que Beauregard \u00e9tait retourn\u00e9 chez-lui et qu'il venait d'appeler malade.\n[15] Le 13 octobre 1998, R\u00e9al Caron fait parvenir une lettre, par poste prioritaire avec signature2, \u00e0 Beauregard dans laquelle il lui demande de communiquer avec lui pour lui fournir plus d'information concernant son attestation m\u00e9dicale dat\u00e9e du 7 octobre 1998.\n[16] Beauregard dit n'avoir re\u00e7u cette lettre que le 28 octobre 1998. La lettre lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e par poste prioritaire avec signature et puisqu'il n'y avait personne \u00e0 son domicile lorsque le facteur a tent\u00e9 de la livrer, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9e au d\u00e9p\u00f4t postal. Beauregard ajoute qu'il avait alors 15 jours pour aller la r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer.3\n[17] Le 14 et 15 octobre 1998, Caron dit avoir fait des tentatives pour communiquer par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone avec Beauregard. Le 14, il n'y avait aucune r\u00e9ponse. Le 15, il dit avoir parl\u00e9 avec quelqu'un qu'il pr\u00e9sume \u00eatre le p\u00e8re de Beauregard et avoir laiss\u00e9 un message pour que celui-ci prenne contact avec lui. Le 16 octobre, Beauregard a contact\u00e9 l'administration et a inform\u00e9 la r\u00e9ceptionniste que l'employeur ne devait plus t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 son domicile. 4\n[18] Le 19 octobre 1998, Caron fait parvenir une nouvelle lettre, poste prioritaire sans signature, \u00e0 Beauregard. Dans cette lettre, Caron fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 nouveau \u00e0 l'attestation m\u00e9dicale du 6 octobre 1998 et \u00e0 une attestation m\u00e9dicale du 13 octobre 1998. Caron indique que Beauregard doit se conformer aux proc\u00e9dures en ce qui regarde les accidents de travail et pr\u00e9cise qu'il lui donne 48 heures, d\u00e8s la r\u00e9ception de la lettre, pour communiquer avec lui, sinon des mesures disciplinaires seraient alors envisag\u00e9es.\n[19] Le plaignant affirme avoir re\u00e7u cette lettre le 4 novembre 1998, soit exactement 15 jours apr\u00e8s son envoi.\n[20] Dans une troisi\u00e8me lettre dat\u00e9e du 23 octobre, envoy\u00e9e par poste prioritaire avec signature, que Beauregard d\u00e9clare avoir re\u00e7ue le 28 octobre 19985, Caron l'avise qu'une suspension d'une journ\u00e9e lui est impos\u00e9e pour ne pas avoir ob\u00e9i \u00e0 la requ\u00eate contenue dans la lettre du 19 octobre. Il lui donne un nouveau d\u00e9lai de 48 heures pour communiquer avec lui.\n[21] Le 23 octobre 1998, le service de Sant\u00e9 professionnelle, S\u00e9curit\u00e9 et Environnement de l'ETC, \u00e0 St-Laurent, fait parvenir une lettre, poste prioritaire avec signature, \u00e0 Beauregard lui demandant de se pr\u00e9senter pour une expertise m\u00e9dicale, le 28 octobre, au bureau du docteur Marc Gu\u00e9rin. Un carton aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9 par le facteur dans la bo\u00eete aux lettres le 26 octobre. La lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e au comptoir postal le 10 novembre, soit une journ\u00e9e avant que n'expire le d\u00e9lai de 15 jours.\n[22] Le 28 octobre 1998, l'employeur fait parvenir \u00e0 Beauregard une quatri\u00e8me lettre mais cette fois par poste prioritaire sans signature. Celle-ci est donc laiss\u00e9e dans la bo\u00eete aux lettres et Beauregard dit l'avoir re\u00e7ue le 29 octobre 1998. Dans cette lettre, Caron indique que puisqu'il ne s'est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au rendez-vous avec le docteur Gu\u00e9rin, l'employeur lui impose deux jours de suspension. Un autre rendez-vous pour l'expertise m\u00e9dicale est fix\u00e9 pour le 6 novembre 1998.\n[23] Le 3 novembre 1998, Beauregard se pr\u00e9sente chez l'employeur pour remplir le document de la CSST intitul\u00e9 Avis de l'employeur et demande de remboursement .\n[24] Entre temps, il a \u00e9galement re\u00e7u une autre lettre le 29 octobre, par poste prioritaire sans signature. Il dit avoir re\u00e7u cette lettre le 30 octobre. Cette lettre l'avise d'une suspension de 3 jours, soit du 6 au 10 novembre. Ainsi, lorsqu'il s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'employeur le 3 novembre, il savait qu'il \u00e9tait suspendu pour trois jours. Il est donc surprenant qu'il affirme par la suite avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tonn\u00e9 de recevoir une lettre le 4 novembre indiquant qu'il \u00e9tait suspendu.\n[25] Cette lettre du 4 novembre n'est toutefois qu'un amendement de la lettre du 29 octobre; elle ne fait que changer les dates de la suspension du 6 au 10 novembre, au 9 au 12 novembre, parce que, selon l'employeur, le 6 novembre Beauregard devait se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical chez le docteur Gu\u00e9rin.\n[26] Lors de la rencontre du 3 novembre 1998, Caron indique qu'il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Beauregard dans quelles circonstances s'est produit l'accident et qu'il lui a r\u00e9pondu c'est marqu\u00e9 sur la feuille . Par la suite, il lui a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 quel endroit s'est produit l'accident et il a r\u00e9pondu dans l'ETL . Caron lui a demand\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et il lui a r\u00e9pondu j'ai pas \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 vos questions, c'est marqu\u00e9 sur la feuille .\n[27] Beauregard r\u00e9agit ainsi aux commentaires de Caron comme j'ai dit tant\u00f4t dans l'autre document, il voulait absolument que je pr\u00e9cise une personne qui \u00e9tait dans mon probl\u00e8me. Il ne voulait pas que je pr\u00e9cise un endroit de travail, mais une personne. Il avait l'air \u00e0 vouloir que je trouve un nom et lui dire ce nom-l\u00e0. Je lui ai dit que je n'avais pas de nom \u00e0 formuler, mais c'\u00e9tait un endroit et un ensemble d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements . Pourtant si nous nous r\u00e9f\u00e9rons aux notes prises par le docteur Payne concernant la consultation m\u00e9dicale du 6 octobre 1998, il indique a not\u00e9 l'apparition des sympt\u00f4mes depuis son d\u00e9placement le 14-09-98 au plan, pas plaisant, son superviseur le stress beaucoup . (C'est moi qui souligne.)\n[28] Le plaignant ajoute qu'il ne peut \u00eatre plus pr\u00e9cis car dans ses mots je n'avais pas d'exemple \u00e0 lui donner . Toutefois, le 9 d\u00e9cembre 1998, dans une lettre \u00e0 France Villeneuve de la CSST, il donne trois pages d'exemples avec des noms et des dates d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements. Dans ce document, il ne relate toutefois aucun \u00e9v\u00e9nement qui se serait produit au plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9 le 14 septembre ou le 15 septembre 1998. Entre le 14 septembre et le 1er octobre, les seuls \u00e9v\u00e9nements qu'il mentionne sont les suivants :\n\u00abLe 24, j'applique comme AP-2, repr\u00e9sentant t\u00e9l\u00e9marketing, on m'avise que j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9.\nLe 28, pour le poste ci-haut mentionn\u00e9, on m'informe que ma candidature n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue car je ne poss\u00e8de pas les exigences requises (bilingue imp\u00e9ratif BBBB), c'est faux je parle anglais couramment. \u00bb\n[29] Le 6 novembre 1998, Beauregard rencontre le docteur Gu\u00e9rin. Nous reviendrons sur cette rencontre un peu plus loin.\n[30] Le 12 novembre 1998, une nouvelle lettre de R\u00e9al Caron, lui impose une nouvelle suspension de trois jours en raison de son attitude lors de son examen par le docteur Gu\u00e9rin.\n[31] Lors d'une rencontre le 16 novembre, l'employeur informe Beauregard qu'il n'est toujours pas en mesure de savoir ce qu'il veut exactement en termes de red\u00e9ploiement ou quelles sont ses limitations fonctionnelles. Beauregard mentionne qu'il voit son m\u00e9decin le 19 novembre 1998 et qu'il sera alors mieux situ\u00e9 sur sa maladie.\n[32] Le 25 novembre 1998, nouvelle rencontre pour discuter de son red\u00e9ploiement. Caron pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 Beauregard une mutation pour Matane, dans un poste de commis plein temps. Beauregard d\u00e9clare qu'il n'a jamais rempli de demande de mutation pour Matane. Confront\u00e9 aux faits qu'il a pr\u00e9par\u00e9, le 16 mai 1997, une telle demande, il r\u00e9pond que cette demande n'est plus valide puisque selon la convention collective, une demande de mutation n'est bonne que pour une ann\u00e9e.\n[33] Ce refus de Beauregard d'accepter la mutation pour Matane est surprenant \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ses d\u00e9clarations au docteur Payne et au docteur G\u00e9rard Cournoyer, psychiatre. Dans le cas du docteur Payne, lors d'une rencontre le 3 novembre 1998, soit quelques semaines avant l'offre de mutation \u00e0 Matane, il aurait expliqu\u00e9 qu'en raison d'un probl\u00e8me d'anciennet\u00e9, il ne pouvait obtenir le genre de mutation qu'il d\u00e9sirait. Il aurait alors indiqu\u00e9 qu'il voulait aller \u00e0 Baie Comeau, qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat finalement \u00e0 aller n'importe o\u00f9 pour sortir de Montr\u00e9al.\n[34] Au docteur Cournoyer, il mentionne qu'il est libre d'aller o\u00f9 il veut parce qu'il n'a pas de conjoint, ni d'enfants. Dans les mots du docteur Cournoyer dans son rapport il s'est mis en frais de remplir, en l'espace d'environ deux semaines quelques 240 demandes de mutation, assurant son employeur que v\u00e9ritablement il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 aller travailler n'importe o\u00f9 au Qu\u00e9bec, afin de ne plus \u00eatre en-dedans , terme consacr\u00e9 dans le jargon des employ\u00e9s de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, pour parler du plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9 o\u00f9 le milieu de travail est, aux yeux de plusieurs, beaucoup plus p\u00e9nible qu'en dehors . Alors pourquoi, si tel est le cas, a-t-il refus\u00e9 l'offre de mutation \u00e0 Matane? Pourquoi ne pas avoir fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 cette offre lors de sa visite au docteur Cournoyer? \u00c0 l'audience, il affirmera qu'il y avait, \u00e0 ce moment, des changements dans sa vie affective et que c'est pour cela qu'il ne voulait pas aller \u00e0 Matane. Mais, pourquoi ne pas avoir parl\u00e9 de ces changements au docteur Cournoyer et avoir laiss\u00e9 celui-ci sous l'impression qu'il \u00e9tait libre d'aller n'importe o\u00f9?\n[35] Il affirme ne pas se souvenir des demandes de mutation parce que celles-ci ne sont bonnes que pour une ann\u00e9e et qu'apr\u00e8s il les jette. Il dit ne pouvoir dire si le chiffre de 240 est exact ou si c'est lui ou le docteur Cournoyer qui a propos\u00e9 ce chiffre. Personnellement, je ne vois pas pourquoi et dans quel int\u00e9r\u00eat le docteur Cournoyer aurait parl\u00e9 de 240 demandes de mutation si le plaignant n'avait pas soulev\u00e9 ce chiffre.6\n[36] Concernant les demandes de mutation, il ajoutera:\nQ. Maintenant, je vois qu'il y a plein d'endroits, c'est marqu\u00e9 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Sept-\u00celes, Mont-Joli, Alma et on passe la pile au complet. Il y en a en Ontario.\nR. Il y en a en Ontario, oui.\nQ. Et il y en a une \u00e0 Matane dans le haut de la pile. Apr\u00e8s \u00e7a, je vois Roberval, tout \u00e7a.\nR. Oui.\nQ. \u00c7a, c'est les endroits o\u00f9 vous \u00e9tiez pr\u00eat \u00e0 aller. C'est \u00e7a?\nR. Au moment que j'ai sign\u00e9 cette demande de mutation-l\u00e0, oui, selon les conditions que j'avais en 1997, mais au niveau syndical, quand on fait une demande de mutation, il n'y a rien qui nous oblige de l'accepter ou pas parce qu'il y a des fois des choses dans la vie qui peuvent changer d'une journ\u00e9e \u00e0 l'autre.\nQ. Je comprends.\nR. Alors, il n'y a rien qui nous oblige \u00e0 l'accepter ou pas. Mais c'est une demande pour garder notre nom sur la liste. Alors, on s'inscrit sur la liste de, exemple, Matane et au moment que quelqu'un nous offre l'emploi ... \u00e7a, c'est bon pour un an. Alors, un an \u00e0 partir du 16 mai 1997. Mais ce n'est pas une obligation en rien. C'est juste pour se garder un choix advenant qu'on ait besoin de ce choix-l\u00e0.\n[...]\nQ. Mais disons, monsieur Beauregard, que si vous faites des demandes comme \u00e7a \u00e0 Matane, \u00e0 Sept-\u00celes, Roberval, Guelph puis que dans le fond, vous n'\u00eates pas int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 aller \u00e0 aucune de ces places-l\u00e0, on pourrait dire que ces demandes-l\u00e0 seraient faites de mauvaise foi?\nR. On ne peut pas dire qu'elles sont faites de mauvaise foi parce qu'on les remplit et on attend de savoir qu'est-ce qu'il y a de disponible \u00e0 cet endroit-l\u00e0, si \u00e7a fait notre affaire ou pas. Alors, c'est pour un choix d'am\u00e9liorer notre sort. Alors, si on regarde la route qui nous est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 et cette route-l\u00e0 ne fait pas notre affaire, on a le droit de le refuser.\nQ. Mais par exemple, monsieur Beauregard, \u00e7a, je comprends pour un facteur de Montr\u00e9al qui fait une demande pour une route de facteur \u00e0 Matane, il peut regarder quelle route qui ferait son affaire \u00e0 Matane, mais pour un employ\u00e9 qui est dans les plans m\u00e9canis\u00e9s \u00e0 St-Laurent puis qui ne veut rien savoir puis qui n'aime pas \u00eatre dans les plans m\u00e9canis\u00e9s \u00e0 St-Laurent, une route de facteur \u00e0 Matane, est-ce qu'on la choisit en fonction des nombres d'\u00e9tages ou des nombres d'escaliers?\nR. Oui. On la choisit en nombres d'\u00e9tages justement et nombres d'escaliers et chaque pas est compt\u00e9. Alors, si c'est une route, par exemple, qui a, comme j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait \u00e0 Youville, 230 escaliers dans la journ\u00e9e, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, on va y penser.\nQ. Vous aimez mieux rester dans le plan.\nR. Et aussi le nombre de portes. Alors, le nombre de portes est tr\u00e8s variable selon les routes et aussi la quantit\u00e9 de tri \u00e0 faire le matin. Alors, si c'est une route qui a beaucoup de tri ou pas beaucoup de tri, c'est toutes ces choses-l\u00e0 qu'il faut analyser au moment que l'employeur nous offre une position.\n[37] Le 20 novembre 1998, suite \u00e0 des rencontres avec la psychologue L\u00e9oline Daigle7, le 2 novembre, avec le docteur Luc Morin, le 18 novembre, et avec le docteur Payne, le 19 novembre, il fait parvenir une lettre \u00e0 R\u00e9al Caron dans laquelle il demande un red\u00e9ploiement en vertu de l'article 54.02b) de la convention collective.8 Cet article pr\u00e9voit que lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 est atteint d'une incapacit\u00e9 physique en raison de probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 et que le besoin d'une affectation s'appuie sur un certificat d\u00e9livr\u00e9 par un m\u00e9decin qualifi\u00e9, l'employ\u00e9 peut, sur demande \u00e9crite, \u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 n'importe quel poste vacant appropri\u00e9 de son groupe. D'apr\u00e8s Beauregard, les r\u00e9sultats du docteur Payne montrent qu'il ne peut r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses fonctions dans l'un ou l'autres des plans m\u00e9canis\u00e9s. Je n'ai pas l'intention de traiter dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision de la question du red\u00e9ploiement en vertu de l'article 54 de la convention collective puisque cette question a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e par l'arbitre du grief9.\n[38] Le 1er d\u00e9cembre 1998, Georges Dolan, gestionnaire au quart du soir, remet \u00e0 Beauregard une copie du rapport d'expertise m\u00e9dicale du docteur Gu\u00e9rin. Dolan lui demande \u00e9galement si les docteurs Payne et Gu\u00e9rin peuvent se rencontrer pour \u00e9changer sur son cas. Beauregard a, dans un premier temps, r\u00e9pondu oui \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate. Toutefois, lorsque Dolan lui pr\u00e9sente les autorisations pour sa signature, il demande de pouvoir rencontrer ses repr\u00e9sentants syndicaux avant de signer les documents.\n[39] Il affirme avoir discut\u00e9 de la question avec son syndicat et que celui-ci lui a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de ne pas signer ces autorisations. Il a donc refus\u00e9 de le faire.\n[40] Le 3 d\u00e9cembre 1998, il informe Georges Dolan, par lettre, qu'il a revu le docteur Payne depuis la rencontre du 1er d\u00e9cembre et que celui-ci lui a confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau qu'il pouvait reprendre le travail en dehors des deux plans m\u00e9canis\u00e9s sans restrictions. Cette lettre est contre-sign\u00e9e par le docteur Payne.\n[41] Le 9 d\u00e9cembre 1998, Caron r\u00e9pond \u00e0 la lettre du 3 d\u00e9cembre et indique que rien dans celle-ci ne montre que Beauregard ne peut effectuer le travail dans le poste qu'il occupe. Il lui ordonne donc de se pr\u00e9senter, le 14 d\u00e9cembre 1998, \u00e0 son poste sur son quart de travail sans quoi des mesures disciplinaires n'excluant pas le cong\u00e9diement seront envisag\u00e9es . Beauregard r\u00e9plique que cette demande est contraire \u00e0 la recommandation du docteur Payne et que de plus la CSST n'a pas [encore] rendu sa d\u00e9cision .10\n[42] Le 16 d\u00e9cembre 1998, Caron avise Beauregard que son emploi avec l'intim\u00e9e est termin\u00e9 \u00e0 compter du 17 d\u00e9cembre 1998.11\nB. Les visites au docteur Allen Payne [43] Le docteur Allen Payne est un m\u00e9decin g\u00e9n\u00e9raliste. Il pratique la m\u00e9decine g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et, selon ses propres mots, il fait \u00e9galement de la m\u00e9decine CSST depuis 1995. Lorsqu'un patient vient le voir suite \u00e0 un accident de travail, il devient le m\u00e9decin traitant aux fins de la CSST. Il assure tout le suivi m\u00e9dical. Il n'a aucune sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re en psychologie ou en psychiatrie.\n[44] En 1998, le docteur Payne travaille \u00e0 la fois dans sa clinique de m\u00e9decine g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et \u00e0 la Polyclinique M\u00e9dicale Populaire sur la rue Sainte-Catherine, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Les gens peuvent se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 la Polyclinique sans rendez-vous. La Polyclinique est surtout fr\u00e9quent\u00e9e par des travailleurs. Le docteur Payne indique que la Polyclinique traite une quantit\u00e9 industrielle de dossiers de la CSST.\n[45] Le docteur Payne dit avoir vu Beauregard le 6 octobre 1998. Celui-ci dit s'\u00eatre rendu \u00e0 cette clinique parce qu'il devait aller cette journ\u00e9e-l\u00e0 conduire quelqu'un au m\u00e9tro Papineau pr\u00e8s de la clinique et que c'\u00e9tait une clinique recommand\u00e9e par le syndicat. Il affirme qu'il se sentait en confiance d'y aller.\n[46] Il admettra, en contre-interrogatoire, qu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 consult\u00e9 le docteur Payne. En effet, le docteur Payne reconna\u00eet avoir vu le plaignant en 1997 pour un autre probl\u00e8me. Toutefois, sur les deux rapports m\u00e9dicaux remplis sur des formulaires de la CSST lors de visites en 1997, on peut lire dans la section intitul\u00e9e Diagnostic et \u00e9volution de la pathologie et des traitements l'expression \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif situationnel . Interrog\u00e9 sur ces visites, le plaignant affirme ne pas se souvenir de ces documents parce que les copies, affirme-t-il, ne sont pas lisibles. Ses r\u00e9ponses sur les \u00e9v\u00e9nements entourant les visites qu'il a fait au docteur Payne en 1997 sont vagues et peu convaincantes. Il est \u00e9galement surprenant que dans son t\u00e9moignage le docteur Payne n'a pas fait de lien entre les rapports m\u00e9dicaux de 1997 et ceux de 1998 puisqu'il \u00e9tait dans les deux cas le m\u00e9decin traitant.\n[47] Quoiqu'il en soit, le plaignant se pr\u00e9sente donc le 6 octobre 1998, \u00e0 la Polyclinique avec ce que le docteur Payne qualifie d' un tableau de congestion sinusal, \u00e9veil nocturne, absence de r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration, baisse d'app\u00e9tit, aplatissement du moral, voudrait se coucher apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 debout que 2 heures; a not\u00e9 l'apparition des sympt\u00f4mes depuis son d\u00e9placement le 14-09-98 au plan pas plaisant, son superviseur le stress beaucoup probl\u00e8me d' inside , cours et contenu de sa pens\u00e9e au ralenti, essaiera un retour au travail au mois de d\u00e9cembre, pr\u00e9sence de c\u00e9phal\u00e9e quotidienne, n'aime pas trop les m\u00e9dicaments, rendez-vous Dr Morin psychiatre le 18-11-98 . (C'est moi qui souligne.)\n[48] Lorsqu'en contre-interrogatoire l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e demande \u00e0 Beauregard \u00e0 quel superviseur il fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence; il d\u00e9clare ne pas s'en souvenir. D'ailleurs, il ajoute avoir parl\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral , que ce n'\u00e9tait pas un superviseur en particulier qui le stressait mais le lieu de travail. Toutefois, selon les notes du docteur Payne c'est un superviseur qui le stress beaucoup .\n[49] Le docteur Payne d\u00e9clare avoir pass\u00e9 de 10 \u00e0 15 minutes avec Beauregard lors de sa visite du 6 octobre. Beauregard dit avoir expliqu\u00e9 toute sa situation au docteur Payne lors de cette rencontre. Cependant, il affirme avoir omis d'informer le docteur Payne qu'il est en arr\u00eat de travail pour maladie depuis le 1er octobre. Le docteur Payne admet que la consultation fut rapide parce qu'il y a d'autre monde qui attendent .\n[50] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le docteur Jacques Gagnon, un t\u00e9moin qualifi\u00e9 d'expert en psychiatrie, indique que pour faire un bon examen psychiatrique, il faut entre 40 \u00e0 50 minutes. Il est d'avis qu'un examen fait en dix minutes n'est pas complet et que le jugement qui est port\u00e9 n'est s\u00fbrement pas bas\u00e9 sur des donn\u00e9es probantes. Il ajoute que le diagnostic doit s'appuyer sur un minimum de sympt\u00f4mes d'ampleur significative. Un autre psychiatre, le docteur G\u00e9rard Cournoyer, t\u00e9moin de la Commission et de Beauregard, ajoute qu'il ne pense pas qu'on puisse, en l'espace de quelques minutes, faire un examen psychiatrique. Il ajoute qu'un tel examen devrait durer au moins une heure et parfois plus. Il affirme qu'avant, d'\u00e9mettre une opinion, il faut qu'on soit convaincu qu'on a vraiment recueilli toute l'information sur laquelle on va baser son opinion. \u00c0 son avis, la premi\u00e8re visite devrait durer, en moyenne, au moins une heure, une heure et demie parce qu'il faut parcourir toute l'histoire de la personne, son histoire m\u00e9dicale et ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents.\n[51] Le docteur Payne affirme \u00eatre arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 son diagnostic en posant certaines questions \u00e0 Beauregard. Il ajoute que ce qu'il cherche c'est \u00e0 \u00e9valuer les fonctions mentales sup\u00e9rieures du patient, le risque suicidaire et ce qu'il appelle l' inside c'est-\u00e0-dire la capacit\u00e9 d'introspection du patient par rapport \u00e0 sa situation. Il d\u00e9clare vouloir \u00e0 ce moment recueillir des donn\u00e9es sur les circonstances et le contexte qui entoure les sympt\u00f4mes.\n[52] Il dit se souvenir de l'\u00e9tat de Beauregard en regardant ses notes, mais il ajoute qu'il n'y avait pas quelque chose de particulier. Vous comprendrez qu'\u00e0 50, 60, 70 patients par jour, disons...il n'y avait pas n\u00e9cessairement quelque chose de plus particulier avec Beauregard qu'un autre . Il ajoute qu'il est venu le voir d'abord pour un probl\u00e8me de sinus puis qu'il a dit Ah, en passant, docteur, je me sens pas bien, puis et caetera . Il d\u00e9clare pouvoir arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion en regardant ses notes [p]arce que j'ai marqu\u00e9 raison de consultation, congestion puis apr\u00e8s, j'ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 parler. Donc, \u00e7a veut dire que logiquement, il m'a abord\u00e9 sur son probl\u00e8me de sinus puis l\u00e0, a d\u00e9coul\u00e9, en le questionnant un peu plus, qu'il ne se sentait pas bien, qu'il n'avait pas d'app\u00e9tit, et caetera, comme j'ai not\u00e9 dans mes notes . Il ajoute que le probl\u00e8me de sinus n'\u00e9tait pas reli\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat psychologique de Beauregard.\n[53] Le docteur Payne affirme avoir pos\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie de questions compl\u00e8tes tel qu'exig\u00e9 par le r\u00e9gime d'assurance maladie du Qu\u00e9bec (le RAMQ ). Il reconna\u00eet que les consultations effectu\u00e9es par les psychiatres sont biens diff\u00e9rentes. Il dit avoir demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Beauregard comment il se sentait. Beauregard mentionne qu'il s'\u00e9veille la nuit, qu'il a de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer, qu'il a une baisse d'app\u00e9tit, qu'il a un moral qu'il d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant \u00e0 plat, qu'il a de la fatigue, qu'il veut se coucher tout de suite apr\u00e8s deux heures. Il dit qu'il a ces sympt\u00f4mes depuis le 14 septembre 1998.\n[54] Le docteur reconna\u00eet qu'il est important dans le cas d'un patient qui se pr\u00e9sente dans un \u00e9tat de d\u00e9pression de conna\u00eetre son \u00e9tat d'esprit, son psychique ou sa condition mentale. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il note que Beauregard ne pleure pas et qu'il n'a pas mentionn\u00e9 qu'il pleurait \u00e0 l'occasion. Il ajoute que pour en arriver \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer l'\u00e9tat psychique, il regarde si l'information est d\u00e9lirante. Est-ce que le d\u00e9bit verbal est normal ou ralenti ? Le patient a-t-il de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 faire des liens ?\n[55] En dix minutes, avec ce type de question, il affirme avoir suffisamment d'information pour pouvoir porter un diagnostic \u00e0 l'effet que Beauregard semble avoir une d\u00e9pression reli\u00e9e \u00e0 la situation qu'il vit au travail.\n[56] Dans l'attestation m\u00e9dicale12 du 6 octobre 1998, le docteur Payne note comme diagnostic \u00c9tat d\u00e9pressif r\u00e9actionnel . La date de l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement est indiqu\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant le 14 septembre 1998. Celle-ci fut fix\u00e9e par le docteur Payne en se basant sur ce que Beauregard lui a dit : C'est le travailleur qui d\u00e9termine finalement la date d'\u00e9v\u00e9nement . Il ajoute que dans un cas psychologique la date de l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement est bas\u00e9e habituellement sur la m\u00e9moire du travailleur quant \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 les sympt\u00f4mes auraient commenc\u00e9s.\n[57] Sur l'attestation m\u00e9dicale le docteur Payne a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 RT 71098 , pour retour au travail le 7 octobre 1998 . Dans ses notes il indique essaiera un retour au travail au mois de d\u00e9cembre . Il affirme que c'est Beauregard qui a dit cela. Le docteur Payne a, pour sa part, \u00e9crit sur le rapport m\u00e9dical que le retour au travail est pr\u00e9vu pour le lendemain. Il ajoute que puisqu'il ne s'agissait pas d'une d\u00e9pression majeure, mais d'un probl\u00e8me situationnel, il pouvait y avoir des am\u00e9nagements administratifs. Il y avait donc une possibilit\u00e9 d'un retour au travail assez rapide. Dans son interrogatoire, Beauregard d\u00e9clare que c'est lui qui a insist\u00e9 pour retourner au travail le 7 octobre. Il affirme avoir dit au docteur Payne : Bon, j'ai eu quelques jours de r\u00e9pit. Alors, je voudrais r\u00e9essayer le 7 \u00e0 travailler et \u00e0 fonctionner normalement.\n[58] Je n'ai aucune raison de mettre en doute la version du docteur Payne et je retiens que c'est le docteur Payne qui a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 un retour au travail le lendemain et non Beauregard.\n[59] Si nous comparons les diff\u00e9rentes copies de l'attestation m\u00e9dicale \u00e9mise par le docteur Payne le 6 octobre 1998, nous constatons que sur les copies du travailleur et de l'employeur il y a une annotation que nous ne trouvons pas sur celle du m\u00e9decin. Cette annotation ajoute sugg\u00e9rons changer endroit travail . Beauregard dit ne pouvoir expliquer comment cet ajout s'est retrouv\u00e9 sur ces copies et non sur celle du m\u00e9decin. Aucune explication satisfaisante n'a pu \u00e9galement \u00eatre donn\u00e9e par le docteur.\n[60] Le docteur Payne \u00e9met \u00e9galement le 6 octobre 1998 un autre document intitul\u00e9 Rapport m\u00e9dical , encore sur un formulaire de la CSST. Le docteur Payne explique qu'en 1998, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le formulaire d'attestation m\u00e9dicale n'avait pas de case pour indiquer si on r\u00e9f\u00e9rait le patient \u00e0 des sp\u00e9cialistes, alors les m\u00e9decins pr\u00e9paraient un rapport m\u00e9dical qui lui avait une case \u00e0 cet effet. Dans le cas qui nous int\u00e9resse, Beauregard est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 au docteur Luc Morin, un psychiatre.\n[61] Le docteur Morin, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, est psychiatre \u00e0 la Polyclinique. Il a quitt\u00e9 la Polyclinique en d\u00e9cembre 2001. Le docteur Morin ne fut pas appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Il semble, selon le docteur Payne, qu'il est soit d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 ou tr\u00e8s malade.\n[62] Le docteur Payne dit avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer Beauregard au docteur Morin parce qu'il pr\u00e9sentait un probl\u00e8me d'ordre psychiatrique. Il ajoute \u00e9galement que le fait qu'il sugg\u00e8re de changer l'endroit de travail l'a \u00e9galement influenc\u00e9 \u00e0 faire cette r\u00e9f\u00e9rence car [\u00e7a] peut \u00eatre une suggestion qui peut ou non d\u00e9plaire \u00e0 l'employeur ou amener des probl\u00e8mes, amener des contre-expertises et tout \u00e7a. Donc, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, il y a une question aussi de couverture, on pourrait dire, par un sp\u00e9cialiste. C'est une proc\u00e9dure standard de la part des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralistes . (C'est moi qui souligne.)\n[63] Le 13 octobre 1998, nouvelle visite au docteur Payne. Lors de celle-ci le docteur Payne pr\u00e9pare un Rapport m\u00e9dical d'\u00e9volution . Le diagnostic y est toujours le m\u00eame \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif situationnel avec l'ajout cette fois des mots (travail) et (endroit) pour, selon le docteur Payne, donner des pr\u00e9cisions \u00e0 l'effet que la situation est reli\u00e9e au travail. En dessous de ces annotations, il ajoute : rendez-vous, arr\u00eat de travail, le 20 octobre 1998 . Il prolonge donc le cong\u00e9 de maladie jusqu'au 20 octobre. Cette rencontre n'a dur\u00e9e que 5 minutes. Le docteur Payne admet ne pas avoir refait d'examen.\n[64] Dans ses notes, le docteur Payne indique accepte de voir psychologue, r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 madame Daigle, rayon X des sinus 13.\n[65] Lors de cette visite le docteur Payne affirme ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris d'apprendre qu'il n'est pas retourn\u00e9 au travail le 7 octobre 1998. Beauregard lui explique que la gestion de sa situation est complexe et qu'elle n\u00e9cessite plus de temps pour \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9 sur le plan administratif, ce qui n'est pas possible dans 24 heures. Le docteur Payne dit avoir prolong\u00e9 son arr\u00eat de travail parce que le probl\u00e8me n'est pas encore r\u00e9gl\u00e9 au point de vue administratif.\n[66] Le docteur Payne ajoute que le diagnostic de trouble d'adaptation est surtout un probl\u00e8me de gestion administrative pour lequel on ne prescrit pas de m\u00e9dicament. On donne plut\u00f4t le temps \u00e0 la gestion administrative de r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me.\n[67] Le 13 octobre 1998, le docteur Payne constate un \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif qui n'a pas pu \u00eatre g\u00e9r\u00e9 et qui se continue. Cet \u00e9tat se caract\u00e9rise par le fait que Beauregard dit ne pas avoir d'app\u00e9tit, ne pas avoir de moral, manquer d'\u00e9nergie; les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques qu'il avait identifi\u00e9es lors de l'examen du 6 octobre 1998. Toutefois, il admet en contre-interrogatoire que ce n'est pas Beauregard qui lui a d\u00e9crit ces sympt\u00f4mes mais que dans, les cinq minutes qu'a dur\u00e9 la visite, il aurait constat\u00e9 qu' il avait l'air un peu abattu, il avait l'air d'avoir les m\u00eames genres de sympt\u00f4mes .\n[68] Beauregard est toujours, lors de cette rencontre, en attente de voir un psychiatre et le docteur Payne l'invite \u00e9galement \u00e0 prendre rendez-vous avec la psychologue, L\u00e9oline Daigle.\n[69] Beauregard revoit le docteur Payne le 20 octobre 1998. Entre le 13 et le 20 octobre, il dit avoir eu un rendez-vous avec la psychologue Daigle, toutefois aucune preuve de cette rencontre ou de ce qui s'est dit lors de celle-ci n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience. Il affirme qu'il a \u00e9galement, pendant cette p\u00e9riode, pris rendez-vous avec le docteur Morin pour le 18 novembre. Pourtant dans ses notes pour le 20 octobre 1998, le docteur Payne indique va prendre rendez-vous avec le psychiatre Morin . Il semble donc qu'au 20 octobre 1998, il n'y a toujours pas de rendez-vous de fixer avec le docteur Morin.\n[70] Dans le Rapport m\u00e9dical que le docteur Payne a rempli lors de la visite du 20 octobre 1998, le diagnostic est toujours le m\u00eame \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif situationnel ; l'arr\u00eat de travail est prolong\u00e9 jusqu'au 5 novembre 1998.\n[71] Le 3 novembre 1998, nouvel examen par le docteur Payne qui a dur\u00e9 cette fois \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 10 minutes. Selon le docteur Payne, Beauregard a le m\u00eame \u00e9tat psychologique que lors de sa premi\u00e8re visite le 6 octobre 1998. Le docteur dit en \u00eatre arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 cette conclusion en le regardant agir, par le ton qu'il utilise, par la fa\u00e7on qu'il a de raconter les \u00e9v\u00e9nements et par l'abondance de d\u00e9tails qu'il utilise. Il en conclut que Beauregard a un affect perturb\u00e9. Il affirme ne pas \u00eatre en mesure de donner un signe clinique objectif de cet affect perturb\u00e9 car la psychiatrie est, selon lui, rarement objective. Il ajoute, de plus, que Beauregard ne souffre pas d'une d\u00e9pression majeure.\n[72] Il dit \u00eatre beaucoup plus en mesure d'identifier des signes subjectifs d'un affect perturb\u00e9. Entre autres, il note que Beauregard a ce qu'il caract\u00e9rise comme de la circonstancialit\u00e9 . Il ajoute que sa pens\u00e9e n'est pas d\u00e9lirante, mais elle n'est pas focuss\u00e9e non plus. Il n'a aucune obsession. Il utilise une abondance de d\u00e9tails pour d\u00e9crire une situation qui peut \u00eatre r\u00e9sum\u00e9e en quelques mots.\n[73] Le docteur Payne recommande un arr\u00eat de travail en raison d'un \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif r\u00e9actionnel ou situationnel qui selon lui sont la m\u00eame chose. Il ajoute qu'aujourd'hui il qualifierait son diagnostic de trouble d'adaptation . Le docteur Payne n'utilisera jamais cette expression dans ses diagnostiques. Elle appara\u00eet pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans la note du docteur Luc Morin.\n[74] Selon le docteur Payne l' \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif r\u00e9actionnel ou situationnel ou le trouble d'adaptation sont des \u00e9quivalents dont les signes et les sympt\u00f4mes sont subtils et discrets par opposition aux d\u00e9pressions majeures. Il ajoute qu'ils ne se traitent pas par des m\u00e9dicaments.\n[75] Pour sa part, le docteur Gagnon t\u00e9moigne \u00e0 l'effet que le trouble d'adaptation est r\u00e9actionnel \u00e0 un \u00e9v\u00e9nement significatif dans la vie de quelqu'un. Le tout rentre habituellement dans l'ordre assez rapidement d\u00e8s qu'on enl\u00e8ve le facteur de stress. Il ajoute que dans le cas de Beauregard, d\u00e8s qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 de son milieu de travail, il aurait d\u00fb retrouver un fonctionnement normal dans seulement quelques jours et non pas dans six semaines comme l'indique le docteur Payne.\n[76] Le docteur Marc Gu\u00e9rin, autre t\u00e9moin qualifi\u00e9 d'expert en psychiatrie, mentionne que la d\u00e9pression peut prendre plusieurs formes mais qu'elle est essentiellement caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e par un trouble de l'humeur c'est-\u00e0-dire que l'humeur est triste; tristesse qui est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement accompagn\u00e9e d'un niveau plus ou moins important d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. Les sympt\u00f4mes principaux de la d\u00e9pression sont la tristesse et l'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. Ces deux sympt\u00f4mes am\u00e8nent l'apparition de d'autres sympt\u00f4mes comme, par exemple, des difficult\u00e9s de concentration. Quelqu'un qui est trop anxieux a de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 se concentrer. Ce qui entra\u00eene un effritement du contr\u00f4le \u00e9motionnel. Les gens qui sont tristes vont souvent pleurer, ils se contr\u00f4lent moins bien, ils sont plus sensibles. L'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 va amener g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de l'insomnie. Dans les cas de d\u00e9pression, ce qu'on observe le plus souvent, c'est une insomnie qui est initiale ou une insomnie qui est matinale, la personne se r\u00e9veille tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t et n'arrive plus \u00e0 se rendormir. Il constate que la majorit\u00e9 des gens connaissent des p\u00e9riodes durant lesquelles ils se r\u00e9veillent la nuit mais ils arrivent \u00e0 se rendormir. Dans ce cas ce n'est pas pathologique. Ce qui est plus caract\u00e9ristique de la d\u00e9pression, c'est l'insomnie initiale ou terminale. L'insomnie \u00e0 long terme va accro\u00eetre les difficult\u00e9s de concentration parce qu'il y a une fatigue mentale qui s'installe et les gens vont aussi se plaindre d'une fatigue physique. Il y a \u00e9galement des probl\u00e8mes d'app\u00e9tit. Les gens soit perdent l'app\u00e9tit, ce qui est le plus fr\u00e9quent, ou mangent plus, ils deviennent boulimique. Dans les cas plus importants, lorsque \u00e7a devient invalidant, il peut appara\u00eetre des probl\u00e8mes d'agitation ou des retards psychomoteurs. Les gens sont tellement angoiss\u00e9s qu'ils sont agit\u00e9s, ils sont incapables d'arr\u00eater de bouger ou ils sont au ralenti mentalement et physiquement. Nous sommes dans ces cas devant une pathologie qui peut \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 d'importante.\n[77] Le docteur Gu\u00e9rin poursuit en indiquant que le trouble d'adaptation est une forme moins importante de la d\u00e9pression. Dans la classification am\u00e9ricaine, les sympt\u00f4mes du trouble d'adaptation sont essentiellement les m\u00eames que nous venons de d\u00e9crire mais avec une intensit\u00e9 relativement plus faible. Le trouble d'adaptation est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement directement li\u00e9 \u00e0 quelque chose d'identifiable, des pr\u00e9occupations familiales, financi\u00e8res ou des probl\u00e8mes au travail. C'est quelque chose qui est \u00e0 la limite de ce qui est normal.\n[78] Lorsque la pathologie s'entretient d'elle-m\u00eame, on parle alors de trouble d\u00e9pressif soit situationnel ou n\u00e9vrotique c'est-\u00e0-dire que les sympt\u00f4mes ne sont plus proportionnels \u00e0 ce que vit la personne dans le monde ext\u00e9rieur. Les gens se sentent tristes m\u00eame s'il n'y a plus vraiment de raison de se sentir triste. La pathologie est plus importante parce qu'elle n'est pas proportionnelle ou explicable par une r\u00e9action de l'ordre des r\u00e9actions normales ou naturelles des individus. \u00c0 l'extr\u00eame, le docteur Gu\u00e9rin parle des personnes qui sont sur le point de perdre le contact avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Ils sont tellement tristes qu'ils vont commencer \u00e0 s'accuser de tous les maux. Leur situation est pratiquement d\u00e9lirante.\n[79] Selon le docteur Gu\u00e9rin, il existe une gradation dans la symptomatologie d\u00e9pressive. Lorsqu'un patient vient voir son m\u00e9decin et lui dit: Bon, bien, \u00e9coutez, j'ai tel, tel sympt\u00f4me, par exemple, je dors moins bien... j'ai un peu moins d'int\u00e9r\u00eat, je suis pr\u00e9occup\u00e9, j'ai des difficult\u00e9s de concentration , le m\u00e9decin doit le questionner pour savoir s'il y a d'autres sympt\u00f4mes associ\u00e9s \u00e0 cet \u00e9tat. Il doit essayer de v\u00e9rifier jusqu'\u00e0 quel point les sympt\u00f4mes sont importants. Le docteur Gu\u00e9rin constate qu'il y a des gens qui disent: J'ai des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 me concentrer , mais apr\u00e8s une demi-heure d'entrevue, le m\u00e9decin constate qu'ils se concentrent bien, qu'ils ne perdent pas le fil de leurs id\u00e9es, qu'ils r\u00e9pondent bien aux questions. Si quelqu'un dit: J'ai peu d'app\u00e9tit , le m\u00e9decin doit essayer de v\u00e9rifier s'ils ont perdu du poids. Ce sont l\u00e0 des choses que le m\u00e9decin doit faire, selon le docteur Gu\u00e9rin, afin d'essayer d'objectiver la pathologie.\n[80] Le 19 novembre 1998, le plaignant retourne voir le docteur Payne. Selon le docteur Payne cette rencontre aurait dur\u00e9 \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s cinq minutes. Lors de cette rencontre le docteur Payne pr\u00e9pare un rapport final. Un tel document est \u00e9mis lorsqu'un patient a atteint, selon les termes de la CSST, un \u00e9tat de consolidation . Le rapport final est diff\u00e9rent des autres documents parce qu'il pose des questions diff\u00e9rentes et sp\u00e9cifiques. Par exemple, est-ce qu'il va y avoir une atteinte permanente? si la case oui est coch\u00e9e, alors on poursuit : est-ce qu'il va y avoir des limitations fonctionnelles ? . Si oui , alors : est-ce qu'on parle d'une aggravation des limitations fonctionnelles ant\u00e9rieures? . Si on r\u00e9pond oui, il faudra produire un rapport d'\u00e9valuation. Dans le cas de Beauregard, ce rapport d'\u00e9valuation ne sera jamais produit.\n[81] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question pourquoi il n'avait jamais produit ce rapport d'\u00e9valuation, le docteur Payne r\u00e9pond : Tr\u00e8s bonne question. Est-ce que c'est une question de ne pas avoir rejoint monsieur Beauregard, est-ce que c'est une question de manque de disponibilit\u00e9, est-ce que c'est parce que monsieur Beauregard avait un processus administratif puis j'attendais peut-\u00eatre \u00e7a, je ne peux vous r\u00e9pondre l\u00e0.\n[82] La date de consolidation sur le rapport final est indiqu\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant le 23 novembre 1998. Le docteur Payne affirme ne pouvoir dire avec certitude comment il est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 cette date. Selon lui, d'un point de vue administratif, il arrive r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement que les patients vont \u00eatre consolid\u00e9s deux ou trois jours apr\u00e8s leur visite. Il ajoute \u00e9galement : \u00c7a peut \u00eatre parce que c'est un jeudi, par exemple, puis on consolide le lundi. Puis c'est logique, si le 19, c'est un jeudi, le 20, le 23, \u00e7a donne un lundi. C'est habituellement des raisons administratives uniquement qui font qu'on va mettre la date de consolidation une couple de jours apr\u00e8s.\n[83] Questionn\u00e9 \u00e0 savoir s'il est normal que la date de consolidation soit fix\u00e9e en fonction d'une journ\u00e9e de la semaine, il r\u00e9pond \u00e7a d\u00e9pend. Ici, on parle d'une gestion administrative, donc une gestion administrative \u00e7a implique aussi qu'il va y avoir une consolidation administrative et pas juste m\u00e9dicale. La consolidation doit \u00e9galement se faire sur le plan administratif c'est-\u00e0-dire lui donner le temps de contacter son employeur .\n[84] Pourtant la date de consolidation , pour les fins de la CSST, se d\u00e9finit comme \u00e9tant la date du plateau th\u00e9rapeutique d'une l\u00e9sion professionnelle. Le docteur Payne d\u00e9finit le concept de plateau th\u00e9rapeutique d'une fa\u00e7on plus large que strictement m\u00e9dical. Il con\u00e7oit cette date comme celle o\u00f9 il est plus convenable et pratique pour le travailleur de retourner au travail, surtout dans un cas comme celui-ci, parce que le probl\u00e8me est, de son avis, plus administratif que m\u00e9dical. D'ailleurs, le docteur Payne qualifie les examens psychologiques du plaignant de ventilation, je ne suis pas s\u00fbr qu'on parlerait d'un tr\u00e8s gros traitement m\u00e9dical .\n[85] Par un probl\u00e8me de nature administratif, il affirme vouloir dire que la gestion et le r\u00e8glement sont essentiellement administratifs. Il ajoute nous nous retrouvons donc avec un probl\u00e8me qui est surtout administratif et un peu m\u00e9dical. ... Si on veut donner des pourcentages, on pourrait peut-\u00eatre dire 80 [administratif]-20 [m\u00e9dical] ou 85-15.\n[86] Le docteur Payne a de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 expliquer quel \u00e9tait le probl\u00e8me que le plaignant avait avec son travail : \u00e7a semblait \u00eatre un probl\u00e8me de relations de travail avec diff\u00e9rentes personnes qui \u00e9taient difficiles . Pourtant dans son compte rendu \u00e9crit de la rencontre du 6 octobre 1998, il note son superviseur le stress beaucoup , au singulier. Beauregard ne lui a pas donn\u00e9 de nom, ni ne lui a-t-il dit lors de leurs rencontres ce qui lui d\u00e9plaisait dans cette ou ces individus. Mais, il est clair pour le docteur Payne que le probl\u00e8me en est un de relations de travail. Pourtant, Beauregard semble dire que c'est le plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9 qui est le probl\u00e8me pas de fen\u00eatres, bruyant, poussi\u00e9reux .\n[87] Le rapport m\u00e9dical du 19 novembre indique le diagnostic suivant \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif situationnel. Retour au travail selon l'article 54.02b) hors 2 plans sans horaire de nuit. Jour ou soir 23-11-98, ceci de fa\u00e7on permanente selon avis psychiatrique . Pourquoi parle-t-on de deux plans?\n[88] Le docteur Payne affirme avoir fait ce nouveau diagnostic suite \u00e0 la rencontre entre Beauregard et le docteur Morin. En ce qui concerne l'article 54.02b) de la convention collective, le docteur Payne t\u00e9moigne que c'est le plaignant qui lui a demand\u00e9 d'y faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence car lui-m\u00eame ne connaissait pas l'existence de cette disposition.\n[89] Il ajoute avoir recommand\u00e9 que le plaignant travaille \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur des deux plans en raison de la recommandation du docteur Morin. Cependant si le probl\u00e8me en est un de relations de travail avec diff\u00e9rentes personnes, il est difficile de voir comment cette recommandation r\u00e9glerait le probl\u00e8me surtout si les superviseurs ne sont pas les m\u00eames dans les deux plans .\n[90] Il pr\u00e9cise qu'il a fait ces recommandations pour les deux plans parce que les deux plans ont les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques de travail et que c'est cela qui amenait le probl\u00e8me. Ainsi, le probl\u00e8me n'en est plus un de conflits de travail avec des superviseurs mais un probl\u00e8me de lieu de travail.\n[91] Le docteur Payne t\u00e9moigne que le docteur Morin recommande \u00e9galement un travail hors des deux plans . Toutefois, si nous nous r\u00e9f\u00e9rons \u00e0 la note manuscrite du docteur Morin pr\u00e9par\u00e9 suite \u00e0 son examen de Beauregard nous constatons que celui-ci parle de plan au singulier et non au pluriel : Rec : Changement de poste et de milieu (plan) . D'ailleurs, rien ne laisse croire que le docteur Morin connaissait l'existence du deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tablissement.\n[92] Le docteur Payne admettra finalement que c'est Beauregard qui lui a demand\u00e9 de l'exclure, par un certificat m\u00e9dical, des deux plans et du travail de nuit, mais il ajoute que ce n'est pas sur cette demande qu'il a fond\u00e9 sa recommandation, sans donner d'autres explications. Il admet \u00e9galement que c'est Beauregard qui lui a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il avait fait une demande en vertu de l'article 54.02b) de la convention collective et qui lui a demand\u00e9 d'\u00e9crire cette recommandation sur le certificat. Le docteur Payne admet ne pas conna\u00eetre l'article en question et reconna\u00eet que ce n'est pas une prescription m\u00e9dicale, tout en ajoutant que c'est toutefois la gestion administrative qui est recherch\u00e9e pour ce dossier.\n[93] Il dit avoir sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 sans horaire de nuit parce qu'il consid\u00e8re Beauregard comme fragile, ce qui lui occasionne plus de difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 s'adapter \u00e0 un horaire de nuit. Le bruit, l'isolation, le stress et le travail nocturne sont, selon lui, des facteurs qui risquent d'amener une rechute. Il reconna\u00eet toutefois qu'il se peut \u00e9galement que ce soit Beauregard qui lui ait demand\u00e9 de l'exclure du quart de nuit mais il n'est pas aussi affirmatif \u00e0 ce sujet qu'il ne l'\u00e9tait en ce qui concerne la suggestion relative aux deux plans .\n[94] En ce qui concerne la rencontre avec le docteur Morin, les seules preuves que nous avons sur celle-ci sont le t\u00e9moignage de Beauregard et la note pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par le docteur Morin. Cette rencontre aurait dur\u00e9e \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 45 minutes. Les questions pos\u00e9es par le docteur Morin portent sp\u00e9cifiquement sur l'endroit de travail et l'\u00e9tat du plaignant lorsqu'il se trouve \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de son lieu de travail et lorsqu'il se trouve \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur. Beauregard indique que le docteur Payne avait pos\u00e9 une question sp\u00e9cifique au docteur Morin, \u00e0 savoir : Est-ce que le patient devrait \u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9 ou mut\u00e9 ou travailler en dehors des deux plans , et la r\u00e9ponse du docteur Morin a \u00e9t\u00e9 dans l'affirmative. Pourtant le docteur Payne n'a jamais fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 cette question ni dans son t\u00e9moignage, ni dans ses notes. En ce qui a trait aux deux plans , rappelons que le docteur Morin dans sa note ne parle que de plan au singulier.\n[95] D'ailleurs la note du docteur Morin est tr\u00e8s br\u00e8ve et je la reproduis en entier : Travaille \u00e0 Postes Canada depuis juin 93 dans un plan m\u00e9canique qui traite le courrier. Se plaint de harc\u00e8lement de la direction. A fait des remplacements dans des succursales postales. Consid\u00e9rait que l'ouvrage \u00e9tait plaisant surveillant \u00c6 surintendant. Accident de travail : \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif situationnel reli\u00e9 au travail (docteur Payne) versus suspension d'apr\u00e8s la direction. Milieu (le plan) : bruit - isolation - stress. Diagnostic : stress aigu + trouble d'adaptation dans le milieu de travail avec humeur anxio-d\u00e9pressive. Recommandation changement de poste et de milieu (plan) .\n[96] Le diagnostic du docteur Morin parle d'un stress aigu . Selon l'interpr\u00e9tation du docteur Payne, un stress aigu c'est quelque chose qui s'est pass\u00e9 dans un court lapse de temps et qui a amen\u00e9 un affect \u00e9motif. Dans l'examen qu'il a fait de Beauregard le lendemain de sa rencontre avec le docteur Morin, le docteur Payne affirme qu'il n'a pas constat\u00e9 de stress aigu. Pour sa part le docteur Gagnon, affirme que c'est difficile de retenir un diagnostic de stress aigu car il manque l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment premier : une r\u00e9action \u00e0 un \u00e9v\u00e9nement. Une r\u00e9action de stress aigu c'est l'\u00e9quivalent d'un \u00e9tat de stress postraumatique, mais de courte dur\u00e9e. Dans le cas de Beauregard, il n'y a jamais eu d'\u00e9v\u00e9nement traumatisant.\n[97] Lors de la rencontre du 19 novembre 1998, le docteur Payne affirme que Beauregard est un peu agit\u00e9. Il est rest\u00e9 debout pendant toute l'entrevue. Le docteur Payne affirme toutefois n'avoir pos\u00e9 aucune question au patient puisqu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vu la veille par le docteur Morin. La rencontre a dur\u00e9 de 2 \u00e0 5 minutes. Dans cette courte p\u00e9riode de temps, le docteur Payne a compl\u00e9t\u00e9 un rapport m\u00e9dical et le rapport final. Dans le rapport final, il reconna\u00eet avoir coch\u00e9 oui \u00e0 toutes les questions dans la section intitul\u00e9e atteinte permanente \u00e0 l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 physique ou psychique et limitations fonctionnelles . Il dit toutefois avoir commis une erreur en cochant oui \u00e0 la question si oui, ces limitations ont-elles aggrav\u00e9 des limitations fonctionnelles ant\u00e9rieures puisque normalement cette question s'adresse \u00e0 des individus qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu un accident de travail. Il dit que cette erreur peut \u00eatre d\u00fbe \u00e0 un manque d'attention car il devait agir rapidement mais qu'elle pourrait \u00e9galement s'expliquer par le fait qu'\u00e0 ce moment il \u00e9tait moins familier avec les rouages administratifs.\n[98] Dans le rapport final, il a \u00e9galement coch\u00e9 oui \u00e0 la question produirez-vous le rapport d'\u00e9valuation en conformit\u00e9 avec le bar\u00e8me des dommages corporels mais admet que ce rapport n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 produit.\n[99] Comme j'en ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait mention, lors de la rencontre du 19 novembre, le docteur Payne a encore une fois diagnostiqu\u00e9 un \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif situationnel. Selon le docteur Gagnon, un tel diagnostic \u00e0 cette date (Beauregard ne travaille plus depuis le 1er octobre) est pour le moins surprenant car, selon lui, une personne qui souffre de trouble d'adaptation ou d'une d\u00e9pression r\u00e9actionnelle ou situationnelle, voit son \u00e9tat s'am\u00e9liorer d\u00e8s qu'elle est sortie de la situation qui cause le trouble puisque le facteur stress n'existe plus. Il ajoute qu'il est difficile de croire qu'un \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif existe encore quelques semaines plus tard et que le m\u00e9decin traitant n'a pas pos\u00e9 de gestes, sur le plan m\u00e9dical, pour traiter cette d\u00e9pression.\n[100] Le 26 novembre 1998, un nouveau rapport m\u00e9dical est pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par le docteur Payne. Pour la pr\u00e9paration de ce rapport, il n'y a pas eu de visite ou d'examen clinique. Le document est, selon le docteur Payne, un certificat administratif qui r\u00e9it\u00e8re les recommandations d\u00e9j\u00e0 faites. Dans le diagnostic nous pouvons lire consolid\u00e9 le 19-11-98, arr\u00eat de travail selon article 54.02b), hors 2 plans et caetera, ad mise en application selon 08665 . Ce que ce document veut dire, selon le docteur Payne, c'est que jusqu'\u00e0 ce que l'on rende effectives ce qu'il qualifie comme des limitations permanentes du plaignant, ce dernier reste en arr\u00eat de travail.\n[101] Un rapport m\u00e9dical est pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le 15 d\u00e9cembre 1998. Le diagnostic de ce document indique travail hors plan obligatoire selon article 54. \u00c9tat d\u00e9pressif connu . Le docteur Payne dit avoir indiqu\u00e9 obligatoire parce qu'il est \u00e9vident qu'il y a des probl\u00e8mes du point de vue de la gestion administrative du dossier du plaignant et que le travail hors plan est finalement, \u00e0 son avis, la solution.\n[102] Dans ses notes, le docteur Payne \u00e9crit pour le 15 d\u00e9cembre 1998, rechute r\u00e9cidive, aggravation car a \u00e9t\u00e9 remis au plan . Selon lui, Beauregard recommence \u00e0 \u00eatre dans un \u00e9tat psychologique plus difficile parce qu'on l'a remis au plan. En contre-interrogatoire, il pr\u00e9cise que c'est une erreur de consid\u00e9rer cette situation comme une rechute et qu'il aurait d\u00fb plut\u00f4t indiquer que c'est la continuation du m\u00eame probl\u00e8me.\nC. La rencontre avec le docteur Marc Gu\u00e9rin [103] Le docteur Marc Gu\u00e9rin est un m\u00e9decin psychiatre. Son exp\u00e9rience professionnelle est surtout dans trois domaines : la pratique de la psychiatrie et de la psychanalyse en milieu hospitalier et en bureau priv\u00e9; l'enseignement de la psychiatrie \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 McGill et de la psychanalyse \u00e0 l'Institut canadien de psychanalyse; et l'expertise m\u00e9dico-l\u00e9gale, qui est devenue depuis la fin 1996, son seul champ d'exercice. Le docteur Gu\u00e9rin dit avoir vingt ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience dans les entrevues ou l'expertise du genre de celui qu'il a eues avec Beauregard. Il ajoute avoir rencontr\u00e9 durant sa vie professionnelle au moins 10 000 patients en expertise, soit \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 500 par ann\u00e9e.\n[104] Le docteur Gu\u00e9rin est qualifi\u00e9 d'expert en psychiatrie.\n[105] Le docteur Gu\u00e9rin a rencontr\u00e9 Beauregard le 6 novembre 1998, dans le cadre d'une expertise demand\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e. L'entrevue fut tr\u00e8s courte. Elle n'a pas dur\u00e9 plus de 15 \u00e0 20 minutes puisque Beauregard a refus\u00e9 de collaborer et de r\u00e9pondre aux questions du docteur. Le docteur Gu\u00e9rin n'a donc pas cru bon de s'obstiner et il a mis fin \u00e0 l'entrevue. Beauregard explique sa r\u00e9ticence par le fait qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 et renseign\u00e9 sur ce qu'est une expertise m\u00e9dicale psychiatrique. Il dit mieux comprendre maintenant ce qui est attendu de lui et c'est pourquoi il a demand\u00e9 par la suite \u00e0 revoir le docteur Gu\u00e9rin et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 collaborer \u00e0 100% avec celui-ci. L'intim\u00e9e ne donnera pas suite \u00e0 cette demande, ce qui \u00e0 mon avis est malheureux, mais sans cons\u00e9quence pour la disposition finale de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[106] La fa\u00e7on dont le docteur Gu\u00e9rin a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9parer son expertise est celle qu'il dit adopter dans tous les cas. Il commence par s'identifier. Il pr\u00e9sente ensuite au patient son mandat. Il explique quelles sont les questions qui lui seront pos\u00e9es. Il dit vouloir s'assurer que la personne sait qui l'a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9. Il explique \u00e9galement qu'il va pr\u00e9parer un rapport apr\u00e8s l'examen. Il remet ensuite un formulaire sur lequel il donne les coordonn\u00e9es de la personne \u00e0 qui il va adresser son rapport. Enfin, il proc\u00e8de avec son questionnaire. Il commence par prendre les donn\u00e9es factuelles : \u00e2ge, date de naissance, etc... Ensuite, il questionne le patient sur ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents tant m\u00e9dicaux que psychiatriques et sur le probl\u00e8me qui l'a amen\u00e9 devant lui.\n[107] Il dit avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 exactement de cette fa\u00e7on avec Beauregard mais que celui-ci n'a pas voulu r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses questions. Tout ce qu'il lui a dit, c'est qu'il ne pouvait pas travailler sur les plans m\u00e9canis\u00e9s; qu'il y avait un conflit sans toutefois \u00e9laborer sur la nature de ce conflit.\n[108] Quand il l'a questionn\u00e9 sur ses sympt\u00f4mes, le plaignant aurait r\u00e9pondu qu'il ne peut pas m'en dire davantage avant d'avoir vu son m\u00e9decin . Cette r\u00e9ponse est selon le docteur Gu\u00e9rin tr\u00e8s inhabituelle. Il reconna\u00eet que les gens qui viennent le voir en expertise ne viennent pas de leur plein gr\u00e9, ils sont toujours envoy\u00e9s par quelqu'un. Ils arrivent donc avec un peu d'appr\u00e9hension et un certain degr\u00e9 de r\u00e9ticence. Mais il ajoute que lorsqu'il leur explique son mandat et son r\u00f4le, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les gens collaborent bien. Il dit qu'il arrive \u00e0 l'occasion qu'il y ait des gens qui collaborent moins bien. Cependant, des gens qui ne collaborent pas au point qu'il ne puisse proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un questionnaire et faire un examen complet ou satisfaisant, c'est tr\u00e8s rare. Il dit que cela lui est arriv\u00e9 seulement quelques fois en 20 ans de pratique.\n[109] Le docteur Gu\u00e9rin mentionne que habituellement les gens qui viennent le voir sont envoy\u00e9s parce qu'ils ont un probl\u00e8me et son r\u00f4le, est d'essayer d'identifier le probl\u00e8me et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, de faire des suggestions pour le traitement. Les gens, m\u00eame s'ils arrivent avec une certaine r\u00e9ticence, savent qu'ils sont devant un m\u00e9decin qui va essayer dans la mesure du possible de les aider. Ils ont donc int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 collaborer et acceptent, malgr\u00e9 les h\u00e9sitations du d\u00e9part, de relater leurs sympt\u00f4mes.\n[110] Le docteur Gu\u00e9rin t\u00e9moigne qu'il n'a pas r\u00e9ussi, lors de son examen, \u00e0 mettre en \u00e9vidence de pathologie psychiatrique pour Beauregard. Ce qu'il dit avoir retir\u00e9 de la discussion avec lui, c'est qu'il est malheureux \u00e0 son travail et qu'il semble y avoir une forme de conflit. Beauregard ne rapporte aucun sympt\u00f4me psychiatrique au docteur Gu\u00e9rin. Le docteur observe qu'il n'a pas de signe \u00e9vident de pathologie psychiatrique : son discours \u00e9tait coh\u00e9rent; il \u00e9tait vif et bien orient\u00e9; et il n'a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en cours d'entrevue de probl\u00e8me de concentration ou de pathologies.\n[111] Dans son rapport le docteur Gu\u00e9rin admet qu'il est clair que Beauregard est malheureux dans son travail et qu'il ne veut pas travailler au poste qu'il occupe dans le plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9. Il ajoute qu'il lui a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il a d\u00fb quitter son travail en raison du stress interne et de la pression dans les plans m\u00e9canis\u00e9s. Toutefois il n'a pas voulu \u00e9laborer sur ces questions et lorsque le docteur Gu\u00e9rin l'a questionn\u00e9 sur ces sympt\u00f4mes, il a r\u00e9pondu qu'il devait revoir son m\u00e9decin et qu'il saurait alors quoi lui dire.\n[112] De son bref entretien, le docteur Gu\u00e9rin a pu noter que Beauregard se pr\u00e9sente bien et qu'il semble en bonne sant\u00e9. Le sensorium, c'est-\u00e0-dire son orientation dans le temps, lui est apparu clair. Il n'a not\u00e9 aucune anomalie des fonctions cognitives c'est-\u00e0-dire les capacit\u00e9s de concentration, la m\u00e9moire et la compr\u00e9hension. Il n'a pas non plus d'agitation, ni de retard psychomoteur, qui sont des signes que l'on note lorsqu'une personne est atteinte, par exemple, d'un syndrome anxio-d\u00e9pressif assez important. Dans ces cas, on constate soit une agitation motrice et psychologique caus\u00e9e par l'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 ou soit un retard dans les cas de d\u00e9pression profonde. Beauregard ne pr\u00e9sente ni l'un, ni l'autre.\n[113] Son humeur est normale; il n'a pas l'air triste. L'affect est, dans les mots du docteur Gu\u00e9rin, mobilisable . Il en conclut qu'il n'y a pas d'\u00e9vidence d'une pathologie qu'on pourrait qualifier de trouble de l'humeur dans le genre des d\u00e9pressions ou de manies. Durant l'examen, Beauregard n'est pas apparu anxieux. La forme de la pens\u00e9e est normale, le discours coh\u00e9rent. Il n'a toutefois pas \u00e9t\u00e9 possible pour le docteur Gu\u00e9rin de se faire une bonne id\u00e9e des contenus psychiques puisqu'il refuse de r\u00e9pondre aux questions. Mais, il ajoute que de toute \u00e9vidence il n'est pas d\u00e9lirant et il ne pr\u00e9sente pas de pens\u00e9es suicidaires.\n[114] Puisqu'il ne constate pas de pathologie \u00e9vidente, le docteur Gu\u00e9rin affirme ne pouvoir \u00e9mettre de restrictions ou de recommandations de traitement. Il n'y a donc pas d'\u00e9vidence d'invalidit\u00e9 et pas d'\u00e9vidence de restrictions pour causes psychiatriques quant \u00e0 son travail. S'il y a un probl\u00e8me, il est, selon le docteur Gu\u00e9rin, de nature administrative et il va falloir adresser ce probl\u00e8me sur le plan administratif ce qui ne rel\u00e8ve pas de la m\u00e9decine. Il rejoint ainsi en quelque sorte les conclusions du docteur Payne.\n[115] Si la question \u00e9tait m\u00e9dicale, le docteur Gu\u00e9rin indique que, dans le cas de sympt\u00f4mes anxio-d\u00e9pressifs, les deux formes de traitements les plus r\u00e9pandues sont la psychoth\u00e9rapie et la pharmacoth\u00e9rapie. Il y a des m\u00e9dicaments, soit des tranquillisants ou des antid\u00e9presseurs, qui peuvent \u00eatre prescrits si les sympt\u00f4mes sont suffisamment importants pour justifier une telle prescription. Tous ces m\u00e9dicaments entra\u00eenent des effets secondaires donc ils ne vont pas \u00eatre prescrits si la personne n'est pas suffisamment perturb\u00e9e. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, l'absence totale de traitement laisse croire, selon le docteur Gu\u00e9rin, \u00e0 une d\u00e9ficience tr\u00e8s l\u00e9g\u00e8re, s'il y a une d\u00e9ficience.\n[116] Beauregard n'informe pas le docteur Gu\u00e9rin qu'il a vu une psychologue le 2 novembre 1998, soit \u00e0 peine quatre jours avant sa rencontre avec lui. Il n'a pas non plus indiqu\u00e9 qu'il allait voir le docteur Morin le 18 novembre 1998. Rien n'indique \u00e9galement dans les notes du docteur Morin, qu'il ait inform\u00e9 celui-ci qu'il a vu le docteur Gu\u00e9rin le 6 novembre 1998.\n[117] Dans son rapport, le docteur Gu\u00e9rin conclut que l'examen bref auquel il a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 ne lui a pas permis d'arriver \u00e0 un diagnostic psychiatrique. En cons\u00e9quence, il indique que l'opinion qu'il \u00e9met est bas\u00e9e sur le court entretien qu'il a eu avec Beauregard et qu'il faut donc prendre son opinion sous toutes r\u00e9serves parce que c'est possible qu'il ait eu des probl\u00e8mes particuliers dont il ne lui a pas parl\u00e9.\nD. L'\u00e9valuation du docteur Andr\u00e9 Gamache [118] Le docteur Andr\u00e9 Gamache est un m\u00e9decin psychiatre. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin par la Commission et le plaignant. Toutefois, ni la Commission, ni le plaignant n'ont jug\u00e9 bon de le qualifier \u00e0 titre de t\u00e9moin expert. Je dois donc, sans remettre en doute ses comp\u00e9tences de psychiatre, prendre sous r\u00e9serve les opinions \u00e9mises par le docteur lors de son t\u00e9moignage.\n[119] En 1999, le docteur Gamache travaille \u00e0 l'H\u00f4pital Louis-H. Lafontaine, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, comme psychiatre \u00e0 l'urgence. De 1999 \u00e0 2001, il travaille \u00e9galement au Bureau d'\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dical (BEM), en moyenne une journ\u00e9e par semaine, o\u00f9 il pratique des expertises. Le BEM est un organisme gouvernemental. Des m\u00e9decins de diff\u00e9rentes sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s y travaillent en tant qu'arbitres dans les litiges relatifs aux dossiers de la CSST. C'est une commission d'arbitrage \u00e0 qui on fait appel lorsque des rapports de m\u00e9decins sont divergents. Un comit\u00e9 conjoint employeurs-employ\u00e9s nomme les m\u00e9decins au BEM. Ces m\u00e9decins sont ind\u00e9pendants et ne sont \u00e0 la solde ni de l'employ\u00e9, ni de l'employeur, ni d'un syndicat et ils doivent proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen neutre pour r\u00e9gler un litige. Ils doivent finalement dire qui a raison entre deux m\u00e9decins. Dans le cas qui nous int\u00e9resse, le docteur Gamache devait trancher entre les \u00e9valuations des docteurs Payne et Gu\u00e9rin.\n[120] La proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9voit que le m\u00e9decin du BEM peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 se prononcer sur plusieurs questions qui rel\u00e8vent de la Loi sur les accidents de travail et maladies professionnelles14. Dans le cas de Beauregard, cinq questions sont pos\u00e9es au docteur Gamache. Elles portent sur le diagnostic, la date de consolidation, les soins ou traitements, l'atteinte permanente et les limitations fonctionnelles.\n[121] Dans la section de son rapport, pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le 26 f\u00e9vrier 1999, intitul\u00e9e Historique de la probl\u00e9matique , le docteur Gamache relate :\n\u00abLe 14 septembre, on lui [Beauregard] aurait demand\u00e9 de retourner au travail dans les plans m\u00e9canis\u00e9s comme commis aux lettres. C'est \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 dit-il qu'il a ressenti de la part de son employeur des moyens de pression. Il me donne aujourd'hui quelques exemples comme par exemple son employeur qui se tenait debout derri\u00e8re lui et qui le surveillait. On v\u00e9rifiait \u00e9galement le fait s'il prenait trop de temps soit pour aller aux toilettes ou la pause-caf\u00e9. Il me mentionne \u00e9galement qu'il ne pouvait pas parler \u00e0 ses voisins, ne serait-ce que pour demander des informations au niveau de son travail. Il me fait part, comme exemple, lorsqu'il avait un colis o\u00f9 il ne savait pas comment le trier, et bien il demandait \u00e0 son voisin le travail \u00e0 faire dans de telles situations. On lui aurait interdit de faire cela et de demander plut\u00f4t \u00e0 son superviseur. On lui aurait m\u00eame dit et, me mentionne-t-il, preuve \u00e0 l'appui, que son superviseur lui aurait mentionn\u00e9 que s'il ne faisait pas cela comme \u00e7a (son travail), on va le \"crisser\" dehors. \u00bb (C'est moi qui souligne)\n[122] Ainsi, selon l'historique que Beauregard a relat\u00e9 au docteur Gamache, c'est le 14 septembre que les moyens de pression de son employeur auraient commenc\u00e9. Il mentionne ensuite une s\u00e9rie d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ne peuvent s'\u00eatre produits le 14 septembre ou apr\u00e8s, puisqu'il a quitt\u00e9 son travail le 15 septembre pour ne revenir que pour une partie de la journ\u00e9e le 7 octobre. D'ailleurs, dans sa lettre \u00e0 France Villeneuve, de la CSST, dat\u00e9e du 9 d\u00e9cembre 1998, dans laquelle il donne trois pages d'exemples avec des noms et des dates d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements, aucun \u00e9v\u00e9nement n'est identifi\u00e9 pour les 14 et 15 septembre 1998. Finalement, les propos qu'un superviseur aurait tenus \u00e0 son endroit qui sont repris dans la derni\u00e8re phrase de cette section du rapport du docteur Gamache, ne lui ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9s directement. Selon les t\u00e9moignages de R\u00e9al Caron et de Richard Gagnon, ces propos auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 tenus le 7 octobre lorsque, Caron, Gagnon et D'Amours attendaient pour lui et qu'il ne s'est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9. De plus, Caron, sans nier qu'il ait utilis\u00e9 ces mots, affirment les avoir dit \u00e0 sa coll\u00e8gue D'Amours et non \u00e0 Gagnon et encore moins \u00e0 Beauregard qui n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent.\n[123] Dans son rapport, le docteur Gamache note \u00e9galement que le m\u00e9decin traitant mentionne trouble d'adaptation dans le milieu de travail avec humeur anxio-d\u00e9pressive...atteinte permanente \u00e0 l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 psychique : 5% . Ce qui veut dire qu'au moment o\u00f9 le docteur Payne l'a examin\u00e9, il pr\u00e9sentait des s\u00e9quelles psychologiques dues \u00e0 son trouble d'adaptation. \u00c0 cinq pourcent, il est d'accord pour dire que l'on parle d'une n\u00e9vrose mineure.\n[124] Dans l' \u00e9volution de la probl\u00e9matique le docteur Gamache indique tout d'abord dans un premier temps, ce fut assez difficile avec monsieur Beauregard de savoir de quoi il souffrait exactement en date du 1er octobre 1998. Je mentionnerais qu'au d\u00e9but de l'entrevue, il \u00e9tait un peu m\u00e9fiant mais que la m\u00e9fiance s'est estomp\u00e9e par la suite . Il ajoute que cette difficult\u00e9 est semble-t-il normal au d\u00e9but mais une fois expliqu\u00e9e le r\u00f4le du BEM, la m\u00e9fiance s'estompe. En contre-interrogatoire, le docteur Gamache a reconnu qu'il ne note l'\u00e9tat de m\u00e9fiance d'un patient que dans les cas o\u00f9 il consid\u00e8re que c'est important.\n[125] Le docteur Gamache indique qu'un psychiatre qui \u00e9value un patient doit poser un certain nombre de questions. Toutefois, il admet n'avoir pos\u00e9 aucune question sur le comportement psychosocial de Beauregard notamment en ce qui concerne le genre de personne qu'il est, comment il se comporte en soci\u00e9t\u00e9, quels sont ses traits de personnalit\u00e9, quelles sont ses particularit\u00e9s psychologiques ou de personnalit\u00e9. Il reconna\u00eet que compte tenu de la probl\u00e9matique soulev\u00e9e que ces questions auraient pu permettre de conna\u00eetre comment Beauregard r\u00e9agit par rapport \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 en milieu de travail surveill\u00e9 et par rapport aux directives ou aux ordres; informations qui auraient pu servir dans le diagnostic.\n[126] Le docteur Gamache ajoute dans son rapport il me mentionne que son m\u00e9decin traitant a \u00e9crit un papier \u00e0 ce sujet o\u00f9 il parlait d'une r\u00e9action anxio-d\u00e9pressive due \u00e0 un stress au travail. Je lui mentionne toutefois que le docteur Payne n'a mentionn\u00e9 aucune des symptomatologies et que je voudrais l'investiguer avec lui . (C'est moi qui souligne.) Le docteur Gamache ne pouvait donc identifier aucun sympt\u00f4me dans les rapports m\u00e9dicaux du docteur Payne.\n[127] \u00c0 l'examen, le docteur Gamache admet qu'il n'a pas constat\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sence des sympt\u00f4mes qui sont n\u00e9cessaires pour poser un diagnostic de trouble d'adaptation et puisqu'il ne peut pour arriver \u00e0 sa conclusion que Beauregard souffre d'un trouble d'adaptation, s'en remettre aux sympt\u00f4mes not\u00e9s sur les rapports m\u00e9dicaux du docteur Payne, il dit s'en \u00eatre remis \u00e0 ce que Beauregard lui a d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant ses sympt\u00f4mes.\n[128] Dans son diagnostic, le docteur Gamache conclut d'\u00e0 mon avis, monsieur Beauregard a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un trouble de l'adaptation avec \u00e0 la fois anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et humeur d\u00e9pressive, code 309.21 . Le code 309.21 se r\u00e9f\u00e8re au manuel DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders) qui contient la nomenclature des maladies mentales avec les diff\u00e9rents diagnostics. Le DSM-IV est un document utilis\u00e9 en clinique, dans les expertises et dans les rapports m\u00e9dicaux. Le docteur Gamache dit en \u00eatre arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 cette conclusion parce que Beauregard lui a dit qu'en date du 1er octobre 1998, il avait des probl\u00e8mes au niveau du sommeil, des r\u00e9veils fr\u00e9quents et qu'il se sentait \u00e9puis\u00e9, fatigu\u00e9, anxieux. Il ajoute, de plus, que sur les plans m\u00e9canis\u00e9s, il n'a pas l'impression d'\u00eatre trait\u00e9 comme un humain d'abord, il ne voit absolument rien \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur, il n'y a aucune fen\u00eatre, qu'il y a beaucoup de poussi\u00e8re, ils sont constamment surveill\u00e9s, brefs robotis\u00e9s. Que pour lui, c'\u00e9tait une situation intenable et qu'en vertu d'un article dit-il 54 de la Convention collective, il a demand\u00e9 un red\u00e9ploiement \u00e0 plusieurs reprises. Il me mentionne donc qu'il voulait bien travailler mais pas \u00e0 un endroit o\u00f9 pour lui il ne sent pas bien psychologiquement, c'est que son employeur a toujours refus\u00e9 ce red\u00e9ploiement au niveau de son emploi .\n[129] Les sympt\u00f4mes \u00e9taient donc, selon le docteur Gamache, la fatigue, l'\u00e9puisement et l'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. Le docteur ajoute que l'on peut conclure que quelqu'un qui est dans une situation de stress et qui en raison de ce stress d\u00e9veloppe dans les semaines, dans les jours, dans les mois qui suivent ces sympt\u00f4mes souffre d'un trouble de l'adaptation avec une humeur anxio-d\u00e9pressive.\n[130] \u00c0 l' avis motiv\u00e9 dans son rapport, le docteur Gamache conclut qu'il est d'accord avec le diagnostic retenu au dossier par le docteur Payne. Il donne, cependant, comme diagnostic un trouble d'adaptation avec \u00e0 la fois anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et humeur d\u00e9pressive et ne retient pas l'\u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif situationnel ou r\u00e9actionnel qui n'est pas un diagnostic cod\u00e9 dans le DSM-IV. Selon lui, les sympt\u00f4mes correspondent plus au code de trouble de l'adaptation avec une humeur anxio-d\u00e9pressive. Encore une fois, la symptomatologie qui lui permet d'arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion lui vient de Beauregard.\n[131] Le trouble d'adaptation est caract\u00e9ris\u00e9, selon le docteur Gamache, par l'apparition de sympt\u00f4mes de nature anxieuse ou d\u00e9pressive ou les deux suite \u00e0 un stress v\u00e9cu par l'individu. Il ajoute qu'en psychiatrie, il n'existe pas d'examen objectif, comme une prise de sang, pour permettre de poser un diagnostic. Le psychiatre doit se fier \u00e0 ce que lui dit le patient et \u00e0 ce qu'il peut comprendre de la nature humaine. D'apr\u00e8s le docteur Gamache, il est fort probable que Beauregard ait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un trouble de l'adaptation suite aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements qu'il dit avoir v\u00e9cus.\n[132] Au moment o\u00f9 le docteur Gamache a \u00e9valu\u00e9 Beauregard le 25 f\u00e9vrier 1999, celui-ci ne fait aucun cauchemar, son humeur est bonne, son sommeil est bon de m\u00eame que son app\u00e9tit. Il n'a donc \u00e0 ce moment pas de probl\u00e8me psychique, il n'a pas de s\u00e9quelles ce qui confirme, \u00e0 son avis, qu'une fois le stress parti les sympt\u00f4mes disparaissent. Toutefois, il ajoute que si le stress r\u00e9appara\u00eet, il existe une possibilit\u00e9 que les sympt\u00f4mes reviennent. Il t\u00e9moigne : Bien, \u00e9coutez, d'apr\u00e8s ce que j'ai lu de mon \u00e9valuation, monsieur Beauregard, donc mentionnait que sur les plans m\u00e9canis\u00e9s o\u00f9 il travaillait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, si je me souviens bien, c'est que c'\u00e9tait surtout l'attitude de son employeur, qui comme j'ai mentionn\u00e9, de le surveiller: As-tu pris 15 minutes pour aller aux toilettes ou, bon, des choses comme \u00e7a. Donc, \u00e7a, \u00e9videmment, c'\u00e9tait quand m\u00eame tr\u00e8s difficile pour lui \u00e0 accepter. Donc, pour lui, c'\u00e9tait un stress et en plus, bien, il travaillait de nuit, si j'ai bien compris, il travaillait sur les plans m\u00e9canis\u00e9s, il n'y a pas de lumi\u00e8re, de la poussi\u00e8re. Je ne me souviens pas s'il travaillait de nuit, de jour ou de soir, mais pour lui, c'\u00e9tait un stress aussi. Donc, c'\u00e9tait une multitude de facteurs qui faisaient qu'il vivait sur les plans m\u00e9canis\u00e9s o\u00f9 il travaillait une situation stressante et le fait de l'enlever de \u00e7a, le fait de l'enlever, donc \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, il n'en a plus de sympt\u00f4me. Mais si on le replace, si vous voulez, il y a possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9apparition de... je ne sais pas si c'est clair. (C'est moi qui souligne.)\n[133] Selon le docteur Gamache, il n'y a aucun traitement, psychoth\u00e9rapie ou pharmacoth\u00e9rapie, pour cette situation. M\u00eame si on prescrivait des anxiolytiques ou des antid\u00e9presseurs, cela ne changerait rien. Seul le temps peut arranger les choses et enlever le stress. Lorsqu'une personne vit un trouble de l'adaptation, on enl\u00e8ve le stress et ensuite les sympt\u00f4mes disparaissent. Pourtant, au mois de novembre 1998, Beauregard n'est plus dans le plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9 depuis la mi-septembre 1998 et le docteur Payne diagnostique toujours un trouble d'adaptation.\n[134] Au moment o\u00f9 il examine Beauregard, le docteur Gamache dit qu'il n'a pas d'atteinte, qu'il a un \u00e9l\u00e9ment mental dans la normale. Il ne voit donc pas de s\u00e9quelles, ni de limitations fonctionnelles, puisqu'il n'a pas de probl\u00e8mes de sommeil, ni d'attention ou de concentration, ni d'humeur. Il est dans la normale et pr\u00eat \u00e0 travailler, mais, selon le docteur Gamache, pas dans le m\u00eame travail qu'avant.\n[135] Dans la section de son rapport intitul\u00e9e Nature, necessit\u00e9, suffisance ou dur\u00e9e de soins , le docteur Gamache indique nil parce que le stress est parti. Il ajoute qu'on ne peut pas sugg\u00e9rer \u00e0 quelqu'un un traitement lorsqu'il n'a pas de sympt\u00f4mes.\n[136] Un peu plus loin dans la section Existence ou pourcentage d'atteinte permanente \u00e0 l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 psychique du travailleur , le docteur Gamache indique aucun . Dans son rapport m\u00e9dical du 1er janvier 1999, le docteur Payne avait pourtant indiqu\u00e9 que Beauregard a un pourcentage d'atteinte permanente de 5%. Le 26 f\u00e9vrier 1999, le docteur Gamache indique qu'il n'y en a pas. Le docteur Gamache dit ne pas se souvenir pourquoi le docteur Payne avait fix\u00e9 ce pourcentage. Toutefois, il ajoute que m\u00eame s'il n'y a pas d'atteinte permanente, cela ne veut pas dire que Beauregard peut retourner dans les plans m\u00e9canis\u00e9s car il y a toujours une possibilit\u00e9 de rechute.\n[137] Dans son contre-interrogatoire, le docteur Gamache admet qu'une atteinte permanente n'est pas quelque chose qui dispara\u00eet dans quelques semaines. Ainsi, puisque le docteur Payne a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu'il y a une atteinte psychique permanente chez Beauregard et que le docteur Gamache, un mois plus tard, dit qu'il n'y a pas d'atteinte permanente alors, il est clair que le docteur Payne doit s'\u00eatre tromp\u00e9 ou que c'est le docteur Gamache qui se trompe. J'ai tendance toutefois \u00e0 pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer, sur ce point, le diagnostic du docteur Gamache.\n[138] Ensuite dans Existence ou \u00e9valuation des limitations fonctionnelles du travailleur , il conclut que le plaignant ne pr\u00e9sente aucune limitation fonctionnelle du point de vue psychiatrique. Au moment o\u00f9 le docteur Gamache l'a examin\u00e9, son sommeil est bon, son app\u00e9tit est bon, il n'est pas anxieux, il est bien orient\u00e9, il a un affect mobilisable . Il a un examen mental dans la normale. Il dit \u00eatre pr\u00eat d\u00e8s demain, dit-il, \u00e0 aller travailler mais dans un autre endroit... . Il n'est pas symptomatique.\n[139] Le docteur Gamache mentionne ... il y aurait int\u00e9r\u00eat qu'il y ait une entente administrative avec son employeur pour un changement de poste et de milieu de travail tel que stipul\u00e9 par son m\u00e9decin traitant ... . Mais il prend soin d'ajouter : Cependant, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te du point de vu psychologique actuellement, son \u00e9tat mental est normal et il n'y a aucune limitation fonctionnelle. Par l'expression entente administrative il affirme ne pas vouloir dire que le probl\u00e8me est uniquement administratif. Ce qu'il sugg\u00e8re c'est qu'il y ait un dialogue entre Beauregard, son employeur et son syndicat pour d\u00e9cider s'il est possible, en raison de son trouble d'adaptation, de lui trouver un poste ailleurs.\nE. L'examen du docteur G\u00e9rard Cournoyer [140] Le docteur G\u00e9rard Cournoyer est m\u00e9decin psychiatre \u00e0 l'H\u00f4pital Louis-H. Lafontaine depuis 20 ans. Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de t\u00e9moin expert et son t\u00e9moignage, en ce qui concerne les opinions qu'il pourrait \u00e9mettre, devra \u00eatre pris sous r\u00e9serve.\n[141] Selon le docteur Cournoyer, il lui est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 quelques reprises dans sa carri\u00e8re d'accepter des mandats d'expertises psychiatriques. C'est d'ailleurs dans cette capacit\u00e9 qu'il a rencontr\u00e9 Beauregard le 25 septembre 2000, \u00e0 la demande de Me Marie-Christine Dufour, avocate du Syndicat des employ\u00e9s des postes. L'examen a dur\u00e9 deux heures.\n[142] Le mandat accept\u00e9 par le docteur Cournoyer lui demandait d'\u00e9mettre une opinion sur la capacit\u00e9 de son retour au travail en tenant compte de la pr\u00e9sence ou de l'absence d'une limitation fonctionnelle. Le 28 septembre 2000, il a remis son rapport d'expertise psychiatrique.\n[143] Le fait que Beauregard a fait 240 demandes de mutation a laiss\u00e9 une forte impression chez le docteur Cournoyer. Lorsqu'il a questionn\u00e9 Beauregard \u00e0 ce sujet, celui-ci a expliqu\u00e9 que rien dans la convention collective ne limite le nombre de demandes de mutation qu'un employ\u00e9 peut faire. Il lui a dit qu'il est tout \u00e0 fait libre d'aller o\u00f9 il veut parce qu'il n'a pas de conjoint, ni d'enfants.\n[144] Dans son contre-interrogatoire le docteur Cournoyer affirme l'avoir questionn\u00e9 sur ses v\u00e9ritables intentions concernant ces demandes de mutation.\nQ. D'ailleurs, vous notez \u00e0 votre examen que dans les 240 demandes de mutation de monsieur, c'\u00e9tait pour aller \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s n'importe o\u00f9 au Qu\u00e9bec. C'est lui qui vous a dit \u00e7a?\nR. Oui, parce que je lui avais pos\u00e9 la question parce que je trouvais que c'\u00e9tait beaucoup de demandes. En fait, ce que je voulais v\u00e9rifier, c'est est-ce qu'il faisait des demandes juste pour faire des demandes ou si vraiment, c'\u00e9tait concr\u00e8tement possible pour lui d'accepter un emploi n'importe o\u00f9 au Qu\u00e9bec, en fran\u00e7ais, en anglais. Il m'a dit: Oui. Moi, je n'ai pas de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Tout ce que je veux, c'est un poste \u00e0 temps complet et je ne suis pas mari\u00e9, je n'ai pas d'enfants, je suis disponible pour y aller.\n[145] Pourtant nous avons vu que Beauregard parle de changements dans sa vie affective pour justifier son refus d'aller \u00e0 Matane. Il est donc surprenant qu'il n'a pas fait mention de ce fait au docteur Cournoyer.\n[146] Le docteur Cournoyer poursuit :\nSi ma m\u00e9moire est fid\u00e8le, je ne sais pas comment... je pense que ses patrons aussi lui avaient pos\u00e9 la question. \u00c7a m'apparaissait \u00eatre une question de gros bon sens, si quelqu'un faisait autant de demandes, de dire: \u00c9coute, vous jouez \u00e0 quoi? Es-tu s\u00e9rieux? Tu pourrais aller n'importe o\u00f9? Si la personne dit: Oui, je suis s\u00e9rieux, je pourrais aller n'importe o\u00f9. Bien l\u00e0, je pense que c'est plus, on va prendre les demandes plus au s\u00e9rieux puis on ne va pas se mettre \u00e0 croire qu'il fait des demandes.\n[...]\nQ. Est-ce que dans votre opinion \u00e0 vous, dans l'\u00e9valuation de la situation cette journ\u00e9e-l\u00e0, est-ce que vous avez cru monsieur Beauregard quand il vous a dit: Moi, j'\u00e9tais disponible pour aller n'importe o\u00f9 ? Vous l'avez cru sur la bonne foi?\nR. Je l'ai cru, il m'a convaincu de \u00e7a quand il m'a dit qu'il n'avait ni femme ni enfant, ce qui, pour la plupart des gens, c'est des facteurs limitants dans le choix du travail (C'est moi qui souligne.)\n[147] Beauregard explique au docteur Cournoyer que dans le plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9 \u00e0 Ville St-Laurent, il y a des sections qui sont tr\u00e8s bruyantes et, qu'en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les employ\u00e9s aiment mieux ne pas travailler dans ce plan. Ils aiment mieux travailler ailleurs soit sur la route, comme facteur, sur les camions, dans les succursales ou encore dans les bureaux de postes.\n[148] Toutefois, le docteur Cournoyer ne croit pas que travailler dans un environnement tel que d\u00e9crit par le plaignant puisse entra\u00eener un trouble de l'adaptation puisqu'il y a plein de gens qui travaillent dans des endroits tr\u00e8s bruyants et s'il fallait que tout ce monde-l\u00e0 aient des troubles d'adaptation... Je ne dis pas que \u00e7a ne peut pas arriver pour quelqu'un, mais en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, non. Dans mon esprit, bon, le bruit, ce n'\u00e9tait certainement pas quelque chose d'agr\u00e9able, mais c'\u00e9tait beaucoup plus le climat conflictuel qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'origine le facteur de stress que j'ai identifi\u00e9 que le bruit . (C'est moi qui souligne.).\n[149] Le diagnostic du docteur Cournoyer est [qu'en] septembre 1998, M. Beauregard a souffert d'un trouble d'adaptation et ce trouble persiste dans la mesure o\u00f9 il est confront\u00e9 \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le travail au plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9 . Pour en arriver \u00e0 ce diagnostic il dit s'\u00eatre fond\u00e9 sur l'histoire que lui a relat\u00e9 Beauregard et sur ses sympt\u00f4mes d'ordre \u00e9motionnel qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 document\u00e9s par le docteur Payne.\n[150] Le docteur Cournoyer indique qu'il y a en l'esp\u00e8ce un facteur de stress identifiable soit la situation difficile que le plaignant vivait au travail. Il constate que docteur Luc Morin a diagnostiqu\u00e9 une r\u00e9action de stress aigu et que Beauregard a des sympt\u00f4mes d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et une humeur d\u00e9pressive. Selon le docteur Cournoyer cette symptomatologie cadre bien avec un diagnostic de trouble d'adaptation.\n[151] Le sympt\u00f4me le plus important d'un \u00e9tat de d\u00e9tresse psychologique importante se trouve, selon le docteur Cournoyer, dans l'affirmation du plaignant \u00e0 l'effet qu'il ne peut plus fonctionner normalement. Dans son rapport, il note le 6 octobre 1998, lorsqu'il consulte le Dr Allen Payne, il ne fonctionne plus normalement . C'est-l\u00e0, selon lui, une symptomatologie conciliable avec une d\u00e9tresse psychologique importante. Si quelqu'un dort mal, n'a pas un sommeil r\u00e9cup\u00e9rateur, perd l'app\u00e9tit, a un aplatissement du moral, cette personne a un affect assez d\u00e9pressif. Quand deux heures apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre lev\u00e9e, cette m\u00eame personne affirme se sentir tellement fatigu\u00e9e qu'elle sent le besoin de se recoucher, alors c'est, selon le docteur Cournoyer, assez important parce que cette situation l'emp\u00eache de fonctionner durant une journ\u00e9e normale. Ajoutez \u00e0 cela, qu'il y a des facteurs de stress car cette m\u00eame personne se sent anxieuse \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e d'\u00eatre au travail, qu'elle a un ralentissement de la pens\u00e9e ainsi que des maux de t\u00eate. Selon le docteur Cournoyer, si le docteur Payne l'a mis en cong\u00e9 de maladie, c'est parce que Beauregard n'arrive plus \u00e0 fonctionner normalement. Il ajoute que c'est l'importance des sympt\u00f4mes cliniques puis l'alt\u00e9ration du fonctionnement global de la personne qui va \u00eatre le motif d'arr\u00eat de travail.\n[152] Selon le docteur Cournoyer, le qualificatif aigu du stress se r\u00e9f\u00e8re au fait que les sympt\u00f4mes sont apparus rapidement. La symptomatologie rapport\u00e9e dans le dossier du docteur et les faits tels que rapport\u00e9s par Beauregard sont, \u00e0 son avis, compatibles avec un diagnostic de stress aigu.\n[153] Le docteur Cournoyer est d'avis que le plaignant est porteur d'une limitation fonctionnelle qui l'emp\u00eache de travailler dans le plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9 m\u00eame si \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 il l'a examin\u00e9, il avoue qu'il n'y a aucun sympt\u00f4me. Son analyse psychologique de la situation est fond\u00e9e sur la situation conflictuelle que Beauregard dit vivre \u00e0 son travail et qui le rend psychologiquement incapable d'y retourner. Pour le docteur Cournoyer l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment stresseur est le conflit de travail.\n[154] Le docteur Cournoyer ajoute qu'il peut arriver que des gens vivent des situations conflictuelles assez importantes pour leur causer des probl\u00e8mes d'ordre psychologiques et que la seule fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me est de les enlever de la situation de conflit. Il consid\u00e8re illusoire de penser qu'au niveau psychologique que Beauregard peut retourner au m\u00eame endroit avec les m\u00eames personnes, o\u00f9 il y a toute un histoire compliqu\u00e9e et d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able qui s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e pour tout le monde .\n[155] Dans son rapport, il dit avoir constat\u00e9 [q]uand on aborde la possibilit\u00e9 qu'il puisse un jour retourner travailler au plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9, on le sent tendu, anxieux et il dit, qu'\u00e0 cette seule id\u00e9e, il commence \u00e0 avoir mal \u00e0 la t\u00eate .\n[156] Le conflit, l'agent stresseur selon le docteur Cournoyer, trouve sa source dans le fait que Beauregard d\u00e9sire un poste \u00e0 temps complet. Selon les faits qu'il a relat\u00e9s au docteur Cournoyer, vers 1995 ou 1996, il obtient ce poste \u00e0 temps complet, mais au bout de trois semaines on l'informe qu'en raison d'une erreur administrative, il est mut\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre poste, perdant son statut d'employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps complet. \u00c0 l'\u00e9t\u00e9 1998, il travaille comme commis en succursale en remplacement d'employ\u00e9s en vacances. De retour au plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9, le 14 septembre 1998, il dit ne pas avoir r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 le poste qu'il occupait dans la section des colis avant l'\u00e9t\u00e9. Il s'est retrouv\u00e9 plut\u00f4t dans la section des lettres. Toutefois, il n'informe pas le docteur Cournoyer que ce poste est temporaire et que son affectation devait se terminer au plus tard le 5 septembre 1998. Insatisfait de ce milieu de travail et pr\u00e9f\u00e9rant de beaucoup sortir du plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9, il dit qu'il s'est mis \u00e0 remplir des demandes de mutation. Toutefois, le docteur Cournoyer est d'avis que ces seuls faits ne seraient pas suffisants en soi pour en arriver \u00e0 un diagnostic de trouble d'adaptation.\n[157] Comme autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment du conflit de travail, le docteur Cournoyer identifie un appel fait par le plaignant au vice-pr\u00e9sident de l'intim\u00e9e15, une action qui aurait cr\u00e9\u00e9, selon Beauregard, une certaine tension entre ses sup\u00e9rieurs et lui. \u00c0 partir de ce moment-l\u00e0, il raconte au docteur Cournoyer qu'il est cibl\u00e9 dans son milieu de travail par ses superviseurs. De plus, en septembre 1998, il se sent mal de retourner au plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9, \u00e0 un travail qu'il n'aime pas o\u00f9 il doit \u00e0 nouveau faire face \u00e0 des cadres avec lesquels il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 en conflit.\n[158] Le docteur Cournoyer conclut: En effet, il me semble illusoire de penser que cet homme pourra fournir une prestation de travail normale, vu le stress psychologique que cela pourrait engendrer dans les circonstances exceptionnelles que l'on conna\u00eet. Par circonstances exceptionnelles , il dit se r\u00e9f\u00e8rer au conflit de travail. Qu'un employ\u00e9 qui a un conflit fasse un appel au vice-pr\u00e9sident de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 c'est, aux yeux du docteur Cournoyer, exceptionnel; que cette m\u00eame personne fasse 240 demandes de mutation, c'est \u00e9galement exceptionnel. Le fait d'\u00eatre dans un plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9 et qu'il y ait des surveillants n'a cependant rien d'exceptionnel. Le fait d'avoir des griefs contre son employeur et des insatisfactions personnelles n'a rien d'exceptionnel. Ce qui est exceptionnel dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, selon le docteur Cournoyer, c'est l'accumulation des faits relat\u00e9s dans l'histoire du conflit. Cette accumulation laisse l'impression qu'il y a de l'adversit\u00e9 dans le milieu de travail.\n[159] Cette adversit\u00e9 est due \u00e0 des personnes, selon le docteur Cournoyer. Ainsi, puisqu'on se retrouve dans une impasse et que ce n'est plus vivable psychologiquement, qu'il y a des gens qui ne sont plus capables de se tol\u00e9rer, la solution c'est d'essayer de s\u00e9parer les protagonistes, mais au niveau m\u00e9dical, \u00e7a ne serait pas une raison de dire: Pour \u00e9viter la chicane, on va mettre une limitation fonctionnelle . \u00c7a, ce ne serait pas honn\u00eate de dire \u00e7a . (C'est moi qui souligne.)\n[160] Dans sa conclusion, le docteur Cournoyer ajoute toutefois je suis d'avis que M. Beauregard est porteur d'une limitation fonctionnelle pour travailler dans le plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9 . En contre-interrogatoire, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question \u00e0 savoir si Beauregard aurait pu travailler dans un autre plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9, le docteur Cournoyer a r\u00e9pondu que cette question n'a jamais effleur\u00e9 son esprit, mais que s'il se l'\u00e9tait pos\u00e9 il aurait probablement dit qu'il pouvait le faire puisque, selon lui, tout ce qui est arriv\u00e9, met en sc\u00e8ne des personnes qui travaillent dans un plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9 en particulier. Le docteur Cournoyer ne semble pas au courant de l'existence d'un autre plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9 au centre-ville. Pourtant Beauregard affirme lui en avoir parl\u00e9 tout en pr\u00e9cisant qu'il se peut qu'il n'ait pas mentionn\u00e9 sp\u00e9cifiquement le plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9 du centre-ville, mais qu'il est certain d'avoir indiqu\u00e9 au docteur Cournoyer qu'il y avait d'autres plans m\u00e9canis\u00e9s \u00e0 Ottawa, Qu\u00e9bec ou Trois-Rivi\u00e8res!\n[161] La conclusion du docteur Cournoyer \u00e0 l'effet que l'agent stresseur d\u00e9coule d'un conflit de travail est incompatible avec le t\u00e9moignage de Beauregard qui lui identifie le lieu de travail comme l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment stresseur et non un ou des superviseurs. La conclusion du docteur \u00e9tant fond\u00e9e sur les faits que lui a relat\u00e9s Beauregard, m'appara\u00eet incompatible avec les faits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience et qui n'identifient aucune situation conflictuelle entre Beauregard et son surintendant ou sa superviseure \u00e0 partir du 14 septembre 1998. Il se peut tr\u00e8s bien que sur les faits retenus par le docteur Cournoyer qu'il soit possible d'identifier une symptomatologie de trouble d'adaptation mais encore faut-il que ceux-ci soient conformes \u00e0 ce qui s'est v\u00e9ritablement d\u00e9roul\u00e9. Je ne jette toutefois aucunement le bl\u00e2me pour cette situation sur le docteur Cournoyer qui, de bonne foi, s'est fi\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que Beauregard lui a dit.\nF. L'\u00e9valuation du docteur Jacques Gagnon [162] Le docteur Jacques Gagnon pratique la m\u00e9decine depuis 1965 : de 1965 \u00e0 1970 \u00e0 titre de m\u00e9decin et, depuis 1970, \u00e0 titre de sp\u00e9cialiste en psychiatrie. Il consacre actuellement le deux tiers de son temps \u00e0 la psychiatrie. Il s'occupe d'un h\u00f4pital de jour (HMR) o\u00f9 il voit surtout des gens qui ont des troubles d'humeur. Il a \u00e9galement men\u00e9 une carri\u00e8re dans l'enseignement (plus de 25 ans). Il est professeur adjoint de clinique \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. Il fait de l'enseignement aupr\u00e8s des r\u00e9sidents en psychiatrie et aupr\u00e8s des externes et des internes en m\u00e9decine familiale. Il a aussi fait de la m\u00e9decine administrative \u00e0 l'H\u00f4pital Maisonneuve-Rosemont qui est un h\u00f4pital d'enseignement. Depuis 1995, il a fait plus d'une centaine d'expertises par ann\u00e9e tout en conservant un volet clinique.\n[163] Le docteur Gagnon est qualifi\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'expert en psychiatrie.\n[164] Le docteur Gagnon a examin\u00e9 Beauregard le 17 novembre 2000, dans le cadre d'une expertise pour l'intim\u00e9e. La question principale pos\u00e9e au docteur Gagnon \u00e9tait de savoir si Beauregard souffre de limitations fonctionnelles de nature psychologique permanentes comme l'indique le docteur Cournoyer. C'est la premi\u00e8re fois qu'il le rencontre.\n[165] Le docteur Gagnon dit se souvenir de cette rencontre, m\u00eame si elle remonte \u00e0 trois ans, parce qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'un des patients les plus difficiles que j'ai eu \u00e0 interroger dans l'ensemble de ma pratique . Beauregard se montre r\u00e9ticent. Il refuse de signer une note d'autorisation de communiquer les renseignements mais il accepte quand m\u00eame que le docteur Gagnon proc\u00e8de \u00e0 l'examen et qu'il fasse un rapport.\n[166] Le docteur Gagnon explique qu'il arrive que des patients soient r\u00e9ticents mais une fois qu'ont leur a expliqu\u00e9 les raisons de l'examen et une fois les premi\u00e8res r\u00e9serves pass\u00e9es, les gens acceptent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de collaborer. Avec Beauregard, le docteur Gagnon dit avoir eu l'impression de marcher sur des ufs et d'avoir \u00e0 fournir le maximum de confort et d'y aller le plus possible avec des gants blancs pour obtenir sa coop\u00e9ration . Malgr\u00e9 tout, il a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 maintenir l'entrevue pendant \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s une heure.\n[167] Dans le rapport pr\u00e9par\u00e9 suite \u00e0 cet examen, le docteur Gagnon note sur la demande16 de l'employ\u00e9, on faisait mention d'un \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif situationnel...et que ce trouble persistait dans la mesure o\u00f9 il est confront\u00e9 \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le travail au plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9 . Un peu plus loin ...monsieur Beauregard a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un trouble d'adaptation avec \u00e0 la fois anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et humeur d\u00e9pressive . Le docteur Gagnon reconna\u00eet qu'il n'est pas, avec les renseignements qu'il a en sa possession, en mesure de poser un diagnostic sur l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du plaignant en 1998.\n[168] Toutefois, le docteur Gagnon ajoute que, selon lui, l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment qui g\u00e9n\u00e8re son probl\u00e8me est clairement sa perception de son milieu de travail. Beaucoup de ses dol\u00e9ances sont d\u00fbes au fait qu'il se consid\u00e8re sous surveillance par ses sup\u00e9rieurs. Il en d\u00e9duit que c'est une strat\u00e9gie de harc\u00e8lement de la part de l'employeur. Pour le docteur Gagnon toutefois les faits qu'il relate n'ont rien d'inhabituels.\n[169] Lorsque le docteur Gagnon lui demande de quoi il souffre, il lui r\u00e9pond qu'il a un \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif situationnel. Selon le docteur Gagnon c'est \u00e9videmment une r\u00e9ponse apprise parce que la personne ordinaire ne mentionnerait pas \u00e7a comme une souffrance. Les gens vont plut\u00f4t dire qu'ils sont tristes ou anxieux ou qu'ils sont nerveux, qu'ils dorment mal ou qu'ils mangent mal. Il faut toutefois reconna\u00eetre que le plaignant, depuis plus d'un an, sait que c'est le diagnostic qu'a pos\u00e9 les docteurs Payne et Morin et il ne fait donc que r\u00e9p\u00e9ter l'information qu'il a re\u00e7u de ses m\u00e9decins, ce qui me semble parfaitement normal dans les circonstances.\n[170] Le docteur Gagnon dit que les r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 ses questions durant l'examen sont demeur\u00e9es vagues et laconiques.\n[171] Reprenant ensuite la liste des sympt\u00f4mes identifi\u00e9s par le docteur Payne, il mentionne que la simple affirmation d'une personne qu'elle souffre d'insomnie n'est pas suffisante. Il faut savoir si c'est une insomnie initiale ou une insomnie terminale, ce qui n'a pas la m\u00eame signification. Il ajoute que le fait qu'une personne se r\u00e9veille la nuit mais qu'elle se rendorme par la suite est une situation normale. Ainsi, pour savoir si quelqu'un a vraiment de l'insomnie, il faut poser plusieurs questions et pas juste se contenter qu'elle nous dise qu'elle a des probl\u00e8mes de sommeil.\n[172] Aux questions portant sur ses probl\u00e8mes de sommeil et d'app\u00e9tit, Beauregard pr\u00e9cise qu'il se r\u00e9veille parfois la nuit et que son app\u00e9tit est variable. En ce qui concerne son poids, il indique qu'il ne se p\u00e8se pas mais qu'il a constat\u00e9 qu'il a r\u00e9duit sa taille d'un trou de ceinture . En ce qui a trait \u00e0 son humeur, il a surtout parl\u00e9 de son irritabilit\u00e9 au travail, une agressivit\u00e9 qu'il dit cependant contr\u00f4lable. Il ne pleure pas et ne se montre pas particuli\u00e8rement triste.\n[173] Le docteur Gagnon consid\u00e8re que ce sont l\u00e0 des questions qu'il faut toujours poser si l'on cherche \u00e0 diagnostiquer la d\u00e9pression; il faut alors identifier un trouble de l'humeur significatif qui est soit de la tristesse ou de l'irritabilit\u00e9. Il ajoute que si quelqu'un ne pleure pas, ne se montre pas triste, cela diminue de beaucoup les chances qu'il ait eu une vraie d\u00e9pression.\n[174] Le docteur Gagnon dit lui avoir pos\u00e9 des questions sur sa concentration. Il r\u00e9pond que, en dehors du plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9, il va bien. Selon le docteur Gagnon, les personnes qui sont d\u00e9prim\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on significative ont des probl\u00e8mes de concentration. Si une personne dit que, en dehors du travail, elle peut se concentrer alors son manque de concentration au travail ne m\u00e8ne pas n\u00e9cessairement au diagnostic d'un \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif; ce manque de concentration peut s'expliquer par d'autres facteurs.\n[175] Le docteur Gagnon l'a \u00e9galement questionn\u00e9 sur la pr\u00e9sence d'id\u00e9es de pers\u00e9cution parce qu'il peut arriver qu'une personne se sente \u00e9pi\u00e9e dans le sens pathologique du terme. Elle peut penser que certaines personnes montent des complots contre elle, qu'elles lui en veulent, qu'elles le suivent partout. Ce n'est pas le cas ici.\n[176] Il n'a pas non plus de ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes hallucinatoires, ni d'obsessions. Le docteur Gagnon indique que les personnes qui souffrent de probl\u00e8mes d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 peuvent parfois souffrir d'un trouble obsessif compulsif. Il mentionne que ce sont l\u00e0 des questions de routine dans un examen de ce genre.\n[177] Il dit avoir constat\u00e9 que Beauregard a une pr\u00e9occupation, son milieu de travail, qu'il consid\u00e8re indigne. Ce qui n'est pas, selon le docteur Gagnon, une obsession au sens m\u00e9dical du terme.\n[178] Le docteur Gagnon l'a \u00e9galement questionn\u00e9 sur l'existence de phobies parce qu'il y a des personnes qui peuvent souffrir d'une incapacit\u00e9 partielle ou totale suite \u00e0 des phobies - c'est-\u00e0-dire des peurs sp\u00e9cifiques qui sont exag\u00e9r\u00e9es - qui sont importantes. Par exemple dans le cas de quelqu'un qui a une phobie des hauteurs, il ne faudrait pas dans ce cas le placer dans un milieu de travail o\u00f9 il aurait \u00e0 travailler en hauteur. Dans le cas de Beauregard, il n'y a pas de phobies.\n[179] Il note que Beauregard n'a pas de pens\u00e9es d\u00e9lirantes; aucun d\u00e9lire de pers\u00e9cution. Il n'a pas ce que le docteur Gagnon a qualifi\u00e9 de ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes schneid\u00e9riens, c'est-\u00e0-dire des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes de psychose; pas d'hallucinations; pas d'obsessions; pas de phobies.\n[180] Toujours selon le docteur Gagnon, il a une bonne vigilance. Il est attentif et capable de se concentrer. Sa m\u00e9moire est fonctionnelle, c'est-\u00e0-dire que pendant toute la dur\u00e9e de l'entrevue il est en parfait contr\u00f4le de ce qu'il veut dire. L'examen des facult\u00e9s mentales sup\u00e9rieures montre que ces facult\u00e9s sont dans les limites de la normale.\n[181] Le docteur Gagnon consid\u00e8re que son questionnaire \u00e9tait assez complet, mais que malgr\u00e9 tout, il aurait pu \u00eatre plus satisfaisant. Son insatisfaction provient de la rigidit\u00e9 mentale et de la m\u00e9fiance de Beauregard pendant l'examen.\n[182] Le docteur Gagnon reconna\u00eet que la crise d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, les id\u00e9es de pers\u00e9cution, les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes hallucinatoires, les phobies, ou encore les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes d'obsession ne sont pas essentiels \u00e0 un diagnostic de trouble d'adaptation. Il ajoute toutefois que lorsque l'on fait un examen mental, il faut poser ces questions pour d\u00e9terminer si l'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 provient d'une maladie plus grave. Ainsi, pour faire une bonne \u00e9valuation d'un trouble d'adaptation, il faut quand m\u00eame \u00e9liminer des diagnostics de maladies plus graves dont la d\u00e9pression majeure, le trouble anxieux s\u00e9v\u00e8re, le trouble de panique, les troubles phobiques, les troubles obsessifs compulsifs ou les troubles psychotiques.\n[183] Pour le docteur Gagnon un trouble majeur de la personnalit\u00e9, c'est une personne qui, tout au long de sa vie adulte, a des difficult\u00e9s d'adaptation en raison de la fa\u00e7on dont elle transige avec les autres. Il y a plusieurs prototypes de trouble majeur de la personnalit\u00e9. Lors de son examen, le docteur Gagnon affirme ne pas avoir d\u00e9tect\u00e9 de trouble majeur de personnalit\u00e9. Il a constat\u00e9 cependant certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments au niveau de la personnalit\u00e9 du plaignant : la froideur, la rigidit\u00e9 de la pens\u00e9e et la m\u00e9fiance.\n[184] Il dit l'avoir questionn\u00e9 sur les traitements qu'il a re\u00e7us. Il constate qu'on ne lui a prescrit aucun m\u00e9dicament - Beauregard lui mentionne d'ailleurs qu'il est contre le fait de prendre des m\u00e9dicaments - et aucune psychoth\u00e9rapie17. Selon le docteur Gagnon, si on parle d'une d\u00e9pression majeure le traitement reconnu est les antid\u00e9presseurs, lesquels ont un effet anxiolytique. En l'esp\u00e8ce, avec les quelques sympt\u00f4mes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9s, il n'y avait pas lieu, d'apr\u00e8s le docteur Gagnon, de prescrire des m\u00e9dicaments et ni de prescrire un traitement quelconque. L'absence de prescription de m\u00e9dicaments est toutefois r\u00e9v\u00e9latrice, selon lui, de l'ampleur de la maladie. Si quelqu'un est malade longtemps ou s\u00e9v\u00e8rement on s'attend normalement \u00e0 ce qu'il re\u00e7oive un traitement m\u00e9dical appropri\u00e9.\n[185] Un aspect qui, selon le docteur Gagnon, sort un peu de l'ordinaire dans l'examen qu'il a fait de Beauregard est son attitude de m\u00e9fiance, mais pour le reste tout est dans les limites de la normale.\n[186] L'examen du docteur Gagnon n'a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 aucune pathologie active mais il estime n\u00e9anmoins qu'il y a probablement un probl\u00e8me de personnalit\u00e9 qui peut expliquer l'ampleur du conflit. Il dit avoir utilis\u00e9 l'expression probablement parce qu'il n'avait pas tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments en main pour se prononcer. Par probl\u00e8me de personnalit\u00e9, il dit se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 un conflit qui n'est pas encore r\u00e9gl\u00e9. Il indique cependant qu'il ne parle pas d'un diagnostic de trouble de la personnalit\u00e9 lorsqu'il parle d'un probl\u00e8me de personnalit\u00e9.\n[187] Le docteur Gagnon conclut que Beauregard n'a pas de pathologie active de nature psychiatrique. Il est en bonne sant\u00e9. Il se peut qu'il \u00e9prouve des petits troubles d'ajustement mais, selon le docteur Gagnon, ces troubles ne sont pas une maladie.\n[188] Le docteur Gagnon ajoute que quand quelqu'un se montre froid ou m\u00e9fiant on va dire, au minimum, qu'il y a certains traits m\u00e9sadaptifs . Il ajoute toutefois qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessairement possible d'en conclure qu'il souffre d'un trouble majeur de la personnalit\u00e9, il faut nuancer. Sous toute r\u00e9serve, il estime que Beauregard pr\u00e9sente certaines caract\u00e9ristiques de la personnalit\u00e9 parano\u00efde, laquelle est bas\u00e9e sur la m\u00e9fiance. Les gens qui ont un probl\u00e8me de personnalit\u00e9 parano\u00efde ont peur de se faire jouer dans le dos, elles ont peur que les autres soient contre elle. Cependant, il ajoute qu'une personnalit\u00e9 parano\u00efde n'atteint pas un niveau psychotique, c'est-\u00e0-dire que ce ne sont pas des gens qui d\u00e9lirent, mais ce sont des gens qui ont un mode de fonctionnement tr\u00e8s r\u00e9serv\u00e9, tr\u00e8s m\u00e9fiant. Il dit cependant que le manque de collaboration de Beauregard lors de l'examen l'oblige \u00e0 \u00e9mettre cette opinion avec r\u00e9serve.\n[189] Le docteur Gagnon constate \u00e9galement que Beauregard n'ouvre pas tellement la porte sur ce qui concerne sa vie personnelle. La seule chose qu'il a \u00e9voqu\u00e9e avec beaucoup d'importance, selon le docteur, c'est son sentiment d'indignit\u00e9 dans son milieu de travail. Dans son rapport, il pr\u00e9cise il parle du stress reli\u00e9 au bruit, du stress reli\u00e9 au travail indigne et de l'agressivit\u00e9 entre employ\u00e9s et parties syndicales . Le seul facteur de stress qu'il \u00e9voque est donc sa difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 composer avec son milieu de travail. Ainsi, d\u00e8s qu'il est retir\u00e9 de son milieu de travail, on peut s'attendre \u00e0 ce que son anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 disparaisse dans les jours ou semaines qui suivent.\n[190] Le docteur Gagnon affirme avoir de la difficult\u00e9 avec l'opinion des m\u00e9decins qui ont retenu un diagnostic de trouble d'adaptation. Ils auraient d\u00fb au contraire indiquer qu'il souffre, tout au plus, d'une anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 d'anticipation, une anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 li\u00e9e \u00e0 sa perception de son milieu de travail. Les personnes apprennent normalement \u00e0 g\u00e9rer cette anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 qui n'est pas une maladie. Si on retient un diagnostic de trouble d'adaptation chronique on comprend alors que l'individu souffre continuellement de troubles de sommeil, de troubles d'app\u00e9tit ou de fonctionnement, ce qu'aucun des m\u00e9decins ayant examin\u00e9 Beauregard n'a mentionn\u00e9.\n[191] Il ajoute que lorsqu'une personne souffre de l'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 d'anticipation, cela peut \u00eatre en raison de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences personnelles ou encore de difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 g\u00e9rer un conflit. S'il y a un conflit au travail, alors l'employeur devrait essayer de r\u00e9gler ce conflit. Toutefois, si on veut en faire une maladie, il faudra alors s'appuyer sur des sympt\u00f4mes qui nous m\u00e8neront \u00e0 cette conclusion.\n[192] Selon le docteur Gagnon on doit interpr\u00e9ter les d\u00e9marches du plaignant, en l'esp\u00e8ce, comme un grand d\u00e9sir d'aller ailleurs , mais il ajoute qu'il y a des m\u00e9canismes pr\u00e9vus dans les conventions collectives pour ces situations. Ce n'est pas du ressort m\u00e9dical. Si un m\u00e9decin d\u00e9termine que le probl\u00e8me est de nature administrative, il doit le signaler \u00e0 l'employeur ou \u00e0 la partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, retournant ainsi le probl\u00e8me \u00e0 ceux qui administrent l'entreprise. Ce n'est pas au m\u00e9decin \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si quelqu'un doit travailler \u00e0 un tel plan ou \u00e0 un tel endroit \u00e0 moins que l'on puisse d\u00e9montrer l'existence d'une pathologie.\n[193] Il poursuit en disant qu'en cas de maladie, si une personne a la volont\u00e9 de retourner dans son milieu de travail elle peut, par exemple, prendre une m\u00e9dication afin de calmer son anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 ou apprendre avec un psychologue de quelle fa\u00e7on elle peut g\u00e9rer la situation. Toutefois, si l'employ\u00e9 ne veut pas reprendre son travail c'est alors difficile de lui offrir les traitements et le soutien qu'il faut.\nIII. OBSERVATIONS G\u00c9N\u00c9RALES \u00c0 PROPOS DE LA CR\u00c9DIBILIT\u00c9 DE MICHEL BEAUREGARD \u00c0 TITRE DE T\u00c9MOIN [194] J'ai d\u00fb pour beaucoup d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, faire un choix entre le t\u00e9moignage de Beauregard et ceux de d'autres t\u00e9moins. Je me dois \u00e0 ce moment d'expliquer pourquoi, dans les cas de conflit, j'ai retenu les t\u00e9moignages des autres t\u00e9moins plut\u00f4t que celui de Beauregard. Sans mettre en doute son honn\u00eatet\u00e9 \u00e0 d'autre \u00e9gard, Beauregard ne m'est pas apparu \u00e0 l'audience comme un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible. Plusieurs exemples appuient cette conclusion.\n[195] Prenons en premier lieu, la raison qu'il a donn\u00e9e pour avoir choisi le docteur Allen Payne comme m\u00e9decin traitant. Le plaignant, lorsque interrog\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet par l'avocate de la Commission, semble attribuer au hasard ce choix. Il accompagnait quelqu'un de sa famille au m\u00e9tro Papineau et il dit avoir remarqu\u00e9 dans un carnet remis par son syndicat que la Polyclinique se trouve pas loin. Il oublie cependant d'ajouter que d\u00e9j\u00e0 en 1997, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 par le docteur Payne pour une \u00e9picondylite du coude droit et un \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif situationnel. Lorsque questionn\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet par l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e, il dira qu'il ne s'en souvient plus.\n[196] Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e9galement que la premi\u00e8re fois o\u00f9 il entendait parler d'une d\u00e9pression situationnelle c'\u00e9tait en octobre 1998. Pourtant nous venons de voir que c'est ce diagnostic que le docteur Payne avait \u00e9galement pos\u00e9 en 1997.\n[197] Autre exemple : le 25 novembre 1998, l'intim\u00e9e lui pr\u00e9sente une mutation pour Matane. Il d\u00e9clare, premi\u00e8rement, qu'il n'a jamais rempli de demande de mutation pour Matane. Confront\u00e9 aux faits qu'il avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le 16 mai 1997 une telle demande, il r\u00e9pond maintenant que cette demande n'est plus valide puisque selon la convention collective une demande de mutation n'est bonne que pour une ann\u00e9e. Il ajoute ensuite qu'il vivait \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque des changements dans sa vie affective ce qui faisait qu'il ne voulait pas accepter une mutation hors de Montr\u00e9al. Il mentionne \u00e9galement que plusieurs autres facteurs doivent \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration avant d'accepter une mutation et que finalement il n'est pas oblig\u00e9 de l'accepter.\n[198] Cette r\u00e9ponse est pour le moins surprenante \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ses d\u00e9clarations au docteur G\u00e9rard Cournoyer \u00e0 qui il mentionne qu'il est libre d'aller o\u00f9 il veut parce qu'il n'a pas de conjoint, ni d'enfants, qu'il serait pr\u00eat \u00e0 aller n'importe o\u00f9 afin de sortir du plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9. Alors pourquoi, si tel est le cas, a-t-il refus\u00e9 l'offre de mutation \u00e0 Matane? Pourquoi ne pas avoir fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence de cette offre lors de sa visite au docteur Cournoyer? Pourquoi ne pas avoir mentionn\u00e9 au docteur Cournoyer les changements dans sa vie affective?\n[199] En ce qui concerne les 240 demandes de mutation, il dit, dans un premier temps, ne pas se souvenir de ces demandes de mutation parce que celles-ci ne sont bonnes que pour une ann\u00e9e et qu'apr\u00e8s il les jette. Il ajoute ensuite ne pouvoir dire si le chiffre de 240 est exact ou si c'est lui ou le docteur Cournoyer qui a propos\u00e9 ce chiffre.\n[200] En r\u00e9action au fait que le docteur Cournoyer ait affirm\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'il ne savait pas qu'il existait un autre plan au centre-ville, il d\u00e9clare, dans un premier temps, lui en avoir parl\u00e9. Puis, il ajoute qu'il se peut qu'il n'ait pas mentionn\u00e9 sp\u00e9cifiquement le plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9 du centre-ville, mais qu'il est certain d'avoir indiqu\u00e9 au docteur Cournoyer qu'il y avait d'autres plans m\u00e9canis\u00e9s \u00e0 Ottawa, Qu\u00e9bec ou Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.\n[201] Sur plusieurs autres points, il existe des inconsistances dans son t\u00e9moignage, mais je ne vais pas en faire une liste d\u00e9taill\u00e9e. Je passerai \u00e9galement sous silence l'imbroglio qui subsiste en ce qui concerne les dates de r\u00e9ception du courrier qui lui \u00e9tait adress\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e. Je me permet un seul commentaire, soit mon \u00e9tonnement devant l'attitude du plaignant. S'il est vrai qu'il avait, selon les r\u00e8glements, quinze jours pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer ses lettres, n'\u00e9tait-ce pas dans son int\u00e9r\u00eat d'agir dans les meilleurs d\u00e9lais et de collaborer avec l'intim\u00e9e afin que sa situation soit trait\u00e9e le plus rapidement possible?\nIV. LE DROIT [202] Avant d'aborder les questions soulev\u00e9es par la Loi, je tiens \u00e0 disposer d'un argument pr\u00e9liminaire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 l'effet que l'arbitre du grief, Me R. Blouin, a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi de la m\u00eame question. En cons\u00e9quence, l'intim\u00e9e soutient que le Tribunal n'aurait pas comp\u00e9tence pour juger de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Une lecture attentive des deux d\u00e9cisions rendues par l'arbitre Blouin montre que les griefs qu'il \u00e9tait demand\u00e9 de trancher ne soul\u00e8vent aucune question de discrimination ou d'all\u00e9gations de violation de droits de la personne et l'arbitre n'a, en effet, tranch\u00e9 aucune question de ce genre. Les questions soumises \u00e0 l'arbitre et celles que je dois trancher en l'esp\u00e8ce sont tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes. En cons\u00e9quence, je rejette cet argument pr\u00e9liminaire de l'intim\u00e9e, sans m'y attarder plus longuement.\n[203] La plainte de Monsieur Beauregard a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 7 de la Loi qui pr\u00e9cise que le fait de d\u00e9favoriser un individu en cours d'emploi constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite.\n[204] Selon l'article 3 de la Loi, la d\u00e9ficience constitue un motif de distinction illicite. L'article 25 indique que d\u00e9ficience englobe la d\u00e9ficience mentale. La premi\u00e8re question que j'ai donc \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre est de savoir si Beauregard souffrait, au moment pertinent en l'esp\u00e8ce, d'une d\u00e9ficience mentale et, en cons\u00e9quence, d'une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi.\n[205] Dans une affaire de ce genre, il incombe premi\u00e8rement \u00e0 la partie plaignante d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination.18 Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, il revient \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de fournir une explication raisonnable de la conduite jug\u00e9e r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible.19\n[206] La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e.20 Les all\u00e9gations faites par la partie plaignante doivent \u00eatre dignes de foi afin de justifier la conclusion qu'une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.21\nV. ANALYSE [207] La Commission et le plaignant n'ont pas r\u00e9ussi, en l'esp\u00e8ce, \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination parce que je ne suis pas convaincu qu'ils ont r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir l'existence d'une d\u00e9ficience chez le plaignant.\n[208] Je tiens \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j'arrive dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire ne met aucunement en question la possibilit\u00e9 qu'un trouble d'adaptation puisse, dans les bonnes circonstances, constituer une d\u00e9ficience suffisante au sens de la Loi. 22 La Loi ne contient pas une liste de d\u00e9ficiences mentales acceptables et une liste de d\u00e9ficiences mentales inacceptables. Ce ne sont pas seulement les d\u00e9ficiences mentales les plus s\u00e9v\u00e8res ou s\u00e9rieuses qui donnent droit \u00e0 un redressement sous la Loi. \u00c9galement, ce ne sont pas uniquement celles qui portent une atteinte permanente qui doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es. Dans les cas appropri\u00e9s, m\u00eame des d\u00e9ficiences mentales qualifi\u00e9es de mineures sans atteintes permanentes pourraient donner droit \u00e0 un redressement sous la Loi. Mais, encore faut-il qu'une preuve suffisante soit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour \u00e9tayer l'existence de cette d\u00e9ficience.\n[209] Dans la plupart des cas, la question \u00e0 savoir si nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d'une d\u00e9ficience n'est pas contentieuse. Toutefois, en l'esp\u00e8ce l'intim\u00e9e soutient que le plaignant ne souffrait pas d'une d\u00e9ficience.\n[210] Beauregard all\u00e8gue qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime le 14 septembre 1998, d'un accident au travail et qu'il s'est bless\u00e923. Cons\u00e9quemment, il dit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 absent du travail du 1er octobre 1998 jusqu'au 17 d\u00e9cembre 1998. Son m\u00e9decin traitant, au fin d'une r\u00e9clamation \u00e0 la CSST, a diagnostiqu\u00e9 une d\u00e9pression situationnelle qui l'a laiss\u00e9 avec des limitations fonctionnelles permanentes, \u00e0 savoir qu'il ne peut plus travailler dans l'un ou l'autre des deux \u00e9tablissements de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, soit celui du centre-ville et celui de ville St-Laurent, sur les quarts de nuit. Pour la Commission et le plaignant, cette condition constitue une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi.\n[211] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue \u00e9galement qu'en ordonnant son retour au travail le 9 d\u00e9cembre 1998, et en le cong\u00e9diant le 16 d\u00e9cembre 1998, pour avoir refus\u00e9 de revenir au travail, l'intim\u00e9e a contrevenu \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi.\n[212] Pour sa part, l'intim\u00e9e soutient que le plaignant ne souffre d'aucune d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi et qu'elle ne peut donc pas avoir commis \u00e0 son \u00e9gard d'actes discriminatoires.\n[213] Il ne fait aucun doute qu'un diagnostic de trouble d'adaptation avec humeur anxio-d\u00e9pressive ou encore une d\u00e9pression dite situationnelle ou r\u00e9actionnelle est une pathologie psychologique qui peut entrer dans la d\u00e9finition de d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi.\n[214] Toutefois, je suis d'accord avec l'intim\u00e9e lorsqu'elle affirme qu'il ne suffit pas qu'un m\u00e9decin affirme qu'une personne souffre de cette condition pour en reconna\u00eetre automatiquement l'existence. Encore faut-il que la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal soutienne des caract\u00e9ristiques propres \u00e0 cette pathologie et le m\u00e8ne \u00e0 la conclusion de l'existence de cette maladie.\n[215] Quelles sont, selon la preuve soumise au Tribunal, les caract\u00e9ristiques propres \u00e0 un trouble d'adaptation avec humeur anxio-d\u00e9pressive? Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, il nous faut reconna\u00eetre en premier lieu qu'une pathologie, quelle qu'elle soit, est d'abord accompagn\u00e9e de sympt\u00f4mes et d'une cause.\n[216] La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience a permis de retenir les sympt\u00f4mes suivants pour un trouble d'adaptation avec humeur anxio-d\u00e9pressive24 : une perte d'app\u00e9tit, une perte de poids, une perte de sommeil, un humeur triste, une perte de concentration et un stress.\n[217] Seuls les docteurs Payne, Morin et Gu\u00e9rin ont examin\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 une \u00e9poque contemporaine aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Dans ses rapports m\u00e9dicaux, le docteur Payne ne relate aucun sympt\u00f4mes. D'ailleurs, il reconna\u00eetra que le plaignant \u00e9tait venu le voir pour un probl\u00e8me de sinus puis qu'il aurait dit Ah, en passant, docteur, je me sens pas bien, puis et caetera . Il ajoute que le probl\u00e8me de sinus n'\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat psychologique du plaignant. Dans une note pr\u00e9par\u00e9e le 8 juin 1999, il constate \u00e0 son entr\u00e9e pour le 6 octobre 1998, \u00e9veil nocturne, absence de r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration, baisse d'app\u00e9tit, aplatissement du moral ... depuis son d\u00e9placement le 14-09-98 au plan . Toutefois, il ne donne aucun d\u00e9tail sur ces sympt\u00f4mes. Le docteur Gamache, qui a vu le plaignant apr\u00e8s les \u00e9v\u00e9nements, affirme ne pouvoir identifier de sympt\u00f4mes dans les rapports du docteur Payne. Dans sa courte note, le docteur Morin n'identifie \u00e9galement aucun sympt\u00f4me. Pour sa part, le docteur Gu\u00e9rin conclut suite \u00e0 son examen qu'il n'existe dans le cas du plaignant aucune pathologie active.\n[218] Personne ne rapporte d'humeur triste chez le plaignant. En ce qui concerne ses pertes de sommeil, il y a tr\u00e8s peu, pour ne pas dire aucun, d\u00e9tail. Le docteur Payne affirmera que la pens\u00e9e du plaignant semble au ralenti; alors que le docteur Gu\u00e9rin affirme le trouver normal \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Aucune preuve de perte de concentration.\n[219] Tous les experts et m\u00e9decins psychiatres ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effet que les sympt\u00f4mes de trouble d'adaptation disparaissent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement lorsque l'agent stresseur dispara\u00eet. Pourtant le docteur Payne indique que le plaignant d\u00e9montre encore des signes anxio-d\u00e9pressifs en novembre 1998, plus d'un mois apr\u00e8s avoir cess\u00e9 de travailler. Si tel est le cas, la situation m'appara\u00eet beaucoup plus grave que premi\u00e8rement diagnostiqu\u00e9 et aurait d\u00fb n\u00e9cessiter un traitement plus agressif sur le plan m\u00e9dical et pourtant aucun traitement n'est prescrit. D'ailleurs cette conclusion du docteur Payne en novembre est pour le moins surprenante puisque lors de la premi\u00e8re visite du plaignant la d\u00e9pression all\u00e9gu\u00e9e \u00e9tait tellement mineure, selon son t\u00e9moignage, qu'il a prescrit un retour au travail le lendemain.\n[220] Dans la d\u00e9cision Chamberlin cit\u00e9e par la Commission, le plaignant avait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 diagnostiqu\u00e9 par son m\u00e9decin avec un trouble d'adaptation. Les sympt\u00f4mes et causes sont d\u00e9crits au paragraphe 11 et 12 de la d\u00e9cision. Dans ce cas, dont les faits semblent d\u00e9crire une situation plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re que celle en l'esp\u00e8ce, le m\u00e9decin traitant avait prescrit deux \u00e0 quatre semaines de cong\u00e9 et une r\u00e9\u00e9valuation \u00e0 la fin de cette p\u00e9riode afin de d\u00e9terminer si le plaignant \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 retourner \u00e0 son travail. Nous pouvons donc en conclure que si la situation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse le docteur Payne aurait prescrit un plus long cong\u00e9 et que s'il a jug\u00e9 qu'une journ\u00e9e \u00e9tait suffisante c'est parce qu'il consid\u00e9rait la d\u00e9pression, s'il y avait d\u00e9pression, comme \u00e9tant mineure.\n[221] D'ailleurs, les diagnostics du docteur Payne doivent \u00eatre pris avec une certaine r\u00e9serve sur le plan factuel. De son propre aveu, les examens du plaignant \u00e0 la Polyclinique devaient \u00eatre faits assez rapidement puisque de nombreux patients attendaient; la Polyclinique traite une quantit\u00e9 industrielle de dossier de la CSST, selon l'expression utilis\u00e9e par le docteur Payne. Aucune des rencontres avec le plaignant n'a d\u00e9pass\u00e9 10 \u00e0 15 minutes, certaines ne dureront que 2 \u00e0 5 minutes et un rapport m\u00e9dical sera \u00e9mis sans examen. Le docteur Payne admet que certains commentaires dans ses diagnostics lui \u00e9taient sugg\u00e9r\u00e9s par le plaignant notamment en ce qui concerne la limitation hors des deux plans , la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un article de la convention collective et la limitation quant \u00e0 l'horaire de nuit. Je constate \u00e9galement qu'une annotation qui appara\u00eet sur les copies du rapport m\u00e9dical du 6 octobre 1998, de l'employeur et de l'employ\u00e9 mais qui n'appara\u00eet par sur celle du m\u00e9decin demeure inexpliqu\u00e9e. Sur d'autres rapports m\u00e9dicaux, il reconna\u00eetra avoir commis certaines erreurs. Finalement, il admettra que le probl\u00e8me du plaignant est surtout administratif et un peu m\u00e9dical .\n[222] J'en conclus qu'\u00e0 l'automne de 1998, il n'y avait aucune preuve que le plaignant avait des sympt\u00f4mes d'un trouble d'adaptation avec humeur anxio-d\u00e9pressive ou autre symptomatologie psychiatrique et donc qu'il n'y a avait pas de d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi.\n[223] Examinons n\u00e9anmoins la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et qui expliquerait les causes de la condition all\u00e9gu\u00e9e du plaignant, si jamais ma conclusion concernant les sympt\u00f4mes s'av\u00e9rait inexacte. Les causes d'un trouble d'adaptation avec humeur anxio-d\u00e9pressive peuvent \u00eatre multiples.25 Les t\u00e9moins experts ont tous t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effet que pour d\u00e9clencher un trouble d'adaptation il faut la pr\u00e9sence d'un agent stresseur.\n[224] Le docteur Cournoyer a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effet que le lieu de travail du plaignant ne peut \u00eatre retenu comme agent stresseur. Le docteur Gu\u00e9rin abonde dans le m\u00eame sens en indiquant que le genre d'endroit o\u00f9 travaille le plaignant ne peut pas \u00e0 lui seul cr\u00e9er une pathologie comme celle all\u00e9gu\u00e9e ici.\n[225] Ce que le docteur Cournoyer retient comme agent stresseur, c'est un conflit de travail. Toutefois, \u00e0 la lecture de l'histoire du conflit, telle que relat\u00e9e par le docteur Cournoyer dans son rapport, force nous est de constater qu'il a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d'une version des faits qui, sur plusieurs points, est divergente de celle qu'a entendue le Tribunal. Dans ce cas c'est soit le docteur Cournoyer qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 induit en erreur ou le Tribunal.\n[226] Le docteur Cournoyer, de bonne foi, a construit son opinion m\u00e9dicale sur ces faits. Il \u00e9tait convaincu, entre autres, que lorsque le plaignant a quitt\u00e9 son poste le 15 septembre 1998, qu'il \u00e9tait entour\u00e9 de superviseurs qui le harcelaient et le surveillaient. Pourtant la preuve, non contredite \u00e0 l'audience, a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'avant le 15 septembre, R\u00e9al Caron ne connaissait pas le plaignant et qu'il n'avait pas eu \u00e0 travailler avec lui. De plus, aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e relatant des \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e0 partir du 14 septembre 1998, qui me permettrait d'arriver aux m\u00eames conclusions que le docteur Cournoyer \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[227] De plus, le plaignant n'a pas expliqu\u00e9 au docteur Cournoyer pourquoi le 14 septembre 1998, il devait se rapporter \u00e0 l'ETL, sur l'horaire de soir, et non \u00e0 l'ETV, laissant l'impression que l'employeur le traitait arbitrairement alors que les faits montrent que son affectation temporaire \u00e0 l'ETV \u00e9tait termin\u00e9e.\n[228] Le plaignant n'a pas cru bon, non plus, d'informer le docteur Cournoyer de l'existence \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al d'un deuxi\u00e8me plan comme celui \u00e0 Ville St-Laurent. Lorsque inform\u00e9 de cette situation \u00e0 l'audience, le docteur Cournoyer reconna\u00eet que le plaignant aurait pu travailler dans cet autre plan car il n'y a aucune raison de croire que le conflit avec les superviseurs du plan \u00e0 Ville St-Laurent - l'agent stresseur - se transposerait dans cet autre plan .\n[229] Le docteur Gamache qui, pour sa part, affirme ne trouver aucun des sympt\u00f4mes de trouble d'adaptation dans les rapports m\u00e9dicaux du docteur Payne, dit s'\u00eatre fi\u00e9, pour son examen, sur les faits tels que relat\u00e9s par le plaignant et il conclut que l'agent stresseur est un probl\u00e8me de relation de travail. Dans son rapport il note que les probl\u00e8mes auraient d\u00e9but\u00e9 le 14 septembre 1998, lorsque l'intim\u00e9e aurait demand\u00e9 au plaignant de retourner au travail dans les plans m\u00e9canis\u00e9s comme commis aux lettres. Encore, une fois le plaignant n'explique pas les circonstances qui entourent cette situation telles qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 relat\u00e9es au Tribunal. Ensuite, le docteur Gamache reprend des exemples que le plaignant lui aurait donn\u00e9s de situations qui \u00e0 partir de cette date montrent que l'employeur exer\u00e7ait sur lui des moyens de pression. Aucun de ces exemples, \u00e0 l'exception d'un, ne fut repris \u00e0 l'audience. D'ailleurs, la preuve retenue montre qu'aucun de ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements, \u00e0 l'exception d'un, ne peut s'\u00eatre produit apr\u00e8s le 14 septembre 1998. Un seul, le dernier \u00e9v\u00e9nement que le docteur Gamache mentionne, s'est produit apr\u00e8s le 14 septembre 1998 : On lui aurait m\u00eame dit et, me mentionne-t-il, preuve \u00e0 l'appui, que son superviseur lui aurait mentionn\u00e9 que s'il ne faisait pas cela comme \u00e7a (son travail), on va le crisser dehors . R\u00e9al Caron n'a pas ni\u00e9 avoir utilis\u00e9 les mots on va le crisser dehors , mais il affirme avoir dit cela \u00e0 Ren\u00e9e D'Amours, le 7 octobre 1998, soit la soir\u00e9e o\u00f9 il cherchait \u00e0 rencontrer le plaignant pour discuter du rapport m\u00e9dical que l'employeur venait de recevoir. D'ailleurs, nous nous souviendrons que Gagnon, le repr\u00e9sentant syndical, avait entendu ces propos qu'il a not\u00e9, chose surprenante, \u00e0 la fin de son compte rendu de la r\u00e9union du 1er d\u00e9cembre 1998. Quoiqu'il en soit, ces propos n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9s directement au plaignant qui d'ailleurs n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent lors la rencontre du 7 octobre.\n[230] Ainsi, pour le docteur Gamache, les probl\u00e8mes ont d\u00e9but\u00e9 le 14 septembre et c'est sur les faits tels que relat\u00e9s par le plaignant qu'il a, de bonne foi, pr\u00e9par\u00e9 son rapport m\u00e9dical.\n[231] Les docteurs Payne, Cournoyer et Gamache \u00e9taient donc tous sous l'impression qu'en septembre 1998, il y avait entre le plaignant et son superviseur ou des superviseurs un conflit de travail lequel \u00e9tait l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement - l'agent stresseur - qui justifie un diagnostic de trouble d'adaptation avec humeur anxio-d\u00e9pressive.\n[232] Le plaignant t\u00e9moigne lui-m\u00eame que ses probl\u00e8mes ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ETL, St-Laurent, le 14 septembre 1998. Pourtant dans une lettre \u00e0 France Villeneuve de la CSST, le 9 d\u00e9cembre 1998, o\u00f9 il dit relater les faits d\u00e9taill\u00e9s de ce qui l'a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 faire une d\u00e9pression situationnelle, il n'y a aucun fait significatif pour la p\u00e9riode entre le 15 septembre et le 1er octobre et certainement aucun fait montrant l'existence d'un conflit avec son ou ses superviseurs \u00e0 l'ETL. D'ailleurs, les noms de R\u00e9al Caron, son surintendant, et de Ren\u00e9e D'Amours, sa superviseure, n'apparaissent nulle part pendant cette p\u00e9riode.\n[233] Face \u00e0 la preuve qui m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, je dois retenir que l'agent stresseur all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ou la cause all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de la pathologie est un conflit de travail \u00e0 l'ETL, St-Laurent. Toutefois, sur l'existence de ce conflit de travail, je ne dispose d'aucune preuve qui me permette de conclure si ce conflit de travail est r\u00e9el ou uniquement une perception. La preuve ne me permet pas de conclure \u00e0 l'existence de l'agent stresseur all\u00e9gu\u00e9 pour justifier \u00e9ventuellement un stress psychologique et donc une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi.\n[234] Je suis convaincu que le plaignant \u00e9tait malheureux dans un travail qu'il n'aimait pas et qu'il trouvait d\u00e9shonorant , selon sa propre expression. Le plan est pour lui une source de frustration et d'insatisfaction sur le plan professionnel. Toutefois, cela ne justifie aucunement une conclusion qu'il existe en l'esp\u00e8ce une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi.\nVI. DISPOSITION [235] En raison de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, la plainte de Michel Beauregard sous l'article 7 de la Loi est rejett\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 28 janvier 2004.\nTRIBUNAL CANADIEN DES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE\nPARTIES INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL : T761\/1103\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE : Michel Beauregard c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes\nDATES ET LIEU Montr\u00e9al (Qu\u00e9bec)\nDE L'AUDIENCE : (les 3 au 5 septembre 2003,\nles 22 au 26 septembre 2003)\nDATE DE LA D\u00c9CISION\nDU TRIBUNAL : le 28 janvier 2004\nONT COMPARU :\nMichel Beauregard En son propre nom\nM e C\u00e9line Harrington Pour la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne\nM e Marc Santerre Pour l'intim\u00e9e\nM e Richard Pageau\n1 L'\u00e9tablissement de St-Laurent se divise physiquement en trois sections : la section administrative, le d\u00e9p\u00f4t ouest, qui est un d\u00e9p\u00f4t de facteurs, et \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de l'\u00e9tablissement une autre section \u00e0 deux vocations, l'une pour le traitement des lettres (ETL) et l'autre pour le traitement des colis (ETV, aujourd'hui connue comme l'ETC).\n1L'ETL est organis\u00e9 en plusieurs secteurs de travail : le secteur manuel, le secteur m\u00e9canis\u00e9, la section des exp\u00e9diteurs et la section de l'international. \u00c0 l'ETV, il y a la section m\u00e9diaposte , la section r\u00e9ception et distribution et la section surdimensionn\u00e9e . Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 du colis, il y a \u00e9galement une section qui s'appelle messagerie prioritaire qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e en 1997.\n1L'ETV et l'ETL sont physiquement s\u00e9par\u00e9s par un mur de ciment dans lequel il y a environ cinq portes. En terme de dimension, l'ETL fait environ 500 pieds par 672 pieds et l'ETV, 800 pieds par 672. Dans l'ETV, il y a des convoyeurs et une trieuse de colis. Le bruit y serait plus fort. \u00c0 l'ETL, il y a \u00e9galement de la m\u00e9canisation mais elle est diff\u00e9rente de l'ETV.\n1Sur le plan de l'organisation du travail, les employ\u00e9s de l'ETL s'occupent du courrier qui est ramass\u00e9 dans les bo\u00eetes aux lettres et de celui qui est d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement m\u00eame. Les employ\u00e9s s'occupent essentiellement de la pr\u00e9paration du courrier et de son traitement pour la livraison. Certains employ\u00e9s font le traitement manuel des lettres; d'autres, les codeurs, ont une formation pour faire le traitement du courrier \u00e0 partir de machines. Il y a \u00e9galement des appareils \u00e0 lecteur optique \u00e0 caract\u00e8re multiligne ou machines de tri de codes \u00e0 barres qui acc\u00e9l\u00e8rent le traitement du courrier.\n1Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'\u00e9tablissement traitement en vrac ou colis (ETV), des remorqueuses transportent les colis, lesquels sont ensuite trait\u00e9s pour l'exp\u00e9dition. Le travail y est moins m\u00e9canis\u00e9. Les employ\u00e9s travaillent plus physiquement. Il y a \u00e9galement des commis dans le secteur des colis surdimensionn\u00e9s, lesquels traitent les colis hors normes. Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 des quais, les exp\u00e9diteurs font le chargement et le d\u00e9chargement des remorqueuses.\n1\u00c0 l'ETV et \u00e0 l'ETL, le travail est organis\u00e9 sur trois quarts : l'horaire de jour de 7 h 30 \u00e0 15 h 30; l'horaire du soir de 15 h 30 \u00e0 23 h 30 et l'horaire de nuit de 23 h30 \u00e0 7 h 30. Sur le quart du soir il y a entre 125 \u00e0 150 employ\u00e9s. Chaque quart de travail a ses surintendants. Il y a \u00e9galement des superviseurs qui rel\u00e8vent des surintendants. Les surintendants et les superviseurs sont attitr\u00e9s soit \u00e0 l'ETL ou soit \u00e0 l'ETV. En haut des surintendants, sur le plan hi\u00e9rarchique, se trouve les gestionnaires : deux \u00e0 l'ETL et deux \u00e0 l'ETV. Au haut de la hi\u00e9rarchie se trouve le directeur.\n2 Dans le cas d'une lettre par poste prioritaire avec signature, le facteur doit aller au domicile du destinataire et obtenir sa signature avant de lui remettre la lettre. Si le destinataire n'est pas \u00e0 son domicile, une carte lui indiquant o\u00f9 il peut r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer la lettre est laiss\u00e9e dans sa bo\u00eete aux lettres.\n3 Dans le bordereau d'objets livr\u00e9s de Poste-Canada, il est indiqu\u00e9 que Beauregard a pris livraison de cette lettre, le 29 octobre et non le 28. Beauregard affirme que la date sur le bordereau est inexacte. Pourtant Danielle Billod, la pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e au comptoir de Postes Canada, au d\u00e9panneur Bachir \u00e0 Anjou, o\u00f9 Beauregard allait r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer son courrier, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effet qu'il insistait pour qu'elle remplisse le document devant lui afin qu'il puisse s'assurer qu'il n'y ait pas d'erreur. Lorsqu'il est all\u00e9 chercher cette lettre au comptoir postal, le plaignant affirme ne pas se souvenir s'il y avait l\u00e0 une autre lettre pour lui. Madame Billod affirme pour sa part que lorsqu'il passait chercher son courrier, le plaignant ne prenait pas n\u00e9cessairement tout le courrier qui lui \u00e9tait adress\u00e9; il se contentait de prendre l'information et disait qu'il repasserait plus tard. Il arrivait parfois qu'il prenne certaines enveloppes et en laisse d'autres.\n4 En ce qui concerne les moyens que pouvaient utiliser l'employeur pour le contacter, Beauregard t\u00e9moigne qu'il ne voulait pas qu'on appelle chez-lui car ce num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone appartient \u00e0 son p\u00e8re et que celui-ci n'aime pas recevoir des appels. De plus, il ajoute utiliser son cellulaire pour ses appels personnels mais ne pas avoir autoris\u00e9 l'employeur \u00e0 le contacter \u00e0 ce num\u00e9ro. Il ajoute que si l'employeur veut le rejoindre, il doit le faire par \u00e9crit. Selon lui, la meilleure mani\u00e8re de communiquer avec lui c'est par poste prioritaire sans signature. Dans ce cas, la lettre sera livr\u00e9e le lendemain dans la bo\u00eete aux lettres \u00e0 son domicile.\n5 Toutefois selon le syst\u00e8me de pistage et rep\u00e9rage - messageries prioritaires de Postes Canada, cette lettre aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9e le 26 octobre 1998.\n6 Le t\u00e9moignage de Beauregard quant au nombre de demandes de mutation qu'il aurait pr\u00e9par\u00e9es est pour le moins vague. \u00c0 un endroit, il affirme qu'il pouvait faire, bon an mal an, de 20 \u00e0 40 demandes de mutation par ann\u00e9e. En contre-interrogatoire il dira qu'il ne sait plus si c'est lui ou le docteur Cournoyer qui a parl\u00e9 de 240 demandes de mutation. Il affirme qu'il n'avait pas avec lui ses demandes de mutation lors de cette rencontre mais uniquement un formulaire vide, \u00e0 titre d'exemple. Un peu plus loin il dira qu'il a rempli ces demandes dans l'intervalle d'une quarantaine de demandes par semaine, donc dans 6 semaines; \u00e0 un autre endroit, il parle de 40 demandes par jour, donc dans 6 jours. Si l'on regarde le nombre impressionnant de demandes de mutation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve lors de l'audience, toutes ces demandes sont dat\u00e9es du 16 mai 1997.\n7 Aucune preuve de cette rencontre ne fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience autre que la conclusion de Beauregard selon laquelle madame Daigle est arriv\u00e9e au m\u00eame diagnostic que le docteur Payne, \u00e0 savoir qu'il devrait y avoir un changement d'endroit de travail.\n8 54.02 R\u00e9int\u00e9gration \u00e0 la main-d'uvre active des employ\u00e9s des groupes 1, 3, 4, et 5.Lorsqu'une employ\u00e9e ou un employ\u00e9 est atteint d'une incapacit\u00e9 physique en raison\n8a) d'un accident du travail donnant droit \u00e0 un indemnisation; ou\n8b) de probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 ne donnant pas droit \u00e0 indemnisation, et que le besoin d'une affectation s'appuie sur un certificat d\u00e9livr\u00e9 par une ou un m\u00e9decin qualifi\u00e9, elle ou il pourra, sur demande \u00e9crite, \u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 n'importe quel poste vacant de son groupe. Lorsqu'un tel poste vacant est vis\u00e9 par les dispositions de l'article 43, la premi\u00e8re affectation ne se fera que pour la p\u00e9riode n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la mise en application de cet article. Toutefois, si l'employ\u00e9e ou l'employ\u00e9 accepte une nomination dans la classe d'emplois assign\u00e9e, elle ou il appartient \u00e0 la classe d'emplois assign\u00e9e et les r\u00e8gles normales d'anciennet\u00e9 sont applicables.\n9 Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses des postes c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (grief de Beauregard, STTP 350-95-18617, Blouin, arbitre), [2001] D.A.T.C. no. 645.\n10 Le 29 d\u00e9cembre 1998, la CSST l'informe qu'elle ne peut accepter sa r\u00e9clamation puisqu'il ne s'agit pas d'un accident de travail. Selon la CSST, le dossier ne permet pas de conclure \u00e0 l'existence d'un \u00e9v\u00e9nement impr\u00e9vu et soudain. En cons\u00e9quence, aucune indemnit\u00e9 ne sera vers\u00e9e. Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 10 mars 1999, France Villeneuve de la CSST affirme que le diagnostic retenu est un trouble de l'adaptation avec \u00e0 la fois anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et humeur d\u00e9pressive, code 309.21 . Selon la CSST, cette l\u00e9sion n'a pas entra\u00een\u00e9 d'atteinte permanente. Un peu plus loin, elle conclut que, compte tenu de la date de consolidation de la l\u00e9sion et de l'absence de limitations fonctionnelles, Beauregard est capable d'exercer son emploi.\n11 Les mesures disciplinaires prises par l'intim\u00e9e contre Beauregard ainsi que son cong\u00e9diement feront l'objet de deux d\u00e9cisions arbitrales. Dans une premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision rendue le 21 juillet 2000, (Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses des postes c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (grief de Beauregard, STTP 350-95-18617, Blouin, arbitre), [2000] D.A.T.C. no. 467), l'arbitre du grief R. Blouin, d\u00e9cide que le cong\u00e9diement et les mesures disciplinaires prises contre lui sont injustifi\u00e9s. Il ordonne sa r\u00e9int\u00e9gration et la radiation de son dossier des lettres disciplinaires. L'arbitre r\u00e9serve toutefois sa comp\u00e9tence sur les difficult\u00e9s pouvant r\u00e9sulter de l'ex\u00e9cution de sa d\u00e9cision. Dans une deuxi\u00e8me d\u00e9cision en date du 7 septembre 2001 (Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses des postes c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (grief de Beauregard,STTP 350-95-18617, Blouin, arbitre), [2001] D.A.T.C. no. 645), qui traitait de la demande de red\u00e9ploiement et de la question des quantum de dommages, l'arbitre d\u00e9cide, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question, que l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment stresseur est un conflit de travail au plan m\u00e9canis\u00e9 et qu'il pourrait s'agir d'un conflit de personnalit\u00e9. Il ajoute ne disposer d'aucune preuve sur l'existence d'un conflit de travail. Il constate qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question que Beauregard se sentait surveill\u00e9, \u00e9pi\u00e9, mais il d\u00e9clare qu'il n'y a pas de preuve destin\u00e9e \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier s'il s'agit de perceptions ou de r\u00e9alit\u00e9s. En somme, il conclut que la preuve ne lui permet pas de conclure \u00e0 l'existence de l'agent stresseur all\u00e9gu\u00e9 pour justifier \u00e9ventuellement un stress psychologique. La demande de red\u00e9ploiement sous l'article 54 n'est donc pas justifi\u00e9e. La demande en quantum de dommages est \u00e9galement intimement li\u00e9e \u00e0 la question du red\u00e9ploiement et puisque celle-ci n'est pas justifi\u00e9e l'arbitre conclut que Beauregard ne peut fonder une r\u00e9clamation mon\u00e9taire sur celle-ci. De plus, puisque l'employeur l'a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 en absence maladie sans salaire et puisqu'il n'avait plus de cr\u00e9dits de maladie, il ne peut \u00e9galement recouvrer sous ce chef.\n12 L'attestation m\u00e9dicale initiale est un document de la CSST pr\u00e9par\u00e9 en cinq copies. Les copies 1 et 2 vont \u00e0 la CSST, la copie 3 est la copie du m\u00e9decin, la copie 4 celle du travailleur et la copie 5 va \u00e0 l'employeur. C'est le travailleur qui doit remettre la copie cinq \u00e0 l'employeur.\n13 Le docteur Payne lui prescrit lors de cette visite du Flonase, un m\u00e9dicament pour les sinus. Le plaignant ne s'est pas object\u00e9 \u00e0 la prescription, mais il ne semble pas qu'il ait pris le m\u00e9dicament, ni qu'il soit all\u00e9 pour le rayon X. Le probl\u00e8me de sinus semble s'\u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9 tout seul.\n14 L.R.Q., c. S-2.1.\n15 En effet, le 28 avril 1998, Beauregard a communiqu\u00e9 par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone avec un certain Monsieur Blanchette, vice-pr\u00e9sident de l'intim\u00e9e, afin de lui faire part de certains griefs.\n16 Il reconna\u00eet que cette constatation est mal formul\u00e9e; il aurait d\u00fb parler plut\u00f4t du formulaire de l'employ\u00e9.\n17 Il ne mentionne pas sa rencontre avec la psychologue.\n18 Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c.

Il pr\u00e9tend que ce refus constitue de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille et que cela contrevient \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi).\n[2] La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) le 30 mars 2002. Le 15 janvier 2004, le Tribunal a accueilli la requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte du plaignant afin d'y ajouter une all\u00e9gation suppl\u00e9mentaire de repr\u00e9sailles en vertu de l'article 14.1 de la Loi. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend qu'il a fait l'objet de nombreuses repr\u00e9sailles de la part de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte.\n[3] Le plaignant s'est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame \u00e0 l'audience. L'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par son avocat. La Commission a choisi de ne pas compara\u00eetre \u00e0 l'audience.\nI. LES FAITS A. Les faits li\u00e9s aux all\u00e9gations faites en vertu de l'article 7 [4] Le plaignant est membre de la Bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle et Stony Point (la Bande). La r\u00e9serve de la Bande est situ\u00e9e au nord-est de Sarnia (Ontario). De nombreux membres de cette collectivit\u00e9 portent les m\u00eames noms de famille malgr\u00e9 qu'il n'y ait qu'un faible lien de parent\u00e9 entre eux, si lien il y a. En l'esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant et le chef, Tom Bressette, portent des noms identiques mais ne sont pas parents.\n[5] Le plaignant est d\u00e9tenteur d'un certificat \u00e9manant du Human Services Foundation Program du Coll\u00e8ge Lambton lequel certificat il a re\u00e7u en 1997. Dans le cadre de sa formation, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler au service d'aide sociale de la Bande pendant environ six mois. Ses fonctions consistaient notamment \u00e0 aider l'administrateur du service d'aide sociale, \u00e0 effectuer du travail cl\u00e9rical et \u00e0 rencontrer les clients du service.\n[6] Apr\u00e8s son certificat, le plaignant a obtenu en avril 2000 un dipl\u00f4me en service social \u00e9manant du m\u00eame coll\u00e8ge. Ce programme pr\u00e9voyait notamment un stage de travail d'\u00e9quipe d'une dur\u00e9e de six mois, lequel fut compl\u00e9t\u00e9 par le plaignant au sein de la Bande. Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au Programme de d\u00e9veloppement familial et communautaire qui est offert au centre de soins de sant\u00e9 de la Bande. Ses t\u00e2ches consistaient notamment \u00e0 faire des observations concernant les clients du centre, \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer leurs dossiers et \u00e0 leur fournir des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences. De plus, il a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un centre de consultation pour les personnes qui ont des probl\u00e8mes d'abus de drogue.\n[7] En octobre 2000, la Bande a embauch\u00e9 le plaignant comme employ\u00e9 occasionnel affect\u00e9 au Programme de services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille. Il a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration de dossiers et \u00e0 l'organisation d'\u00e9v\u00e8nements comme les f\u00eates de No\u00ebl, des repas communautaires et des activit\u00e9s de financement. Il a accompagn\u00e9 le travailleur aupr\u00e8s des jeunes de la Bande lors de visites \u00e0 domicile chez des enfants qui \u00e9taient en garde supervis\u00e9e chez des parents. De plus, il accompagnait occasionnellement les travailleurs du programme lorsqu'ils devaient assister \u00e0 des audiences. Lorsqu'il en avait le temps, le plaignant en profitait pour examiner certains des documents disponibles au bureau concernant la Loi sur les services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille de l'Ontario. Son mandat \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 se terminer \u00e0 la fin de d\u00e9cembre 2000 mais il a \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9 pour deux mois. On ne lui a pas offert un deuxi\u00e8me renouvellement et son emploi a pris fin \u00e0 la fin de f\u00e9vrier 2001.\n[8] En juillet 2001, l'intim\u00e9 a annonc\u00e9 un concours pour un poste \u00e0 temps plein d'intervenant aupr\u00e8s des familles, dans le cadre du Programme de services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille. Les t\u00e2ches de l'emploi comprenaient l'\u00e9laboration d'un plan de service individualis\u00e9 visant \u00e0 aider les enfants et les familles qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient de services de soutien \u00e0 la famille \u00e0 domicile. Le candidat choisi devait \u00eatre familier avec la culture et avec les attitudes des Autochtones ainsi que poss\u00e9der des connaissances et de l'exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dures administratives et de r\u00e9daction de rapport. On exigeait \u00e9galement qu'ils poss\u00e8dent des aptitudes en mati\u00e8re de communication et de relations humaines, en plus d'une compr\u00e9hension de l'ensemble des lois applicables. Le candidat choisi devait d\u00e9tenir un permis de conduire valide et poss\u00e9der un v\u00e9hicule automobile. Tous les candidats devaient fournir une v\u00e9rification d'ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents criminels.\n[9] Le plaignant a envoy\u00e9 sa lettre de candidature pour le poste le 20 juillet 2001. Il \u00e9tait l'un des cinq candidats qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 convoqu\u00e9s peu apr\u00e8s \u00e0 une entrevue men\u00e9e par Laura Wilde (une a\u00een\u00e9e de la Bande), Sharon Henry (la coordonnatrice du Programme de services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille) et Robert Bressette (un membre du conseil de Bande). Les intervieweurs se sont vu remettre un ensemble de questions et de r\u00e9ponses possibles pr\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00e0 l'avance. Les candidats se sont fait demander d'\u00e9laborer, notamment, sur leur degr\u00e9 d'implication dans la collectivit\u00e9, sur leur opinion quant au r\u00f4le du Programme de services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans la collectivit\u00e9 et sur l'obligation l\u00e9gale d'un intervenant aupr\u00e8s des familles de d\u00e9noncer la violence faite aux enfants.\n[10] Le plaignant n'a re\u00e7u aucune nouvelle concernant les r\u00e9sultats du concours dans les mois qui ont suivi l'entrevue. En novembre 2001, Stan Sabourin, l'administrateur de la Bande \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, a dit au plaignant que le comit\u00e9 des finances de la Bande ainsi que le conseil de Bande traitaient toujours l'affaire. En f\u00e9vrier 2002, le plaignant a finalement appris qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi. Quelques semaines plus tard, il a appris que Eva Bressette, la sur du chef Tom Bressette, avait obtenu le poste par suite d'une mutation \u00e0 l'interne.\n[11] Eva Bressette travaille pour la bande depuis 1994. Tout r\u00e9cemment, elle travaillait officiellement comme repr\u00e9sentante de la bande. Ses fonctions consistaient \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la bande devant les tribunaux dans les instances relatives au bien-\u00eatre des enfants. Son bureau \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9difice des Services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille o\u00f9 le plaignant avait \u00e9galement travaill\u00e9 comme employ\u00e9 occasionnel.\n[12] Le plaignant croyait qu'Eva Bressette ne poss\u00e9dait pas les comp\u00e9tences n\u00e9cessaires pour obtenir le poste. Il a d\u00e9couvert que, par exemple, au moment de sa mutation, le permis de conduire d'Eva Bressette \u00e9tait suspendu et qu'elle ne poss\u00e9dait pas de v\u00e9hicule. Toutefois, selon l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de qualit\u00e9s pour le poste, ces deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e9taient exig\u00e9s.\n[13] Le plaignant soup\u00e7onnait qu'Eva Bressette avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e parce qu'elle \u00e9tait la sur du chef, ce qui l'a incit\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9poser la plainte dont le Tribunal est pr\u00e9sentement saisi. Il semble que lorsque le plaignant a sign\u00e9 sa plainte, il croyait qu'Eva Bressette avait particip\u00e9 au m\u00eame concours. Toutefois, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que ce n'\u00e9tait pas le cas - elle n'avait pas postul\u00e9 pour le poste affich\u00e9 dans ce concours.\n[14] Sur les personnes qui ont postul\u00e9, cinq ont \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9es pour l'\u00e9tape de l'entrevue, le plaignant notamment. Le jury de l'entrevue a finalement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de recommander Deborah Herman comme son premier choix au conseil de Bande et Dorothy French comme second choix. Aucune des deux candidates n'\u00e9tait parente avec le chef Bressette ni avec aucun des membres du jury de l'entrevue. Toutefois, lorsque la recommandation du jury a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e un peu plus tard au conseil de Bande, celle-ci fut rejet\u00e9e. Le conseil de Bande a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que ni M>me Herman, ni M>me French ne poss\u00e9dait les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents et les qualifications n\u00e9cessaires pour le poste d'intervenant aupr\u00e8s des familles. Par cons\u00e9quent, le poste est demeur\u00e9 vacant.\n[15] Au cours de la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode, le comit\u00e9 des finances de la Bande a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 qu'un certain nombre de probl\u00e8mes s\u00e9rieux quant aux finances de la Bande \u00e9taient apparus. La Bande \u00e9tait confront\u00e9e \u00e0 un d\u00e9ficit accumul\u00e9 plut\u00f4t important accompagn\u00e9 d'une diminution importante de son flux de tr\u00e9sorerie. Le comit\u00e9 des finances a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9laborer une strat\u00e9gie de r\u00e9duction du d\u00e9ficit qui \u00e9liminerait du m\u00eame coup le probl\u00e8me de flux de tr\u00e9sorerie. C'est dans ce contexte de redressement des finances que M. Sabourin a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de muter les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 l'interne afin de maximiser l'utilisation de cr\u00e9dits gouvernementaux disponibles.\n[16] Il avait fait remarquer que le financement pour le poste de repr\u00e9sentant de la Bande provenait du Minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien et qu'il \u00e9tait verser \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour une charge de travail pouvant aller jusqu'\u00e0 20 heures par semaine. Eva Bressette travaillait en fait plus que 20 heures. Outre ses fonctions de repr\u00e9sentante de la Bande, lesquelles demandaient plus que 20 heures de travail par semaine, elle a effectu\u00e9 de nombreuses t\u00e2ches au sein des Services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille, notamment de nombreuses t\u00e2ches qui \u00e9taient normalement effectu\u00e9es par un intervenant aupr\u00e8s des familles et elle \u00e9tait r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9e pour ces t\u00e2ches \u00e0 m\u00eame les fonds d'administration. La Bande a de plus retenu les services \u00e0 l'interne \u00e0 temps plein d'un avocat-conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, Jonathon George. Celui-ci \u00e9tait \u00e9galement r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 m\u00eame les fonds d'administration de la Bande. Cependant, le financement provenant du gouvernement de l'Ontario pour le poste d'intervenant aupr\u00e8s des familles \u00e9tait demeur\u00e9 intact \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le poste n'avait toujours pas \u00e9t\u00e9 combl\u00e9.\n[17] D'ordinaire, M. George et Eva Bressette assistaient tous les deux \u00e0 toutes les instances qui avaient trait aux Services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille, chacun en sa qualit\u00e9 respective, c'est-\u00e0 dire avocat de la Bande et repr\u00e9sentante de la Bande. M. Sabourin a propos\u00e9 que M. George assume les deux fonctions. Une partie du salaire de M. George comme avocat-conseil interne serait d\u00e9sormais pay\u00e9 \u00e0 m\u00eame le cr\u00e9dit gouvernemental affect\u00e9 au poste de repr\u00e9sentant de la Bande. Eva Bressette, elle, serait mut\u00e9e \u00e0 l'interne au poste vacant d'intervenante aupr\u00e8s des familles. De cette mani\u00e8re, son salaire complet \u00e0 temps plein serait pay\u00e9 \u00e0 m\u00eame le r\u00e9gime de financement provincial. Son travail comprendrait plusieurs des fonctions qu'elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es et pour lesquelles elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement pay\u00e9e \u00e0 m\u00eame les propres fonds de la Bande ainsi que les t\u00e2ches suppl\u00e9mentaires li\u00e9es au poste officiel d'intervenant aupr\u00e8s des familles. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Bande pourrait conserver les services d'un avocat-conseil interne et d'un repr\u00e9sentant de la Bande tout en obtenant les services d'un intervenant aupr\u00e8s des familles, et ce, tout en diminuant l'ensemble des d\u00e9penses \u00e0 m\u00eame ses fonds g\u00e9n\u00e9raux.\n[18] Le comit\u00e9 des finances de la Bande a souscrit \u00e0 la recommandation lorsque l'affaire lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise lors d'une r\u00e9union tenue le 6 f\u00e9vrier 2002. Le plaignant a soulev\u00e9 certaines inqui\u00e9tudes \u00e0 l'audience quant \u00e0 cette r\u00e9union du comit\u00e9 des finances. Le chef Bressette n'est pas officiellement membre de ce comit\u00e9. Toutefois, le proc\u00e8s-verbal fait \u00e9tat de son arriv\u00e9e juste apr\u00e8s que la r\u00e9union fut ouverte et que l'ordre du jour fut approuv\u00e9. Il y est consign\u00e9 que le chef Bressette a fourni au comit\u00e9 une mise \u00e0 jour sur de nombreux sujets. Il n'y ait fait aucune mention particuli\u00e8re qu'il aurait quitt\u00e9 la s\u00e9ance avant que la question de la mutation interne de sa sur ne soit abord\u00e9e plus tard ce soir-l\u00e0. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que le chef est demeur\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent et a influenc\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision prise par le comit\u00e9. Il a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 que le comit\u00e9 n'avait peut-\u00eatre pas atteint le quorum lorsque la d\u00e9cision concernant le poste d'intervenant aupr\u00e8s des familles a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise.\n[19] La recommandation du comit\u00e9 des finances a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise au conseil de Bande le 21 mars 2002. Le conseil de Bande a approuv\u00e9 la mutation, prenant effet le m\u00eame jour, le proc\u00e8s-verbal faisant \u00e9tat que le poste avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu au budget . Le chef Bressette n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 cette s\u00e9ance car il \u00e9tait en voyage d'affaires . En conformit\u00e9 avec la d\u00e9cision de la Bande, Eva Bressette a assum\u00e9 les fonctions d'intervenante aupr\u00e8s des familles et Jonathon George a pris la rel\u00e8ve comme repr\u00e9sentant de la Bande.\nB. Les faits ayant trait \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles (article 14.1 de la Loi) [20] Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne le 30 mars 2002. En juin de cette m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lu membre du conseil de Bande. Il pr\u00e9tend que depuis son \u00e9lection, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris \u00e0 partie et a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente par le conseil de Bande, notamment par le chef Bressette, en repr\u00e9sailles pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[21] Le 8 juillet 2002, le conseil de Bande a tenu sa premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9lection. Les conseillers ont d\u00fb pr\u00eater un serment de confidentialit\u00e9 en vertu duquel ils se sont engag\u00e9s \u00e0 ne r\u00e9v\u00e9ler aucun renseignement obtenu en raison de leurs t\u00e2ches officielles. Le plaignant a refus\u00e9 de pr\u00eater le serment car il a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il d\u00e9sirait examiner les conditions et les implications rattach\u00e9s au serment avant de le pr\u00eater. Il a \u00e9ventuellement pr\u00eat\u00e9 le serment un mois plus tard. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que son refus initial a provoqu\u00e9 une r\u00e9action n\u00e9gative de la part du chef lors de la r\u00e9union. En critiquant le plaignant, le chef Bressette lui a adress\u00e9 des reproches pour avoir intent\u00e9 une poursuite contre sa soeur, Eva Bressette. Une dispute en public s'en est suivie jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le chef d\u00e9cide de demander le huis clos, durant lequel il a continu\u00e9 d'accuser la plaignant d' attirer des poursuites contre la Bande. Il est important de mentionner ici que, d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, une plainte avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par l'\u00e9pouse du plaignant contre la Bande en vertu du Code canadien du travail en rapport avec son emploi d'enseignante \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole de la Bande. \u00c0 partir du milieu de l'ann\u00e9e 2001, le plaignant a envoy\u00e9 de nombreuses lettres de plainte au conseil de Bande concernant les all\u00e9gations de son \u00e9pouse et il a distribu\u00e9 de nombreux avis dans la collectivit\u00e9 dans lesquels il critiquait la bande quant \u00e0 cette affaire.\n[22] Le plaignant conteste la critique qu'on lui a adress\u00e9 quant \u00e0 son refus initial de pr\u00eater le serment de confidentialit\u00e9. Un autre membre du conseil de Bande, Ron George, n'avait pas encore pr\u00eat\u00e9 son serment au moment o\u00f9 il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, en avril 2004. M. George a expliqu\u00e9 que ses nombreux voyages d'affaires avaient eu comme cons\u00e9quence qu'il \u00e9tait toujours absent lorsque le juge de paix \u00e9tait disponible pour faire pr\u00eater le serment. N\u00e9anmoins, il est reconnu que M. George n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 critiqu\u00e9 pour ne pas avoir pr\u00eat\u00e9 le serment et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 participer aux s\u00e9ances \u00e0 huis clos des r\u00e9unions du conseil.\n[23] En septembre 2002, le conseil de Bande a tenu apr\u00e8s les \u00e9lections un atelier d'orientation durant lequel les conseillers ont fait part des comit\u00e9s auxquels ils aimeraient participer. Le plaignant et deux autres conseillers ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 devenir membres du comit\u00e9 des finances et du personnel. Toutefois, lors de la r\u00e9union suivante du conseil de Bande, le nom du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 de la liste et seuls les noms des deux autres personnes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que le retrait a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en repr\u00e9sailles contre son d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre la Bande. Par ailleurs, M>me Lorraine George a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, selon le mandat du comit\u00e9, seuls deux conseillers pouvaient \u00eatre choisis pour si\u00e9ger \u00e0 ce comit\u00e9. Les deux autres personnes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 choisies en raison de leur exp\u00e9rience ant\u00e9rieure au comit\u00e9. M>me George a pr\u00e9tendu dans son t\u00e9moignage que la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne du plaignant contre la Bande n'avait eu aucune incidence sur la d\u00e9cision du conseil.\n[24] Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que, en f\u00e9vrier 2003, on lui a refus\u00e9 sans justification une copie du Rapport Ron Commons , une \u00e9tude demand\u00e9e par le conseil quant aux activit\u00e9s du conseil scolaire de la Bande. Le conseil a pr\u00e9tendu que le plaignant ne pouvait pas consulter le document parce qu'il comprenait des renseignements confidentiels concernant la position de la Bande quant \u00e0 la plainte faite par son \u00e9pouse en vertu du Code canadien du travail. Le plaignant s'est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 cette position en pr\u00e9tendant que, comme il avait \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 pr\u00eat\u00e9 le serment de confidentialit\u00e9, on pouvait lui confier les renseignements figurant dans ce document. Le conseil de Bande a maintenu sa position et le document n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 remis au plaignant.\n[25] Lors de la r\u00e9union du conseil de Bande du 28 juin 2003, on a demand\u00e9 le huis clos afin de discuter de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de personne du plaignant. On a demand\u00e9 au plaignant de se retirer de la r\u00e9union pour des motifs de conflit d'int\u00e9r\u00eats et il a ob\u00e9i. Toutefois, il s'est oppos\u00e9 au fait que le chef Bressette et de nombreux autres parents d'Eva Bressette aient \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 rester. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que sa plainte porte sur la nomination d'Eva Bressette, l'ensemble de ses parents qui si\u00e8gent au conseil de Bande \u00e9taient en situation de conflit d'int\u00e9r\u00eats et on aurait d\u00fb leur demander de quitter la salle comme on le lui avait demand\u00e9.\n[26] Le plaignant invoque une s\u00e9rie d'\u00e9v\u00e8nements, lesquels ont commenc\u00e9 lors de la r\u00e9union du conseil du 24 novembre 2003, comme indices suppl\u00e9mentaires de repr\u00e9sailles dont il aurait fait l'objet. Peu de temps apr\u00e8s que la r\u00e9union fut ouverte, le chef Bressette a soulev\u00e9 une question concernant la confidentialit\u00e9 de certaines proc\u00e9dures du conseil. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que certains renseignements qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis au conseil \u00e0 titre confidentiel avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s, sans que l'on sache comment, \u00e0 des personnes qui n'appartenaient pas au conseil. Il \u00e9tait clair que le chef Bressette sous-entendait que c'\u00e9tait le plaignant qui \u00e9tait la source de la fuite. Le chef a ensuite quitt\u00e9 la salle de r\u00e9union afin de permettre que l'on d\u00e9batte de la question. Dans la discussion qui a suivi, le plaignant s'est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 ce qui est d\u00e9crit dans le proc\u00e8s-verbal comme \u00e9tant un \u00e9change belliqueux avec les autres conseillers, au point que le pr\u00e9sident l'a inform\u00e9 que s'il ne n'arr\u00eatait pas imm\u00e9diatement de se conduire de la sorte, on appellerait la police pour l'escorter hors de la salle. Les choses se sont apparemment calm\u00e9es par la suite et le chef Bressette est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. Le proc\u00e8s-verbal mentionne que, apr\u00e8s d'autres \u00e9changes, toutes les parties ont convenu (notamment le plaignant et le chef Bressette) qu'une enqu\u00eate ind\u00e9pendante, possiblement pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par le juge de paix local, soit entreprise afin d'examiner les accusations.\n[27] Le conseil aurait \u00e9galement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 d'organiser une r\u00e9union sp\u00e9ciale dans les jours qui suivraient afin de discuter de la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle l'enqu\u00eate serait men\u00e9e. Selon Faye Jackson, laquelle a consign\u00e9 le proc\u00e8s-verbal, et Lorraine George, l'administratrice de la Bande, il \u00e9tait clair pour tout le monde que le plaignant et le chef Bressette ne seraient pas invit\u00e9s \u00e0 cette r\u00e9union d'organisation, malgr\u00e9 que le proc\u00e8s-verbal soit silencieux l\u00e0-dessus. Le plaignant nie avoir convenu de ne pas \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent. De toute fa\u00e7on, M>me George a choisi le 26 novembre comme \u00e9tant la date de cette seconde r\u00e9union \u00e0 laquelle M>me Jackson a convi\u00e9 l'ensemble des conseillers, \u00e0 l'exception du plaignant. Le chef a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 et inform\u00e9 de la date de la r\u00e9union mais on lui a dit qu'il ne devait pas y assister. Le plaignant n'a pas re\u00e7u d'appel similaire et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant de la tenue de la r\u00e9union par d'autres sources. Il \u00e9tait furieux de ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 et il s'est malgr\u00e9 tout pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du 26 novembre. Le proc\u00e8s-verbal r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'il [Traduction] est arriv\u00e9 en col\u00e8re parce qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9, mais le conseil de Bande a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 ce stade-l\u00e0 de le laisser assister \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. Le conseil de Bande a plus tard pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des excuses officielles au chef Bressette et au plaignant pour ne pas les avoir pr\u00e9venus qu'ils ne devaient pas y \u00eatre.\n[28] L'une des conclusions tir\u00e9es lors de la r\u00e9union du 26 novembre, selon le proc\u00e8s-verbal, \u00e9tait que le conseil ne tol\u00e8rerait plus d'\u00e9couter les dissensions entre le chef Bressette et le plaignant et que l'on devrait tenter de r\u00e9soudre le conflit. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que le conseil l'a maltrait\u00e9 au cours de ces deux r\u00e9unions de la fin du mois de novembre et que ce mauvais traitement est survenu, du moins en partie, \u00e0 la suite de sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[29] Le 27 novembre, six conseillers ont sign\u00e9 une lettre adress\u00e9e au plaignant l'informant qu'ils d\u00e9sapprouvaient sa conduite et soulignant notamment certains commentaires qu'il avait faits concernant le chef Bressette et un autre membre du conseil lors de la r\u00e9union du 24 novembre.\n[30] Au d\u00e9but de d\u00e9cembre 2003, le conseil de Bande a \u00e9mis un communiqu\u00e9 adress\u00e9 \u00e0 la collectivit\u00e9. Le communiqu\u00e9 avait cens\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une lettre ainsi qu'\u00e0 un circulaire qui avaient r\u00e9cemment \u00e9t\u00e9 distribu\u00e9s dans la collectivit\u00e9 et dans lesquels le conseil \u00e9tait critiqu\u00e9 pour ne pas avoir fait \u00e9tat de deux poursuites en instance contre la Bande, notamment une poursuite intent\u00e9e par le fr\u00e8re du plaignant, Miles Bressette. Le conseil de Bande a expliqu\u00e9 dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l'avis que les d\u00e9tails concernant les deux revendications \u00e9taient gard\u00e9s confidentiels de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne pas nuire \u00e0 la position de la Bande. Toutefois, le document r\u00e9v\u00e9lait \u00e9galement que [Traduction] Maurice Bressette, qui est membre \u00e9lu du conseil et qui est l'auteur d'au moins une des lettres adress\u00e9es \u00e0 la collectivit\u00e9, a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre la Premi\u00e8re nation . L'avis mentionnait de plus que ce fait, conjugu\u00e9 avec l'int\u00e9r\u00eat continu du plaignant dans l'obtention de plus de d\u00e9tails concernant les autres revendications en instance contre la Bande, nuisaient \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 du conseil de s'occuper de ses affaires d'une [Traduction] mani\u00e8re transparente . Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que cette accusation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e en repr\u00e9sailles contre sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[31] Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que d'autres incidents de diff\u00e9rence de traitement et de mesures de repr\u00e9sailles en raison de sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne se sont produits. Lors de la r\u00e9union susmentionn\u00e9e du conseil de Bande du 24 novembre, une motion a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e pour nommer le plaignant ainsi que Peter B. Cloud d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e0 l'assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale annuelle du Southern First Nations Secretariat qui allait se tenir quelques jours plus tard \u00e0 London (Ontario). Cependant, dans une lettre de confirmation envoy\u00e9e au Secretariat par l'adjointe ex\u00e9cutive, Faye Jackson, le plaignant n'\u00e9tait pas mentionn\u00e9 comme repr\u00e9sentant \u00e0 l'assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, son nom ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9 par celui d'un autre conseiller. M>me Jackson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que bien qu'elle ne se souvenait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle ce changement s'\u00e9tait produit, d'ordinaire les r\u00e9solutions du conseil ne pouvaient \u00eatre modifi\u00e9es que de deux mani\u00e8res : par une r\u00e9solution subs\u00e9quente, ce qui ne s'est pas produit en l'esp\u00e8ce, ou \u00e0 la suite d'une directive expresse de la part du chef.\n[32] Le 11 mars 2004, le conseil de Bande a tenu une r\u00e9union sp\u00e9ciale d' \u00e9tude afin de traiter de certains commentaires faits aux m\u00e9dias par un conseiller concernant une question importante touchant la collectivit\u00e9. Il semble que l'ensemble des membres du conseil furent invit\u00e9s \u00e0 cette r\u00e9union, \u00e0 l'exception de deux, - Ron George et le plaignant. M>me Jackson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle aurait appel\u00e9 M. George mais ne l'avait pas fait parce qu'elle savait qu'il \u00e9tait en voyage d'affaires. Par cons\u00e9quent, seul le plaignant n'avait pas express\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9. Il pr\u00e9tend qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau pris \u00e0 partie parce qu'il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre la Bande. Pour sa part, M>me Jackson a expliqu\u00e9 que c'est elle seule qui avait pris la d\u00e9cision de ne pas appeler le plaignant. Le chef Bressette lui avait tout simplement donn\u00e9 instruction de pr\u00e9venir tous les membres de longue date du conseil de la tenue de cette r\u00e9union. Comme le plaignant en \u00e9tait \u00e0 son premier mandat comme conseiller, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lu pour la premi\u00e8re fois en 2002, elle ne l'avait pas inclus dans cette liste. Toutefois, un autre conseiller, Maynard (Sam) D. George, qui n'\u00e9tait pas non plus membre si\u00e9geant au conseil lorsqu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lu en 2002, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9. M>me Jackson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que ce qui diff\u00e9renciait M. George du plaignant \u00e9tait qu'il avait si\u00e9g\u00e9 au conseil dans un mandat ant\u00e9rieur et, de ce fait, elle l'avait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant un membre de longue date .\nII. LE CADRE JURIDIQUE [33] Au sens de l'article 7, constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de refuser d'employer un individu. Pour l'application de la Loi, la situation de famille d'un individu constitue un motif de distinction illicite (article 3). Constitue \u00e9galement un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte, d'exercer ou de menacer d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant (article 14.1).\n[34] Il incombe au plaignant d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination - en d'autres mots, une preuve \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue. Selon l'arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, Ontario (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne) c. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, paragraphe 28, dans ce contexte, la preuve suffisante jusqu'\u00e0 preuve contraire est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9. Une fois que la preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, le fardeau de la preuve se d\u00e9place alors sur l'intim\u00e9 qui doit fournir une explication raisonnable quant au comportement discriminatoire. Si une explication raisonnable est donn\u00e9e, il incombe au plaignant de d\u00e9monter que l'explication n'est qu'un pr\u00e9texte de discrimination (voir Basi c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (no 1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029, paragraphe 38474 (T.C.D.P.); Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204, paragraphes 17 \u00e0 23).\n[35] La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a soulign\u00e9, dans Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12, paragraphe 7, qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires soient le seul motif des actes reproch\u00e9s pour que la plainte soit jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e. Il suffit que la discrimination ait \u00e9t\u00e9 l'un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ont motiv\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de l'employeur.\n[36] En mati\u00e8re d'emploi, deux crit\u00e8res ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis pour aider un tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie (voir Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2003 CF 1156). Le premier crit\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 articul\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Shakes c. Rex Pak Ltd., (1981), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001, paragraphe 8918 (commission d'enqu\u00eate de l'Ontario). La commission d'enqu\u00eate de l'Ontario a conclu qu'une preuve prima facie pouvait \u00eatre \u00e9tablie en prouvant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\nle plaignant avait les comp\u00e9tences requises pour l'emploi; le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9; une personne qui n'\u00e9tait pas mieux qualifi\u00e9e mais qui ne poss\u00e9dait pas le trait distinctif \u00e0 l'origine de la plainte a subs\u00e9quemment obtenu le poste.\n[37] Dans Israeli c. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, ((1983), 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1616, page 1618 (T.C.D.P.), conf. par (1984), 5 C.H.R.R. D\/2147 (T.C.D.P.- Tribunal d'appel)), le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a \u00e9labor\u00e9 un deuxi\u00e8me crit\u00e8re qui devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 dans les situations o\u00f9 le plaignant est qualifi\u00e9 mais n'est pas embauch\u00e9 et l'employeur continue \u00e0 chercher un candidat qualifi\u00e9. Dans de tels cas, une preuve prima facie peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie en d\u00e9montrant ce qui suit :\nle plaignant appartient \u00e0 l'un des groupes susceptibles d'\u00eatre victimes de discrimination aux termes de la Loi; le plaignant s'est port\u00e9 candidat \u00e0 un poste que l'employeur d\u00e9sirait combler; la candidature du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e en d\u00e9pit du fait qu'il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9; par la suite, l'employeur a continu\u00e9 d'\u00e9tudier les demandes des candidats poss\u00e9dant les m\u00eames qualifications que le plaignant.\n[38] Alors que les crit\u00e8res \u00e9labor\u00e9s dans Shakes et Israeli servent de guides utiles, aucun des deux crit\u00e8res ne devraient \u00eatre automatiquement appliqu\u00e9s d'une mani\u00e8re rigide ou arbitraire dans toutes les causes en mati\u00e8re d'embauche (voir Singh c. Canada (Statistique Canada) (1998), 34 C.H.R.R. D\/203, paragraphe 161 (T.C.D.P.), conf. par [2000] A.C.F. n>o 417 (C.F. 1>re inst.) (QL); Premakumar c. Air Canada, [2002] C.H.R.D., paragraphe 77 (T.C.D.P.) (QL)). Les circonstances dans chaque cas devraient \u00eatre examin\u00e9es afin de d\u00e9terminer si l'application de l'un ou l'autre crit\u00e8re, en tout ou en partie, est opportune.\nIII. L'ANALYSE A. La plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 7 (i) La preuve prima facie [39] Selon l'interpr\u00e9tation que l'on fait des faits en l'esp\u00e8ce, l'un ou l'autre des crit\u00e8res susmentionn\u00e9s peut s'appliquer. D'une part, d'apr\u00e8s la description qui figure dans la plainte, le crit\u00e8re formul\u00e9 dans Shakes semble opportun. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend qu'il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour le poste, qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 et qu'Eva Bressette, la sur du chef, a obtenu le poste m\u00eame si elle n'\u00e9tait pas plus qualifi\u00e9e et m\u00eame si elle ne poss\u00e9dait aucunement certaines des qualifications exig\u00e9es pour l'emploi.\n[40] D'autre part, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que personne n'a obtenu le poste apr\u00e8s la cl\u00f4ture du concours. Les candidates recommand\u00e9es par le jury de l'entrevue au conseil de Bande (Deborah Herman et Dorothy French) n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9es parce que l'on a estim\u00e9 qu'elles n'\u00e9taient pas pleinement qualifi\u00e9es. Le poste est demeur\u00e9 vacant pendant un certain temps, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que l'on prenne la d\u00e9cision d'embaucher Eva Bressette, laquelle n'avait pas particip\u00e9 au concours initial. On peut donc affirmer que l'employeur a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher des candidats, comme le pr\u00e9voit le crit\u00e8re formul\u00e9 dans Israeli.\n[41] Je ne suis pas convaincu que le plaignant a prouv\u00e9 prima facie qu'il y a eu discrimination en vertu de l'un ou l'autre crit\u00e8re. Les deux approches exigent que le plaignant d\u00e9montre qu'il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour le poste d'intervenant aupr\u00e8s des familles. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'il ne l'\u00e9tait pas.\n[42] Le plaignant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans sa plainte qu'il r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 toutes les exigences affich\u00e9es quant au poste. Il est vrai qu'il r\u00e9pondait apparemment \u00e0 tous les crit\u00e8res n\u00e9cessaires lui permettant de se rendre \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de l'entrevue du processus d'\u00e9valuation. Toutefois, apr\u00e8s lui avoir fait passer une entrevue, le jury de l'entrevue a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas suffisamment qualifi\u00e9 pour qu'il soit justifi\u00e9 de recommander sa candidature au conseil de Bande. Finalement, m\u00eame les deux candidates dont les noms ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9s ont en bout de ligne \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es non qualifi\u00e9es par le conseil. Aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite pour indiquer que la d\u00e9cision du comit\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 partiale ou influenc\u00e9e par le chef Bressette ou que l'une ou l'autre des candidates recommand\u00e9es de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 lui \u00e9taient parentes avec le chef.\n[43] M\u00eame si l'on pr\u00e9sume que le plaignant \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour l'emploi, la d\u00e9cision de ne pas l'embaucher n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par l'intim\u00e9. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par le jury de l'entrevue et c'est une d\u00e9cision, qui, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 affirm\u00e9, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9e par la situation de famille du plaignant. On ne peut affirmer qu'une personne qui ne poss\u00e9dait pas le trait distinctif a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e \u00e0 la place du plaignant, car en fait les deux candidates recommand\u00e9es, Deborah Herman et Dorothy French, poss\u00e9daient le m\u00eame trait distinctif que le plaignant - elles n'\u00e9taient pas parentes avec le chef Bressette.\n[44] M\u00eame lorsque l'on ne se fie pas aux crit\u00e8res formul\u00e9s dans Shakes\/Israeli, je ne suis pas convaincu que l'on puisse prouver prima facie qu'il y a eu discrimination en raison de la situation de famille du plaignant. Franchement, rien dans la preuve n'\u00e9taye, m\u00eame \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, l'argument que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination. Le conseil de Bande a nomm\u00e9 Eva Bressette des mois apr\u00e8s que le jury de l'entrevue eut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la candidature du plaignant n'\u00e9tait tout simplement pas assez forte pour que l'on puisse proposer son nom au conseil de Bande. En effet, si la d\u00e9cision de nommer Eva Bressette avait \u00e9t\u00e9 de quelque fa\u00e7on influenc\u00e9e par son lien de parent\u00e9 avec le chef, les personnes autoris\u00e9es \u00e0 d\u00e9poser une plainte auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 Deborah Herman ou Dorothy French, car ce sont leurs candidatures qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es par le conseil de Bande et non pas la candidature du plaignant.\n[45] Si j'avais conclu que le plaignant avait \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie, sa plainte ne serait toujours pas fond\u00e9e. La d\u00e9cision de muter Eva Bressette dans le poste toujours vacant d'intervenant aupr\u00e8s des familles \u00e9tait judicieuse tant du point de vue de la gestion des finances que du point de vue de la gestion des ressources humaines. L'explication fournie \u00e9tait raisonnable et on n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve qui permettrait de mettre cela en doute.\n[46] Je n'estime pas que la question soulev\u00e9e dans la plainte quant aux qualifications de M>me Bressette (notamment, le fait qu'elle ne poss\u00e9dait pas de v\u00e9hicule, ni de permis de conduire valide, au moment de sa mutation) indique que l'on s'\u00e9tait servi d'un pr\u00e9texte. La preuve est que les employ\u00e9s en fonction qui d\u00e9tenaient des permis valides lorsqu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s n'ont pas eu \u00e0 prouver par la suite que leurs permis \u00e9taient toujours valides car cela \u00e9tait tout simplement pr\u00e9sum\u00e9. Seuls les nouveaux employ\u00e9s devaient pr\u00e9senter une preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. M>me Lorraine George, l'administratrice de la Bande, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, aussit\u00f4t qu'elle a appris en novembre 2002 que le permis de M>me Bressette \u00e9tait expir\u00e9, celle-ci a re\u00e7u l'instruction de corriger la situation sans d\u00e9lai, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi des mesures disciplinaires seraient prises. M>me Bressette a imm\u00e9diatement ob\u00e9i \u00e0 l'ordre et a produit la preuve du renouvellement de son permis \u00e0 son employeur. Quant \u00e0 la question du v\u00e9hicule, il semble que lorsque M>me Bressette \u00e9tait appel\u00e9e \u00e0 se d\u00e9placer \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du bureau, elle prenait des arrangements avec les autres employ\u00e9s quant au transport. En d'autres mots, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de remplir l'ensemble des t\u00e2ches exig\u00e9es par son emploi malgr\u00e9 que son permis fut suspendu et malgr\u00e9 qu'elle ne poss\u00e9d\u00e2t pas de v\u00e9hicule personnel. De toute fa\u00e7on, il semble qu'elle ait depuis acquis son propre v\u00e9hicule. Aucun de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments ne m'ont convaincu que l'explication qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la mutation d'Eva Bressette dans le poste d'intervenant aupr\u00e8s des familles n'\u00e9tait qu'un pr\u00e9texte.\n[47] Pour l'ensemble de ces motifs, je conclus que la partie de la plainte qui a trait \u00e0 l'article 7 n'est pas fond\u00e9e.\nB. La plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 14.1 [48] Selon l'article 14.1 de la Loi, constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, d'exercer ou de menacer d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant. Les parties ne m'ont cit\u00e9 aucune jurisprudence traitant pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de cette question. L'affaire a toutefois \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e en d\u00e9tail par le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne dans l'affaire Wong c. Banque Royale du Canada, [2001] C.H.R.D. n>o 11, paragraphes 213 \u00e0 229 (QL). Le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'article 14.1 ne devrait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme exigeant que le plaignant prouve l'intention d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles et il ne devrait pas non plus \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant diff\u00e9rent, du point de vue de l'application, des articles de la Loi qui conf\u00e8rent des droits. Le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 que cela va dans le m\u00eame sens que ce que la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84, c'est-\u00e0-dire que la Loi s'attache \u00e0 \u00e9liminer la discrimination plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 punir et que, par cons\u00e9quent, les motifs ou les intentions des auteurs d'actes discriminatoires ne constituent pas une pr\u00e9occupation majeure du point de vue de la Loi.\n[49] La d\u00e9cision qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue dans Wong est conforme aux conclusions de la commission d'enqu\u00eate de l'Ontario dans Entrop c. Imperial Oil Ltd. (no 7), (1995) 23 C.H.R.R. D\/213, concernant une disposition libell\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on similaire qui interdit l'exercice de repr\u00e9sailles en vertu du Code des droits de la personne, L.R.O. 1990, ch. H-19. La commission a conclu que m\u00eame si le plaignant avait per\u00e7u raisonnablement que la conduite reproch\u00e9e de l'intim\u00e9 constituait des repr\u00e9sailles pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, cela pourrait \u00e9galement \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 des repr\u00e9sailles, ind\u00e9pendamment de toute intention prouv\u00e9e de l'intim\u00e9. Toutefois, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 dans Wong, il faut d\u00e9terminer dans quelle mesure la perception du plaignant est raisonnable. Les intim\u00e9s ne devraient pas \u00eatre tenus responsables de l'angoisse ou des r\u00e9actions exag\u00e9r\u00e9es des plaignants.\n[50] En l'esp\u00e8ce, j'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'un certain nombre d'incidents soulev\u00e9s par le plaignant \u00e9taient des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles, ce qui est interdit par l'article 14.1 de la Loi.\n[51] Nul doute qu'il existe depuis longtemps de l'hostilit\u00e9 entre le plaignant et sa famille d'une part et le chef ainsi que le conseil d'autre part. L'\u00e9pouse du plaignant avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte li\u00e9e \u00e0 l'emploi qui l'avait brouill\u00e9e avec le conseil. Cette plainte n'avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e lorsque le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lu au conseil. Le fr\u00e8re du plaignant avait \u00e9galement eu un litige avec la bande. Le plaignant \u00e9tait intervenu en leur nom au sein de la collectivit\u00e9, sur un ton consid\u00e9r\u00e9 acerbe, du moins par le chef et certains conseillers. Sur le plan politique, le plaignant se situait incontestablement \u00e0 l'oppos\u00e9 du chef et des autres membres du conseil.\n[52] Dans ce contexte, il peut \u00eatre difficile de discerner si certains incidents concernant le plaignant se sont tout simplement produits en raison de ce conflit persistant ou en raison de sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Malgr\u00e9 cela, je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 accepter qu'une preuve prima facie de repr\u00e9sailles a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie en rapport avec chacune des occasions o\u00f9 le plaignant a fait l'objet d'un traitement diff\u00e9rent de celui des autres conseillers. Sans aucune explication, il serait juste de conclure que la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne serait raisonnablement per\u00e7ue comme \u00e9tant au moins l'un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui a motiv\u00e9 la diff\u00e9rence de traitement.\n[53] L'intim\u00e9 a fourni de nombreuses explications qui, pour la plupart, tiraient leurs racines des querelles et des d\u00e9saccords politiques qui existaient entre le plaignant et le chef. Par exemple, la Bande pr\u00e9tend que le plaignant \u00e9tait responsable des questions soulev\u00e9es en rapport avec les r\u00e9unions du 24 et du 26 novembre 2003, dans les salles du conseil, notamment en raison du fait qu'il avait divulgu\u00e9 des renseignements confidentiels et en raison de son comportement belliqueux durant la r\u00e9union. Cette explication est compatible avec les t\u00e9moignages de nombreux t\u00e9moins qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents et dont certains lui ont plus tard \u00e9crit une lettre dans laquelle ils exprimaient leur d\u00e9sapprobation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa conduite. En fait, m\u00eame les membres du personnel du conseil de Bande ont cru bon, le 3 d\u00e9cembre 2003, de d\u00e9poser un rapport concernant le comportement agressif du plaignant. Ils ont notamment all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu'il s'\u00e9tait montr\u00e9 tr\u00e8s agressif lorsqu'il s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aux bureaux de la Bande.\n[54] Compte tenu de l'ensemble des circonstances, je ne crois pas que la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne du plaignant ait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans le fait qu'il n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union de suivi du 26 novembre. Il est important de constater que le chef n'a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9. Je suis convaincu qu'il y a eu une certaine confusion quant \u00e0 savoir qui devait assister \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9union, une confusion pour laquelle le conseil de Bande s'est en bout de ligne excus\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du plaignant et du chef Bressette.\n[55] Je ne suis pas non plus convaincu que c'\u00e9tait dans le but d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles que l'on a refus\u00e9 au plaignant l'acc\u00e8s au Rapport Ron Commons . Qu'il ait ou non pr\u00eat\u00e9 serment de confidentialit\u00e9, j'estime qu'il est parfaitement raisonnable que le conseil ait jug\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas opportun qu'il soit mis au courant de la strat\u00e9gie de la Bande quant au litige en cours avec son \u00e9pouse. De m\u00eame, j'estime raisonnable l'explication fournie par l'intim\u00e9 pour ne pas avoir exclu le chef de la r\u00e9union \u00e0 huis clos du 28 juin 2003 au cours de laquelle on a discut\u00e9 de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant. Le plaignant a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 le conseil de Bande comme intim\u00e9 et non pas le chef. Bien qu'il fut reconnu comme \u00e9tant \u00e0 l'origine de la pr\u00e9tendue discrimination, il semble logique et \u00e9quitable que l'intim\u00e9 puisse le consulter quant aux all\u00e9gations. Apr\u00e8s tout, le conseil de Bande n'agissait pas \u00e0 titre d'arbitre neutre dans l'affaire, il \u00e9tait intim\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 dans la plainte et il n'\u00e9tait pas tenu de maintenir ses distances face au plaignant ou au chef. Je ne vois aucune raison de consid\u00e9rer l'une ou l'autre de ces explications comme \u00e9tant de simples pr\u00e9textes de conduite par ailleurs discriminatoire.\n[56] J'accepte \u00e9galement comme \u00e9tant raisonnable et non pas comme \u00e9tant un pr\u00e9texte l'explication donn\u00e9e concernant le traitement pr\u00e9tendument diff\u00e9rent accord\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Ron George et au plaignant, concernant le serment de confidentialit\u00e9. On doit faire une distinction claire et justifi\u00e9e entre les deux conseillers. Le plaignant a d'abord refus\u00e9 de pr\u00eater imm\u00e9diatement serment alors que M. Ron George n'\u00e9tait tout simplement pas disponible pour pr\u00eater serment. Les situations respectives sont, par cons\u00e9quent, tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes.\n[57] Je ne vois \u00e9galement aucune raison de rejeter l'explication de Lorraine George concernant la composition du comit\u00e9 des finances et du personnel. Il \u00e9tait parfaitement raisonnable que le conseil nomme des conseillers qui poss\u00e9daient plus d'exp\u00e9rience que la plaignant pour si\u00e9ger sur l'un des comit\u00e9s les plus importants.\n[58] Cela dit, il y a eu d'autres pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s incidents de repr\u00e9sailles au regard desquels je ne suis pas convaincu du caract\u00e8re raisonnable des explications fournies par l'intim\u00e9. Lors de la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union du conseil de la nouvelle session, laquelle fut tenue le 8 juillet 2002, la pr\u00e9occupation du chef Bressette quant \u00e0 l'omission du plaignant de pr\u00eater le serment de confidentialit\u00e9 \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre bien fond\u00e9e, mais plut\u00f4t que de traiter exclusivement ce probl\u00e8me, il a r\u00e9agi en prenant \u00e0 partie le plaignant pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre la Bande. Aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour contredire la version des \u00e9v\u00e8nements du plaignant lors de cette premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union. L'avis que la bande a fait circuler en d\u00e9cembre 2003 soul\u00e8ve une question semblable. Le conseil a \u00e9t\u00e9 manifestement tr\u00e8s irrit\u00e9 par la lettre et le circulaire qui venaient tout juste d'\u00eatre distribu\u00e9s dans la collectivit\u00e9 et dans lesquels on critiquait ses activit\u00e9s. Compte tenu de la preuve, je suis convaincu que le plaignant fut selon toute probabilit\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9paration et la distribution d'au moins l'un de ces documents. Une r\u00e9ponse de la part du conseil de Bande \u00e9tait certainement justifi\u00e9e, mais le conseil a choisi de faire plus que de tout simplement faire part de sa position quant aux questions soulev\u00e9es. Il a fait valoir que la raison pour laquelle le conseil n'\u00e9tait plus capable de fonctionner d'une mani\u00e8re transparente \u00e9tait que le plaignant avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne - rejetant ainsi le bl\u00e2me sur ses \u00e9paules, tout simplement parce qu'il avait exerc\u00e9 son droit de d\u00e9poser une plainte en vertu de la Loi.\n[59] Il est raisonnable de percevoir une telle diff\u00e9rence de traitement comme constituant des repr\u00e9sailles pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Les plaignants qui sont pris \u00e0 partie de cette mani\u00e8re peuvent h\u00e9siter \u00e0 aller de l'avant avec leurs plaintes. Il s'agit pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment du pr\u00e9judice que l'article 14.1 vise \u00e0 corriger ou pr\u00e9venir. Il est important que les plaignants demeurent confiants qu'ils peuvent exercer et faire respecter leurs droits de la personne sans craindre d'\u00eatre par la suite victimes de pr\u00e9judice.\n[60] \u00c0 peu pr\u00e8s au m\u00eame moment o\u00f9 le conseil faisait publiquement ces commentaires quant au plaignant, sa nomination comme d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Southern First Nations Secretariat a myst\u00e9rieusement \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9 n'a fourni aucune explication, mais ce qui ressort clairement du t\u00e9moignage de M>me Jackson \u00e9tait que cette annulation ne pouvait s'\u00eatre produite que suite \u00e0 une intervention de la part du chef. Lorsque la r\u00e9union du groupe de travail fut tenue environ quatre mois plus tard, en mars 2004, le plaignant fut le seul conseiller \u00e0 ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9. L'explication fournie \u00e9tait que la r\u00e9union n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 organis\u00e9e que pour les membres de longue date du conseil et que c'est M>me Jackson qui avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 quels membres rencontraient ce crit\u00e8re. Je ne doute pas qu'elle ait suivi scrupuleusement, de bonne foi, ces instructions. En effet, elle semble avoir jug\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre que le plaignant \u00e9tait la seule personne qui n'\u00e9tait pas un membre de longue date. C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour cela que l'on peut se demander si les instructions qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es visaient \u00e0 exclure le plaignant. De toute fa\u00e7on, que l'on ait eu ou non une telle intention, une personne raisonnable percevrait cette exclusion et la d\u00e9cision d'annuler sa nomination en tant que d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant une forme de repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant. Les repr\u00e9sailles peuvent \u00eatre li\u00e9es aux nombreux conflits qui existaient entre le plaignant et le chef d'une part et entre le plaignant et le conseil d'autre part, mais l'un de ces nombreux d\u00e9saccords avait trait au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Compte tenu des autres commentaires faits par le chef et le conseil de Bande quant au plaignant, il serait raisonnable de percevoir que la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00e9tait au moins un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui a motiv\u00e9 ces actes particuliers de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[61] Bref, je suis convaincu que les perceptions de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e9taient raisonnables dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles avaient trait aux incidents particuliers susmentionn\u00e9s. Compte tenu des rapports acrimonieux qui existaient entre le plaignant et le chef Bressette en rapport avec un grand \u00e9ventail de questions non li\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte, je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 voulait exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant en raison de sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Apr\u00e8s tout, le plaignant avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre une institution publique qui doit rendre compte \u00e0 son \u00e9lectorat, les membres de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle et Stony Point. On peut s'attendre \u00e0 ce que le chef et le conseil discutent ouvertement de toute action en justice en instance contre la Bande. Mais, la mani\u00e8re avec laquelle le chef et le conseil ont soulev\u00e9 cette question dans certains cas a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une perception raisonnable de repr\u00e9sailles. La plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant en vertu de l'article 14.1 de la Loi est donc jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e.\nIV. LE REDRESSEMENT A. Indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral (alin\u00e9a 53(2) e)) [62] Le plaignant demande \u00e0 \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 pour le pr\u00e9judice moral qu'il a subi en raison de l'acte discriminatoire (alin\u00e9a 53(2)e)). Je ne crois pas qu'une indemnit\u00e9 importante soit opportune en l'esp\u00e8ce. Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 quant au stress qu'il a subi depuis le concours pour le poste d'intervenant aupr\u00e8s des familles. Le plaignant attribue la plus grande partie du stress \u00e0 l'opportunit\u00e9 d'emploi perdue et \u00e0 la perte r\u00e9sultante d'un bon revenu stable. Cela a occasionn\u00e9 une situation difficile sur le plan financier pour lui et sa famille. Toutefois, j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la discrimination n'\u00e9tait pas un \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui avait motiv\u00e9 le fait qu'il n'avait pas obtenu le poste d'intervenant aupr\u00e8s des familles. Par cons\u00e9quent, aucune indemnit\u00e9 ne sera accord\u00e9e pour pr\u00e9judice moral concernant ce stress .\n[63] La plupart des actes de r\u00e9pr\u00e9sailles pour lesquelles le plaignant pr\u00e9tend avoir subi un pr\u00e9judice sont des incidents qui a mon avis ne sont pas reli\u00e9s \u00e0 aucune forme de repr\u00e9sailles. Le d\u00e9sordre survenu lors de la r\u00e9union du 24 novembre en est un exemple.\n[64] \u00c0 mon avis, les quelques incidents pr\u00e9cis que j'ai estim\u00e9s constituer des repr\u00e9sailles n'ont eu que de modestes effets sur le plaignant. Dans ces circonstances, il est justifi\u00e9 d'ordonner le paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 d'un montant de 2 000,00 $ au plaignant pour pr\u00e9judice moral (alin\u00e9a 53(2)e)).\nB. Indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale (paragraphe 53(3)) [65] Le paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut ordonner le paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 la victime si l'intim\u00e9 a commis des actes de repr\u00e9sailles d'une mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e. Je ne constate aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui \u00e9taye la pr\u00e9tention que l'intim\u00e9 voulait exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte. J'ai tout simplement conclu qu'il \u00e9tait raisonnable que le plaignant per\u00e7oive certains aspects de la conduite de l'intim\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant des repr\u00e9sailles. Il n'a donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que l'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant.\n[66] L'intim\u00e9 a-t-il agi d'une mani\u00e8re inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e? C'est-\u00e0-dire, le chef et le conseil \u00e9taient-ils conscients du risque que leur conduite puisse \u00eatre per\u00e7ue comme \u00e9tant des actes de repr\u00e9sailles et ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der malgr\u00e9 tout? Selon moi, la preuve n'\u00e9taye pas cette proposition. La d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9 de r\u00e9agir \u00e0 l'opposition politique du plaignant en faisant ouvertement allusion \u00e0 sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et en le traitant diff\u00e9remment des autres conseillers \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre peu judicieuse mais n'\u00e9tait pas inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e au sens du paragraphe 53(3).\n[67] La demande d'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi est par cons\u00e9quent rejet\u00e9e.\nC. Les d\u00e9penses (alin\u00e9a 53(2) d)) [68] Le plaignant demande d'\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 quant aux d\u00e9penses suivantes entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire (alin\u00e9a 53(2)d)) :\nIndemnit\u00e9s vers\u00e9es aux t\u00e9moins : plusieurs t\u00e9moins cit\u00e9s \u00e0 compara\u00eetre \u00e0 l'audience par le plaignant \u00e9taient soit des employ\u00e9s, des conseillers, soit des personnes li\u00e9es de pr\u00e8s au conseil de Bande. \u00c0 la demande de l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9, j'ai d\u00e9livr\u00e9 une ordonnance obligeant le plaignant \u00e0 payer les frais engag\u00e9s pour assister \u00e0 l'audience \u00e0 un tarif sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 \u00e0 tout t\u00e9moin qui en a fait la demande. Compte tenu de ma conclusion que seule la partie de la plainte qui a trait \u00e0 l'article 14.1 est fond\u00e9e, j'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de rembourser au plaignant les frais vers\u00e9s aux t\u00e9moins suivants, dont le t\u00e9moignage a eu une certaine incidence sur la question des repr\u00e9sailles :\nFaye Jackson Le chef Tom Bressette Ron George David Henry Robert Bressette Peter Cloud Lorraine George\nFrais de photocopie et de papeterie : selon les r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dures du Tribunal, les parties sont tenues de se communiquer les faits et les documents importants avant la tenue de l'audience et de produire en plusieurs copies toutes les pi\u00e8ces d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en preuve. Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait d\u00fb avoir recours aux services d'un d\u00e9taillant en fournitures de bureau situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Sarnia pour la pr\u00e9paration des documents et que cela lui avait co\u00fbt\u00e9 un montant de 300 $. Il pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que ses nombreuses visites chez le d\u00e9taillant lui avaient co\u00fbt\u00e9 environ 300 $ en frais de d\u00e9placement. Malheureusement, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 de produire des re\u00e7us \u00e0 l'appui de cette demande mais l'utilisation fr\u00e9quente de services de photocopie ressort clairement du dossier et il est reconnu que sa r\u00e9sidence, situ\u00e9e sur la r\u00e9serve de la Bande, est environ \u00e0 50 km de Sarnia. J'accepte donc le t\u00e9moignage de l'intim\u00e9 selon lequel le total de ses d\u00e9penses \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 environ 600 $. Toutefois, compte tenu que seule la partie de sa plainte qui a trait \u00e0 l'article 14.1 est fond\u00e9e, j'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de payer au plaignant la moiti\u00e9 de ces d\u00e9penses, c'est-\u00e0-dire 300 $. Le temps consacr\u00e9 : le plaignant demande un montant de 8 000 $ \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 pour le temps qu'il a consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 toute cette entreprise qu'a \u00e9t\u00e9 la pr\u00e9paration de sa cause. Une demande semblable a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale - Section de premi\u00e8re instance dans Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada c. Lambie (1996), 29 C.H.R.R. D\/483. Le plaignant dans cette affaire demandait une somme d'argent pour les cong\u00e9s et le temps consacr\u00e9s \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration de la plainte . La Cour a rejet\u00e9 la demande en soulignant que le mot d\u00e9penses n'avait pas une port\u00e9e assez large pour inclure ce genre de d\u00e9penses et que de toute fa\u00e7on ces d\u00e9penses ne doivent \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9es que dans des circonstances exceptionnelles . Il n'y a pas eu de circonstances exceptionnelles en l'esp\u00e8ce, particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui a trait au volet des repr\u00e9sailles, lequel \u00e9tait la seule partie de la plainte qui est fond\u00e9e. La demande est donc rejet\u00e9e.\nD. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats [69] Des int\u00e9r\u00eats simples doivent \u00eatre pay\u00e9s sur tous les montants accord\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats doivent \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s sur une base annuelle \u00e0 un taux \u00e9quivalent au taux d'escompte (fr\u00e9quence mensuelle) fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada et ils courent \u00e0 compter de la date \u00e0 laquelle la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e afin d'ajouter l'all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles, c'est-\u00e0-dire le 15 janvier 2004.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

INTRODUCTION [1] La plaignante est membre de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada. Le 14 mars 2001, elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 devant la Commission des droits de la personne une plainte all\u00e9guant que la Gendarmerie a exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et la situation de famille en la d\u00e9favorisant dans l'application des conditions d'emploi, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Cette all\u00e9gation d\u00e9coulait d'une demande de promotion de la plaignante. La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e ult\u00e9rieurement afin d'y ajouter une all\u00e9gation aux termes de l'article 10.\n[2] L'audience s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e \u00e0 Vancouver en septembre 2003. La Commission n'y a pas particip\u00e9, se contentant de pr\u00e9senter un aper\u00e7u g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'\u00e9tat du droit. On remarquera que j'ai consult\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des principes cl\u00e9s ainsi que les observations \u00e9crites de la plaignante et de l'intim\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9paration de l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 des motifs de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nII. LES FAITS [3] La caporale Brown est membre de la GRC. Elle est mari\u00e9e avec un autre membre de la Gendarmerie. Elle soutient que la Gendarmerie lui a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 d'autres candidats en raison de son sexe et de son \u00e9tat matrimonial. L'intim\u00e9e ne conteste pas l'all\u00e9gation fondamentale et pr\u00e9tend simplement qu'il \u00e9tait raisonnable de tenir compte de son \u00e9tat matrimonial dans le processus de promotion. Elle affirme que le sexe n'est pas entr\u00e9 en ligne de compte.\nA. Le processus de promotion [4] Il convient d'examiner le processus de promotion \u00e0 la GRC avant de se pencher sur les faits de l'esp\u00e8ce. Le sergent d'\u00e9tat-major Mitchell, qui agissait comme conseiller sp\u00e9cial aupr\u00e8s de l'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res, a indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal que la GRC a eu recours \u00e0 trois syst\u00e8mes diff\u00e9rents de promotion. Le syst\u00e8me initial \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur l'examen du dossier personnel. Les officiers d\u00e9sireux d'obtenir de l'avancement pr\u00e9sentaient une demande \u00e0 un conseil de promotion charg\u00e9 d'examiner chaque candidature.\n[5] Ce syst\u00e8me a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9 par celui des cycles , qui \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur la publication de listes des affectations disponibles. Ces listes \u00e9taient transmises aux membres int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, qui pouvaient pr\u00e9senter une demande de promotion en indiquant leurs pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences. Le troisi\u00e8me syst\u00e8me \u00e9tait probablement un amalgame des deux premiers.\n[6] Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills \u00e9tait le repr\u00e9sentant des relations fonctionnelles. Il s'agissait d'un poste \u00e9lectif \u00e0 temps plein. Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, il a affirm\u00e9 que les membres qui critiquaient le premier syst\u00e8me le qualifiaient de vieille clique . Vers le milieu des ann\u00e9es 80, on se plaignait que le syst\u00e8me \u00e9tait injuste. On reconnaissait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement que le processus devrait \u00eatre ax\u00e9 plus sur les comp\u00e9tences essentielles que sur la supervision administrative. L'id\u00e9e \u00e9tait d'en arriver \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me impartial.\n[7] Le syst\u00e8me des cycles a \u00e9t\u00e9 instaur\u00e9 en 1994. Le mot cycle d\u00e9signe un processus distinct d'offres de promotion d'une dur\u00e9e de deux ans. Il y a eu quatre cycles. Toutefois, le respect de l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier posait probl\u00e8me. Ainsi, le troisi\u00e8me cycle, qui aurait d\u00fb prendre fin le 31 mars 2000, accusait du retard en raison, semble-t-il, d'un probl\u00e8me d'informatique. Le quatri\u00e8me cycle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9but\u00e9 et accusait lui aussi du retard. C'\u00e9tait une \u00e9poque loufoque.\n[8] Il y avait aussi d'autres pr\u00e9occupations. Les cycles du printemps 2000 \u00e9taient les derniers avant la mise en place du nouveau syst\u00e8me de promotion. On s'inqui\u00e9tait, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les r\u00e8gles devant r\u00e9gir le nouveau syst\u00e8me n'avaient pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies et que la nouvelle s\u00e9rie de promotions ne pourrait avoir lieu avant un certain temps. L'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res \u00e9tait confront\u00e9e \u00e0 un vide .\n[9] Il s'ensuit que les Services du personnel et des affectations subissaient \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de pression. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, l'insp. Donovan a affirm\u00e9 que l'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res avait d\u00e9pass\u00e9 son budget et avait d\u00fb obtenir l'autorisation de mettre en uvre les derni\u00e8res listes. Les mutations posaient un probl\u00e8me suppl\u00e9mentaire. Chaque transfert co\u00fbtait \u00e0 la GRC 36 000 $ en moyenne et la Gendarmerie ne disposait pas d'un budget suffisant pour absorber le co\u00fbt de tous les d\u00e9m\u00e9nagements. Le s.\u00e9.-m. Mitchell avait re\u00e7u instruction d'aller de l'avant avec les promotions tout en veillant \u00e0 assurer une gestion financi\u00e8re responsable.\n[10] Il y avait d'autres pressions. Le processus de promotion de la GRC \u00e9tait g\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle des divisions. Le commandement en Colombie-Britannique est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 sous le nom de Division E. Cette division \u00e9tait nettement en sous-effectif et tentait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de conserver le plus grand nombre possible de membres. Par cons\u00e9quent, on voulait que les conjoints continuent de travailler. On \u00e9prouvait \u00e9galement de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 recruter des membres d\u00e9sireux d'obtenir une promotion dans le Lower Mainland. Cette situation tenait, semble-t-il, au co\u00fbt de la vie dans cette r\u00e9gion.\nB. L'offre de mars 2000 [11] L'offre de promotion de mars 2000 de la Division E a \u00e9t\u00e9 exp\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00e0 200 officiers, dont environ 60 caporaux. Les membres qui postulaient un poste voyaient leur nom \u00eatre inscrit sur une liste de promotions. Les candidats dont les noms figuraient sur cette liste \u00e9taient class\u00e9s en fonction d'un score cumulatif \u00e9tabli en se fondant sur leur rapport de rendement, les r\u00e9sultats d'un test et leur anciennet\u00e9. Il y a eu une deuxi\u00e8me s\u00e9rie de promotions du fait qu'un certain nombre de caporaux avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 promus au rang de sergent et qu'il fallait combler les postes de caporal devenus ainsi vacants. Les candidats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s que le membre qui refuserait une affectation qu'il avait demand\u00e9e verrait son nom \u00eatre ray\u00e9 de la liste de promotions.\n[12] L'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res de la Division E \u00e9tait dirig\u00e9e par le surint. Schlecker. Deux inspecteurs relevaient de lui : l'insp. Donovan, qui \u00e9tait responsable du processus de promotion, et le s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell, qui relevait de l'insp. Donovan et qui avait la responsabilit\u00e9 imm\u00e9diate du processus. Il incombait au s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell de passer au crible les listes et de faire des recommandations \u00e0 ses sup\u00e9rieurs. Ses recommandations \u00e9taient examin\u00e9es par l'insp. Donovan et approuv\u00e9es par le surint. Schlecker. C'est ce dernier qui avait le dernier mot.\n[13] Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell a indiqu\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'il regardait d'abord quel \u00e9tait le candidat qui s'\u00e9tait le mieux class\u00e9, puis proc\u00e9dait \u00e0 son affectation; ensuite, il passait au candidat suivant. Certains postes exigeaient des comp\u00e9tences particuli\u00e8res. Cependant, dans la mesure o\u00f9 un candidat satisfaisait aux exigences, [TRADUCTION] il n'y avait aucune raison de ne pas le nommer . Une fois la liste de promotions approuv\u00e9e par ses sup\u00e9rieurs, le s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell communiquait avec le superviseur du membre pour v\u00e9rifier s'il y avait des raisons de ne pas lui accorder l'affectation choisie.\nC. La demande de la cap. Brown [14] La plaignante avait subi l'examen de caporal en 1997. Elle s'\u00e9tait class\u00e9e dans le premier d\u00e9cile, mais elle n'avait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de demande de promotion. Elle avait alors d'autres chats \u00e0 fouetter et, en 1999, son p\u00e8re \u00e9tait en phase terminale. Elle a demand\u00e9 d'\u00eatre mut\u00e9e en Saskatchewan pour raisons de famille afin qu'elle puisse \u00eatre pr\u00e8s de son p\u00e8re. Son nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrit sur une liste humanitaire , mais on a refus\u00e9 de lui accorder la mutation demand\u00e9e.\n[15] L'officier de gestion des carri\u00e8res de la cap. Brown \u00e9tait le sergent Kimoto. Ce dernier travaillait au sein des Services du personnel et des affectations depuis 1993. Il a conseill\u00e9 \u00e0 la cap. Brown de participer au cycle de promotion de 2000, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait probablement du dernier. La cap. Brown a donc postul\u00e9 un certain nombre d'affectations \u00e0 une distance raisonnable en voiture de Calgary, o\u00f9 son p\u00e8re \u00e9tait hospitalis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'occasion. Bien que ce d\u00e9tail importe peu par rapport aux aspects juridiques de la situation, il explique dans une certaine mesure sa r\u00e9action aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements ult\u00e9rieurs.\n[16] La cap. Brown \u00e9tait 47e dans la liste des candidats. Elle a postul\u00e9 37 postes, les \u00e9num\u00e9rant par ordre de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Ses cinq premiers choix \u00e9taient Columbia Valley, Whistler, Gibson's Landing, Prince George et un poste de d\u00e9tective \u00e0 Coquitlam. Elle d\u00e9sirait obtenir le poste de Columbia Valley, car cette localit\u00e9 \u00e9tait situ\u00e9e \u00e0 quatre heures de Calgary. Son 17e choix \u00e9tait un poste aux services g\u00e9n\u00e9raux \u00e0 Coquitlam. J'ai tendance \u00e0 croire que les cadres sup\u00e9rieurs des Services du personnel et des affectations estimaient qu'on lui avait attribu\u00e9 un rang trop \u00e9lev\u00e9, ce qui pourrait expliquer dans une large mesure la suite des \u00e9v\u00e9nements.\n[17] Il ne fait aucun doute que la cap. Brown a fait une erreur en postulant trop de postes, dont certains ne l'int\u00e9ressaient gu\u00e8re. Ce fait t\u00e9moigne \u00e0 mon avis d'un manque de confiance, qui a in\u00e9vitablement jou\u00e9 dans les d\u00e9cisions prises par l'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res. L'id\u00e9e qu'elle ne semblait pas savoir ce qu'elle voulait n'\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9nu\u00e9e de tout fondement. Le serg. Kimoto estimait que sa palette de choix quant aux affectations qui l'int\u00e9ressaient dans le Lower Mainland \u00e9tait immense .\n[18] La cap. Brown et son mari craignaient n\u00e9anmoins que la direction ne la laisse simplement \u00e0 Coquitlam, si elle incluait cet endroit dans ses choix. Ils ont donc parl\u00e9 au serg. Chris Deevy, l'officier responsable de l'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res, qui leur a donn\u00e9 l'assurance qu'il n'y aurait pas de saute-mouton . Colin Brown a v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 la chose aupr\u00e8s du s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell et avait confiance qu'un officier qui s'\u00e9tait moins bien class\u00e9 que sa femme n'aurait pas pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur celle-ci.\n[19] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, le serg. Deevey a indiqu\u00e9 que la cap. Brown lui avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 le 3 mai 2000 pour lui poser une question ressemblant \u00e0 celle-ci : [TRADUCTION] Si je suis la premi\u00e8re candidate qualifi\u00e9e pour un poste, va-t-on me le donner? Il a simplement r\u00e9pondu oui. Il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un d\u00e9tail crucial pour la suite. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, la cap. Brown s'est fi\u00e9e beaucoup trop au conseil du serg. Deevey et du gend. Lou, un autre agent de dotation, qui l'ont simplement encourag\u00e9e \u00e0 postuler le plus grand nombre de postes possible. Il convient de souligner que le serg. Deevey ne donnerait pas le m\u00eame conseil aujourd'hui.\n[20] \u00c0 l'audience, une bonne partie de la preuve a port\u00e9 sur le classement des candidats. Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Kimoto a exprim\u00e9 l'avis que la personne ayant obtenu le meilleur rang \u00e9tait celle qui obtiendrait normalement le poste, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle avait les comp\u00e9tences n\u00e9cessaires. Il a n\u00e9anmoins reconnu que l'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res jouissait, aux termes du sous-alin\u00e9a 134(4)d)(1) du Manuel de gestion des carri\u00e8res, du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d'accorder un poste \u00e0 un autre candidat. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que ce sous-alin\u00e9a avait \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 de temps \u00e0 autre avant l'affaire Brown.\nD. La premi\u00e8re s\u00e9rie de promotions [21] L'insp. Donovan et le s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell ont d\u00e9crit la premi\u00e8re s\u00e9rie de promotions. Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell a fourni \u00e0 l'insp. Donovan une liste des candidats - \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans l'ordre o\u00f9 ils s'\u00e9taient class\u00e9s, sur laquelle il avait indiqu\u00e9 pour chacun la promotion qu'il proposait. Ils ont examin\u00e9 la liste ensemble. Une fois rendus au nom de la cap. Brown, qui figurait au 47e rang dans la liste, ils ont pass\u00e9 en revue ses choix un \u00e0 un. M\u00eame si la plaignante arrivait en premi\u00e8re place pour au moins cinq de ses choix ant\u00e9rieurs, le s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell a recommand\u00e9 qu'on lui propose une affectation aux services g\u00e9n\u00e9raux \u00e0 Coquitlam - son 17e choix. L'insp. Donovan n'a pas vu d'objection et le surint. Schlecker a ult\u00e9rieurement confirm\u00e9 la recommandation.\n[22] Columbia Valley \u00e9tait le deuxi\u00e8me choix de la plaignante. Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell et l'insp. Donovan ont tous deux affirm\u00e9 lors de leur t\u00e9moignage que le poste a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 \u00e0 quelqu'un d'autre parce qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de trouver un poste pour son mari. Le co\u00fbt des r\u00e9affectations posait aussi probl\u00e8me. Lorsqu'un membre est r\u00e9affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un endroit situ\u00e9 \u00e0 plus de 40 kilom\u00e8tres de son lieu d'affectation, le processus de r\u00e9installation se trouvait enclench\u00e9, lequel entra\u00eenait des co\u00fbts variant entre 28 000 et 40 000 $. Le probl\u00e8me qui se pose dans le cas de la r\u00e9affectation d'un membre dont le conjoint fait lui aussi partie de la GRC est que la direction risque d'avoir \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager le couple une deuxi\u00e8me fois, si aucun poste ne devient disponible pour le conjoint. C'est le co\u00fbt du deuxi\u00e8me d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement qui pr\u00e9occupait l'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res.\n[23] L'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res craignait de ne pouvoir trouver un poste au mari de la cap. Brown, si sa femme \u00e9tait mut\u00e9e \u00e0 un petit d\u00e9tachement. Il s'agissait l\u00e0 d'un probl\u00e8me g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de dotation qui se posait dans les petits d\u00e9tachements, o\u00f9 la Gendarmerie ne peut selon les r\u00e8gles affecter, semble-t-il, des membres d'une m\u00eame famille. D'autre part, il \u00e9tait beaucoup plus commode de laisser le couple Brown dans le Lower Mainland.\n[24] Les demandes d'affectation \u00e0 Columbia, Gibson's Landing, Whistler et Prince George ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es pour \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s les m\u00eames raisons. Il n'y avait pas \u00e0 proprement parler de strat\u00e9gie pour restreindre les co\u00fbts de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement. On faisait simplement du cas par cas. Si on pouvait garder quelqu'un \u00e0 son lieu d'affectation, c'est ce qu'on faisait. La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que l'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res \u00e9tait sous le coup de terribles restrictions financi\u00e8res \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Elle avait re\u00e7u l'ordre de r\u00e9duire ses co\u00fbts le plus possible.\n[25] Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell a candidement reconnu que la cap. Brown avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 trop de choix. Si elle avait mentionn\u00e9 simplement Columbia Valley, elle aurait obtenu l'affectation, d'apr\u00e8s ce qu'il a affirm\u00e9. L'Unit\u00e9 de gestion de carri\u00e8re n'aurait pas alors eu le choix. Elle avait droit \u00e0 une promotion. Si elle a obtenu une autre affectation, c'est simplement parce qu'elle avait indiqu\u00e9 d'autres choix.\n[26] Le 14 mars, le s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell a transmis \u00e0 la plaignante un courriel l'informant de la recommandation voulant qu'elle obtienne une promotion \u00e0 son lieu d'affectation - Coquitlam. Son mari resterait l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait. La cap. Brown a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tonn\u00e9e, car elle croyait que le classement des candidats faisait foi aux fins des affectations.\nE. La suite des \u00e9v\u00e9nements [27] La cap. Brown et son mari ont rencontr\u00e9 le s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell le lendemain. Ce dernier a confirm\u00e9 qu'elle s'\u00e9tait class\u00e9e premi\u00e8re pour Invemere. Il a \u00e9galement inform\u00e9 le couple qu'on craignait de ne pouvoir trouver un autre poste \u00e0 son mari. La cap. Brown et son mari ont ensuite parl\u00e9 au surint. Schlecker. Ils voulaient r\u00e9gler la question avant que la liste officielle soit diffus\u00e9e et qu'il soit trop tard pour changer les choses.\n[28] Le surint. Schlecker a invoqu\u00e9 plusieurs motifs pour justifier la d\u00e9cision de laisser la cap. Brown \u00e0 Coquitlam. L'un d'eux \u00e9tait le co\u00fbt. Un autre motif \u00e9tait le fait qu'ils \u00e9taient mari et femme. Il \u00e9tait prudent selon lui de les laisser \u00e0 Coquitlam. Le mari de la cap. Brown a r\u00e9agi en demandant un cong\u00e9 sans solde. Le surint. Schlecker n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 envisager la chose. La rencontre a dur\u00e9 environ une heure. Le surint. Schlecker a accept\u00e9 de discuter de la question avec son personnel, mais il \u00e9tait fermement convaincu que Coquitlam \u00e9tait un bon endroit o\u00f9 travailler .\n[29] Apr\u00e8s sa rencontre avec la cap. Brown et son mari, le surint. Schlecker a eu un entretien avec le s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell et l'insp. Donovan. Le serg. Kimoto \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre pr\u00e9sent lui aussi. Le surint. Schlecker leur a fait part du m\u00e9contentement de la cap. Brown et de son mari. Le groupe a analys\u00e9 la question et d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait impossible de modifier la d\u00e9cision. L'\u00e9l\u00e9ment le plus crucial \u00e9tait le mari de la plaignante. Il n'y avait pas d'autres postes de caporal dans la r\u00e9gion et il \u00e9tait illogique d'affecter la cap. Brown \u00e0 Columbia Valley, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il leur faudrait r\u00e9affecter ult\u00e9rieurement son mari. Un tel sc\u00e9nario entra\u00eenerait d'autres frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement.\n[30] Je ne crois pas que la question du sexe ait \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e lors de la discussion. On a discut\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 d'accorder au mari de la plaignante un cong\u00e9 sans solde. Cette solution ne ferait que retarder le probl\u00e8me de trouver un poste au mari et entra\u00eenerait ult\u00e9rieurement des frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement. Je sens ici le besoin d'ajouter que ce genre de solution sur mesure, qui impliquait de contourner le processus officiel de dotation, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 inappropri\u00e9.\n[31] \u00c0 mon avis, les circonstances indiquent clairement qu'un autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment est entr\u00e9 en ligne de compte. Le consensus \u00e9tait que la d\u00e9cision avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 prise et qu'on ne reviendrait pas en arri\u00e8re. Une volte-face aurait eu des r\u00e9percussions sur un trop grand nombre d'autres d\u00e9cisions. Un courriel attendait les Brown \u00e0 leur retour \u00e0 Coquitlam. Le message indiquait que la plaignante serait promue \u00e0 son lieu d'affectation. La cap. Brown et son mari \u00e9taient f\u00e2ch\u00e9s et d\u00e9\u00e7us. Ils estimaient avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trahis par le processus.\nF. Le sergent d'\u00e9tat-major Wills [32] La chronologie exacte des \u00e9v\u00e9nements n'est pas tout \u00e0 fait claire dans mon esprit. La cap. Brown et son mari ont \u00e9galement discut\u00e9 de la question avec le s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills, le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 du personnel. Ce dernier leur a dit qu'il y avait des postes disponibles pour le mari de la plaignante suffisamment proches de Whistler, Gibson's Landing et Prince George pour qu'elle puisse obtenir l'une de ces affectations. Il a indiqu\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'il y avait cinq postes de caporal disponibles \u00e0 une distance de moins d'une heure d'Invermere en voiture.\n[33] Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills connaissait le sergent Kalin, qui \u00e9tait le commandant du d\u00e9tachement de Columbia Valley. Il lui a donc t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 pour s'enqu\u00e9rir des possibilit\u00e9s. Le serg. Kalin lui a dit qu'il ne voulait pas plus de femmes. Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills a r\u00e9pondu : [TRADUCTION] Ed, tu ne peux pas tenir ce genre de discours. Le serg. Kalin a dit qu'il s'en foutait. Il y avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans son service deux membres en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9; de ce fait, il manquait de personnel. Aussi ne voulait-il plus de femmes. Il en avait soup\u00e9 des quarts de nuit. Le probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait qu'il n'y avait pas \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de m\u00e9canisme pour remplacer un membre en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Beaucoup de d\u00e9tachements manquaient de personnel \u00e0 cause de cela.\n[34] Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills a racont\u00e9 \u00e0 la cap. Brown, sa conversation avec le serg. Kalin. La cap. Brown a naturellement conclu que cela expliquait ce qui s'\u00e9tait produit. Je crois comprendre que la conversation a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 racont\u00e9e au s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell, qui l'a rapport\u00e9e \u00e0 ses sup\u00e9rieurs. La preuve d\u00e9montre clairement, toutefois, que l'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res n'a communiqu\u00e9 avec personne \u00e0 Columbia Valley, et je ne partage pas l'opinion voulant que les vues du serg. Kalin soient entr\u00e9es en ligne de compte. Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, le serg. Kimoto a indiqu\u00e9 que le commandant du d\u00e9tachement d'accueil n'a pas grand-chose \u00e0 dire dans le choix des membres promus qui sont affect\u00e9s \u00e0 son service.\n[35] Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills a rencontr\u00e9 le s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell pour discuter de la situation. Les deux hommes ont pass\u00e9 en revue un \u00e0 un les choix indiqu\u00e9s par la cap. Brown. Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills a dit qu'il y avait un poste disponible \u00e0 Columbia Valley. Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell a r\u00e9pondu qu'il y avait un probl\u00e8me \u00e0 cause du mari. Un seul poste de caporal \u00e9tait disponible. Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills a dit au s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell qu'il ne pensait pas que la cap. Brown serait la bienvenue \u00e0 Columbia Valley, faisant allusion aux commentaires du serg. Kalin.\n[36] Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question du poste de d\u00e9tective \u00e0 Coquitlam. Au dire du s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills, ce poste \u00e9tait disponible et la cap. Brown avait les comp\u00e9tences voulues. Pourquoi ne pouvait-elle pas l'obtenir? Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell a dit qu'elle n'avait pas l'\u00e9toffe d'une enqu\u00eateuse g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills a contest\u00e9 cette affirmation, faisant remarquer qu'elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 men\u00e9 des enqu\u00eates sur de graves infractions contre la personne. Ses \u00e9valuations de rendement \u00e9taient satisfaisantes. Il a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 question des autres affectations possibles, qui ont fait l'objet du m\u00eame genre d'analyse.\n[37] Le groupe a discut\u00e9 des transferts de co\u00fbts. Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills a indiqu\u00e9 que le membre ayant obtenu l'affectation \u00e0 Ridge Meadows repr\u00e9sentait un transfert de co\u00fbts et qu'il en \u00e9tait de m\u00eame de celui qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 enqu\u00eateur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 Coquitlam. Dans le cas de Columbia Valley, c'\u00e9tait la m\u00eame chose. Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills a reconnu que le probl\u00e8me du mari et de la femme se posait dans ce cas. Toutefois, \u00e0 son avis, on n'avait pas bien examin\u00e9 la question, car il y avait plusieurs solutions possibles. Une de ces solutions consistait \u00e0 accorder un cong\u00e9 au mari de la plaignante.\n[38] Une foule de possibilit\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es lors de la discussion. Les deux hommes n'\u00e9taient pas sur la m\u00eame longueur d'ondes quant \u00e0 la difficult\u00e9 de trouver un poste au mari de la cap. Brown \u00e0 Whistler. Selon le s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills, on aurait pu lui attribuer un des postes de Prince George. C'\u00e9tait un gros d\u00e9tachement. Il devait y avoir une quinzaine de caporaux au sein de ce d\u00e9tachement, sans compter les caporaux du quartier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de district. Pourquoi ne pourrait-on pas trouver une place \u00e0 son mari l\u00e0-bas?\n[39] Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills \u00e9tait m\u00e9content des r\u00e9ponses qu'il recevait. Selon son calcul, on aurait saut\u00e9 sept fois par-dessus la cap. Brown. Les deux hommes ont discut\u00e9 de ses comp\u00e9tences. Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell a convenu qu'elle \u00e9tait un jeune officier comp\u00e9tent qui travaillait fort. Par cons\u00e9quent, le s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills d\u00e9sirait savoir pourquoi on ne voulait pas l'aider? Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell lui a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s ce qui suit : [TRADUCTION] Elle veut \u00eatre partout et nulle part \u00e0 la fois. Elle n'a aucune id\u00e9e de ce qu'elle fait. Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills a alors dit qu'il passerait par-dessus la t\u00eate du s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell.\n[40] Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills a rencontr\u00e9 le surint. Schlecker environ une semaine plus tard. Il d\u00e9sirait qu'on lui fournisse une explication logique . Le surint. Schlecker s'est \u00e9vertu\u00e9 \u00e0 expliquer qu'il avait d\u00fb faire des choix difficiles . Devant l'insistance de son interlocuteur, il a invoqu\u00e9 le sous-alin\u00e9a 134(4)d)(1) du Manuel de gestion des carri\u00e8res. Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'il n'avait eu connaissance d'aucun autre cas o\u00f9 cette disposition avait \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9e.\nG. La deuxi\u00e8me s\u00e9rie de promotions [41] Les efforts du s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills sont demeur\u00e9s vains. La cap. Brown a refus\u00e9 le poste aux services g\u00e9n\u00e9raux \u00e0 Coquitlam et retir\u00e9 son nom du processus de promotion. La direction a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ce geste comme un refus d'\u00eatre promue. Ils se sont ensuite adoucis et lui ont permis de participer \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me s\u00e9rie de promotions, qui \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour combler les vacances r\u00e9sultant de la promotion de caporaux au grade de sergent. Cette initiative a \u00e9t\u00e9 per\u00e7ue comme une certaine reconnaissance par l'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res que le processus initial avait mal tourn\u00e9.\n[42] \u00c0 mon avis, cette s\u00e9rie de promotions rev\u00eat beaucoup d'importance par rapport \u00e0 la plainte dont je suis saisi. La cap. Brown est d'avis qu'elle aurait d\u00fb recevoir une affectation aux drogues. Toutefois, ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de travail s'inscrivaient dans les domaines de la circulation, des services de police communautaires et du d\u00e9veloppement communautaire. Le gend. Lou connaissait son dossier personnel et n'avait souvenance de rien indiquant qu'elle avait l'exp\u00e9rience n\u00e9cessaire au niveau des enqu\u00eates pour travailler dans la Section des enqu\u00eates g\u00e9n\u00e9rales ou dans la Section antidrogue. Le serg. Kimoto n'avait pas lui non plus souvenance qu'elle justifiait d'une vaste exp\u00e9rience dans le domaine des enqu\u00eates et il n'avait pas l'impression qu'elle avait beaucoup d'exp\u00e9rience en ce qui touche les infractions en mati\u00e8re de drogue.\n[43] La d\u00e9cision voulant que la cap. Brown ne poss\u00e9dait pas les comp\u00e9tences n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 une affectation \u00e0 la Section antidrogue est raisonnable et peut certes r\u00e9sister \u00e0 un examen. Je ne vois rien d'in\u00e9quitable dans la fa\u00e7on dont le concours s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 et je soup\u00e7onne que les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard soient le reflet de la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration continuelle des relations entre les parties. \u00c0 mon avis, le v\u00e9ritable probl\u00e8me r\u00e9side dans le fait qu'il n'y avait pas suffisamment de postes vacants pour offrir \u00e0 la cap. Brown une affectation satisfaisante.\nH. Le cong\u00e9 de maladie [44] \u00c0 l'issue de la deuxi\u00e8me s\u00e9rie de promotions, la plaignante s'est vu offrir un poste de caporal au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 officiellement promue le jour de son arriv\u00e9e au d\u00e9tachement, c'est-\u00e0-dire le jour o\u00f9 elle a sign\u00e9 son rapport de mutation A22A. C'\u00e9tait le 12 avril 2001. Le lendemain, elle s'est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e malade. Au dire de l'intim\u00e9e, son geste \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9. Si elle s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9e malade le 6 avril plut\u00f4t que le 13 avril, elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de gendarme.\n[45] Je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re croire que la cap. Brown avait un sentiment partag\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son nouveau poste et qu'elle a constat\u00e9 qu'elle ne pouvait faire face \u00e0 ses responsabilit\u00e9s. Lorsqu'elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins, la cap. Brown a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle s'\u00e9tait rendue chez son m\u00e9decin, la Dre Susan Buchan, et qu'elle lui avait dit qu'elle ne pourrait retourner au travail si les choses ne changeaient pas. Elle avait des migraines et des \u00e9tourdissements. En outre, elle \u00e9tait inqui\u00e8te au sujet de son p\u00e8re. Le Dr Bowman, le psychologue r\u00e9gional de la Gendarmerie, a ensuite communiqu\u00e9 avec elle. Il a dirig\u00e9 la cap. Brown vers le Dr Hannah, un autre psychologue. Le Dr Hannah a pens\u00e9 que ce serait une bonne id\u00e9e qu'elle rende visite \u00e0 son p\u00e8re. Elle a alors pass\u00e9 l'\u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 de maladie en Saskatchewan.\n[46] Je n'entends pas passer en revue la preuve m\u00e9dicale, ne serait-ce que sommairement. Cette preuve suffit \u00e0 prouver que la cap. Brown \u00e9tait fort perturb\u00e9e. Elle souffrait depuis longtemps de migraine et avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des troubles psychologiques. Son \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif s'expliquait en partie par la maladie de son p\u00e8re. Je crois n\u00e9anmoins que les sentiments de la cap. Brown \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son emploi \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s simples. Elle se croyait incapable de retourner au travail tant que la Gendarmerie n'aurait pas avou\u00e9 qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e injustement.\n[47] \u00c0 la barre des t\u00e9moins, la cap. Brown a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle avait fait une erreur en consultant un psychologue nomm\u00e9 par la Gendarmerie. Son mari ne semblait pas partager son opinion. Je ne sympathise pas avec eux sur ce point, la contre-preuve ayant r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu'elle ne se soignait pas. Elle a dit qu'elle refusait de prendre les m\u00e9dicaments qu'on lui avait prescrits parce qu'elle craignait leurs effets secondaires. C'est peut-\u00eatre vrai, mais il est clair \u00e0 mon avis que la cap. Brown cherchait \u00e0 gagner du temps. Elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un grief \u00e0 propos de la premi\u00e8re s\u00e9rie de promotions et esp\u00e9rait obtenir une d\u00e9cision en sa faveur avant de retourner au travail. Cet espoir s'est envol\u00e9 lorsque son grief a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9.\n[48] L'insp. Donovan a \u00e9ventuellement communiqu\u00e9 avec la cap. Brown afin de r\u00e9gler la situation. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, il a fait valoir l'importance que les employ\u00e9s reviennent au travail le plus vite possible. Certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve donnent \u00e0 croire que d'autres membres de la Gendarmerie lan\u00e7aient des rumeurs et des insinuations malveillantes. Je fais mienne l'opinion de l'insp. Donovan voulant que la v\u00e9ritable solution \u00e0 ce genre de probl\u00e8me de nature sociale est de faire en sorte que le membre se retrouve dans un milieu de travail sain \u00e0 son retour. Je reconnais que l'insp. Donovan a vraiment fait des efforts pour donner \u00e0 la cap. Brown et \u00e0 son mari des affectations qui leur conviendraient. Aussi a-t-il obtenu l'autorisation de leur offrir des postes de caporal \u00e0 la Section du radar photo \u00e0 Kamloops avant que ces postes soient offerts aux autres membres de la Gendarmerie. La cap. Brown et son mari ont refus\u00e9 ces affectations parce qu'ils estimaient que le programme de radar photo serait supprim\u00e9 apr\u00e8s les \u00e9lections.\n[49] L'insp. Donovan a aussi offert \u00e0 la cap. Brown une affectation \u00e0 Castlegar. Le couple \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter cette offre, \u00e0 la condition que le mari puisse prendre un cong\u00e9 sans solde jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'un poste devienne disponible. Cela a sembl\u00e9 \u00eatre la solution jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la cap. Brown constate qu'il lui fallait renoncer \u00e0 son grief. C'\u00e9tait trop lui demander. Aussi l'offre a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e.\n[50] La cap. Brown \u00e9tait d'avis qu'il y avait quelque chose de sinistre dans le fait d'exiger qu'elle renonce \u00e0 son grief. Je ne partage pas ce sentiment. Il n'y avait rien de mal \u00e0 ce que la GRC tente de r\u00e9gler ainsi le probl\u00e8me. La situation demeure enti\u00e8re. La cap. Brown voulait que la GRC admette ouvertement qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination et qu'elle avait eu raison d'insister sur ce point. Bien qu'on puisse s'interroger \u00e0 savoir si la cap. Brown a pris la bonne d\u00e9cision, elle \u00e9tait en droit de rejeter l'entente pour le motif qu'elle ne comportait pas l'aveu souhait\u00e9.\n[51] Le refus de la cap. Brown de signer l'entente a mis un terme aux n\u00e9gociations avec l'insp. Donovan. Il ne fait aucun doute que ce dernier a \u00e9t\u00e9 froiss\u00e9 et qu'il a trouv\u00e9 la plaignante d\u00e9raisonnable. Voil\u00e0 qui mettait un terme \u00e0 l'affaire. L'insp. Donovan a inform\u00e9 la plaignante qu'elle recevrait l'ordre de rentrer au travail. La Dre Buchan en \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 l'opinion que la cap. Brown \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 travailler, mais qu'elle ne voulait pas reprendre le collier tant que son diff\u00e9rend avec la Gendarmerie n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9. Il y a l\u00e0-dedans une certaine v\u00e9rit\u00e9 morale selon moi. De toute \u00e9vidence, les deux parties se sont montr\u00e9es tr\u00e8s ent\u00eat\u00e9es.\n[52] Lorsque les n\u00e9gociations avec l'insp. Donovan ont \u00e9chou\u00e9, le dialogue entre la cap. Brown et son employeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 rompu. \u00c0 mon avis, il est raisonnable de dire qu'\u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, le manque de confiance de la plaignante envers son employeur \u00e9tait tel qu'elle se m\u00e9fiait de tout effort pour r\u00e9soudre la situation. Lorsque le Dr Hannah lui a dit qu'elle \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 faire du travail de bureau, elle a cru qu'il avait subi des pressions. Je ne vois aucune raison de mettre en doute la bonne foi d'un des m\u00e9decins ou des psychologues.\n[53] Dans un effort ultime pour d\u00e9nouer l'impasse, Colin Brown a communiqu\u00e9 avec le serg. Haggymasy, qui \u00e9tait adjoint au commandant responsable des ressources humaines. Une rencontre \u00e0 trois a \u00e9t\u00e9 organis\u00e9e. Durant cette rencontre, la plaignante a clairement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'elle n'entendait pas renoncer \u00e0 la plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission. Il a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 question de ses comp\u00e9tences. Le serg. Haggymasy a constat\u00e9 que la cap. Brown poss\u00e9dait un dipl\u00f4me en commerce et a propos\u00e9 une affectation \u00e0 l'Unit\u00e9 int\u00e9gr\u00e9e des produits de la criminalit\u00e9. Il s'agissait d'un poste convoit\u00e9 . La cap. Brown s'est \u00e9ventuellement vu attribuer le poste et a \u00e9t\u00e9 louang\u00e9e pour son travail dans ce service. Le serg. Haggymasy a aussi eu l'amabilit\u00e9 de trouver un poste \u00e0 son mari.\nIII. LE DROIT [54] L'analyse des questions de droit en l'esp\u00e8ce implique d'\u00e9tablir quatre points. Le premier point consiste simplement \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que la plaignante n'est pas tenue de prouver l'existence d'une motivation discriminatoire. Il s'agit l\u00e0 d'une r\u00e8gle de droit bien connue qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans O'Malley c. Simpson Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536.\n[55] Le deuxi\u00e8me point a trait \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation de la cap. Brown selon laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille aux termes de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. La Commission a cit\u00e9 l'arr\u00eat B. c. Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne) (2002), 44 C.H.R.R. D\/1 (CSC), dans lequel les juges Iacobucci et Bastarache soutiennent que l' \u00e9tat familial et l' \u00e9tat matrimonial ne se limitent pas au seul fait d'\u00eatre mari\u00e9 ou d'appartenir \u00e0 un certain type de famille. Ces termes englobent le statut particulier dont jouit une personne du fait qu'elle est mari\u00e9e \u00e0 un individu donn\u00e9.\n[56] Le troisi\u00e8me point ne pr\u00eate pas lui non plus \u00e0 controverse. La Commission a cit\u00e9 Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (CAF), p. D\/15, \u00e0 l'appui de son argument selon lequel il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la discrimination soit le seul facteur qui explique la fa\u00e7on dont la partie intim\u00e9e a trait\u00e9 la partie plaignante. C'est l\u00e0 un \u00e9l\u00e9ment important, ne serait-ce que parce que le cas qui nous occupe s'en trouve simplifi\u00e9. Si la situation de famille de la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments ayant jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de lui refuser une promotion particuli\u00e8re, cela est suffisant pour prouver la discrimination aux fins de la Loi.\n[57] Voil\u00e0 qui m'am\u00e8ne \u00e0 la question de droit plus fondamentale qui se pose en l'esp\u00e8ce, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'obligation de la plaignante d'\u00e9tablir l'existence d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Dans Basi c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029, par exemple, ce Tribunal a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nLe fardeau et l'ordre de la preuve dans les causes de discrimination pour refus d'embaucher sont des m\u00e9canismes d'ores et d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien \u00e9tablis dans toutes les provinces canadiennes : le plaignant doit d'abord \u00e9tablir que l'acte reproch\u00e9 a toutes les apparences d'un acte discriminatoire; apr\u00e8s quoi, il incombe aux mis en cause de fournir une explication raisonnable de l'acte qui lui est reproch\u00e9.\nEn supposant que l'employeur ait fourni une explication, il revient alors au plaignant de d\u00e9montrer que celle-ci ne constitue qu'un pr\u00e9texte et que le comportement de l'employeur \u00e9tait effectivement empreint de discrimination.\nCette analyse est un moyen pratique de d\u00e9terminer s'il y a eu discrimination dans un cas particulier. Elle ne doit toutefois pas \u00eatre faite de mani\u00e8re rigide ou m\u00e9canique.\n[58] La commission d'enqu\u00eate de l'Ontario qui a statu\u00e9 sur Shakes v. Rex Pak Ltd. (1982), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001, pr\u00e9cise \u00e0 la p. D\/1002 les conditions \u00e0 satisfaire pour \u00e9tablir l'existence d'une preuve prima facie :\n[TRADUCTION] Dans une plainte qui a trait \u00e0 l'emploi, la Commission \u00e9tablit habituellement l'existence d'une preuve prima facie en d\u00e9montrant :\nque le plaignant avait les comp\u00e9tences requises pour l'emploi; que le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9; et qu'une personne qui n'\u00e9tait pas mieux qualifi\u00e9e mais qui ne poss\u00e9dait pas la caract\u00e9ristique dont il est question dans le principal chef d'accusation de la plainte relative aux droits de la personne a obtenu le poste.\nSi ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments sont prouv\u00e9s, il incombe alors \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de fournir une explication ... quant \u00e0 ce qui s'est produit.\nL'\u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel des affaires telles que Shakes est qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de prouver quoi que ce soit d'autre que le fait qu'une personne qui n'\u00e9tait pas mieux qualifi\u00e9e que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9e ou promue.\n[59] La situation est plus simple dans les cas o\u00f9 une personne moins qualifi\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9e. La justification habituelle du crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie ne semble gu\u00e8re utile dans ce contexte.\nAinsi, dans Basi, le Tribunal a soutenu (paragraphe 38481) ce qui suit :\n... le plaignant serait confront\u00e9 \u00e0 une t\u00e2che hercul\u00e9enne s'il devait prouver, \u00e0 l'aide de preuves directes, que la discrimination est l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment qui a motiv\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de l'employeur. La discrimination n'est pas un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne qui se manifeste ouvertement, comme on serait port\u00e9 \u00e0 le croire. Il est rare en effet qu'on puisse prouver par des preuves directes qu'un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis intentionnellement.\nCet \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ne tient pas compte du fait que le plaignant n'est pas tenu de prouver que la discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 un \u00e9l\u00e9ment conscient dans la d\u00e9cision d'engager quelqu'un d'autre. Bien que l'intention du pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 auteur d'un acte discriminatoire puisse \u00eatre un \u00e9l\u00e9ment important dans certains aspects du processus, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de prouver un \u00e9tat mental pour qu'une plainte de discrimination soit jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e.\n[60] Dans les anciens pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, on parlait de discrimination indirecte ou par suite d'un effet pr\u00e9judiciable . Ainsi, dans l'arr\u00eat Andrews c. Law Society of British Columbia, [1989] 1 R.C.S. 143, la Cour posait \u00e0 la p. 173 la question suivante :\nQue signifie le terme discrimination? C'est le plus souvent dans l'examen des lois sur les droits de la personne que cette question s'est pos\u00e9e et le concept g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de discrimination en vertu de ces lois a \u00e9t\u00e9 assez bien circonscrit. Vu les arr\u00eats rendus par cette Cour, identifier une d\u00e9finition acceptable pr\u00e9sente peu de difficult\u00e9. Dans l'arr\u00eat Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O'Malley c. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, \u00e0 la p. 551, voici comment elle d\u00e9crit le terme discrimination (dans cette affaire, il s'agissait de discrimination par suite d'un effet pr\u00e9judiciable) : Ce genre de discrimination se produit lorsqu'un employeur adopte . . . une r\u00e8gle ou une norme . . . qui a un effet discriminatoire pour un motif prohib\u00e9 sur un seul employ\u00e9 ou un groupe d'employ\u00e9s en ce qu'elle leur impose, en raison d'une caract\u00e9ristique sp\u00e9ciale de cet employ\u00e9 ou de ce groupe d'employ\u00e9s, des obligations, des peines ou des conditions restrictives non impos\u00e9es aux autres employ\u00e9s . Dans cette affaire, la Cour a \u00e9galement conclu que l'intention n'\u00e9tait pas requise comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la discrimination puisque c'est essentiellement l'effet de la disposition ou de la mesure discriminatoire sur la personne touch\u00e9e qui est d\u00e9terminant dans l'examen de toute plainte.\nLe volet probatoire de l'instruction a toujours mis l'accent sur les effets des faits et gestes de l'employeur. La m\u00eame approche a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) (1987) 1 C.H.R.R. D\/1014 (paragraphe 30).\n[61] La jurisprudence plus r\u00e9cente a renforc\u00e9 cette approche. Dans Colombie-Britannique c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3, arr\u00eat mieux connu sous le nom de Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame affirme qu'il n'y a pas de raison d'\u00e9tablir une distinction entre la notion de discrimination directe et celle de discrimination par suite d'un effet pr\u00e9judiciable , et ce, tant dans le contexte de la Charte des droits que dans celui de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne. Au paragraphe 47, la Cour \u00e9crit ce qui suit : ... la distinction entre la discrimination directe et la discrimination par suite d'un effet pr\u00e9judiciable peut avoir une certaine importance sur le plan analytique, mais, puisque la principale pr\u00e9occupation est l'effet de la loi contest\u00e9e, cette distinction a peu d'importance sur le plan juridique . Au paragraphe 48, elle poursuit :\n...notre Cour a conclu depuis longtemps que le fait qu'un effet discriminatoire n'\u00e9tait pas voulu n'est pas d\u00e9terminant pour les fins de son analyse g\u00e9n\u00e9rale fond\u00e9e sur la Charte et que cela n'est s\u00fbrement pas d\u00e9cisif quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration possible : Law, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au par. 80, le juge Iacobucci; Andrews c. Law Society of British Columbia, [1989] 1 R.C.S. 143, aux pp. 174-175, le juge McIntyre; Eldridge c. Colombie-Britannique (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1997] 3 R.C.S. 624, au par. 62, le juge La Forest. Dans des arr\u00eats comme O'Malley, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, et Bhinder c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 561, notre Cour s'est efforc\u00e9e d'appliquer le m\u00eame principe dans son analyse des lois sur les droits de la personne. (30)\nIl s'agit d'un th\u00e8me constant dans la jurisprudence. Si la doctrine de l'effet discriminatoire s'applique, la preuve de l'existence de motifs ill\u00e9gitimes est un aspect de la discrimination plut\u00f4t qu'une particularit\u00e9 d\u00e9terminante.\n[62] Il me semble que cette question devrait \u00eatre le v\u00e9ritable objet de l'analyse. La premi\u00e8re t\u00e2che du Tribunal dans l'examen d'une affaire comme celle dont je suis saisi est de d\u00e9terminer s'il existe des preuves cr\u00e9dibles que les actes de l'intim\u00e9e ont eu les effets requis sur la plaignante. En fait, la discrimination est souvent une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 th\u00e9orique, qui existe \u00e0 tout le moins en droit de par les cons\u00e9quences qui en d\u00e9coulent. D'apr\u00e8s mon interpr\u00e9tation de la jurisprudence, il est suffisant que la plaignante prouve qu'elle a subi les effets n\u00e9cessaires. L'inf\u00e9rence de discrimination existe d\u00e9j\u00e0 en droit substantiel. Cela suffit.\n[63] Il n'y a rien de tr\u00e8s compliqu\u00e9 dans une telle affirmation. Dans une large mesure, c'est comme si l'on disait que la plaignante est tenue de produire des preuves d\u00e9montrant qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination. Elle n'a pas non plus de r\u00e9percussions sur l'analyse standard, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la doctrine de l'effet discriminatoire et le crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie appliquent le m\u00eame principe de responsabilit\u00e9 objective au processus des droits de la personne. S'il existe une explication raisonnable de ce qui semble \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue \u00eatre un comportement discriminatoire, il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de fournir cette explication. Cependant, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de consid\u00e9rer la preuve d'une telle conduite comme une preuve circonstancielle d'une intention frauduleuse.\n[64] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, on estime que toute personne qui s'adresse aux tribunaux a l'obligation de prouver les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la cause qu'elle entend pr\u00e9senter. Il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de r\u00e9pliquer. C'est ce que l'on appelle souvent la preuve prima facie, qui n'implique pas de se lancer dans une appr\u00e9ciation un tant soit peu approfondie de la preuve proprement dite. Je ne crois pas que la charge de la preuve, qui incombe \u00e0 la partie plaignante tout au cours du processus, s'en trouve alt\u00e9r\u00e9e. Si la partie plaignante n'a pas prouv\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin du processus, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu'elle a subi un effet discriminatoire, la plainte doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[65] C'est un principe de droit fondamental, qui d\u00e9coule de la pr\u00e9misse simple voulant que la partie poursuivante prouve le bien-fond\u00e9 de sa cause. Selon la jurisprudence, la situation est diff\u00e9rente lorsque la partie intim\u00e9e invoque un moyen statutaire de d\u00e9fense. Tout ce que je puis dire, c'est que ce n'est pas le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce et qu'il faut pousser plus loin l'analyse. Dans une affaire comme celle dont je suis saisi, le tribunal ne peut \u00e0 mon avis qu'appr\u00e9cier la preuve et la contre-preuve afin de d\u00e9terminer si la plaignante a prouv\u00e9 sa cause selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. C'est un moyen irr\u00e9sistible et s\u00fbr de d\u00e9terminer l'issue appropri\u00e9e de la cause, un moyen qui permet d'\u00e9viter que des consid\u00e9rations externes interviennent dans le processus. La jurisprudence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale reconna\u00eet qu'il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de faire en sorte que la t\u00e2che consistant \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier la preuve demeure la plus simple possible.\n[66] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la dynamique juridique est extr\u00eamement simple. Le t\u00e9moignage d\u00e9montre qu'on a pass\u00e9 par-dessus la plaignante dans le processus de promotion parce qu'elle \u00e9tait mari\u00e9e avec un autre membre de la Gendarmerie. La plaignante n'a pas eu de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une preuve cr\u00e9dible en l'esp\u00e8ce. La question qu'il faut se poser au plan probatoire est donc la suivante : l'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de fournir une explication raisonnable au sujet de ce qui s'est produit et \u00e0 d\u00e9pouiller la plaignante de son fardeau juridique du point de vue de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve? Par suite du d\u00e9faut de l'intim\u00e9e de fournir pareille explication, la cause de la plaignante reste enti\u00e8re.\nIV. L'ANALYSE [67] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne a pour objet de rem\u00e9dier au probl\u00e8me de la discrimination. La plaignante doit prouver qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e par rapport aux autres candidats en raison de son sexe ou de son \u00e9tat matrimonial. Elle doit aussi prouver que ces diff\u00e9rences ont jou\u00e9 contre elle. L'affaire dont je suis saisi est remarquablement simple. La cap. Brown figurait au 17e rang dans la liste des candidats, et l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas contest\u00e9 ce classement. La preuve de part et d'autre indique que l'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res \u00e9tait tenue de donner pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance aux candidats qui s'\u00e9taient le mieux class\u00e9s. Les postes \u00e9taient attribu\u00e9s strictement en fonction de l'ordre hi\u00e9rarchique.\n[68] Je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre que la direction jouissait d'un certain pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire dans l'attribution des postes. Des facteurs contextuels - et non pas strictement la situation du candidat - doivent \u00eatre pris en compte dans le processus promotionnel. Le sous-alin\u00e9a 134(4)d)(1) du Manuel de gestion des carri\u00e8res pr\u00e9cise la chose. Cependant, les pr\u00e9rogatives de la direction n'en sont pas moins limit\u00e9es, les comp\u00e9tences des candidats devant l'emporter sur les autres consid\u00e9rations. \u00c0 mon avis, c'est l\u00e0 l'aspect positif de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne. L'employeur ne doit pas simplement s'abstenir d'exercer une discrimination contre ses employ\u00e9s dans l'octroi des promotions. Il est tenu de respecter le principe du m\u00e9rite.\n[69] L'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e \u00e0 tenir compte d'un certain nombre de facteurs dans la d\u00e9cision d'accorder \u00e0 la cap. Brown une affectation particuli\u00e8re. Elle devait notamment tenir compte du fait que la cap. Brown \u00e9tait mari\u00e9e avec un autre membre de la Gendarmerie. Il en r\u00e9sultait pour la Gendarmerie un certain nombre de cons\u00e9quences. En outre, il est \u00e9vident que les comp\u00e9tences et la situation particuli\u00e8res des autres candidats devaient \u00eatre prises en compte. Ainsi, la preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que les membres affect\u00e9s \u00e0 des postes de dur\u00e9e limit\u00e9e avaient droit \u00e0 une mutation. Il \u00e9tait raisonnable \u00e0 mon avis que l'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res tienne compte, dans l'exercice de ses pr\u00e9rogatives, des frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement, de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins du conjoint et de la situation particuli\u00e8re des autres candidats.\n[70] Il s'ensuit que l'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res avait le pouvoir d'accorder une affectation \u00e0 un candidat qui s'\u00e9tait moins bien class\u00e9, si elle avait des raisons valables de le faire. Cependant, il ne faut pas pousser trop loin ce raisonnement. Il \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre raisonnable de ne pas tenir compte des premiers choix de la cap. Brown. Cet argument perd toutefois de sa force plus on descend dans la liste. Pass\u00e9 un certain point dans le processus, l'argument n'est plus soutenable.\n[71] Il est \u00e9vident que plus on fait fi des premiers choix du candidat, plus sa cause s'en trouve renforc\u00e9e. La deuxi\u00e8me fois qu'on passe par-dessus le candidat, la direction devrait prendre note de la chose. Avant de le faire une troisi\u00e8me fois, on devrait bien peser la d\u00e9cision. Le syst\u00e8me de classement doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9. L'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res n'a tout simplement pas respect\u00e9 ses obligations juridiques \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. La meilleure preuve r\u00e9side probablement dans le fait que le 14e choix de la cap. Brown a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 un candidat qui s'\u00e9tait class\u00e9 au 96e rang, soit pr\u00e8s de 50 rangs derri\u00e8re elle. C'est inimaginable. La pr\u00e9rogative de la direction de refuser \u00e0 la cap. Brown une des promotions demand\u00e9es \u00e9tait \u00e9puis\u00e9e bien avant qu'elle en arrive \u00e0 son 17e choix.\n[72] L'un des probl\u00e8mes que pose l'argument selon lequel l'intim\u00e9e a le droit de nommer des candidats qui se sont moins bien class\u00e9s est que cette logique ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9serv\u00e9e \u00e0 d'autres candidats. Elle s'applique aussi \u00e0 la cap. Brown. Si un candidat qui s'\u00e9tait moins bien class\u00e9 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait parfois d'une promotion en passant par-dessus un candidat qui s'\u00e9tait mieux class\u00e9, force est de conclure que l'intim\u00e9e avait toute la latitude voulue pour accorder \u00e0 la cap. Brown un de ses premiers choix.\n[73] Il est \u00e9vident que la liste des choix de la cap. Brown d\u00e9notait une certaine ind\u00e9cision. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait remarquer que son manque de confiance expliquait en partie cette situation. Ses choix \u00e9taient partout et nulle part \u00e0 la fois . Cela n'a pas d'importance. C'est \u00e0 elle qu'il incombait d'exprimer les choix en question et personne, surtout pas moi, n'est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 mettre en doute les raisons pour lesquelles elle a privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 certains postes plut\u00f4t que d'autres. Je n'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi d'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve donnant \u00e0 croire que d'autres candidats se sont vu accorder leur 17e choix. En fait, la preuve d\u00e9montre le contraire. Le cas de la plaignante est dans une cat\u00e9gorie \u00e0 part.\n[74] Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell a candidement reconnu que la cap. Brown aurait obtenu une des affectations qu'elle convoitait particuli\u00e8rement si elle avait restreint ses choix. En d\u00e9finitive, ce sont les derniers choix dans la liste de ses pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences qui ont eu raison d'elle. Le processus a \u00e9t\u00e9 travesti. La cap. Brown n'a pas indiqu\u00e9 ses pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences suppl\u00e9mentaires afin que son employeur puisse passer par-dessus elle et attribuer les postes qui l'int\u00e9ressaient \u00e0 des candidats qui s'\u00e9taient class\u00e9s moins bien qu'elle.\n[75] Je suis persuad\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision d'attribuer \u00e0 la cap. Brown le poste \u00e0 Coquitlam a \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9e davantage par une question de co\u00fbts et les besoins de la Gendarmerie que par les int\u00e9r\u00eats l\u00e9gitimes du processus de promotion. Il \u00e9tait commode de laisser la cap. Brown et son mari dans le Lower Mainland, o\u00f9 la direction avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 garder des officiers. Cela allait \u00e0 l'encontre de l'esprit du processus de promotion, qui \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 \u00eatre fond\u00e9 sur les pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences des membres individuels. L'intim\u00e9e ne m'a donn\u00e9 aucun autre exemple de candidat mieux qualifi\u00e9 qui s'\u00e9tait vu accorder un choix aussi bas dans le classement.\n[76] Je ne puis dire si le surint. Schlecker et son personnel ont d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment trait\u00e9 la cap. Brown de fa\u00e7on injuste. Cependant, il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un th\u00e8me commun dans les affaires de discrimination. Le visage de la discrimination a un c\u00f4t\u00e9 invisible, ce qui n'aide en rien \u00e0 att\u00e9nuer les effets. Il est suffisant de dire que la d\u00e9cision d'accorder \u00e0 la cap. Brown une promotion \u00e0 son lieu d'affectation \u00e9tait manifestement injuste. Il est \u00e9vident \u00e9galement que son \u00e9tat matrimonial a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment crucial dans cette d\u00e9cision. Vu ce constat, qui est plus que suffisant pour que la plainte soit jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne entre en jeu.\nV. CONCLUSIONS A. L'article 10 [77] \u00c0 mon avis, la pr\u00e9sente instance ne soul\u00e8ve pas de questions de principe importantes. La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il y a eu une injustice personnelle plut\u00f4t que syst\u00e9mique dans le processus. Les d\u00e9cisions dans le cadre du processus de promotion ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en fonction de chaque cas. Les pr\u00e9occupations de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sont accessoires et ne font qu'\u00e9clairer le contexte dans lequel s'inscrit la plainte personnelle. Le bien-fond\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es aux termes de l'article 10 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9.\nB. L'article 7 [78] Passons maintenant \u00e0 l'examen de la plainte relevant de l'article 7, dans laquelle la cap. Brown all\u00e8gue qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e dans le processus de promotion en raison de son sexe et de son \u00e9tat matrimonial. L'all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e. Des preuves ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la GRC \u00e9prouve encore des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 int\u00e9grer les femmes, ne serait-ce que parce que des membres du sexe oppos\u00e9 estiment qu'elles b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d'un traitement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel. Cependant, cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9 se situe dans une large mesure en arri\u00e8re-plan.\n[79] Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell a reconnu que les commentaires du serg. Kalin avaient suscit\u00e9 certaines plaisanteries, mais il semblerait que celles-ci avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites \u00e0 son sujet. On donnerait une trop grande importance au serg. Kalin dans l'analyse si on laissait croire que le s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell se souciait de ce qu'il pensait. Le s.\u00e9.-m. Mitchell subissait beaucoup trop de pressions pour se pr\u00e9occuper des pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences personnelles des commandants des d\u00e9tachements. L'id\u00e9e que le surint. Schlecker et l'insp. Donovan aient pu tenir compte du point de vue du serg. Kalin dans l'examen d'un ensemble complexe de demandes de promotion ne r\u00e9siste pas \u00e0 l'analyse.\n[80] \u00c0 mon avis, le personnel de l'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res \u00e9tait consciente de sa responsabilit\u00e9 de faire en sorte que les d\u00e9cisions relatives aux promotions ne soient pas empreintes de discrimination \u00e0 l'endroit des membres de sexe f\u00e9minin. Il peut exister des relents du pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 historique \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des membres de sexe f\u00e9minin, particuli\u00e8rement aux \u00e9chelons inf\u00e9rieurs. Cependant, je n'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi d'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve convaincant d\u00e9montrant que cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment a jou\u00e9 dans le processus de promotion. Je fais mienne l'affirmation du s.-\u00e9.-m. Mitchell selon laquelle l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment sexe n'est pas intervenu et n'a pas influ\u00e9 sur le processus de promotion.\n[81] Il reste l'all\u00e9gation voulant que la cap. Brown ait fait l'objet d'une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e9tat matrimonial. Je suis persuad\u00e9 que cet aspect de la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9. Les t\u00e9moins ont ouvertement reconnu que l'\u00e9tat matrimonial avait \u00e9t\u00e9 le principal facteur dans la d\u00e9cision, et aucune explication v\u00e9ritable n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie par l'intim\u00e9e, si ce n'est qu'il en co\u00fbtait cher de r\u00e9affecter un membre. L'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res avait re\u00e7u l'ordre formel de ne pas d\u00e9penser d'argent. Toutefois, il s'agissait d'une crainte sans fondement et rien dans la preuve ne justifie du point de vue l\u00e9gal la d\u00e9cision de laisser la plaignante dans le Lower Mainland.\n[82] Je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 que j'ai eu droit \u00e0 toute l'histoire. Le serg. Deevey a encore de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 expliquer ce qui s'est produit. Le s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills a affirm\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'il n'avait jamais obtenu d'explications satisfaisantes quant \u00e0 ce qui s'\u00e9tait produit. Il ne fait aucun doute que le s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills a peut-\u00eatre d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 une certaine m\u00e9fiance \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la direction en raison de son r\u00f4le de d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 du personnel. Toutefois, m\u00eame si on tient compte de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment, il est \u00e9vident que la situation appelle une explication.\n[83] Il est probable que divers \u00e9l\u00e9ments - l\u00e9gitimes ou ill\u00e9gitimes - aient contribu\u00e9 au processus de prise de d\u00e9cisions. Toutefois, la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 est que des candidats moins qualifi\u00e9s ont pass\u00e9 par-dessus la cap. Brown. Le caract\u00e8re injuste du processus \u00e9tait flagrant. Il ne fait aucun doute que la plaignante a \u00e9tabli l'existence d'une preuve prima facie. En fait, c'est le moins qu'on puisse dire. L'affaire dont je suis saisi exige une r\u00e9ponse, que l'intim\u00e9e n'a jamais fournie.\n[84] Soit dit en passant, le processus de promotion a \u00e9t\u00e9 mal con\u00e7u au d\u00e9part. Les officiers de l'Unit\u00e9 de gestion des carri\u00e8res subissaient d'\u00e9normes pressions et le processus \u00e9tait soumis \u00e0 trop de contraintes. Somme toute, il \u00e9tait plus facile de maintenir le statu quo et de se d\u00e9filer. Je fais mienne la remarque laconique du s.-\u00e9.-m. Wills, \u00e0 savoir qu'il aurait fallu un effort gigantesque pour stopper le processus et corriger l'erreur. Les t\u00e9moignages des autres t\u00e9moins mettent en relief ce constat.\nC. Les mesures de redressement (i) Excuses [85] Les efforts de l'employeur pour composer avec la plaignante et corriger l'injustice initiale ont \u00e9t\u00e9 non n\u00e9gligeables. Malheureusement, ces efforts ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits sans reconna\u00eetre que la cap. Brown avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e injustement. C'est ce qui est devenu \u00e0 mon avis la principale pomme de discorde. Lorsqu'on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Colin Brown pourquoi sa femme avait refus\u00e9 l'affectation \u00e0 Castlegar, il a r\u00e9pondu qu'il s'agissait pour elle de retrouver sa dignit\u00e9 . Elle avait besoin qu'on admette que les d\u00e9cisions prises lui avaient caus\u00e9 une injustice.\n[86] Je suis persuad\u00e9 que la cap. Brown est devenue davantage int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 prouver un point moral plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 r\u00e9soudre les questions de fond dont j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi. Les deux parties se sont montr\u00e9es particuli\u00e8rement ent\u00eat\u00e9es. Cela ne change pas toutefois ma perception de la situation. Que la discrimination f\u00fbt d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou le r\u00e9sultat d'un concours de circonstances n'importe pas. Le fait est que la cap. Brown a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e injustement dans le processus de promotion.\n[87] Bien qu'il s'agisse exactement du genre d'affaire qui semblerait justifier des excuses de la Gendarmerie, l'arr\u00eat rendu par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (Canada) c. Stevenson 2003 CFPI 341 (C.F., 1re inst.) m'emp\u00eache d'ordonner que des excuses soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es. Voil\u00e0 qui ne cl\u00f4t pas pour autant le d\u00e9bat, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que rien n'interdit \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de poser un tel geste. J'invite les parties \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des observations quant \u00e0 savoir si la conduite de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard comporte des cons\u00e9quences en ce qui concerne l'indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle la plaignante peut avoir droit aux termes de l'article 53.\n[88] Lors de l'audience, j'ai exprim\u00e9 une certaine frustration du fait que les parties n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de r\u00e9gler la plainte \u00e0 l'amiable. Je continue de croire qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 possible de trouver un r\u00e8glement. Il se peut cependant que l'aveu que la cap. Brown cherchait \u00e0 obtenir ait tout simplement \u00e9t\u00e9 quelque chose d'illusoire. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, il faudra se contenter de ma d\u00e9cision. Elle constitue une conclusion de droit que la GRC a exerc\u00e9 une discrimination \u00e0 l'endroit de la cap. Brown.\n[89] J'esp\u00e8re que la Gendarmerie prendra les mesures correctives n\u00e9cessaires en n\u00e9gociant un r\u00e8glement final du diff\u00e9rend, dans un esprit de r\u00e9conciliation. J'estime par ailleurs que la cap. Brown doit tourner la page. Son mari et elle sont des officiers d\u00e9vou\u00e9s, et il n'y a pas de raison qu'ils ne connaissent pas une carri\u00e8re professionnelle gratifiante au sein de la Gendarmerie.\n(ii) Transfert de co\u00fbts [90] La cap. Brown a droit au transfert de co\u00fbts qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9 dans le processus de promotion. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne que la GRC lui donne une autre affectation, de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence au d\u00e9tachement de Saskatoon ou \u00e0 celui de Calgary. Je crois comprendre que l'une ou l'autre affectation lui conviendrait. J'h\u00e9site \u00e0 entrer davantage dans les d\u00e9tails, car cette question rel\u00e8ve de la comp\u00e9tence discr\u00e9tionnaire raisonnable de la direction.\n[91] J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9 n\u00e9anmoins de conserver ma comp\u00e9tence relativement \u00e0 cet aspect de l'affaire. Si les parties ne peuvent convenir d'une affectation appropri\u00e9e dans un d\u00e9lai de quatre mois, je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 r\u00e9examiner la question \u00e0 la demande de l'une d'elles. Je demanderais \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, par souci de bonne foi, d'offrir des perspectives raisonnables au mari de la cap. Brown. La preuve d\u00e9montre qu'il ne devrait pas \u00eatre difficile de trouver un poste \u00e0 chacun d'eux dans un grand centre.\n(iii) Indemnisation [92] Il est n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 mon avis d'entendre d'autres observations au sujet du quantum des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats ainsi que des d\u00e9pens en l'esp\u00e8ce. Je pr\u00e9f\u00e9rerais traiter ces questions en m\u00eame temps. Il est peut-\u00eatre utile, cependant, de faire quelques commentaires sur cet aspect de l'affaire.\n[93] Un certain nombre d'observations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es. La plaignante invoque le fait qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 de maladie pendant plus d'un an. L'intim\u00e9e r\u00e9torque qu'elle est tomb\u00e9e en cong\u00e9 de maladie le jour qui a suivi son retour au travail et qu'elle a continu\u00e9 de toucher sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration jusqu'au jour de son retour. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle n'a subi aucune perte salariale. Cette situation est bizarre \u00e0 maints \u00e9gards. La GRC a refus\u00e9 d'admettre ouvertement qu'elle avait exerc\u00e9 une discrimination \u00e0 l'endroit de la cap. Brown. Toutefois, elle lui a volontiers pay\u00e9 des cong\u00e9s de maladie, qui peuvent \u00eatre reli\u00e9s directement aux souffrances provoqu\u00e9es par la discrimination dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet.\n[94] La plaignante a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral. Elle a eu peine \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner et elle a encore vivement l'impression d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trahie. Le diff\u00e9rend a nui \u00e0 son bien-\u00eatre \u00e9motif, psychologique et physique. Elle a perdu confiance en elle et a \u00e9t\u00e9 atteinte de d\u00e9pression. Son mariage et sa famille ont souffert. J'aimerais entendre les opinions des parties quant \u00e0 l'importance de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments aux fins de l'\u00e9valuation des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n[95] Il y a des points en faveur de l'autre partie. \u00c0 mon avis, la GRC \u00e9tait en droit d'insister pour que la cap. Brown retourne au travail. Il n'\u00e9tait pas raisonnable que le cap. Brown exige que la plainte soit r\u00e9gl\u00e9e avant qu'elle r\u00e9int\u00e8gre ses fonctions. Tout processus institutionnel prend du temps, et l'employ\u00e9e ne pouvait s'attendre d'\u00eatre pay\u00e9e ind\u00e9finiment alors qu'elle refusait, somme toute, de travailler.\n[96] Je fais mienne l'observation de l'insp. Donovan selon laquelle la chose la plus importante pour r\u00e9tablir les ponts entre un employeur et un employ\u00e9 est de faire en sorte que l'employ\u00e9 revienne au travail. Le temps ne favorise pas le r\u00e9tablissement d'une relation de travail harmonieuse. Il est \u00e9vident d'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de la cap. Brown qu'elle se tire bien d'affaire dans son nouveau poste et que ce processus s'est \u00e0 tout le moins amorc\u00e9.\n[97] La plaignante soutient \u00e9galement que ses perspectives de carri\u00e8re au sein de la Gendarmerie se sont d\u00e9grad\u00e9es du fait qu'elle a ru\u00e9 dans les brancards. Cependant, je ne suis pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer que la Gendarmerie agira de mauvaise foi; compte tenu des r\u00e9pliques de l'intim\u00e9e, il me semble qu'elle a obtenu un poste tr\u00e8s convoit\u00e9 au sein de la Section int\u00e9gr\u00e9e des produits de la criminalit\u00e9. Je fais mienne l'observation de l'intim\u00e9e selon laquelle elle a obtenu un poste enviable.\n[98] On a fait valoir \u00e9galement que la cap. Brown a fait l'objet de comm\u00e9rages en milieu de travail. Cela est in\u00e9vitable, et la preuve indique que la GRC est contre l'id\u00e9e de d\u00e9battre en public de questions ayant trait au dossier personnel d'un officier. La Gendarmerie n'est pas responsable du comm\u00e9rage illicite des autres officiers et employ\u00e9s.\n(iv) D\u00e9pens [99] Dans une situation normale, je serais enclin \u00e0 adjuger \u00e0 la plaignante des d\u00e9pens raisonnables. L'intim\u00e9e m'a toutefois demand\u00e9 de r\u00e9server ma d\u00e9cision \u00e0 ce sujet, pour le motif que la plaignante aurait, semble-t-il, rejet\u00e9 une offre raisonnable de r\u00e8glement avant l'audience. Je crains toutefois que les faits pertinents \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard soient contest\u00e9s. Il se peut par ailleurs qu'il faille se pencher sur des questions de confidentialit\u00e9 ou de privil\u00e8ge. Je demanderais donc aux parties de m'indiquer si une preuve sera n\u00e9cessaire avant d'aller plus avant.\n[100] Il se peut qu'il faille examiner d'autres questions. Ainsi, la cap. Brown m'a demand\u00e9 d'ordonner \u00e0 la GRC de verser une copie de ma d\u00e9cision dans son dossier personnel. Il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable selon moi d'examiner cette requ\u00eate apr\u00e8s que j'aurai entendu les parties au sujet des questions en suspens en mati\u00e8re de redressement. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'invite les parties \u00e0 informer le Tribunal de la fa\u00e7on dont elles entendent proc\u00e9der. Je conserve ma comp\u00e9tence pour examiner toute question d\u00e9coulant de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nSign\u00e9e par\nPaul Groarke\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nle 4 f\u00e9vrier 2004\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT769\/1903\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nJacqueline Brown c.

Explication de l'intim\u00e9e\nV. REDRESSEMENT\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] La plaignante all\u00e8gue dans sa plainte que l'intim\u00e9e a refus\u00e9 de l'employer parce qu'elle est une personne transsexuelle. Elle all\u00e8gue que, ce faisant, l'intim\u00e9e a exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\n[2] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi ) dispose que le fait de refuser d'employer une personne en raison de son sexe constitue un acte discriminatoire (art. 3 et 7). Le certificat de naissance de la plaignante indique que cette derni\u00e8re est de sexe masculin. Dans le formulaire de plainte qu'elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en septembre 2001, la plaignante pr\u00e9tend qu'elle est une personne transsexuelle qui s'habille en femme et qu'elle \u00e9tait, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, dans une p\u00e9riode de transition pour devenir une femme. L'intim\u00e9e ne conteste pas la pr\u00e9tention de la plaignante voulant qu'une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e9tat de personne transgenderiste constitue une discrimination sexuelle aux termes de la Loi.\n[3] Cependant, \u00e0 l'ouverture de l'audience en l'esp\u00e8ce, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e a fait remarquer que dans une instance r\u00e9cente devant la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec mettant en cause la plaignante1, celle-ci a apparemment admis devant la Cour qu'elle n'avait plus l'intention de subir les interventions chirurgicales n\u00e9cessaires pour modifier ses organes sexuels. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e s'est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit de faire valoir, dans son plaidoyer final, que cette incoh\u00e9rence apparente par rapport aux all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans sa plainte peut susciter des doutes quant \u00e0 sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9.\nA. R\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 la plaignante dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision [4] La plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 partie \u00e0 des instances devant plusieurs cours - notamment la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec et la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec - portant sur des questions li\u00e9es au nom qu'elle est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 utiliser \u00e0 des fins d'identification personnelle. Dans les jugements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus dans ces affaires, on a utilis\u00e9 pour d\u00e9signer la plaignante tant\u00f4t le sexe f\u00e9minin tant\u00f4t le sexe masculin, selon l'organisme d\u00e9cisionnel. Par exemple, dans l'affaire Montreuil c. Directeur de l'\u00e9tat civil2, la juge Rousseau-Houle a utilis\u00e9 le genre f\u00e9minin, tandis que le juge Morin, faisant remarquer que la plaignante \u00e9tait encore physiquement un homme, a employ\u00e9 le genre masculin dans ses motifs dissidents.\n[5] En ce qui concerne cette question d'identit\u00e9 sexuelle, je trouve particuli\u00e8rement int\u00e9ressante l'analyse pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans Sheridan v. Sanctuary Investments Ltd. No. 33, instance portant sur une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par une personne transgenderiste. Le tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie-Britannique a fait observer qu'il existe chez certains individus une [TRADUCTION] discordance entre les divers indicateurs du sexe . En ce qui concerne les transsexuels, il peut exister une dissociation compl\u00e8te entre le sexe physique et l'exp\u00e9rience subjective de leur masculinit\u00e9 ou f\u00e9minit\u00e9.\n[6] L'intim\u00e9e ne s'est pas prononc\u00e9e dans un sens ou dans l'autre \u00e0 ce sujet. En revanche, la plaignante a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle d\u00e9sire qu'on utilise le genre f\u00e9minin lorsqu'on parle d'elle. Dans les circonstances, je ne vois aucune raison de ne pas acquiescer \u00e0 la demande de la plaignante. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'utiliserai dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision le genre f\u00e9minin pour d\u00e9signer la partie plaignante.\nB. Le r\u00f4le de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne \u00e0 l'audience [7] La Commission s'est content\u00e9e de pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l'ouverture de l'audience un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 des principes qui, selon elle, rev\u00eatent une importance cl\u00e9 pour l'instruction de la plainte. L'avocat de la Commission a quitt\u00e9 la salle d'audience imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir lu l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 en question et n'est pas revenu par la suite.\nII. FAITS A. Demande d'emploi de la plaignante [8] Les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents scolaires et professionnels de la plaignante sont vastes et vari\u00e9s. Elle est membre du Barreau du Qu\u00e9bec et est titulaire d'une ma\u00eetrise en administration des affaires de l'Universit\u00e9 Laval ainsi que d'un Dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es en ressources humaines, administration et organisation de l'Universit\u00e9 de Paris - Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne. En 1981, elle a suivi avec succ\u00e8s le cours sur les valeurs mobili\u00e8res offert par l'Institut canadien des valeurs mobili\u00e8res (ICVM). En plus de pratiquer le droit, elle a travaill\u00e9 comme conseill\u00e8re en gestion et enseign\u00e9 de nombreux cours de droit, d'\u00e9conomie, de finances et de gestion \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec et dans plusieurs coll\u00e8ges (C\u00c9GEPs). Dans les ann\u00e9es 70, elle a exploit\u00e9 son propre restaurant \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec. Elle est l'auteure de nombreuses publications et notamment de plusieurs articles portant sur l'industrie bancaire. Elle a m\u00eame servi dans l'Arm\u00e9e canadienne. Qu'il suffise de dire que la plaignante a accumul\u00e9 durant sa vie une vaste exp\u00e9rience.\n[9] La plaignante a v\u00e9cu la majeure partie de sa vie publique comme homme, sous le nom de Pierre Montreuil, tout en dissimulant son existence en tant que Micheline. Elle soutient qu'en 1997, le C\u00c9GEP de la ville de Qu\u00e9bec o\u00f9 elle travaillait comme charg\u00e9e de cours l'a renvoy\u00e9e parce qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vue en public, v\u00eatue en femme, dans un centre commercial local. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne plus cacher sa vraie identit\u00e9 et de commencer une nouvelle vie sous le nom de Micheline. Elle s'est d\u00e9partie de ses v\u00eatements masculins et a op\u00e9r\u00e9 dans sa vie un changement radical qui impliquait notamment une r\u00e9orientation professionnelle. Elle \u00e9tait alors convaincue que son renvoi l'emp\u00eacherait d\u00e9sormais d'enseigner dans le r\u00e9seau des C\u00c9GEPs.\n[10] La plaignante a senti le besoin de quitter Qu\u00e9bec pour s'\u00e9tablir dans un grand centre comme Montr\u00e9al. Elle percevait la ville de Qu\u00e9bec comme ayant une mentalit\u00e9 d'insulaire \u00e0 l'endroit des personnes comme elle. En revanche, elle percevait Montr\u00e9al comme une collectivit\u00e9 vaste et diverse o\u00f9 elle pourrait vivre sa vie davantage dans l'anonymat sans attirer autant d'attention n\u00e9gative. Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, elle a affirm\u00e9 qu'il est normal que des personnes qui sont en voie de changer de sexe tournent radicalement le dos \u00e0 leur pass\u00e9 et entreprennent une nouvelle vie, comme par exemple en d\u00e9m\u00e9nageant \u00e0 un autre endroit.\n[11] Par cons\u00e9quent, la plaignante a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de chercher un emploi en s'affichant d\u00e9sormais ouvertement comme femme dans un milieu totalement nouveau. Elle a vu dans l'\u00e9dition du 2 mai 1998 du journal La Presse une annonce plac\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e. Cette annonce indiquait que l'intim\u00e9e recrutait pour son centre d'appels (connu sous le nom de TelNat ) des travailleurs \u00e0 temps partiel (20 \u00e0 35 heures par semaine de cinq jours) qui pourraient \u00e9ventuellement acc\u00e9der \u00e0 des postes \u00e0 temps plein. L'intim\u00e9e faisait \u00e9tat d'un taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration d'au moins dix dollars l'heure. Les fonctions consistaient \u00e0 fournir des services \u00e0 la client\u00e8le et \u00e0 vendre des produits bancaires. Les candidats devaient poss\u00e9der au moins un dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes coll\u00e9giales, \u00eatre bilingues et avoir de l'exp\u00e9rience dans le service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le ou la vente. L'annonce pr\u00e9cisait que l'intim\u00e9e offrait des possibilit\u00e9s de carri\u00e8re \u00e0 la hauteur des comp\u00e9tences de l'employ\u00e9(e), ainsi qu'une formation continue, un bel environnement de travail et un plan de r\u00e9muneration concurrentiel. Le lieu de travail indiqu\u00e9 pour ces postes \u00e9tait Montr\u00e9al. L'intim\u00e9e terminait son annonce en exhortant les personnes d\u00e9sireuses de relever un d\u00e9fi et de faire carri\u00e8re au sein d'une entreprise de grande envergure \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une demande. Tout nouvel agent de TelNat \u00e9tait soumis \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode de stage de six mois au cours de laquelle l'intim\u00e9e pouvait \u00e0 son gr\u00e9 le renvoyer. Toutefois, cette condition d'emploi n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e dans l'annonce.\n[12] La plaignante a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l'annonce par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, apr\u00e8s quoi elle a fait parvenir une version d'une page de son curriculum vit\u00e6 ainsi que des photocopies de son passeport, de son permis de conduire et de sa carte d'assurance sociale. Le nom qui figure sur ces derniers documents est Micheline Montreuil ou, dans le cas du passeport, Micheline Pierre Montreuil. Sur les photographies qui accompagnent ces documents, elle pr\u00e9sente une apparence qu'on associe habituellement au sexe f\u00e9minin. Toutefois, selon son permis de conduire et son passeport, elle appartient au sexe masculin.\n[13] La plaignante avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 postul\u00e9 diff\u00e9rents emplois dans des \u00e9tablissements bancaires, mais ceux qu'offrait l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9taient particuli\u00e8rement attrayants \u00e0 ses yeux. L'annonce pr\u00e9cisait que l'intim\u00e9e avait un effectif de 16 000 personnes et offrait la possibilit\u00e9 de faire carri\u00e8re au sein de l'entreprise. La plaignante savait que le taux de roulement parmi les employ\u00e9s des centres d'appels \u00e9tait relativement \u00e9lev\u00e9. Elle estimait qu'en tant qu'avocate ayant des comp\u00e9tences dans le domaine bancaire et dans celui des valeurs mobili\u00e8res, elle pourrait gravir les \u00e9chelons assez rapidement au sein de la banque et peut-\u00eatre se joindre \u00e0 son service du contentieux apr\u00e8s quelques ann\u00e9es.\nB. Premi\u00e8re entrevue [14] L'intim\u00e9e a invit\u00e9 la plaignante et une trentaine d'autres candidats \u00e0 participer le 22 mai 1998 \u00e0 une entrevue de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection dans ses bureaux de la rue Metcalfe, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. \u00c0 son arriv\u00e9e, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9e de remplir un formulaire de demande. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 sur le formulaire qu'elle avait quitt\u00e9 l'emploi qu'elle occupait au C\u00c9GEP parce qu'elle souhaitait changer sa vie compl\u00e8tement et r\u00e9orienter sa carri\u00e8re professionnelle. Dans l'espace r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ajout d'autres renseignements qui seraient utiles \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation de sa candidature, la plaignante a \u00e9crit qu'elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire un gros changement dans sa vie et qu'elle esp\u00e9rait que l'intim\u00e9e l'aiderait \u00e0 concr\u00e9tiser ce changement. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle devait commencer au bas de l'\u00e9chelle pour monter . Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la politique d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en emploi de l'intim\u00e9e, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9e de remplir un questionnaire d'auto-identification. Bien qu'elle ne se soit pas identifi\u00e9e comme membre d'un des groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s (Autochtones, minorit\u00e9 visible ou personnes handicap\u00e9es), elle a inscrit, sous la rubrique Autre , qu'elle \u00e9tait une personne transgenderiste.\n[15] Une fois le formulaire rempli, l'intim\u00e9e a soumis la plaignante \u00e0 une entrevue dite exploratoire . Le rapport de l'interrogateur pr\u00e9cisait que sa candidature \u00e9tait accept\u00e9e, ce qui signifiait qu'elle pourrait participer \u00e0 la prochaine \u00e9tape du processus d'\u00e9valuation. Il \u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9 dans le rapport que la plaignante \u00e9tait un cas particulier et avait une motivation hors du commun. Apr\u00e8s l'entrevue, la plaignante a subi une batterie de tests : test de mise en situation, test de raisonnement num\u00e9rique et test de personnalit\u00e9. La plaignante a r\u00e9ussi les deux premiers tests. Elle soutient avoir r\u00e9ussi \u00e9galement le test de personnalit\u00e9 \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape, mais je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 de la chose. La fiche synth\u00e8se \u00e9tablie apr\u00e8s cette \u00e9tape du processus d'\u00e9valuation indiquait que plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s par le test de personnalit\u00e9 devaient \u00eatre v\u00e9rifi\u00e9s plus en d\u00e9tail durant la derni\u00e8re entrevue que devaient mener les gestionnaires de TelNat. Cependant, il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'on ne pourrait se fonder sur ces seuls \u00e9l\u00e9ments pour rejeter une candidature. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments en question \u00e9taient son \u00e9motivit\u00e9 (empathie et sens de l'urgence) et sa d\u00e9sirabilit\u00e9 sociale .\nC. Deuxi\u00e8me entrevue [16] Une fois qu'un candidat a franchi l'\u00e9tape de la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection, l'intim\u00e9e l'invite g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 une derni\u00e8re entrevue, que m\u00e8ne le gestionnaire qui dirige le service qui recrute. Cependant, en l'esp\u00e8ce, la directrice du service des ressources humaines de l'intim\u00e9e, Suzanne Girard, a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 nouveau aux bureaux de la rue Metcalfe pour une deuxi\u00e8me entrevue ou, si on pr\u00e9f\u00e8re, pour une entrevue interm\u00e9diaire, avant de se soumettre \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re entrevue. \u00c0 la demande de Mme Girard, Lisette Cloutier, qui dirigeait le service des ressources humaines de TelNat, a \u00e9galement particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'entrevue interm\u00e9diaire, qui a eu lieu le 8 juillet 1998. Mme Cloutier a expliqu\u00e9 au cours de son t\u00e9moignage que l'intim\u00e9e tient une entrevue interm\u00e9diaire dans certains cas - particuli\u00e8rement lorsque le profil du candidat exige de v\u00e9rifier plus en profondeur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments tels que le niveau d'instruction, le nombre d'ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience ou m\u00eame la situation personnelle . Mme Cloutier n'a pu pr\u00e9ciser la raison pr\u00e9cise pour laquelle Mme Girard a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de convoquer la plaignante \u00e0 une telle entrevue, et Mme Girard n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e comme t\u00e9moin durant l'audience pour fournir des explications suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[17] L'entrevue a dur\u00e9 environ deux heures. Au dire tant de Mme Cloutier que de la plaignante, elle s'est bien d\u00e9roul\u00e9e dans l'ensemble. Mme Cloutier a trouv\u00e9 que la plaignante \u00e9tait courtoise et s'exprimait bien. Selon elle, la plaignante n'a pas affich\u00e9 une attitude arrogante \u00e0 l'entrevue. Les interrogatrices ont discut\u00e9 avec la plaignante de ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents scolaires et professionnels, puis lui ont demand\u00e9 pourquoi elle s'int\u00e9ressait \u00e0 un poste aussi peu \u00e9lev\u00e9, compte tenu de ses vastes comp\u00e9tences. La plaignante a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle voyait l'emploi offert par TelNat comme une occasion de mettre les pieds dans l'entreprise et qu'elle nourrissait l'espoir de pouvoir gravir les \u00e9chelons au fil du temps. Mme Cloutier a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle avait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 cette r\u00e9ponse comme \u00e9tant correcte . Elle a dit \u00e0 la plaignante que, pour obtenir de l'avancement au sein de la banque, elle devait \u00eatre pr\u00eate \u00e0 demeurer deux ou trois ans au poste d'entr\u00e9e. La plaignante a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 accepter cette condition et m\u00eame \u00e0 faire des heures de travail prolong\u00e9es, si n\u00e9cessaire.\n[18] Selon la plaignante, il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident d'apr\u00e8s son apparence physique qu'elle \u00e9tait une personne transgenderiste. Afin de dissiper tout malentendu, elle a demand\u00e9 franchement si sa situation posait probl\u00e8me \u00e0 l'employeur. Mme Cloutier a expliqu\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait elle qui s'occupait des cas particuliers , et elle a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante l'assurance que l'intim\u00e9e appliquait une politique d'emploi sans aucune discrimination. La plaignante a jug\u00e9 opportun \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 de remettre aux interrogatrices un document d'une page intitul\u00e9 Firms that officially accept Transgendered\" qui \u00e9num\u00e8re les multinationales ayant leur si\u00e8ge aux \u00c9tats-Unis qui ont adopt\u00e9 des politiques lib\u00e9rales et ouvertes vis-\u00e0-vis des personnes transgenderistes. Parmi les entreprises mentionn\u00e9es dans la liste figurait la Chase Bank. La liste en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise \u00e0 la plaignante par une connaissance vivant aux \u00c9tats-Unis qui a milit\u00e9 en faveur de l'avancement des droits des personnes transgenderistes. La plaignante a dit qu'elle avait remis le document \u00e0 Mmes Cloutier et Girard afin de rassurer l'intim\u00e9e en lui montrant qu'elle ne serait pas la seule grande entreprise \u00e0 adopter une politique d'ouverture \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des personnes transgenderistes.\n[19] Mme Cloutier a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 le geste de la plaignante de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente. Elle s'est demand\u00e9e si la plaignante d\u00e9sirait vraiment travailler comme employ\u00e9e dans un centre d'appels ou si sa v\u00e9ritable intention n'\u00e9tait pas de se faire embaucher pour promouvoir l'int\u00e9gration des personnes transgenderistes au sein de l'organisation. Cependant, ni Mme Cloutier ni m\u00eame Mme Girard n'a \u00e0 aucun moment interrog\u00e9 ouvertement la plaignante au sujet de ces pr\u00e9occupations. Les interrogatrices ont finalement conclu que la plaignante r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 tous les crit\u00e8res fondamentaux et que sa demande d'emploi devrait \u00eatre soumise en vue de l'\u00e9tape suivante - l'\u00e9tape finale - du processus d'\u00e9valuation. Environ deux semaines plus tard, Mme Cloutier a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante pour lui annoncer qu'elle avait r\u00e9ussi la deuxi\u00e8me entrevue.\nD. Troisi\u00e8me entrevue [20] Le 12 ao\u00fbt 1998, Lise Roy, la superviseure de la section du contr\u00f4le de la qualit\u00e9 chez TelNat, a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante pour l'inviter \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me et derni\u00e8re entrevue. Durant la conversation, Mme Roy a discut\u00e9 avec la plaignante de certaines conditions d'emploi, notamment la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, l'horaire de travail, la formation n\u00e9cessaire et les p\u00e9riodes de stage. Selon Mme Roy, on discute habituellement de ces questions avec toutes les candidates au cours de ces appels. La plaignante se souvient d'avoir expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Roy qu'elle d\u00e9m\u00e9nagerait de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al dans le cas o\u00f9 l'intim\u00e9e lui offrirait un poste.\n[21] L'entrevue s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e le 20 ao\u00fbt 1998 dans les bureaux de TelNat au si\u00e8ge social de l'intim\u00e9e, au 500, Place d'Armes, dans le Vieux-Montr\u00e9al. La plaignante a rencontr\u00e9 Mme Roy et Jos\u00e9e Lecompte, qui \u00e9tait chef d'\u00e9quipe chez TelNat. Selon Mme Roy, l'entrevue s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e de la fa\u00e7on habituelle. Durant la premi\u00e8re partie, qu'elle a qualifi\u00e9e de formelle, les interrogatrices ont pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante des questions visant \u00e0 \u00e9valuer son int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du poste et \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si elle \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 l'occuper. Ensuite, il y a eu une discussion informelle au cours de laquelle les interrogatrices ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante si elle avait des questions \u00e0 leur poser. Cette deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape visait \u00e0 d\u00e9tendre l'atmosph\u00e8re et \u00e0 amener la candidate \u00e0 faire un brin de conversation. Les candidats n'\u00e9taient pas tenus de poser des questions et certains s'abstenaient d'ailleurs de le faire. Il semble qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas obligatoire de participer aux conversations informelles pour \u00eatre embauch\u00e9. Toutefois, dans le cas de la plaignante, il y a bel et bien eu un \u00e9change informel qui, selon Mme Roy, s'apparentait \u00e0 un bla-bla-bla entre femmes.\n[22] Au dire de la plaignante, l'entrevue a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s positive. On lui a expliqu\u00e9 que les fonctions initiales du poste (au sein du service Ligne Express de TelNat) consistaient \u00e0 fournir aux clients de l'intim\u00e9e par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone des renseignements (p. ex., le solde de leur compte). Une fois que l'employ\u00e9 avait acquis une certaine exp\u00e9rience, on l'affectait aux appels plus complexes. Selon la plaignante, les interrogatrices, apr\u00e8s avoir constat\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait titulaire d'une ma\u00eetrise en administration des affaires et qu'elle avait suivi le cours en valeurs mobili\u00e8res de l'ICVM, l'ont inform\u00e9e qu'elle serait susceptible d'\u00eatre promue \u00e0 la direction des pr\u00eats et des placements au sein du service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le. \u00c0 la fin de l'entrevue, la plaignante s'est fait dire qu'elle recevrait une r\u00e9ponse dans un d\u00e9lai de deux \u00e0 trois semaines. Elle affirme qu'on lui a montr\u00e9 l'aire de travail de TelNat et qu'on lui a dit que c'est \u00e0 cet endroit qu'elle travaillerait. Au sortir de l'entrevue, elle \u00e9tait convaincue qu'elle serait embauch\u00e9e pour le poste.\n[23] Mme Roy et Mme Lecompte nient avoir indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante \u00e0 quel endroit elle travaillerait ou lui avoir m\u00eame donn\u00e9 \u00e0 entendre qu'elle allait \u00eatre embauch\u00e9e. Elles ont affirm\u00e9 au cours de leur t\u00e9moignage qu'elles s'\u00e9taient assises pour discuter de la candidature de la plaignante imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9part. Elles ont alors convenu d'indiquer au service des ressources humaines qu'il serait hasardeux d'embaucher la plaignante. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que Mme Lecompte, qui avait pris des notes durant l'entrevue, dactylographierait un compte rendu \u00e9non\u00e7ant les motifs de leur d\u00e9cision. Ce n'\u00e9tait pas la coutume de r\u00e9diger un tel compte rendu; toutefois, elles ont senti le besoin de le faire en l'occurrence, en raison de certaines remarques formul\u00e9es par la plaignante. Le compte rendu en question est reproduit ci-apr\u00e8s dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9. Il n'a fait l'objet d'aucune modification en ce qui touche les passages soulign\u00e9s ou mis en \u00e9vidence.\nMADAME MICHELINE MONTREUIL\n01 septembre 98\nObjet:\nCompte-rendu de l'entrevue du 25 ao\u00fbt 98 au centre d'appels Telnat, en pr\u00e9sence de Jos\u00e9e Lecompte et Lise G. Roy. L'entrevue s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e en deux volets.\nq Entrevue dite formelle\nAu cours de cette entrevue, Madame Montreuil nous a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait en mesure de suivre notre formation et d'occuper un poste de repr\u00e9sentante au service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le de Telnat.\n\u00c0 notre avis, la candidate \u00e9tait surqualifi\u00e9e pour un poste de repr\u00e9sentante sur la Ligne Express. De part ses habilet\u00e9s, ses connaissances et son exp\u00e9rience, elle nous a apparu \u00eatre une candidate apte \u00e0 occuper un poste \u00e0 un secteur de services financiers. Cependant, nous avons per\u00e7u un ton condescendant, m\u00eame suffisant, nous ayant mentionn\u00e9: Si la Banque ne reconna\u00eet pas mes capacit\u00e9s, un concurrent viendra me chercher.\nq Entrevue, discussion libre\nNous voulions sensibiliser Madame Montreuil en ce qui a trait \u00e0 sa surqualification, compte tenu de son exp\u00e9rience, et clarifier la possibilit\u00e9 que le poste puisse lui sembler inappropri\u00e9.\nEt c'est sur cette lanc\u00e9e qu'elle nous a mentionn\u00e9 les diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9tapes de quarante derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es dans les institutions financi\u00e8res en faisant allusion au racisme, au sexisme et autres discriminations.\nElle se voyait elle-m\u00eame ambassadrice de son `type' dans l'industrie bancaire et mentionnait: Dans les ann\u00e9es 50, non sans difficult\u00e9, les femmes ont joint le march\u00e9 du travail. \u00c0 la suite de ces derni\u00e8res, dans les ann\u00e9es 60, les Italiens et les Grecs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9s dans les entreprises. Dans les ann\u00e9es 70, les Noirs et les Chinois faisaient leur entr\u00e9e. C'est ensuite, dans les ann\u00e9es 80, que les Gais \u00e9taient accept\u00e9s. Maintenant, c'est \u00e0 mon tour, au m\u00eame titre que les Martiens qui surprendront \u00e9galement tout le monde en 2010 avec leur petites antennes et leur corps vert.\nSur un ton de plaisanterie, elle a ajout\u00e9 :\n\u00ab Les portes, je les ouvre, mais je peux aussi les d\u00e9foncer.\u00bb\nElle nous a fait \u00e9galement part de son passage au sein de Forces canadiennes et nous a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une photo o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait v\u00eatue en soldat avant la transformation physique qu'elle a subi.\nLa discussion s'est poursuivie et Madame Montreuil nous a demand\u00e9 o\u00f9 se situait le palais de justice car elle devait s'y rendre pour plaider sa cause en ce qui concerne le changement de nom qu'elle a demand\u00e9 (c'est-\u00e0-dire de Michel Montreuil \u00e0 Micheline Montreuil).\nElle nous a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet :\n\u00ab Je les aurai \u00e0 l'usure ... je suis tenace.\u00bb\nL'entrevue s'est conclue sur une note d'humour de la part de Madame Montreuil.\nSachant que Jos\u00e9e Lecompte avait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 membre des Forces canadiennes, elle a termin\u00e9: On peut dire que l'Arm\u00e9e forme de belles et grandes femmes!\n\u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les propos tenus par Madame Montreuil, nous croyons qu'il serait hasardeux de lui offrir un poste de repr\u00e9sentant au service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le.\nLise Roy, Directrice d'\u00e9quipe Jos\u00e9e Lecompte, Directrice d'\u00e9quipe\nMme Roy et Mme Lecompte ont indiqu\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage qu'en \u00e9crivant qu'il serait hasardeux d'offrir un poste \u00e0 la plaignante, elles recommandaient en fait de ne pas l'embaucher.\n[24] La plaignante s'est inscrite en faux contre la mani\u00e8re dont ses pr\u00e9tendues remarques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans le compte rendu. Elle a relev\u00e9 dans le texte plusieurs erreurs qui font douter de l'exactitude des faits et des d\u00e9clarations dont il fait \u00e9tat. Par exemple, il est possible que la plaignante ait parl\u00e9 aux interrogatrices du litige en instance concernant sa requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire changer officiellement son nom, mais elle nie avoir jamais demand\u00e9 comment se rendre au Palais de justice de Montr\u00e9al. La plaignante a fait remarquer qu'elle est all\u00e9e au Palais de justice de Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises durant sa carri\u00e8re d'avocate et qu'elle sait parfaitement o\u00f9 il se trouve. De plus, sa requ\u00eate avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e devant la Cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec et non \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Elle a \u00e9galement fait observer que le nom qu'elle voulait faire modifier n'\u00e9tait pas Michel, comme l'indiquait le compte rendu, mais bien Pierre. La plaignante a indiqu\u00e9 que ces erreurs sont la preuve que le compte rendu ne rend pas compte fid\u00e8lement des observations qu'elle a formul\u00e9es durant l'entrevue, laissant entendre qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e hors contexte.\n[25] De m\u00eame, la plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une version quelque peu diff\u00e9rente du commentaire qu'elle aurait formul\u00e9 au sujet de l'embauche de membres de diverses minorit\u00e9s visibles au sein du secteur bancaire. Elle a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que cette partie de la conversation a \u00e9t\u00e9 beaucoup plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9e et qu'elle avait indiqu\u00e9 qu'au cours des 40 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, un groupe minoritaire apr\u00e8s l'autre avait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 s'int\u00e9grer dans l'industrie, malgr\u00e9 le mouvement de r\u00e9sistance initial attribuable \u00e0 id\u00e9es fausses et \u00e0 des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s. Elle a soutenu que sa remarque \u00e0 propos des Martiens qui pourraient un jour chercher eux aussi \u00e0 s'y faire int\u00e9grer avait pour but d'illustrer, avec une pointe d'humour, comment les entreprises s'adaptent constamment aux besoins de divers groupes au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. La plaignante a soulign\u00e9 le fait que cette conversation a eu lieu durant l'entrevue libre - la partie de la rencontre que Mme Roy a qualifi\u00e9e de bla-bla-bla entre femmes.\n[26] La plaignante n'avait jamais vu ce compte rendu avant l'audience; en fait, l'intim\u00e9e ne lui a divulgu\u00e9 le document qu'apr\u00e8s qu'elle eut commenc\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage.\nE. Communication \u00e0 la plaignante du refus de l'embaucher [27] Le 10 septembre 1998, soit exactement trois semaines apr\u00e8s la troisi\u00e8me entrevue de la plaignante, l'intim\u00e9e n'avait toujours pas communiqu\u00e9 avec cette derni\u00e8re pour lui indiquer si elle \u00e9tait embauch\u00e9e. Cependant, un \u00e9v\u00e9nement tr\u00e8s important dans la vie de la plaignante est survenu ce jour-l\u00e0. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec a rendu un jugement confirmant la d\u00e9cision de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'assurance automobile du Qu\u00e9bec (SAAQ) de supprimer le nom de Micheline sur son permis de conduire. \u00c0 l'insu de la plaignante et, en fait, avant qu'elle ait elle-m\u00eame eu vent de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour, deux journaux de Qu\u00e9bec ont publi\u00e9 le matin m\u00eame des articles au sujet de la d\u00e9cision rendue. Dans le courant de la journ\u00e9e, d'autres journaux ainsi qu'une foule de stations de radio et de r\u00e9seaux de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision de diverses r\u00e9gions de la province ont communiqu\u00e9 avec elle. Elle s'est pli\u00e9e \u00e0 toutes les demandes d'interview. Elle jugeait important de pr\u00e9senter sa version des faits, sachant tr\u00e8s bien que son \u00e9tat de personne transgenderiste qui, de surcro\u00eet, est avocat de profession pr\u00eate facilement au sensationnalisme. Elle a \u00e9galement fait remarquer que les premiers articles de journaux qui ont paru ne pr\u00e9sentaient pas son point de vue sur les questions soulev\u00e9es et contenaient plusieurs erreurs importantes.\n[28] La plaignante a dit qu'elle n'avait jamais communiqu\u00e9 auparavant avec la presse au sujet des proc\u00e9dures concernant son changement de nom, tout en soulignant qu'elle n'avait pas sollicit\u00e9 la couverture dont elle a fait l'objet \u00e0 la suite de la publication de la d\u00e9cision le 10 septembre. Toutefois, elle a reconnu n'avoir refus\u00e9 aucune demande d'interview des m\u00e9dias. D'autres articles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9s \u00e0 son sujet au cours du mois d'octobre 1998 et, le 7 octobre 1998, elle a fait la manchette du Journal de Montr\u00e9al et du Journal de Qu\u00e9bec. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9e dans le cadre de diverses \u00e9missions de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision populaires ( Point J , JE en direct , etc.).\n[29] Durant toute cette p\u00e9riode, la plaignante n'avait toujours pas re\u00e7u de nouvelles de la part de l'intim\u00e9e au sujet de sa demande d'emploi. Le 14 octobre, elle s'est rendue au si\u00e8ge social de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la Place d'Armes, soit l'endroit o\u00f9 s'\u00e9tait tenue sa troisi\u00e8me entrevue, et a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 parler \u00e0 Mme Roy. La plaignante s'est fait dire que Mme Roy n'\u00e9tait pas disponible et qu'elle recevrait par la poste une r\u00e9ponse le ou avant le 19 octobre. En d\u00e9pit de ces assurances, la plaignante n'a re\u00e7u aucune correspondance de la part de l'intim\u00e9e au cours du mois d'octobre. Entre-temps, elle a remarqu\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e continuait de faire para\u00eetre dans le journal La Presse l'annonce qu'elle avait vue en mai \u00e0 propos du recrutement de nouveaux employ\u00e9s pour son centre d'appels TelNat.\n[30] Le 10 novembre 1998, la plaignante s'est rendue au centre de recrutement de l'intim\u00e9e dans ses bureaux de la rue Metcalfe, o\u00f9 avaient eu lieu ses deux premi\u00e8res entrevues. On lui a fix\u00e9 un rendez-vous en vue d'une rencontre avec Mme Girard plus tard cette semaine-l\u00e0. Entre-temps, la plaignante a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 et livr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e une lettre de trois pages d\u00e9crivant en d\u00e9tail chacune de ses interactions avec l'intim\u00e9e depuis la pr\u00e9sentation de sa demande d'emploi. \u00c0 la fin de sa lettre, la plaignante demandait qu'on veuille bien lui indiquer o\u00f9 en \u00e9tait sa demande d'emploi. Elle affirmait, en termes non \u00e9quivoques, qu'elle d\u00e9sirait travailler pour l'intim\u00e9e. Elle se disait pr\u00eate \u00e0 occuper n'importe quel poste pour lequel elle avait les comp\u00e9tences voulues selon l'intim\u00e9e, pr\u00e9cisant qu'elle comprenait que la plupart des postes autres que ceux qui sont au niveau d'entr\u00e9e sont combl\u00e9s gr\u00e2ce au recrutement interne. Elle faisait remarquer que c'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la raison pour laquelle elle souhaitait obtenir un poste chez l'intim\u00e9e au niveau d'entr\u00e9e, peu importe la faible r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration qui s'y rattache.\n[31] Lorsque la plaignante s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 son rendez-vous avec Mme Girard le 13 novembre, cette derni\u00e8re lui a dit qu'une d\u00e9cision avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise et qu'elle recevrait une r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite sous peu. En fait, la plaignante a effectivement re\u00e7u \u00e0 son domicile une lettre de l'intim\u00e9e en date du 6 novembre 1998, mais elle a soutenu ne pas l'avoir re\u00e7ue avant le 18 ou 19 novembre. Dans sa lettre, l'intim\u00e9e explique, dans deux courts paragraphes, qu'apr\u00e8s avoir interview\u00e9 la plaignante, elle n'a malheureusement pas pu retenir sa candidature parce que ses comp\u00e9tences ne rencontraient pas les exigences du poste. Fait int\u00e9ressant, la lettre est adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Monsieur Pierre Montreuil et non \u00e0 Micheline Montreuil .\n[32] La plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 grandement offusqu\u00e9e par l'utilisation de ce nom, faisant valoir \u00e0 l'audience que cela d\u00e9montrait que la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9e par la couverture m\u00e9diatique dont elle avait fait l'objet. Dans tous les documents qu'elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, elle n'avait jamais utilis\u00e9 le pr\u00e9nom de Pierre - uniquement celui de Micheline . Cependant, la preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu'un rapport \u00e9tabli \u00e0 la suite de la v\u00e9rification d'ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents effectu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e au moment o\u00f9 la plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 initialement sa demande d'emploi indiquait que son nom \u00e0 la naissance \u00e9tait Pierre Montreuil . L'intim\u00e9e a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu'elle a simplement jug\u00e9 opportun de s'adresser \u00e0 la plaignante par son nom officiel, tel qu'il figurait dans les registres \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 que l'usage du pr\u00e9nom de Pierre dans la lettre t\u00e9moigne du d\u00e9sir de l'intim\u00e9e d'insulter la plaignante, ou que cela prouve que sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas l'embaucher r\u00e9sultait de la publicit\u00e9 \u00e0 son sujet.\n[33] \u00c0 la date du 4 mars 1999, la plaignante avait \u00e9crit \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e pas moins de trois lettres demandant des nouvelles au sujet de sa demande d'emploi. Dans aucune de ces lettres, elle ne reconna\u00eet avoir re\u00e7u la lettre de refus de l'intim\u00e9e en date du 6 novembre 1998. La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle n'avait jamais pens\u00e9 que cette lettre lui \u00e9tait destin\u00e9e puisqu'elle \u00e9tait adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Monsieur Pierre Montreuil. Le 16 mars 1999, la plaignante a re\u00e7u une autre lettre de l'intim\u00e9e, sign\u00e9e celle-l\u00e0 par le vice-pr\u00e9sident (Ressources humaines), Santo Alborino. Cette lettre, qui \u00e9tait adress\u00e9e pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 Madame Micheline Montreuil, indiquait qu'une r\u00e9ponse lui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise (la lettre du 6 novembre) et que, par cons\u00e9quent, l'intim\u00e9e consid\u00e9rait le dossier comme \u00e9tant clos.\n[34] Le 13 avril 1999, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re version de sa plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. La Commission a initialement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la plainte \u00e9tait inadmissible du fait que la plaignante ne l'avait pas fait enregistrer sous son nom l\u00e9gal, tel qu'il figurait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque dans les registres. La plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et a obtenu gain de cause. La Cour a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission d'admettre la plainte de la plaignante. Elle a \u00e9galement ordonn\u00e9 que la plainte soit r\u00e9dig\u00e9e en utilisant le nom de Joseph Yves Pierre Papineau Montreuil, connu sous le nom de Micheline Montreuil . La plainte dont je suis saisi et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'ordonnance a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e et d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission le 4 septembre 2001. Le 15 avril 2003, le Tribunal a accord\u00e9 la demande de la plaignante de modifier l'intitul\u00e9 de cause afin de l'identifier uniquement sous le nom de Micheline Montreuil .\n[35] Depuis le 3 juin 2002, la plaignante travaille comme agent des recouvrements d'imp\u00f4t au centre d'appels du minist\u00e8re du Revenu du Qu\u00e9bec. Ses fonctions consistent \u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner aux contribuables qui ont des imp\u00f4ts impay\u00e9s et \u00e0 prendre des dispositions en vue du recouvrement des sommes dues. Aucun d\u00e9tail ne m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni quant aux emplois que la plaignante a pu occuper avant cette date.\nIII. CADRE JURIDIQUE [36] En vertu de la Loi, le fait de refuser d'embaucher une personne en raison de son sexe (art. 3 et 7) constitue un acte discriminatoire. Dans Kavanagh c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada4, une affaire mettant en cause une transsexuelle au stade postop\u00e9ratoire, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a statu\u00e9 que la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le transsexualisme constitue une discrimination sexuelle. Dans l'affaire Sheridan5 en Colombie-Britannique, qui avait trait \u00e0 une transsexuelle au stade pr\u00e9op\u00e9ratoire, une conclusion similaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9e. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9e ne conteste pas le principe selon lequel le refus d'embaucher une personne en raison de son \u00e9tat de personne transgenderiste constitue une discrimination sexuelle.\n[37] Il incombe, dit-on, \u00e0 la partie plaignante d'\u00e9tablir l'existence d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination6. Dans ce contexte, la preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e. Une fois que l'existence d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il revient \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de fournir une explication raisonnable de la conduite qui serait par ailleurs discriminatoire. Si une telle explication est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, la partie plaignante doit d\u00e9montrer que celle-ci ne constitue qu'un pr\u00e9texte et que la conduite de l'employeur \u00e9tait effectivement empreinte de discrimination7.\n[38] Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires soient le seul motif des actes reproch\u00e9s pour que la plainte soit jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e. Il suffit que la discrimination ait \u00e9t\u00e9 l'un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ont motiv\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de l'employeur8. La norme de preuve dans les affaires de discrimination est la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s.\n[39] Dans Basi9, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a affirm\u00e9 que la discrimination s'exerce souvent de mani\u00e8re subtile. Il a ajout\u00e9 que rares sont en fait les cas de discrimination o\u00f9 l'on peut d\u00e9montrer gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une preuve directe que la discrimination est exerc\u00e9e \u00e0 dessein. Le tribunal doit tenir compte de toutes les circonstances afin de d\u00e9terminer s'il existe de subtiles odeurs de discrimination .\n[40] Dans le contexte de l'emploi, deux crit\u00e8res ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9s dans la jurisprudence, servant \u00e0 guider le tribunal dans la d\u00e9termination de l'existence ou non d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination10. Le premier de ces crit\u00e8res a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9fini dans Shakes c. Rex Pak Ltd11. Dans cette affaire, la commission d'enqu\u00eate de l'Ontario a statu\u00e9 que, pour \u00e9tablir l'existence d'une preuve prima facie, il faut prouver :\nque le plaignant avait les comp\u00e9tences voulues pour l'emploi dont il s'agit; que le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9; qu'une personne qui n'\u00e9tait pas plus comp\u00e9tente, mais qui ne pr\u00e9sentait pas le trait distinctif \u00e0 l'origine de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, a obtenu le poste.\n[41] Dans Israeli c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne12, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 un deuxi\u00e8me crit\u00e8re qui s'applique aux situations o\u00f9 le plaignant a les comp\u00e9tences requises mais n'est pas embauch\u00e9 et o\u00f9 l'employeur continue de chercher un candidat comp\u00e9tent. Dans ces cas-l\u00e0, il faut, pour \u00e9tablir l'existence d'une preuve prima facie, d\u00e9montrer :\nque le plaignant appartient \u00e0 l'un des groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s dans la Loi; que le plaignant a pos\u00e9 sa candidature \u00e0 un poste pour lequel il \u00e9tait comp\u00e9tent et que l'employeur d\u00e9sirait combler; que, m\u00eame s'il \u00e9tait comp\u00e9tent, le plaignant a vu sa candidature rejet\u00e9e; que, par la suite, l'employeur a continu\u00e9 de chercher des candidats poss\u00e9dant les comp\u00e9tences du plaignant.\n[42] Dans plusieurs d\u00e9cisions subs\u00e9quentes rendues par le TCDP, il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que, bien que les crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans les affaires Shakes et Israeli soient des guides utiles, aucun des deux ne devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 d'office de mani\u00e8re rigide et arbitraire dans une affaire d'embauchage13. Il faut tenir compte des circonstances entourant chaque affaire pour d\u00e9terminer s'il convient d'appliquer, en tout ou en partie, l'un ou l'autre crit\u00e8re.\nIV. ANALYSE A. Preuve prima facie [43] La plaignante a postul\u00e9 l'emploi en mai 1998. Si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e, elle serait entr\u00e9e en fonctions en m\u00eame temps que de nombreuses autres nouvelles recrues qui devaient recevoir une formation d'environ une semaine en septembre et commencer \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des appels peu de temps apr\u00e8s. Il ne semble pas qu'il y avait un nombre d\u00e9termin\u00e9 de postes \u00e0 pourvoir. Au contraire, l'intim\u00e9e faisait passer r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des annonces en vue de recruter de nouveaux employ\u00e9s de TelNat. Le taux de roulement annuel chez TelNat se situait entre 20 % et 30 %, d'o\u00f9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pour l'intim\u00e9e de chercher constamment \u00e0 pourvoir des postes pour \u00eatre en mesure de servir ses clients. De plus, TelNat prenait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de l'expansion, situation qui, peut-on pr\u00e9sumer, exigeait la pr\u00e9sence d'un nombre croissant de repr\u00e9sentants au service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le. Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que certains membres de la cohorte de candidats dont faisait partie la plaignante ont \u00e9ventuellement \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s, l'intim\u00e9e a continu\u00e9 par la suite de chercher d'autres candidats.\n[44] Le crit\u00e8re Shakes semble s'appliquer aux cas o\u00f9 un plaignant rivalise avec d'autres candidats pour l'obtention d'un ou plusieurs postes particuliers. Cependant, il ne semble pas qu'il puisse s'appliquer aux situations permanentes de recrutement, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que, peu importe si les personnes embauch\u00e9es \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 ne pr\u00e9sentent pas le trait distinctif du plaignant, il existe d'autres postes \u00e0 pourvoir, pour lesquels le plaignant pourrait \u00eatre \u00e9ventuellement embauch\u00e9. En revanche, le crit\u00e8re Israeli, compte tenu de son quatri\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment, s'applique aux situations o\u00f9 l'employeur continue de chercher des candidats. Par cons\u00e9quent, le crit\u00e8re Israeli est mieux adapt\u00e9 aux faits dont je suis saisi. Aussi, je suivrai aux fins de mon analyse les \u00e9tapes qu'il implique.\nB. Appartenance de la plaignante \u00e0 un des groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s [45] Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, il n'est pas contest\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce qu'\u00e0 titre de personne transgenderiste au stade pr\u00e9op\u00e9ratoire, la plaignante appartenait au groupe contre lequel il est interdit en vertu de la Loi d'exercer une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\nC. La plaignante s'est port\u00e9e candidate \u00e0 un poste que l'employeur d\u00e9sirait pourvoir et poss\u00e9dait les comp\u00e9tences voulues [46] La plaignante a pos\u00e9 sa candidature \u00e0 un poste que l'intim\u00e9e souhaitait \u00e0 coup s\u00fbr pourvoir. L'intim\u00e9e avait mis sur pied une campagne permanente de recrutement d'agents de TelNat, et la plaignante a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 se faire embaucher \u00e0 titre d'agent. Avait-elle les comp\u00e9tences n\u00e9cessaires pour occuper le poste?\n[47] La plaignante avait franchi la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du processus de s\u00e9lection. M\u00eame si sa fiche de synth\u00e8se pr\u00e9cisait qu'il fallait v\u00e9rifier son \u00e9motivit\u00e9 et sa d\u00e9sirabilit\u00e9 sociale lors de la derni\u00e8re entrevue, il y \u00e9tait \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 que sa candidature ne saurait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e en raison strictement de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments. La plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9e par la suite de se soumettre, exceptionnellement, \u00e0 une deuxi\u00e8me entrevue - dite interm\u00e9diaire . Elle a \u00e9galement franchi cette \u00e9tape.\n[48] L'intim\u00e9e a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 entendre \u00e0 l'audience que la plaignante n'avait pas une exp\u00e9rience suffisante de la vente et du service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le, ce qui \u00e9tait une condition fondamentale selon l'annonce publi\u00e9e dans les journaux. Les faits ne confirment pas cette pr\u00e9tention. Sa connaissance de la vente r\u00e9sidait dans son exp\u00e9rience des affaires, qu'elle avait acquise principalement en exploitant un restaurant. Cette information \u00e9tait fournie dans les deux premi\u00e8res versions du curriculum vit\u00e6 qu'elle a transmises \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e par courrier au d\u00e9but de mai 1998, et \u00e9tait r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e dans la version plus compl\u00e8te du document qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e en juillet lors de la deuxi\u00e8me entrevue. De plus, aucun des documents d'\u00e9valuation de la plaignante ne fait \u00e9tat d'une faiblesse dans ce domaine. Au contraire, on trouve dans les notes manuscrites que Mme Cloutier a prises lors de la deuxi\u00e8me entrevue la mention suivante : vente = OK . Les dossiers de l'intim\u00e9e confirment que la plaignante r\u00e9pondait \u00e9galement aux deux autres exigences minimales \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans l'annonce, soit \u00eatre titulaire d'un dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes coll\u00e9giales et \u00eatre bilingue.\n[49] Dans le rapport pr\u00e9par\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la troisi\u00e8me entrevue, Mme Lecompte et Mme Roy ont indiqu\u00e9 que la plaignante avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait en mesure de suivre la formation dispens\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e et d'occuper le poste de repr\u00e9sentant au service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le de TelNat. Selon Mme Roy, le poste exigeait que les candidats puissent suivre toute la formation n\u00e9cessaire afin d'\u00eatre en mesure de bien r\u00e9pondre aux demandes des clients. Mme Roy a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la plaignante avait sans aucun doute les comp\u00e9tences n\u00e9cessaires pour ex\u00e9cuter toutes ces t\u00e2ches. Les pr\u00e9occupations exprim\u00e9es par Mme Roy et Mme Lecompte en ce qui touche la candidature de la plaignante r\u00e9sidaient plut\u00f4t dans le fait qu'elle \u00e9tait surqualifi\u00e9e pour le poste. \u00c0 leur avis, les employ\u00e9s surqualifi\u00e9s ont plus tendance \u00e0 perdre leur motivation et, partant, \u00e0 en venir \u00e0 fournir un pi\u00e8tre rendement ou \u00e0 quitter pr\u00e9matur\u00e9ment leur emploi.\n[50] Si le plaignant ou la plaignante est surqualifi\u00e9, cela signifie-t-il qu'il ou elle n'est pas comp\u00e9tent aux fins de la satisfaction du deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment du crit\u00e8re Israeli? Je ne crois pas. Il semble contre-intuitif de s'attendre \u00e0 ce que la plaignante, \u00e0 laquelle incombe le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer qu'elle avait les comp\u00e9tences voulues pour le poste convoit\u00e9, fasse montre d'une certaine retenue dans la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve relative \u00e0 ses comp\u00e9tences, par crainte de franchir un Rubicon imaginaire au-del\u00e0 duquel elle sera soudainement r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00eatre surqualifi\u00e9e et, partant, pas qualifi\u00e9e du tout.\n[51] \u00c0 mon avis, une fois que la plaignante a \u00e9tabli qu'elle avait les comp\u00e9tences voulues pour occuper le poste, et dans l'hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 l'existence d'une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie \u00e0 tous autres \u00e9gards, il devrait alors incomber \u00e0 l'employeur de d\u00e9montrer, dans son explication, que la plaignante \u00e9tait surqualifi\u00e9e pour le poste et que, par cons\u00e9quent, son refus de l'embaucher \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9. Par ailleurs, du point de vue pratique, l'employeur serait certes mieux plac\u00e9 pour d\u00e9montrer en quoi la plaignante est surqualifi\u00e9e pour le poste - mieux plac\u00e9 que la plaignante ne l'est pour d\u00e9montrer qu'elle n'est pas surqualifi\u00e9e. Par exemple, dans le cas qui nous occupe, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la plupart des employ\u00e9s de TelNat sont des \u00e9tudiants d'universit\u00e9. Un certain nombre d'agents sont titulaires d'un baccalaur\u00e9at, et le centre d'appels a compt\u00e9 dans son effectif au moins un titulaire de ma\u00eetrise. M. Alborino a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il \u00e9tait possible selon lui que TelNat ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu \u00e0 son service des titulaires de doctorat. Comment peut-on alors s'attendre \u00e0 ce que la plaignante d\u00e9montre qu'elle n'est pas surqualifi\u00e9e alors que, compte tenu de ces faits, il n'y a pas de point vraiment apparent au-del\u00e0 duquel un candidat devient surqualifi\u00e9 pour occuper un poste chez TelNat?\n[52] En ce qui concerne le deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment du crit\u00e8re Israeli, je conclus donc que la plaignante a postul\u00e9 un poste que l'intim\u00e9e d\u00e9sirait pourvoir et qu'elle avait les comp\u00e9tences n\u00e9cessaires.\nD. La plaignante \u00e9tait comp\u00e9tente, mais sa candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e [53] L'intim\u00e9e a rejet\u00e9 la candidature de la plaignante, bien que plusieurs mois se soient \u00e9coul\u00e9s avant qu'elle soit officiellement inform\u00e9e de sa d\u00e9cision.\nE. L'employeur continue de chercher des candidats ayant les comp\u00e9tences de la plaignante [54] L'intim\u00e9e a continu\u00e9 tout au cours de 1998 et apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de 1999 de publier ses annonces en vue de recruter des repr\u00e9sentants au service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le chez TelNat. Le taux de roulement annuel de 20 % \u00e0 30 % n\u00e9cessitait un renouvellement continu du personnel. Toutes les annonces de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9taient presque identiques et n'ont comport\u00e9 aucun changement en ce qui touche les comp\u00e9tences professionnelles n\u00e9cessaires. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis convaincu que l'intim\u00e9e a continu\u00e9 de chercher des candidats ayant les m\u00eames comp\u00e9tences que celles que poss\u00e9dait la plaignante.\n[55] Toutes les conditions d'application du crit\u00e8re Israeli \u00e9tant remplies, je conclus que la plaignante a \u00e9tabli l'existence d'une preuve facie case de discrimination.\nF. Explication de l'intim\u00e9e [56] Essentiellement, l'intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 trois explications pour justifier sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas embaucher la plaignante.\nla plaignante \u00e9tait surqualifi\u00e9e pour le poste. l'attitude de la plaignante au cours de la derni\u00e8re entrevue n'\u00e9tait pas celle d'une personne d\u00e9sireuse de servir le public, mais plut\u00f4t celle d'une personne condescendante et centr\u00e9e sur elle-m\u00eame. la v\u00e9ritable motivation de la plaignante \u00e9tait de d\u00e9crocher le poste afin de promouvoir les droits des personnes transgenderistes.\n[57] L'intim\u00e9e a soutenu qu'elle n'aurait en aucune circonstance embauch\u00e9 la plaignante parce qu'elle \u00e9tait surqualifi\u00e9e. Elle a fait valoir que les employ\u00e9s dont le bagage de connaissances et de comp\u00e9tences est trop grand par rapport aux exigences du poste sont plus susceptibles de perdre int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de leur travail et de fournir un pi\u00e8tre rendement, ou m\u00eame de quitter carr\u00e9ment leur emploi. L'intim\u00e9e ne pouvait se permettre de se placer dans une telle situation, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les co\u00fbts qu'implique la formation d'un employ\u00e9 au centre d'appels TelNat, sans parler des difficult\u00e9s op\u00e9rationnelles qu'entra\u00eene la perte soudaine d'un employ\u00e9.\n[58] Cette explication semble raisonnable; toutefois, je conclus, pour les raisons \u00e9nonc\u00e9es ci-apr\u00e8s, qu'elle n'est en fait qu'un pr\u00e9texte. Au cours de toutes les entrevues qu'elle a subies, la plaignante a r\u00e9pondu directement aux pr\u00e9occupations de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa stabilit\u00e9 \u00e9ventuelle. La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises qu'elle d\u00e9sirait faire un changement dans sa vie, qu'elle d\u00e9m\u00e9nagerait \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 cette fin et qu'elle demeurerait en poste aussi longtemps qu'on le voudrait (pendant m\u00eame deux ou trois ans) avant de chercher \u00e0 obtenir de l'avancement. L'intim\u00e9e a reconnu que, dans les faits, de nombreux employ\u00e9s de TelNat r\u00e9ussissent \u00e0 obtenir de l'avancement au sein de la banque.\n[59] En outre, dans l'hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 la plaignante \u00e9tait vraiment susceptible de quitter pr\u00e9matur\u00e9ment son emploi, comme l'affirme l'intim\u00e9e, pareil r\u00e9sultat n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 extraordinaire. La plupart des agents au centre d'appels TelNat sont des \u00e9tudiants, et un bon nombre d'entre eux restent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement en poste moins de deux ans. En fait, le taux de roulement annuel de 20 % \u00e0 30 % indique qu'un grand nombre des employ\u00e9s, voire la majorit\u00e9, ne demeurent pas en poste longtemps. Mme Roy a dit lors de son t\u00e9moignage que, dans le cas d'un employ\u00e9 du centre d'appels, une p\u00e9riode de 24 mois est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une longue p\u00e9riode de service.\n[60] La plaignante \u00e9tait pleinement consciente des t\u00e2ches, si modestes soient-elles, qui sont ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es dans un centre d'appels de premi\u00e8re ligne. N\u00e9anmoins, il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident qu'elle cherchait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment \u00e0 obtenir cet emploi afin d'op\u00e9rer un changement dans sa vie, dans l'espoir, voire dans l'attente, qu'une personne de sa comp\u00e9tence r\u00e9ussirait \u00e9ventuellement \u00e0 gravir les \u00e9chelons dans l'entreprise. Apr\u00e8s tout, les annonces que l'intim\u00e9e faisait para\u00eetre dans les journaux pr\u00e9cisaient clairement que les employ\u00e9s auraient la possibilit\u00e9 de suivre un plan de carri\u00e8re \u00e0 la hauteur de leurs comp\u00e9tences. M. Alborino a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la plupart des postes \u00e0 doter, \u00e0 l'exception de ceux aux niveaux d'entr\u00e9e inf\u00e9rieurs, sont combl\u00e9s gr\u00e2ce au recrutement interne. Si les efforts de recrutement \u00e0 l'interne ne portent pas fruit, un concours externe est mis sur pied. La plaignante a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 dans sa preuve qu'elle \u00e9tait consciente qu'il existait de telles possibilit\u00e9s d'avancement et qu'elle avait abord\u00e9 cette question lors de sa conversation avec les interrogatrices.\n[61] Par cons\u00e9quent, compte tenu de l'engagement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 de la plaignante \u00e0 demeurer en poste au moins aussi longtemps qu'il le faudrait pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 toutes les attentes de l'employeur \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, pourquoi l'intim\u00e9e ne l'a-t-elle pas prise au mot?\n[62] La r\u00e9ponse r\u00e9side dans la troisi\u00e8me explication fournie par l'intim\u00e9e pour justifier le rejet de la candidature de la plaignante. D'apr\u00e8s les t\u00e9moignages de Mme Roy, de Mme Lecompte et de Mme Cloutier, il est \u00e9vident qu'elles avaient de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 comprendre pourquoi une personne poss\u00e9dant les titres de comp\u00e9tence de la plaignante opterait pour un poste au niveau d'entr\u00e9e. Comme l'a dit Mme Lecompte, elle \u00e9tait perplexe face \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la plaignante. Cette derni\u00e8re devait \u00eatre anim\u00e9e d'un autre motif. Mme Roy et Mme Lecompte ont pens\u00e9 avoir trouv\u00e9 la r\u00e9ponse au cours de la conversation informelle qui a eu lieu \u00e0 la fin de l'entrevue. En entendant les commentaires de la plaignante au sujet des progr\u00e8s r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par les groupes minoritaires durant le dernier si\u00e8cle, ainsi que sa d\u00e9claration voulant qu'elle soit une personne tenace pr\u00eate \u00e0 d\u00e9foncer des portes, Mme Roy et Mme Lecompte ont conclu que sa v\u00e9ritable motivation \u00e9tait la promotion des droits des personnes transgenderistes. Il y a lieu de souligner que les interrogatrices ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de terminer le compte rendu en disant qu'il serait hasardeux d'embaucher la plaignante, compte tenu des propos tenus et non en raison de ses comp\u00e9tences.\n[63] En fait, Mme Roy a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'apr\u00e8s avoir entendu ces commentaires, elle a conclu que si la plaignante d\u00e9sirait obtenir un poste au niveau d'entr\u00e9e, c'\u00e9tait en fait parce qu'elle voulait devenir une pionni\u00e8re dans la promotion du transgenderisme. Mme Roy a ajout\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e ne recrute pas d'employ\u00e9s pour leur permettre de mener une croisade . Cependant, les deux interrogatrices ont reconnu que la plaignante n'avait jamais dit qu'elle \u00e9tait anim\u00e9e d'une intention du genre. Dans leur compte rendu, il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que la plaignante leur avait dit qu'elle se consid\u00e9rait une ambassadrice de son type , mais Mme Lecompte a admis \u00e0 l'audience que c'est elle-m\u00eame qui lui avait pr\u00eat\u00e9 ces propos et que la plaignante n'avait jamais fait une telle affirmation.\n[64] De surcro\u00eet, elles n'ont jamais fait part directement de leurs pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 la plaignante afin que celle-ci puisse y r\u00e9agir. La plaignante n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9e au sujet de ses v\u00e9ritables motifs ou si elle avait l'intention de se servir de son poste comme outil de promotion. J'accepte l'explication de la plaignante au sujet de ses commentaires relatifs aux progr\u00e8s accomplis par divers groupes minoritaires au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Dans le cours de la conversation portant sur des sujets l\u00e9gers - le bla-bla-bla -, la plaignante a voulu souligner, sur un ton badin, qu'il \u00e9tait opportun que l'intim\u00e9e permette \u00e0 des personnes transgenderistes de se joindre \u00e0 son effectif, de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu'on avait ouvert la porte \u00e0 d'autres par le pass\u00e9.\n[65] M. Alborino, en sa qualit\u00e9 de vice-pr\u00e9sident (Ressources humaines) de l'intim\u00e9e, a abord\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens que Mme Roy et de Mme Lecompte. \u00c0 son avis, la plaignante \u00e9tait en qu\u00eate d'une esp\u00e8ce de plate-forme pour promouvoir des int\u00e9r\u00eats personnels, et il a affirm\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu'une telle activit\u00e9 n'avait pas sa place au sein de la banque. Toutefois, lorsqu'on a insist\u00e9 pour obtenir des \u00e9claircissements, ni lui ni aucun autre des t\u00e9moins n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d'expliquer de fa\u00e7on satisfaisante comment un agent du centre d'appels dont les fonctions consistent \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux appels des clients de la banque \u00e0 propos de ses succursales, des soldes bancaires, etc., pourrait se servir de son poste pour promouvoir les droits des personnes transgenderistes. Personne n'a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 entendre, par exemple, que la plaignante pourrait entra\u00eener des clients dans des conversations portant sur les droits des personnes transgenderistes. Les inqui\u00e9tudes de l'intim\u00e9e avaient trait essentiellement, semble-t-il, \u00e0 sa motivation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du poste; alors que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des autres employ\u00e9s de TelNat, notamment des \u00e9tudiants d'universit\u00e9, \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment de toucher un salaire en retour du travail accompli, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la plaignante devait se situer ailleurs.\n[66] Je trouve cette pr\u00e9tention inqui\u00e9tante. En supposant que la plaignante attache vraiment de l'importante au fait qu'elle puisse devenir la premi\u00e8re personne s'affichant ouvertement comme transgenderiste \u00e0 \u00eatre embauch\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e ou m\u00eame par une autre banque canadienne, doit-on pour autant mettre en doute son engouement pour le poste ainsi que sa sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9? Si la cause des droits de la personne a pu progresser au fil du temps, c'est gr\u00e2ce aux initiatives des nombreux individus qui ont forc\u00e9 les barri\u00e8res au prix d'immenses efforts et sacrifices. On peut penser ici \u00e0 l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 certaines \u00e9coles ou au droit de s'asseoir sur les banquettes avant d'un autobus. Leur motivation principale dans ces cas-l\u00e0 a peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 de mettre un terme \u00e0 la discrimination, mais est-ce qu'il faut n\u00e9cessairement en conclure que ces gens-l\u00e0 n'\u00e9taient pas int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e9galement \u00e0 s'instruire ou \u00e0 traverser la ville?\n[67] Si, en fait, on suit le raisonnement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, seul un membre du groupe d\u00e9sign\u00e9 (les personnes transgenderistes, en l'occurrence) ne peut \u00eatre embauch\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la probabilit\u00e9 est que ce serait ce m\u00eame membre qui c\u00e9l\u00e9brerait sa victoire ou qui s'en vanterait. En appliquant un tel raisonnement, l'intim\u00e9e a effectivement tenu compte, dans sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas embaucher la candidate, de son appartenance au groupe d\u00e9sign\u00e9. Il va sans dire qu'un candidat semblable qui ne pr\u00e9senterait pas le trait distinctif qui caract\u00e9rise la plainte relative aux droits de la personne, ne serait pas priv\u00e9 pour ce motif de la m\u00eame possibilit\u00e9 d'emploi. Ce qui est plus inqui\u00e9tant en l'esp\u00e8ce, c'est que la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e strictement sur sa perception que la plaignante adopterait un comportement qu'elle consid\u00e9rait inacceptable, sans jamais avoir v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 cette perception en interrogeant directement la plaignante \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[68] Pour toutes ces raisons, je suis persuad\u00e9 que le sexe de la plaignante a jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e de refuser de lui offrir le poste chez TelNat.\n[69] L'intim\u00e9e a fait valoir que la plaignante n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e de toute fa\u00e7on en raison du ton suffisant et condescendant que les interrogatrices avaient per\u00e7u au cours de la premi\u00e8re partie - soi-disant formelle - de l'entrevue. Cependant, je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 que cette conclusion \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e strictement sur les observations recueillies durant la premi\u00e8re partie de l'entrevue. Mme Roy a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle en \u00e9tait venue \u00e0 cette conclusion en raison notamment des commentaires de la plaignante relativement aux changements qu'elle avait apport\u00e9s \u00e0 son apparence physique ainsi que de ses remarques \u00e0 propos de ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents militaires. Mme Roy a \u00e9galement fait \u00e9tat de la photographie d'elle-m\u00eame v\u00eatue en soldat, prise avant sa transformation physique, que la plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Tout cela s'est produit durant la partie informelle de l'entrevue.\n[70] Mme Roy a expliqu\u00e9 que le probl\u00e8me avec les agents du centre d'appels qui sont centr\u00e9s sur eux-m\u00eames et qui aiment s'entendre parler est qu'ils engagent parfois des conversations futiles qui leur font perdre du temps ainsi qu'aux clients. Cependant, il semble que cette tendance n'ait pas emp\u00each\u00e9 d'autres personnes d'\u00eatre embauch\u00e9es au centre d'appels. Mme Roy a soulign\u00e9 qu'elle doit occasionnellement travailler sur cet aspect avec certains de ses employ\u00e9s. Le fait que ces personnes soient n\u00e9anmoins employ\u00e9es par TelNat nous am\u00e8ne \u00e0 nous demander si cette explication de l'intim\u00e9e quant \u00e0 son refus d'embaucher la plaignante ne constitue qu'un pr\u00e9texte.\n[71] Cependant, il n'importe pas en fin de compte que l'explication fournie soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e ou non comme un pr\u00e9texte. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que la discrimination \u00e9tait un \u00e9l\u00e9ment sous-jacent aux deux autres explications fournies. Le fait que, comme le pr\u00e9tend l'intim\u00e9e, le principal motif du refus d'embaucher la plaignante \u00e9tait la pr\u00e9tendue tendance \u00e0 \u00eatre centr\u00e9 sur soi-m\u00eame est sans importance. Comme l'a soulign\u00e9 la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Cranston c. Canada14, la notion de cause imm\u00e9diate n'est aucunement pertinente en vertu de la Loi. Pour conclure \u00e0 la discrimination, il suffit que la discrimination ait \u00e9t\u00e9 un des motifs de la d\u00e9cision de l'employeur; il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que ce soit le seul et unique motif15.\n[72] Bien que j'aie conclu que la conduite de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait discriminatoire, je ne crois pas que ses repr\u00e9sentants aient eu quelque intention d'exercer une discrimination \u00e0 l'endroit de la plaignante. Au contraire, je n'ai aucune raison de douter de leur pr\u00e9tendu esprit d'ouverture \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son \u00e9tat de personne transgenderiste. Cependant, il est bien \u00e9tabli en droit que l'intention d'exercer une discrimination n'est pas une condition pr\u00e9alable pour conclure \u00e0 la discrimination16.\n[73] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, je suis persuad\u00e9, au regard de l'ensemble de la preuve, que la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e de ne pas embaucher la plaignante comme agente au centre d'appels TelNat a \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9e, du moins en partie, par des consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires li\u00e9es au sexe. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal fait droit \u00e0 la plainte.\nV. REDRESSEMENT [74] Durant l'audience, la plaignante a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal se prononce uniquement sur la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-ci. Dans le cas o\u00f9 il conclurait \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9, le Tribunal conserverait sa comp\u00e9tence pour entendre ult\u00e9rieurement la preuve et les arguments des parties sur la question du redressement. L'intim\u00e9e ne s'\u00e9tant pas oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate, j'y ai fait droit. Compte tenu de ma pr\u00e9sente conclusion, \u00e0 savoir que la plainte est fond\u00e9e, je conserve ma comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de toute mesure de redressement \u00e0 laquelle la plaignante peut avoir droit en vertu de la Loi. Si elles ne peuvent parvenir \u00e0 une entente \u00e0 ce sujet, les parties peuvent communiquer avec le greffe du Tribunal afin qu'il puisse fixer de nouvelles dates d'audience.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthanasios D.

La plainte constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure\nV. ORDONNANCE\n[1] Le Tribunal est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 se prononcer sur une requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e visant \u00e0 rejeter sommairement la plainte de M. Tweten avant le d\u00e9but de l'instruction de la plainte.\nI. CONTEXTE [2] Le 9 septembre 1998, M. Tweten a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) une plainte dans laquelle il all\u00e8gue qu'il a des motifs raisonnables de croire que RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd. (l'intim\u00e9e) a exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience en faisant d\u00e9faut de l'accommoder, en le d\u00e9favorisant en cours d'emploi et en refusant de lui permettre de revenir au travail, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne 1. Le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 au Tribunal le 3 juillet 2003 la plainte de M. Tweten pour instruction.\n[3] Apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte devant la Commission, M. Tweten a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une plainte de cong\u00e9diement injuste en vertu du Code canadien du travail. Cette plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue le 28 novembre 2000.\n[4] Dans une d\u00e9cision en date du 29 d\u00e9cembre 2000, l'arbitre d\u00e9sign\u00e9e en vertu du Code canadien du travail, Mme Donna C. Read, a statu\u00e9 qu'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ne lui permettait de conclure qu'il s'agissait d'une affaire de cong\u00e9diement injuste d\u00e9guis\u00e9. Elle a plut\u00f4t conclu que M. Tweten avait quitt\u00e9 son emploi. Elle a donc rejet\u00e9 sa plainte.\nII. OBSERVATIONS DES PARTIES [5] Dans ses observations \u00e9crites, l'intim\u00e9e, s'appuyant sur le principe de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e, fait valoir non seulement que le Tribunal ne peut instruire la plainte de M. Tweten relative aux droits de la personne, mais aussi que celle-ci doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e parce qu'elle est frivole, vexatoire ou entach\u00e9e de mauvaise foi aux termes de l'alin\u00e9a 41(1)d) de la Loi. En outre, l'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que la plainte constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[6] En ce qui concerne la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e, il semble, d'apr\u00e8s la lettre du 12 novembre 2003 de l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e, que cette derni\u00e8re admette qu'il est impossible d'appliquer le principe de la pr\u00e9clusion aux affaires auxquelles la Commission est partie. Cela dit, le Tribunal entend n\u00e9anmoins aborder cette question dans sa d\u00e9cision.\n[7] Pour ce qui est de l'all\u00e9gation selon laquelle la plainte est frivole, vexatoire ou entach\u00e9e de mauvaise foi, l'intim\u00e9e fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait que M. Tweten n'a pas fourni \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, lorsqu'on le lui a demand\u00e9, de renseignements pertinents au sujet de ses restrictions physiques ou de son besoin d'accommodement, de m\u00eame qu'au fait que trois personnes diff\u00e9rentes ont fait enqu\u00eate au nom de la Commission au cours des deux ann\u00e9es qui ont suivi le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, et que le dernier enqu\u00eateur a recommand\u00e9 que l'affaire ne soit pas renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal, ce que la Commission a tout de m\u00eame fait plut\u00f4t que de rejeter la plainte.\n[8] Enfin, en ce qui touche l'all\u00e9gation voulant que la plainte constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure, l'intim\u00e9e soutient que tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de fond ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s lors de proc\u00e9dures ant\u00e9rieures et que si le Tribunal devait proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'instruction, on permettrait que deux tribunaux de jurisdiction f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (le Conseil des relations industrielles de travail et le Tribunal des droits de la personne) en arrivent \u00e0 des conclusions contradictoires, ce qui jetterait du discr\u00e9dit sur l'administration de la justice. De plus, l'intim\u00e9e affirme que M. Tweten a d\u00e9j\u00e0 expos\u00e9 ses griefs devant deux autres tribunes, occasionnant ainsi des d\u00e9penses consid\u00e9rables \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e.\n[9] \u00c0 l'appui des all\u00e9gations mentionn\u00e9es ci-dessus, l'intim\u00e9e invoque principalement les d\u00e9cisions rendues dans Barter c. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia 2 et Toronto (Ville) c. Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique, section locale 79 (S.C.F.P.)3.\n[10] Pour sa part, la Commission soutient que le principe de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e ne s'applique pas en l'esp\u00e8ce. \u00c0 l'appui de sa pr\u00e9tention, elle cite la d\u00e9cision rendue par ce Tribunal dans Desormeaux c. Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d'Ottawa-Carleton 4 ainsi que l'arr\u00eat Angle c. Canada (ministre du Revenu national)5 de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada.\n[11] En ce qui a trait aux deux autres motifs, soit que la plainte est frivole, vexatoire ou entach\u00e9e de mauvaise foi et qu'elle constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure, la Commission pr\u00e9tend que le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour examiner ces arguments. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Commission invoque la d\u00e9cision de ce Tribunal dans Roch c. Maltais Transport Lt\u00e9e et Ga\u00e9tan Maltais 6.\n[12] En d\u00e9finitive, la Commission soutient que la d\u00e9cision de renvoyer une plainte au Tribunal rel\u00e8ve uniquement du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que le paragraphe 49(1) de la Loi conf\u00e8re \u00e0 la Commission, et que, une fois qu'il y a eu renvoi, le Tribunal ne jouit \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard d'aucun pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et doit instruire la plainte conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 49(2) de la Loi.\nIII. LE DROIT A. La pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e [13] Comme ce Tribunal l'a indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment dans Desormeaux7, Parisien 8 et Thompson 9, l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e est une doctrine d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public con\u00e7ue pour favoriser les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice. Elle a pour objet d'emp\u00eacher des parties de d\u00e9battre \u00e0 nouveau de questions qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es dans d'autres instances. Cette doctrine est fond\u00e9e sur des principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux tels que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 que les proc\u00e8s aient une fin et le d\u00e9sir de prot\u00e9ger des individus contre le risque d'avoir \u00e0 se d\u00e9fendre dans de multiples instances d\u00e9coulant d'un m\u00eame ensemble de circonstances. Elle vise \u00e9galement \u00e0 att\u00e9nuer le risque d'aboutir \u00e0 des r\u00e9sultats contradictoires si la m\u00eame question est d\u00e9battue devant plusieurs tribunes.\n[14] Selon la jurisprudence10, les trois conditions ou exigences pr\u00e9alables suivantes doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9unies pour que la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e puisse \u00eatre accueillie :\nla question doit \u00eatre la m\u00eame que celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure; la d\u00e9cision judiciaire ant\u00e9rieure doit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 une d\u00e9cision finale; les parties dans les deux instances doivent \u00eatre les m\u00eames ou leurs ayants droit11.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, si l'une des trois conditions ou exigences pr\u00e9alables n'est pas satisfaite, le principe ne peut s'appliquer.\nB. Plaintes frivoles, vexatoires ou entach\u00e9es de mauvaise foi [15] L'alin\u00e9a 41(1)d) de la Loi dispose que la Commission peut rejeter une plainte qu'elle juge frivole, vexatoire ou entach\u00e9e de mauvaise foi. Il convient de souligner que cette disposition de la Loi s'applique uniquement \u00e0 la Commission, et non au Tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, le pouvoir du Tribunal de rejeter une plainte frivole, vexatoire ou entach\u00e9e de mauvaise foi ne peut d\u00e9couler de cette disposition de la Loi. Cela dit, le paragraphe 53(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9cise cependant qu'\u00e0 l'issue de l'instruction, le Tribunal a le pouvoir de rejeter une plainte qu'il juge non fond\u00e9e.\n[16] Il semble donc que, sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi, une fois qu'une plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal, celui-ci n'ait d'autre choix d'instruire la plainte, \u00e0 moins que les d\u00e9lais dans le processus aff\u00e9rent aux droits de la personne violent l'article 7 de la Charte 12 ou que, comme nous le verrons plus loin, il y ait abus de proc\u00e9dure. Dans ces cas-l\u00e0, il est loisible au Tribunal de renoncer \u00e0 instruire la plainte. \u00c0 moins qu'il en vienne \u00e0 de telles conclusions, le Tribunal n'a aucun pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire quant \u00e0 la tenue de l'instruction.\n[17] En outre, il y a lieu de souligner que le Tribunal n'est pas habilit\u00e9 en vertu de la Loi \u00e0 r\u00e9viser une d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer une plainte au Tribunal. Tel que pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans Oster 13 et dans bon nombre de d\u00e9cisions rendues par ce Tribunal14, le TCDP n'exerce pas de pouvoir de surveillance \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des mesures et des d\u00e9cisions prises par la Commission. Ces questions rel\u00e8vent de la comp\u00e9tence exclusive de la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[18] Par cons\u00e9quent, si la partie intim\u00e9e est d'avis que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal est injustifi\u00e9e ou non fond\u00e9e, le seul recours qui s'offre \u00e0 elle consiste \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale15.\nC. Abus de proc\u00e9dure [19] La doctrine de l'abus de proc\u00e9dure est invoqu\u00e9e dans divers contextes juridiques, notamment lorsqu'il y a remise en cause de questions qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es lors de proc\u00e9dures judiciaires ant\u00e9rieures. Comme l'a affirm\u00e9 la juge Arbour dans l'arr\u00eat Toronto (Ville) c. Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique, section locale 79 (S.C.F.P.), les tribunaux canadiens ont appliqu\u00e9 la doctrine de l'abus de proc\u00e9dure pour emp\u00eacher la r\u00e9ouverture de litiges dans des circonstances o\u00f9 les exigences strictes de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e (g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement les exigences de lien de droit et de r\u00e9ciprocit\u00e9) n'\u00e9taient pas remplies, mais o\u00f9 la r\u00e9ouverture aurait n\u00e9anmoins port\u00e9 atteinte aux principes d'\u00e9conomie, de coh\u00e9rence, de caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des instances et d'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l'administration de la justice16. La juge Arbour a ajout\u00e9 que la doctrine de l'abus de proc\u00e9dure a d\u00e9bord\u00e9 des stricts param\u00e8tres du principe de l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e tout en lui empruntant beaucoup de ses fondements et quelques-unes de ses restrictions et que les raisons de principes \u00e9tayant la doctrine de l'abus de proc\u00e9dure pour remise en cause sont identiques \u00e0 celles de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d'une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e17.\n[20] Pour conclure qu'un renvoi constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure, le Tribunal doit \u00eatre convaincu que les proc\u00e9dures, si elles avaient lieu, seraient oppressives ou vexatoires et violeraient les principes fondamentaux de justice sous-jacents au sens de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de la d\u00e9cence de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nIV. ANALYSE [21] Le Tribunal doit maintenant se pencher et statuer sur chacun des arguments soulev\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9e dans sa requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire.\nA. La pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e [22] Dans sa lettre en date du 12 novembre 2003, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e admet qu'au moins une des trois conditions pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l'application du principe de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e n'est pas satisfaite, soit l'identit\u00e9 des parties. Il reconna\u00eet en outre qu'il est impossible, en d\u00e9finitive, d'appliquer le principe de la pr\u00e9clusion aux questions qui concernent la Commission. Le Tribunal est d'accord.\n[23] Comme l'a affirm\u00e9 l'ancienne pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal dans Desormeaux18 et Parisien 19, ainsi que dans Thompson20, la Commission n'est pas un ayant droit de la partie plaignante et ne repr\u00e9sente pas cette derni\u00e8re. La Commission et la partie plaignante sont des parties distinctes aux fins de l'instruction d'une plainte en vertu de la Loi, chacune ayant un r\u00f4le particulier \u00e0 jouer. En ce qui concerne la Commission, ce r\u00f4le consiste \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\n[24] Ces opinions sont conformes \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat Toronto (Ville) c. Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique21 de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, dans lequel la juge Arbour, apr\u00e8s avoir soigneusement examin\u00e9 l'\u00e9tat du droit sur cet aspect de la doctrine, affirme qu'elle ne voit aucune n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de supprimer ou d'assouplir l'exigence de la r\u00e9ciprocit\u00e9, \u00e9tablie depuis longtemps (troisi\u00e8me condition pr\u00e9alable).\n[25] Il s'ensuit que les parties aux deux instances (arbitrage en vertu du Code canadien du travail et Tribunal) ne sont pas les m\u00eames. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut \u00e0 l'absence d'au moins un des trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9cessaires pour que la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e puisse s'appliquer en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[26] Bien que cette conclusion soit suffisante en soi pour trancher la question de la pr\u00e9clusion, le Tribunal est d'avis par ailleurs que la question dont il est saisi n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 franchement abord\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre d\u00e9sign\u00e9e en vertu du Code canadien du travail. Ce point sera analys\u00e9 plus en d\u00e9tail au regard de la question de l'abus de proc\u00e9dure.\nB. La plainte est frivole, vexatoire ou entach\u00e9e de mauvaise foi [27] Le fait que M. Tweten n'ait pas, dans le cadre de sa plainte relevant du droit du travail, fourni \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e des renseignements au sujet de ses restrictions physiques ou de son besoin d'accommodement ne constitue pas un motif suffisant pour amener le Tribunal \u00e0 conclure que sa plainte est frivole, vexatoire ou entach\u00e9e de mauvaise foi et entra\u00eener son rejet \u00e0 ce stade des proc\u00e9dures. Il en est de m\u00eame de la conclusion de l'arbitre d\u00e9sign\u00e9e en vertu du Code canadien du travail voulant que M. Tweten ait quitt\u00e9 son emploi.\n[28] Il ne faut pas oublier que tant le plaignant que la Commission sont des parties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance et qu'ils ont tous deux le droit d'\u00eatre entendu sur les questions de fond touchant les droits de la personne que soul\u00e8ve la plainte. L'omission du plaignant de fournir des renseignements pertinents sur son \u00e9tat ainsi que sur les indemnit\u00e9s dont il a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 par suite de son accident de travail sont autant d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments que l'intim\u00e9e pourra soulever comme moyens de d\u00e9fense lors de l'instruction de la plainte.\n[29] Dans un autre ordre d'id\u00e9es, le fait que trois enqu\u00eateurs diff\u00e9rents aient fait enqu\u00eate sur la plainte au nom de la Commission au cours des deux ann\u00e9es qui ont suivi son d\u00e9p\u00f4t, le fait que le dernier enqu\u00eateur ait recommand\u00e9 de ne pas faire un renvoi au Tribunal et le fait que la Commission ait renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal en d\u00e9pit de cette recommandation sont autant d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments qui auraient d\u00fb faire partie d'une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal.\n[30] En l'esp\u00e8ce, le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le que l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer la plainte de M. Tweten au Tribunal. Tel qu'indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour r\u00e9viser cette d\u00e9cision.\n[31] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que la deuxi\u00e8me objection pr\u00e9liminaire de l'intim\u00e9e n'est pas fond\u00e9e.\nC. La plainte constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure [32] Ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, la partie intim\u00e9e a invoqu\u00e9 dans plusieurs instances l'abus de proc\u00e9dure pour contester le renvoi par la Commission d'une plainte au Tribunal22. Les motifs de ces contestations avaient trait principalement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tendue inconduite de la Commission et au retard de celle-ci \u00e0 traiter une plainte et \u00e0 faire enqu\u00eate. Plusieurs intim\u00e9s semblent s'offusquer du fait que, dans certains cas, la plainte est renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal m\u00eame si le rapport d'enqu\u00eate recommande son rejet.\n[33] En l'esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal, en ce qui concerne la question de l'abus de proc\u00e9dure, doit d\u00e9terminer si, dans le cours de l'instruction qu'il doit tenir en vertu de la Loi une fois qu'une plainte lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e, les questions en litige devant l'arbitre d\u00e9sign\u00e9e en vertu du Code du travail seront d\u00e9battues \u00e0 nouveau. Afin de trancher cette question, le Tribunal doit, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans Barter 23, examiner soigneusement la teneur de la d\u00e9cision rendue par Mme Donna C. Read.\n[34] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les faits entourant l'affaire, Mme Donna C. Read a d\u00e9fini de la fa\u00e7on suivante les questions \u00e0 trancher24 :\nLa plainte de M. Tweten en vertu du paragraphe 240(2) du Code canadien du travail a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e apr\u00e8s la date limite du fait qu'elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans les 90 jours suivant la date du cong\u00e9diement? Dans la n\u00e9gative, M. Tweten a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 injustement ? Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, quel est le redressement appropri\u00e9?\n[35] Dans la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant la Commission, M. Tweten all\u00e8gue qu'il a des motifs raisonnables de croire que l'intim\u00e9e a exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience en faisant d\u00e9faut de l'accommoder, en le d\u00e9favorisant en cours d'emploi et en refusant de lui permettre de revenir au travail, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi.\n[36] Compte tenu des all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans la plainte que M. Tweten a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission, il semble que le Tribunal soit saisi des questions suivantes :\nA-t-on exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'endroit de M. Tweten une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne? L'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle fait d\u00e9faut de l'accommoder ? M. Tweten a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 en cours d'emploi? L'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle refus\u00e9 de permettre \u00e0 M. Tweten de revenir au travail ?\n[37] Par cons\u00e9quent, il semble que la principale question dont Mme Read \u00e9tait saisie \u00e9tait la suivante : M. Tweten a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 de son poste et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, s'agissait-il d'un cong\u00e9diement injuste aux termes des dispositions du Code canadien du travail? En revanche, la principale question dont le Tribunal est saisi est la suivante : M. Tweten a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'un acte discriminatoire au sens de la Loi en raison de la d\u00e9ficience qu'il pr\u00e9sentait. Il s'agit l\u00e0 de deux questions tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes.\n[38] En ce qui concerne la question de l'accommodement, il y a lieu de souligner que Mme Read a clairement indiqu\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision que les parties n'en sont jamais arriv\u00e9es jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9tape consistant \u00e0 examiner quelle serait la mesure d'accommodement appropri\u00e9e25. Par cons\u00e9quent, cette question demeure enti\u00e8re.\n[39] Le Tribunal est donc d'avis que les questions dont Mme Read a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie ne sont pas susceptibles d'\u00eatre remises en cause devant le Tribunal. Il n'existe pas vraiment de risque d'avoir \u00e0 propos des m\u00eames questions deux d\u00e9cisions contradictoires qui porteraient atteinte \u00e0 l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus judiciaire et \u00e9branleraient sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e926.\nV.

Introduction [1] Ce Tribunal a rendu une d\u00e9cision le 23 novembre 2001 [la d\u00e9cision de 2001]. \u00c0 la suite d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire portant sur cette d\u00e9cision, le juge No\u00ebl a rendu un jugement en date du 27 mai 2003 (2003 CFPI 660).\nII. D\u00e9cision de la cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale [2] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, le juge No\u00ebl affirme ce qui suit :\nLe Tribunal a mentionn\u00e9 en passant le principe d\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service comme il l\u2019avait fait en 1996 au moment o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision de lib\u00e9rer M. Irvine a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue. \u00c0 mon avis, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas reconnu la jurisprudence en vigueur \u00e0 cette p\u00e9riode, qui confirmait que l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service constitue une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. Mais avant tout, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas tenu compte du fait que cette jurisprudence portait sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation d\u2019une loi par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Le Tribunal devait tenir compte de la loi applicable en 1996 et d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y avait eu discrimination directe contre M. Irvine et, dans l\u2019affirmative, si la norme m\u00e9dicale exig\u00e9e de lui \u00e9tait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e dispensant les FAC de leur obligation d\u2019accommodement.\n[par. 25]\nLa Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait observer qu\u2019en 1995 et 1996, lorsque les FAC ont pris les d\u00e9cisions concernant la carri\u00e8re militaire de M. Irvine, elles se sont fond\u00e9es sur le droit \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. St. Thomas et Commission canadienne des droits de la personne[1], Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es)[2] et Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Robinson[3] [St. Thomas, Husband, Robinson, respectivement], et par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Central Alberta Dairy Pool c. Alberta (Commission des droits de la personne) 1990 2 R.C.S. 489 [Central Alberta Dairy Pool].\n\u00c0 la suite de cette jurisprudence, il n\u2019y avait pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque d\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement dans les cas de discrimination directe. Dans le cas de M. Irvine, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une discrimination directe. Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 la suite de la jurisprudence de cette \u00e9poque, les FAC n\u2019avaient pas l\u00e9galement d\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Irvine. En outre, le juge No\u00ebl a fait observer que l\u2019exigence qu\u2019un membre soit oblig\u00e9 d\u2019exercer des fonctions de combat ou soit un soldat d\u2019abord a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu comme une obligation l\u00e9gale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Robinson. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon la trilogie de jugements qui s\u2019appliquait en 1996, le principe de l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service exigeait que chaque membre des FAC soit en tout temps apte \u00e0 exercer des fonctions de combat. Par la suite, ce principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu par le l\u00e9gislateur dans les modifications qu\u2019il a apport\u00e9es en 1998 \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H\u20116 (version modifi\u00e9e), par l\u2019ajout du paragraphe 15(9). Le juge No\u00ebl a affirm\u00e9 que ce Tribunal a appliqu\u00e9 correctement l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9troactive, mais a omis de l\u2019analyser dans le contexte du principe de l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service, dont la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a jug\u00e9 que la source l\u00e9gislative se trouvait dans la Loi sur la d\u00e9fense nationale, L.R.C. 1985, ch. N\u20115. Le juge No\u00ebl s\u2019est dit pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par la bri\u00e8vet\u00e9 des commentaires du Tribunal \u00e0 propos de l\u2019analyse des principes li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service, estimant qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas trait\u00e9 suffisamment de la question. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le Tribunal aura d\u00fb examiner, dans son analyse et son application de l\u2019arr\u00eat Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 \u2013 aussi appel\u00e9 Meiorin, l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur et l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation judiciaire de la loi \u00e9tablissant et mettant en \u0153uvre le principe de l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service au moment de la d\u00e9cision en 1996.\n[3] Pour ce qui est des erreurs de fait all\u00e9gu\u00e9es, le juge No\u00ebl a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas en traiter, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision susmentionn\u00e9e. Il a accueilli la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire et ordonn\u00e9 que l\u2019affaire soit renvoy\u00e9e pour une nouvelle d\u00e9cision, et ce, sans adjudication de d\u00e9pens.\nIII. Nouvelle d\u00e9cision [4] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision constitue la nouvelle d\u00e9cision dans cette affaire, suite \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance susmentionn\u00e9e de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada. La Commission, M. Irvine et l\u2019intim\u00e9e, les Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes (FAC), ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un plaidoyer et des observations \u00e9crites.\nA. D\u00e9cision de 2001 du tribunal \u2013 nouvelle d\u00e9cision \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du principe de l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service [5] Dans la d\u00e9cision de 2001, j\u2019ai formul\u00e9 les conclusions de fait aux paragraphes 3 \u00e0 102. J\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9 les principes juridiques aux paragraphes 103 \u00e0 113 et j\u2019ai pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 mon analyse dans les paragraphes 114 \u00e0 163. Dans cette derni\u00e8re section, je me suis prononc\u00e9 sur les questions de preuve aux paragraphes 122 \u00e0 124. Ma conclusion et les mesures de redressement sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es aux paragraphes 164 et 165.\n[6] Dans cette nouvelle d\u00e9cision, je n\u2019accorde pas d\u2019importance, pour les raisons mentionn\u00e9es ci-dessous, aux faits \u00e9nonc\u00e9s aux paragraphes 36 \u00e0 57 et j\u2019estime que les paragraphes 151 et 154 \u00e0 163 de mon analyse ne sont plus pertinents.\n(i) Conclusions de fait [7] La Commission est d\u2019avis que, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne s\u2019est pas prononc\u00e9e sur les faits, les conclusions de fait initiales doivent demeurer telles quelles. Selon la Commission, ce Tribunal est li\u00e9 par ses conclusions de fait ant\u00e9rieures et n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour les modifier; pour ce faire, il faudrait que le Tribunal si\u00e8ge comme tribunal d\u2019appel r\u00e9visant sa propre d\u00e9cision. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission estime que les paragraphes 3 \u00e0 102 de la d\u00e9cision initiale ne doivent pas \u00eatre modifi\u00e9s. L\u2019intim\u00e9e est d\u2019avis que chacun des paragraphes qui traitent de l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service et de son application, notamment les paragraphes 36 \u00e0 57 et 125 \u00e0 163, doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9examin\u00e9s.\n[8] En ce qui concerne les paragraphes 36 \u00e0 57 [faits relatifs aux t\u00e2ches militaires g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et principes concernant l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service; politiques de d\u00e9cembre 1999 des FAC en mati\u00e8re d\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service; politiques des FAC ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 1999 concernant l\u2019accommodement et politiques post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 1999; politiques de novembre 2000 des FAC concernant l\u2019accommodement; t\u00e2ches militaires g\u00e9n\u00e9rales des FAC et universalit\u00e9 du service], je ferai remarquer que ces paragraphes traitent des politiques post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 1996, des politiques concernant l\u2019attribution du facteur professionnel (le facteur O) et des politiques d\u2019accommodement des FAC post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la lib\u00e9ration. Ces faits sont fond\u00e9s sur la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience, mais je ne leur accorde aucune importance dans ma r\u00e9vision de la d\u00e9cision de 2001, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que seul le facteur G est en litige dans l\u2019affaire Irvine et que les politiques post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la lib\u00e9ration, particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui touche l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement des FAC, ne sont pas pertinentes.\n[9] Pour ce qui est des paragraphes 58 \u00e0 102 [Situation particuli\u00e8re de M. Irvine et Donn\u00e9es m\u00e9dicales pertinentes], je demeure d\u2019avis que ces paragraphes pr\u00e9sentent les faits entourant l\u2019affaire Irvine.\n(ii) Principes juridiques [10] En ce qui a trait aux paragraphes 103 \u00e0 113 [Principes juridiques], je modifie ceux qui portent sur l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service afin d\u2019y inclure les commentaires formul\u00e9s ci-dessous \u00e0 propos des principes applicables.\n[11] Pour ce qui est des paragraphes 114 \u00e0 121 [Analyse], je maintiens ma conclusion \u00e0 savoir que la Commission et le plaignant ont \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience par rapport tant \u00e0 la lib\u00e9ration de M. Irvine, qui contrevient \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7 de la Loi, qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019application \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de M. Irvine des politiques et proc\u00e9dures, qui va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019art. 10 de la Loi.\n[12] En ce qui regarde les paragraphes 122 \u00e0 124 [Questions relatives \u00e0 la preuve], je demeure selon la Commission li\u00e9 par la d\u00e9cision initiale. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 d\u2019objections particuli\u00e8res. J\u2019ai r\u00e9examin\u00e9 les questions relatives \u00e0 la preuve et je maintiens les conclusions d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9nonc\u00e9es.\n[13] En ce qui a trait au paragraphe 125 [Universalit\u00e9 du service], je le r\u00e9examine \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019analyse de la question de l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service que je pr\u00e9sente ci-dessous.\n[14] Pour ce qui est des paragraphes 126 \u00e0 132 [D\u00e9termination des normes ayant entra\u00een\u00e9 la lib\u00e9ration de M. Irvine], je maintiens que les trois \u00e9valuations m\u00e9dicales d\u00e9terminantes du Dr Kafka , le Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie et le Conseil de r\u00e9vision des carri\u00e8res qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es en fonction des normes des FAC (les politiques des FAC de 1979, les politiques transitoires et les lignes de conduite de septembre 1995 concernant l\u2019attribution des restrictions \u00e0 l\u2019emploi) sont au centre de ce processus de r\u00e9vision.\n[15] Pour ce qui est des paragraphes 133 \u00e0 136, o\u00f9 j\u2019ai appliqu\u00e9 la m\u00e9thode d\u2019analyse d\u00e9crite dans Meiorin [Lien rationnel et La norme a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e de bonne foi?], je maintiens ma conclusion selon laquelle les normes des FAC \u00e9taient rationnellement li\u00e9es \u00e0 leur objectif, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0-dire exiger que M. Irvine soit un soldat d\u2019abord. En outre, je maintiens que les normes et les \u00e9valuations m\u00e9dicales et professionnelles, y compris l\u2019attribution des restrictions \u00e0 l\u2019emploi par le Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies de bonne foi.\n[16] Pour ce qui est des paragraphes 137 \u00e0 140 [N\u00e9cessit\u00e9 raisonnable et volet accommodement du crit\u00e8re Meiorin], je maintiens que les normes des FAC tel qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans les politiques transitoires n\u2019\u00e9taient pas aussi conciliantes que les normes des FAC \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans lignes de conduite de septembre 1995. Les conclusions que j\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans ces paragraphes demeurent inchang\u00e9es.\n[17] \u00c0 propos des paragraphes 141 \u00e0 148 [\u00c9valuation du Dr Kafka; \u00c9valuations du Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie et du Conseil de r\u00e9vision des carri\u00e8res], je continue de croire que les pr\u00e9occupations que j\u2019ai exprim\u00e9es dans ces paragraphes sont pertinentes \u00e0 la nouvelle d\u00e9cision. Comme le veut l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin, les normes d\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service doivent \u00eatre les plus conciliantes possible ou, si l\u2019on pr\u00e9f\u00e8re, individualis\u00e9es. Cela dit, l\u2019analyse de l\u2019essence m\u00eame de l\u2019affaire Irvine et mes motifs sont r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9s ci-dessous.\n[18] Pour ce qui est des paragraphes 149 et 150 [Attentes proportionn\u00e9es et mesur\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des personnes atteintes d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience], je maintiens que les tests individuels qu\u2019on a fait subir \u00e0 M. Irvine ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9s plus rigoureusement de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 l\u2019exclure des FAC lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience qu\u2019ils ne l\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 aux membres physiquement aptes. Je demeure persuad\u00e9e que les FAC auraient d\u00fb offrir \u00e0 M. Irvine l\u2019occasion de se soumettre \u00e0 un autre test EXPRES, et ce, d\u2019autant plus qu\u2019un tel test aurait aid\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9valuer le risque de mortalit\u00e9 et de morbidit\u00e9.\n[19] En ce qui a trait au paragraphe 151 de la d\u00e9cision de 2001, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il est superflu puisqu\u2019il ne traite que du facteur professionnel (le facteur O) qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9terminant par rapport \u00e0 la lib\u00e9ration de M. Irvine.\n[20] En ce qui touche les paragraphes 152 et 153 [Nature subjective de l\u2019attribution des restrictions et cotes], je maintiens ma conclusion \u00e0 savoir que le caract\u00e8re inexact de la proc\u00e9dure consistant \u00e0 attribuer des cotes est un facteur qui renforce les doutes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la justesse de la cote attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Irvine par les FAC (\u00e9l\u00e9ment explicit\u00e9 ci-dessous).\n[21] \u00c0 propos du paragraphe 154 [Imposition de conditions sur le plan m\u00e9dical], il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 mon avis de maintenir cette pr\u00e9occupation pour trancher la plainte de M. Irvine, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019acc\u00e8s de ce dernier aux renseignements m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 son sujet n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9terminant en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[22] Pour ce qui est des paragraphes 155 \u00e0 163 [accommodement des militaires inaptes, d\u00e9ployabilit\u00e9, maintien en fonction et co\u00fbts relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019accommodement], ils ne peuvent \u00e0 mon avis \u00eatre maintenus \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des principes concernant l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service.\n[23] En ce qui concerne les paragraphes 164 et 165 [Conclusion et Mesures de redressement], je maintiens ma d\u00e9cision initiale, tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessous.\n[24] La m\u00e9thode d\u2019analyse d\u00e9crite ci-dessus est appliqu\u00e9e tout en reconnaissant express\u00e9ment qu\u2019un membre des FAC est assujetti \u00e0 l\u2019obligation d\u2019exercer des fonctions de combat. J\u2019ai r\u00e9examin\u00e9 chaque paragraphe de la d\u00e9cision de 2001 \u00e0 la lueur des principes concernant l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service, qui sont analys\u00e9s plus en profondeur ci-dessus.\nB. Motifs (i) Observations des parties au sujet de l\u2019orientation donn\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale [25] La Commission et M. Irvine pr\u00e9tendent que la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans le cas qui nous occupe est fond\u00e9e sur une question de droit limit\u00e9e et distincte : la Cour a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de r\u00e9examiner sa d\u00e9cision \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des principes concernant l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de r\u00e9examiner sa d\u00e9cision au regard des principes li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service, la Commission fait valoir que la Cour a par ailleurs confirm\u00e9 que c\u2019est \u00e0 juste titre que le Tribunal a appliqu\u00e9 r\u00e9troactivement l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin. La Commission est d\u2019avis que la seule question que doit trancher le Tribunal est la suivante : les FAC ont-elles satisfait au troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment du crit\u00e8re Meiorin.\n[26] En ce qui concerne l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement des FAC, la Commission estime que les FAC b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d\u2019une exemption en vertu de l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service dans le cas suivant : une fois qu\u2019elles ont jug\u00e9 qu\u2019un membre ne satisfait pas aux normes m\u00e9dicales et, partant, aux principes li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service, les FAC ne sont pas tenues de prouver qu\u2019elles subiraient une contrainte excessive si elles devaient composer avec le membre par tous les moyens possibles. Cependant, la Commission est d\u2019avis que le crit\u00e8re Meiorin s\u2019applique \u00e0 tous autres \u00e9gards. Autrement dit, les FAC ont encore la charge de d\u00e9montrer que leurs normes m\u00e9dicales sont raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaires pour atteindre l\u2019objectif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les normes m\u00e9dicales proprement dites doivent pr\u00e9voir une \u00e9valuation individualis\u00e9e et \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es selon une m\u00e9thode \u00e9quitable.\n[27] En revanche, l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que la restriction m\u00e9dicale contest\u00e9e, \u00e0 savoir la cote G4 (doit pouvoir recourir aux services d\u2019un m\u00e9decin) \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour prot\u00e9ger le plaignant et les FAC contre les risques de d\u00e9faillance cardiaque et pr\u00e9server le principe de l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service. \u00c0 son avis, la norme m\u00e9dicale litigieuse constituait une EPJ, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le plaignant risquait grandement de subir une autre attaque cardiaque. Par cons\u00e9quent, les FAC n\u2019\u00e9taient pas tenues de composer avec le plaignant par suite du diagnostic de coronaropathie et du risque \u00e9lev\u00e9 de rechute.\n[28] En outre, les FAC soutiennent que l\u2019\u00e9valuation individuelle effectu\u00e9e par les m\u00e9decins des FAC aux fins de diagnostiquer l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du plaignant et d\u2019\u00e9valuer le risque de rechute n\u2019est pas susceptible de r\u00e9vision par ce Tribunal. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de cet argument, elles invoquent l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Anvari [1993] A.C.F. no 317 (C.A.) [Anvari].\n[29] Je vais maintenant me pencher sur ces arguments dans le cadre du r\u00e9examen de la d\u00e9cision initiale.\nC. Universalit\u00e9 du service [30] L\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service dans les Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes exige que chaque membre soit apte \u00e0 \u00eatre un soldat d\u2019abord. Le terme universalit\u00e9 du service d\u00e9signe l\u2019ensemble de principes qui r\u00e9gissent le service des membres au sein des FAC. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 les principes en question dans trois arr\u00eats rendus au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 90 (St. Thomas, Husband et Robinson). Dans chacune de ces instances, le litige gravitait autour de la question \u00e0 savoir si une norme d\u2019emploi militaire constituait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e (EPJ).\n[31] Les trois principes essentiels de l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service sont les suivants :\nPeu importe leur m\u00e9tier ou leur profession, les membres des FAC sont d\u2019abord et avant tout des soldats. Le soldat doit \u00eatre pr\u00eat \u00e0 servir en tout temps, en tout lieu et dans toutes les conditions. L\u2019obligation est universelle en ce sens qu\u2019elle s\u2019applique \u00e0 tous les membres des FAC.\n[32] Dans chacun des cas faisant partie de cette trilogie, la Cour d\u2019appel a soutenu que les normes m\u00e9dicales en cause \u00e9taient raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaires pour assurer l\u2019ex\u00e9cution efficace et \u00e9conomique des t\u00e2ches militaires universelles. Il s\u2019agissait donc \u00e0 proprement parler d\u2019EPJ. Ces affaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es en appliquant la m\u00e9thode d\u2019analyse \u00e0 deux volets ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 Meiorin qui d\u00e9coulait de l\u2019arr\u00eat Central Alberta Dairy Pool et qui \u00e9tablissait une distinction entre la discrimination directe et la discrimination indirecte. Comme il s\u2019agissait de cas de discrimination directe, les FAC, une fois l\u2019existence d\u2019une EPJ \u00e9tablie, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas tenues de composer avec les employ\u00e9s en question. Les FAC n\u2019avaient pas d\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des personnes qui ne satisfaisaient pas aux principes du service universel.\n(i) Les fonctions d\u2019un soldat [33] En ce qui concerne le deuxi\u00e8me principe, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de soldats, les membres des FAC jouent un r\u00f4le unique au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne. J\u2019en conviens. Les articles 31 et 33 de la Loi sur la d\u00e9fense nationale, L.R.C. 1985, ch. N\u20115, disposent qu\u2019un membre des Forces canadiennes peut \u00eatre mis en service actif, pour la d\u00e9fense du Canada, en raison d\u2019un \u00e9tat d\u2019urgence, et est en permanence soumis \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de service l\u00e9gitime.\n[34] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a soulign\u00e9 l\u2019importance de ce contexte militaire dans l\u2019arr\u00eat St. Thomas (p. 677) :\n\u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019examen de cette question doit faire entrer en ligne de compte un \u00e9l\u00e9ment contextuel que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas suffisamment pris en consid\u00e9ration, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce un soldat est en cause. En sa qualit\u00e9 de membre des Forces canadiennes, M. St. Thomas \u00e9tait d\u2019abord et avant tout un soldat. En tant que tel, il devait vivre et travailler dans des conditions inconnues dans la vie civile et \u00eatre capable de fonctionner, \u00e0 bref d\u00e9lai, dans des conditions de stress physique et \u00e9motionnel extr\u00eame et dans des endroits o\u00f9 des installations m\u00e9dicales n\u2019\u00e9taient peut-\u00eatre pas disponibles aux fins du traitement de sa maladie ou, si elles l\u2019\u00e9taient, n\u2019\u00e9taient peut-\u00eatre pas ad\u00e9quates. Tel est, me semble-t-il, le contexte dans lequel la conduite des Forces canadiennes devrait \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n(ii) Les fonctions sont universelles [35] Les fonctions d\u2019un soldat sont universelles dans le sens o\u00f9 chaque membre des FAC doit \u00eatre apte \u00e0 les remplir. Dans Robinson, la Cour d\u2019appel a infirm\u00e9 une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal selon laquelle la politique m\u00e9dicale des militaires exempts de crises ne pouvait \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e, les Forces n\u2019ayant pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le plaignant \u00e9tait susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des fonctions de combat. La Cour d\u2019appel a soutenu que le Tribunal avait commis une erreur en exigeant une telle preuve (p. 238) :\n\u2026[L]e tribunal a commis une erreur dans la fa\u00e7on dont il a dispos\u00e9 de l\u2019argument du requ\u00e9rant. Cet argument n\u2019\u00e9tait ni th\u00e9orique ni sp\u00e9cieux. La loi assujettissait M. Robinson \u00e0 l\u2019obligation d\u2019exercer des fonctions de combat. Cette obligation est tr\u00e8s bien comprise au sein des Forces arm\u00e9es. Les militaires qui exercent des r\u00f4les de soutien n\u2019en sont pas exempt\u00e9s. L\u2019ex\u00e9cution de cette obligation ne d\u00e9pend pas d\u2019une mutation, notamment \u00e0 un r\u00f4le de combat. Comme il \u00e9tait d\u2019opinion contraire, le tribunal a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument du requ\u00e9rant et a conclu, \u00e0 tort selon moi, que le requ\u00e9rant devait produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnelle quelconques pour \u00e9tablir le nombre de militaires exer\u00e7ant un r\u00f4le de soutien qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mut\u00e9s \u00e0 des fonctions de combat pendant une certaine p\u00e9riode. Cette opinion ne tient tout simplement pas compte du fait que cette obligation est \u00e9dict\u00e9e par la loi. Elle ne peut \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e par une pratique administrative. La loi a force obligatoire.\nLa Cour d\u2019appel a poursuivi son raisonnement, soutenant que les FAC n\u2019\u00e9taient pas tenues de d\u00e9montrer que le plaignant \u00e9tait susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des fonctions de combat.\n[36] Je conclus que les FAC \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es \u00e0 exiger que chacun de leurs membres satisfasse \u00e0 ces principes d\u2019universalit\u00e9 de service. Les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents cit\u00e9s, la jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qui \u00e9tait pertinente en 1995 et 1996 dans les cas de discrimination directe par rapport aux activit\u00e9s des FAC, et l\u2019orientation du juge No\u00ebl mettent en relief cette conclusion. Autrement dit, une fois qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une EPJ dans le contexte des fonctions de combat, les FAC ne sont pas soumises \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de composer avec M. Irvine en l\u2019affectant \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches non li\u00e9es au combat.\nD. MEIORIN [37] Cependant, cette conclusion ne marque pas la fin de l\u2019instruction de la plainte de M. Irvine. M\u00eame si elles \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es \u00e0 exiger que chaque membre soit un soldat d\u2019abord, les FAC doivent encore d\u00e9montrer, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin, que les normes dont elle s\u2019est dot\u00e9e pour \u00e9valuer l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service pr\u00e9voient des tests individuels. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu, dans ma d\u00e9cision initiale, que les FAC avaient respect\u00e9 les deux premiers \u00e9l\u00e9ments du crit\u00e8re Meiorin du fait que les politiques de 1979, les politiques transitoires et les lignes de conduite de septembre 1995 \u00e9taient rationnellement li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019objectif des FAC d\u2019exiger que M. Irvine soit apte \u00e0 exercer de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire et efficace ses fonctions de soldat, et que ces normes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es de bonne foi.\n[38] Le troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment du crit\u00e8re Meiorin exige que les normes contest\u00e9es soient raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaires pour atteindre l\u2019objectif poursuivi par l\u2019employeur, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0-dire l\u2019ex\u00e9cution s\u00e9curitaire et efficace du travail. Les FAC doivent d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elles ne peuvent composer avec le plaignant et toute autre personne touch\u00e9e par la norme sans subir une contrainte excessive. Elles doivent veiller \u00e0 ce que la m\u00e9thode \u2013 s\u2019il en est \u2013 suivie pour \u00e9valuer la question de l\u2019accommodement tienne compte de la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle puisse \u00eatre ind\u00fbment discriminatoire pour un motif de distinction illicite. En outre, la teneur r\u00e9elle d\u2019une norme plus conciliante qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte par les FAC ou, subsidiairement, les raisons pour lesquelles les FAC n\u2019ont pas offert une telle norme doivent \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9es. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9 au paragraphe 139 de la d\u00e9cision de 2001, les lignes de conduite de septembre 1995, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles permettaient une \u00e9valuation individuelle, \u00e9taient raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaires pour atteindre l\u2019objectif des FAC de veiller \u00e0 ce que les membres satisfassent aux principes de l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service. Par cons\u00e9quent, comparativement aux normes ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 1979 et aux politiques transitoires, elles constituaient une norme plus conciliante d\u2019\u00e9valuation des cas de coronaropathie. Cependant, les FAC ont omis, dans le cas de M. Irvine, de se fonder sur une norme d\u2019\u00e9valuation individualis\u00e9e plus conciliante, telle que celle \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans les lignes de conduite de septembre 1995, comme je l\u2019expliquerai ci-dessous.\nE. ANVARI [39] S\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Anvari, l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que les tests de diagnostic des FAC d\u00e9passent l\u2019expertise et la comp\u00e9tence de ce Tribunal. Le juge No\u00ebl ne cite pas ce point de droit comme motif de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision initiale. En fait, l\u2019argument n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battu devant moi lors de l\u2019audience initiale. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne crois pas en avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment saisi. M\u00eame si je me m\u00e9prends sur ce point, j\u2019estime que l\u2019arr\u00eat Anvari doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le contexte de l\u2019ensemble de la jurisprudence de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n(i) L\u2019orientation d\u00e9finie dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Anvari [40] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 soigneusement Anvari, une affaire traitant de l\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9 pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales d\u2019un immigrant \u00e9ventuel aux termes de la Loi sur l\u2019immigration f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Dans ce cas, la plainte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019art. 5, qui porte sur la fourniture de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public. La Cour a statu\u00e9 qu\u2019un tribunal ne peut exiger que la partie intim\u00e9e \u00e9tablisse dans le cadre d\u2019une d\u00e9fense de motif justifiable que la norme a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on raisonnable ou que son application \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e dans les circonstances.\n[41] Anvari doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de concert avec d\u2019autres pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Ainsi, dans Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral c. Levac [1992] 3 C.F. 463 (C.A.F.), une affaire de discrimination aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) dans laquelle les FAC ont tent\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une EPJ, le juge D\u00e9cary a conclu que le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas commis d\u2019erreur susceptible de r\u00e9vision dans son \u00e9valuation de la preuve m\u00e9dicale et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas parvenu \u00e0 une conclusion \u00e0 laquelle il ne pouvait raisonnablement parvenir en pr\u00e9f\u00e9rant le t\u00e9moignage du m\u00e9decin du plaignant, qui avait examin\u00e9 ce dernier, \u00e0 celui du m\u00e9decin des FAC, dont le t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9tude de son dossier m\u00e9dical plut\u00f4t que sur un examen. Le juge D\u00e9cary a express\u00e9ment confirm\u00e9 l\u2019analyse faite par le Tribunal de l\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale des FAC. Dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Beaulieu [1993] A.C.F. no 174, 103 D.L.R. (4e) 217 (C.A.), une autre affaire dans laquelle les FAC ont invoqu\u00e9 comme d\u00e9fense une EPJ dans le contexte d\u2019une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) et de l\u2019article 10 de la Loi, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a soutenu qu\u2019un tribunal ne pouvait juger une plainte de discrimination non fond\u00e9e simplement parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait persuad\u00e9 que le diagnostic de d\u00e9ficience \u00e9tait erron\u00e9. Cependant, le tribunal aurait pu \u00e9galement \u00eatre convaincu soit que le diagnostic avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli de fa\u00e7on imprudente, auquel cas il aurait peut-\u00eatre pu parler d\u2019une discrimination d\u00e9guis\u00e9e ou d\u2019une impression fausse et h\u00e2tive, soit que l\u2019exigence n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une EPJ. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019arr\u00eat Anvari fait \u00e9tat du pouvoir du tribunal de se pencher sur l\u2019application discriminatoire d\u2019une norme ou d\u2019une pratique. Le juge Mahoney \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[Traduction] Pour qu\u2019il y ait comp\u00e9tence sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP, il faut que la disposition ait \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire. \u00c0 moins qu\u2019on puisse \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un commencement de preuve que l\u2019opinion des m\u00e9decins \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur la discrimination, ceux-ci n\u2019avaient pas la charge de d\u00e9montrer que leur opinion reposait sur un motif justifiable. Peut-\u00eatre \u00e9tait-elle mal fond\u00e9e en droit ou peut-\u00eatre y \u00e9tait on parvenu en d\u00e9pit de la preuve. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, il existe un recours ailleurs; toutefois, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019on puisse \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il y a eu discrimination aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 19(1)a), il n\u2019existe pas de recours en vertu de la LCDP. Autrement dit, la discrimination \u00e9voqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 19(1)a) \u00e9tant fond\u00e9e sur un motif justifiable, la question \u00e0 trancher sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de savoir si leur opinion \u00e9tait probablement valable, mais si, dans l\u2019exercice de leurs fonctions, les m\u00e9decins avaient exerc\u00e9 une discrimination non fond\u00e9e sur un motif justifiable.\nAutrement dit, l\u2019analogie entre cette d\u00e9cision et l\u2019affaire Irvine veut que les m\u00e9decins et les comit\u00e9s doivent exercer leurs fonctions de fa\u00e7on non discriminatoire. Dans le cas de M. Irvine, les m\u00e9decins et les comit\u00e9s en faveur de l\u2019attribution de la cote G4 ont omis, comme je l\u2019explique ci-dessous, de soumettre M. Irvine \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation individuelle conforme aux politiques les plus conciliantes des FAC. Leurs \u00e9valuations individuelles ne respectaient ni la lettre ni l\u2019esprit de l\u2019approche individualis\u00e9e pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e par les lignes de conduite de 1995 des FAC. Leur mode de prise de d\u00e9cision et leurs d\u00e9cisions au sujet des restrictions \u00e0 l\u2019emploi \u00e9taient discriminatoires \u00e0 son endroit en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience et tombent sous le coup des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi.\n[42] Dans une d\u00e9cision subs\u00e9quente portant sur l\u2019article 7 de la Loi (VIA Rail Canada c. Mills [1997] A.C.F. no 1089), la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, faisant une distinction avec Beaulieu, a confirm\u00e9 la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal de conclure que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas examin\u00e9 la preuve m\u00e9dicale de fa\u00e7on ad\u00e9quate et exhaustive. Le juge Teitelbaum \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\nDe plus, rien ne laisse croire dans la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas tenu compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments mis \u00e0 sa disposition. Le Tribunal a minutieusement examin\u00e9 les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents m\u00e9dicaux plut\u00f4t complexes de M. Mills et n\u2019a pas limit\u00e9 son analyse des diverses consultations et opinions m\u00e9dicales \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement d\u00e9terminant du mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 1991. Le Tribunal a analys\u00e9 diverses opinions m\u00e9dicales pertinentes et les a minutieusement examin\u00e9es, y compris les opinions exprim\u00e9es avant ou apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident du mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 1991 ou la tentative infructueuse de retour au travail, en octobre 1991\u2026\nLa conclusion du Tribunal selon laquelle VIA n\u2019a pas effectu\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate ad\u00e9quate et exhaustive de la preuve m\u00e9dicale ne justifie pas un contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\nDans cette affaire, la Cour a soutenu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait loisible au Tribunal d\u2019accorder plus d\u2019importance \u00e0 l\u2019opinion d\u2019un m\u00e9decin en particulier qu\u2019\u00e0 celle d\u2019un autre, et de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer la preuve des m\u00e9decins qui avaient examin\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 celle de ceux qui n\u2019avaient effectu\u00e9 qu\u2019un examen du dossier.\n[43] Compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble de la jurisprudence et des dispositions des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi, il semble que le Tribunal ait comp\u00e9tence pour examiner les \u00e9valuations m\u00e9dicales discriminatoires ou arbitraires, h\u00e2tives, imprudentes ou insuffisantes par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019application de normes qualifi\u00e9es d\u2019EPJ. Pr\u00e9tendre le contraire minerait totalement l\u2019objet de la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Ainsi, un mis en cause pourrait d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019une norme constitue une EPJ et justifier le cong\u00e9diement du plaignant, malgr\u00e9 une application erron\u00e9e \u2013 discriminatoire, h\u00e2tive ou d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e \u2013 de la norme au plaignant. Autrement dit, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pourrait faire indirectement ce qu\u2019on lui interdit directement de faire.\n(ii) Application \u00e0 l\u2019affaire Irvine [44] Dans le cas de M. Irvine, on ne remet pas en question le diagnostic de coronaropathie. Le diagnostic n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9. Il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t de d\u00e9terminer si les FAC ont men\u00e9 au sujet de la preuve m\u00e9dicale une enqu\u00eate ad\u00e9quate, exhaustive et non discriminatoire qui soit suffisante pour justifier la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019emploi correspondant \u00e0 la cote G4 et la lib\u00e9ration \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue discriminatoire de M. Irvine en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Est-ce que l\u2019\u00e9valuation individuelle du cas de M. Irvine par les FAC, qui s\u2019est sold\u00e9e par l\u2019attribution de la cote G4 (susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre lib\u00e9r\u00e9) par opposition \u00e0 G3 (demeure apte \u00e0 servir comme soldat) est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019exigence des tests individuels ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s en fonction de la norme la plus conciliante, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 Meiorin et \u00e0 la jurisprudence mentionn\u00e9e de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale?\n[45] Dans le cas de M. Irvine, les m\u00e9decins des FAC, conform\u00e9ment aux conclusions de fait que j\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision de 2001 (paragraphes 69 \u00e0 80), ont recommand\u00e9 des cotes contradictoires en ce qui a trait aux restrictions \u00e0 l\u2019emploi. Certains ont recommand\u00e9 la cote G3O3 et d\u2019autres, dont le Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie, la cote G4O3. La diff\u00e9rence de facteur g\u00e9ographique entre G3 et G4 a \u00e9t\u00e9 le facteur d\u00e9terminant de la lib\u00e9ration de M. Irvine. Ainsi, le Dr Buchholtz, chef, M\u00e9decine, qui agissait comme m\u00e9decin-conseil aupr\u00e8s des FAC, a examin\u00e9 M. Irvine en novembre 1994. Par la suite, M. Irvine a subi une \u00e9preuve d\u2019effort sur tapis roulant et obtenu d\u2019excellents r\u00e9sultats. M. Irvine n\u2019a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 aucune douleur thoracique et manifest\u00e9 aucun signe d\u2019isch\u00e9mie. Il avait perdu 35 livres et \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement asymptomatique. Le Dr Buchholtz a \u00e9t\u00e9 tent\u00e9 de recommander la cote G3O3 qui, \u00e0 son avis, \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e \u00e0 long terme [par. 70 et 71]. Toutefois, le Dr Buchholtz a \u00e9crit que le niveau de cholest\u00e9rol de M. Irvine \u00e9tait normal alors qu\u2019en fait, un rapport de laboratoire avait confirm\u00e9 en octobre 1994 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait encore \u00e9lev\u00e9. Par la suite, le 16 janvier 1995, un m\u00e9decin-examinateur de la base, le Dr MacKinnon, a recommand\u00e9 la cote G3O3, jugeant M. Irvine apte \u00e0 \u00eatre promu. Par cons\u00e9quent, le m\u00e9decin des FAC estimait \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 que M. Irvine pouvait \u00eatre maintenu en poste et promu.\n[46] Cependant, le cas de M. Irvine a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019attention du Dr Kafka, le m\u00e9decin-chef de la base. Le 7 f\u00e9vrier 1995, le Dr Kafka a examin\u00e9 le graphique de M. Irvine du point de vue de la ma\u00eetrise des facteurs de risque. Le Dr Kafka nourrissait des inqui\u00e9tudes au sujet de la portion G3. Il a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que M. Irvine \u00e9tait un ex-fumeur, que, m\u00eame s\u2019il avait beaucoup r\u00e9duit son poids apr\u00e8s son attaque cardiaque, il \u00e9tait encore plus lourd qu\u2019en 1990, et que son dernier test de cholest\u00e9rol indiquait des niveaux de cholest\u00e9rol plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s que ceux constat\u00e9s par le Dr Buchholtz en d\u00e9cembre 1994. Le Dr Kafka a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait recommand\u00e9 la cote G3 :\n[Traduction] pour un petit groupe de patients qui, apr\u00e8s avoir subi un pontage aortocoronarien, ne manifestaient aucun signe d\u2019isch\u00e9mie, avaient une maladie b\u00e9nigne et ma\u00eetrisaient extr\u00eamement bien leurs facteurs de risque. W.O. Irvine devra mieux contr\u00f4ler son r\u00e9gime alimentaire et abaisser ses niveaux de cholest\u00e9rol en prenant des m\u00e9dicaments.\nLe Dr Kafka estimait que si M. Irvine pouvait atteindre le niveau vis\u00e9 de cholest\u00e9rol LDL (2.6), il ne serait pas d\u00e9raisonnable de lui attribuer la cote G3. Cependant, cette opinion \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9misse que M. Irvine serait soumis \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation bas\u00e9e sur le test d\u2019effort Mibi et subirait une angiographie dans une autre ann\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, m\u00eame \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, le Dr Kafka \u00e9tait pr\u00eat, moyennant certaines conditions, \u00e0 attribuer la cote G3. Bien que subordonn\u00e9e au niveau de cholest\u00e9rol LDL de M. Irvine, au r\u00e9sultat qu\u2019il obtiendrait lors d\u2019une autre \u00e9preuve d\u2019effort sur tapis roulant (c.-\u00e0-d. un test Mibi) et \u00e0 une angiographie, l\u2019attribution de cette cote traduisait l\u2019opinion du propre m\u00e9decin des FAC. Ce point de vue indiquait qu\u2019on envisageait le maintien en poste de M. Irvine.\n[47] Le 4 juillet 1995, le Dr Buchholtz a observ\u00e9 une fois de plus que M. Irvine avait fait un [Traduction] excellent programme d\u2019exercice et qu\u2019il se faisait suivre par le service de di\u00e9to-th\u00e9rapie. Le niveau global de cholest\u00e9rol de M. Irvine avait baiss\u00e9, mais son niveau de cholest\u00e9rol LDL (un type particulier de cholest\u00e9rol) demeurait sup\u00e9rieur au niveau cible de 2.6. Le Dr Buchholtz a souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019opinion du Dr Kafka et convenu que la cote G4 serait justifi\u00e9e s\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de changements au niveau des facteurs de risque. Toutefois, il a not\u00e9 que M. Irvine faisait de l\u2019exercice et suivait son r\u00e9gime et il a \u00e9mis l\u2019opinion que, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il continuerait de s\u2019astreindre \u00e0 son programme d\u2019exercice et de diminuer ses risques, il serait apte \u00e0 accomplir toutes les activit\u00e9s et qu\u2019on pourrait lui attribuer la cote G3, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il pourrait servir dans un poste isol\u00e9 ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, le Dr Buchholtz, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019opinion du Dr Kafka et de donn\u00e9es m\u00e9dicales pr\u00e9cises, envisageait donc d\u2019attribuer \u00e0 M. Irvine la cote G3, compte tenu de son programme d\u2019exercice et de son r\u00e9gime alimentaire. En fait, le 11 juillet 1995, la cote g\u00e9ographique de M. Irvine a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9vis\u00e9e \u00e0 la hausse, passant \u00e0 G3O3 [Traduction] \u00e9tat m\u00e9dical exigeant une surveillance m\u00e9dicale \u00e9troite.\n[48] Par cons\u00e9quent, le chef, M\u00e9decine, et m\u00e9decin-conseil des FAC, le Dr Buchholtz, songeait \u00e0 attribuer \u00e0 M. Irvine la cote G3O3, sc\u00e9nario qui s\u2019est concr\u00e9tis\u00e9. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 cette cote, M. Irvine satisfaisait aux crit\u00e8res en mati\u00e8re d\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service et pouvait demeurer au sein des FAC.\n[49] Cependant, aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s, l\u2019officier de carri\u00e8re de M. Irvine a port\u00e9 son dossier \u00e0 l\u2019attention d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s des FAC et l\u2019attribution de sa cote m\u00e9dicale a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en veilleuse jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019examen de son dossier par le Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie \u00e0 la DSTSS. On a \u00e9tabli un nouveau formulaire de modification de cote sur lequel on a inscrit la cote G3O3 tout en pr\u00e9cisant que cette cote serait r\u00e9examin\u00e9e par le Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie.\n[50] Le 30 ao\u00fbt 1995, le Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie s\u2019est pench\u00e9 sur le dossier m\u00e9dical de M. Irvine. Il a not\u00e9 que le m\u00e9decin-conseil avait recommand\u00e9 la cote G4O3 tout en indiquant que la cote G3 pourrait \u00eatre attribu\u00e9e si son niveau de lipides baissait, et que le m\u00e9decin-chef de la base avait recommand\u00e9 la cote G3O3 (surveillance m\u00e9dicale \u00e9troite). Le Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie \u00e9tait donc confront\u00e9 \u00e0 deux cotes de restriction \u00e0 l\u2019emploi qui pouvaient s\u2019av\u00e9rer contradictoires : celle recommand\u00e9e par le Dr Buchholtz, le chef, M\u00e9decine, qui avait examin\u00e9 M. Irvine, et celle propos\u00e9e par le Dr Kafka, qui avait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un examen du dossier de M. Irvine. Il n\u2019existe gu\u00e8re de preuves, voire aucune preuve, que le Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie ait soigneusement tenu compte du fait que le Dr Kafka \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 recommander la cote G3 dans la mesure o\u00f9 l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 am\u00e9liorerait son niveau de cholest\u00e9rol LDL et se soumettrait \u00e0 un nouveau test d\u2019effort Mibi et \u00e0 une angiographie. Il n\u2019existe gu\u00e8re de preuves, voire aucune preuve, que le Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie ait soigneusement examin\u00e9 le degr\u00e9 de coh\u00e9rence entre les deux opinions et leurs assises respectives. Il n\u2019existe gu\u00e8re de preuves, voire aucune preuve, que le Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie ait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de prendre des mesures pour examiner la possibilit\u00e9 que M. Irvine puisse satisfaire aux exigences de la cote G3, envisag\u00e9e par ses propres m\u00e9decins. Le Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie a plut\u00f4t d\u00e9cid\u00e9, sommairement et arbitrairement, de l\u2019\u00e9valuer comme inapte \u00e0 servir dans deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments ou plus et recommand\u00e9 G4 comme cote m\u00e9dicale permanente.\n[51] En outre, tel que pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de 2001, cette d\u00e9cision du Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise conform\u00e9ment aux politiques m\u00e9dicales de 1979 des FAC sur l\u2019attribution des cotes [par. 13 \u00e0 19] et aux politiques transitoires [paragraphe 18]. Ces normes de 1979 et ces politiques transitoires ne pr\u00e9voyaient pas, en ce qui touche l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 et l\u2019attribution des cotes professionnelles, l\u2019approche individualis\u00e9e pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e par les lignes de conduite de septembre 1995 [paragraphes 20 \u00e0 26, 138, 139]. Les lignes de conduite de septembre 1995 pr\u00e9voyaient des consultations entre les employ\u00e9s des FAC relativement \u00e0 l\u2019attribution des cotes. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, elles pr\u00e9cisaient, en ce qui concerne les cas de coronaropathie, que les militaires atteints d\u2019ath\u00e9roscl\u00e9rose coronarienne ne devaient PAS tous n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre lib\u00e9r\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, les FAC, par le biais de leurs m\u00e9decins et de leurs politiques, reconnaissaient express\u00e9ment qu\u2019un groupe de malades atteints de coronaropathie pouvaient respecter l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service et \u00eatre maintenus en poste. De plus, les lignes de conduite de septembre 1995 pr\u00e9cisaient que, dans les cas de coronaropathie, de multiples facteurs serviraient \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer l\u2019ampleur de la maladie et la capacit\u00e9 fonctionnelle du membre, y compris les sept facteurs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au paragraphe 25 de ma d\u00e9cision initiale. J\u2019ai conclu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 suffisamment de preuves d\u00e9montrant que le Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie avait soigneusement tenu compte \u00e0 tout le moins de ces sept facteurs et plus particuli\u00e8rement du fait que M. Irvine ne manifestait pas de signes d\u2019isch\u00e9mie; qu\u2019il avait obtenu de bons r\u00e9sultats lors du test d\u2019effort sur tapis roulant et qu\u2019il aurait d\u00fb avoir l\u2019occasion de subir un autre test avant sa lib\u00e9ration, selon l\u2019\u00e9valuation conditionnelle pr\u00e9liminaire du Dr Kafka; que, m\u00eame s\u2019il pr\u00e9sentait un certain nombre de facteurs de risque, M. Irvine ne manifestait pas d\u2019autres signes comme l\u2019hypertension ou le diab\u00e8te. Il n\u2019existe pas non plus suffisamment de preuves que le Comit\u00e9 a fait mesurer la fraction d\u2019\u00e9jection de M. Irvine et a examin\u00e9 soigneusement les r\u00e9sultats, ce qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 utile pour d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 la fois sa capacit\u00e9 fonctionnelle et le risque de rechute, particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des r\u00e9sultats d\u2019un test d\u2019effort Mibi [paragraphes 93 \u00e0 95, 144 \u00e0 146]. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 suffisamment de preuves d\u00e9montrant que le Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie, dans sa d\u00e9cision du 30 ao\u00fbt 1995 et par la suite, s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 la norme d\u2019\u00e9valuation individualis\u00e9e la plus conciliante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des personnes atteintes de coronaropathie, soit celle \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans les lignes de conduite de septembre 1995. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 Meiorin, les FAC avaient l\u2019obligation d\u2019appliquer une norme plus conciliante ou la charge d\u2019expliquer de fa\u00e7on satisfaisante son omission \u00e0 appliquer l\u2019approche individualis\u00e9e pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e.\n[52] Par contraste, le Dr Buchholtz, se fondant sur sa propre \u00e9valuation de l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de M. Irvine, de m\u00eame que sur le suivi qu\u2019il avait fait, a envisag\u00e9 l\u2019attribution de la cote G3. Je constate que la d\u00e9cision du Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise de fa\u00e7on machinale et en fonction d\u2019impressions. Je maintiens les opinions que j\u2019ai exprim\u00e9es initialement aux paragraphes 143 \u00e0 150 de la d\u00e9cision de 2001 en ce qui concerne le facteur g\u00e9ographique. Compte tenu du point de vue du Dr Buchholtz, et pour toutes les raisons \u00e9nonc\u00e9es ci-dessus, je continue de croire que la d\u00e9cision du Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie \u00e9tait discriminatoire et fond\u00e9e sur un examen cursif et insuffisant du dossier de M. Irvine.\n[53] Tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 dans ma d\u00e9cision initiale, l\u2019examen en avril 1996 du dossier de M. Irvine par le Conseil de r\u00e9vision des carri\u00e8res n\u2019a pas permis de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la situation. Une fois de plus, le Conseil a simplement fait sienne la recommandation du Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie, l\u2019approuvant de fa\u00e7on machinale et attribuant \u00e0 M. Irvine une cote m\u00e9dicale permanente (G4O3). \u00c0 l\u2019instar du Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie, il a omis d\u2019obtenir une \u00e9valuation individualis\u00e9e \u00e0 jour, et ce, malgr\u00e9 le fait que les lignes de conduite de septembre 1995 \u00e9taient en vigueur [paragraphes 143 \u00e0 148].\n[54] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait valoir que ni l\u2019administration de tests additionnels ou diff\u00e9rents ni un d\u00e9lai suppl\u00e9mentaire n\u2019aurait r\u00e9duit ou \u00e9limin\u00e9 les risques inh\u00e9rents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat cardiaque de M. Irvine. Dans le contexte de la responsabilit\u00e9 des FAC en termes de discrimination, cet argument ne tient pas compte du fait que les FAC ont maintenu en poste un certain nombre d\u2019employ\u00e9s qui avaient subi un accident cardiaque, les jugeant aptes \u00e0 remplir des fonctions de combat. Les FAC \u00e9taient tenues de prendre avant la lib\u00e9ration de M. Irvine toutes les mesures possibles pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il pouvait faire partie de ce groupe. Le Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie aura d\u00fb se livrer \u00e0 tout le moins \u00e0 un examen minutieux des sept facteurs d\u00e9crits dans les lignes de conduite de septembre 1995, y compris l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la fraction d\u2019\u00e9jection, l\u2019\u00e9valuation de celle-ci \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des r\u00e9sultats d\u2019un test d\u2019effort Mibi et des consultations \u00e9troites avec ses propres m\u00e9decins, y compris le Dr Buchholtz. Dans le cadre de leur propre preuve, les FAC ont elles-m\u00eames reconnu que des tests suppl\u00e9mentaires, soit le test d\u2019effort Mibi et l\u2019angiogramme recommand\u00e9s par le Dr Kafka, auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 utiles au Comit\u00e9 de la coronaropathie. Dans le cas de M. Irvine, l\u2019\u00e9cart entre les cotes G3 et G4 \u00e9tait mince. Les FAC se devaient de prendre toutes les mesures possibles afin d\u2019\u00e9valuer de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable sa capacit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir avant sa lib\u00e9ration la cote G3 afin de satisfaire aux principes li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service. Il incombait aux FAC de d\u00e9montrer que M. Irvine se serait vraisemblablement vu attribuer la cote G4 si de telles mesures avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises. Compte tenu des faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je ne puis conclure que les FAC se sont acquitt\u00e9s de ce fardeau.\nIV. Conclusion [55] Pour tous les motifs cit\u00e9s, je maintiens ma conclusion selon laquelle les FAC ont d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 en cours d\u2019emploi M. Irvine, en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, dans le cadre des politiques mentionn\u00e9es qui s\u2019appliquaient \u00e0 lui \u00e0 titre de militaire atteint de coronaropathie, dans les \u00e9valuations m\u00e9dicales relatives \u00e0 son \u00e9tat et dans l\u2019attribution de ses restrictions \u00e0 l\u2019emploi. Les FAC \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es \u00e0 exiger que M. Irvine satisfasse aux principes de l\u2019universalit\u00e9 du service; en fait, chacune de leurs normes \u00e9tait bas\u00e9e sur l\u2019exigence voulant qu\u2019un membre soit apte \u00e0 \u00eatre un soldat d\u2019abord. Cependant, les FAC ont omis de prouver qu\u2019elles avaient appliqu\u00e9 ces m\u00eames normes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de M. Irvine de fa\u00e7on non discriminatoire. Elles ont donc omis de prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, l\u2019existence d\u2019une EPJ \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 7 ou de celle relevant de l\u2019article 10.\nV. Mesures de redressement [56] Comme je l\u2019ai fait dans ma d\u00e9cision de 2001, je m\u2019abstiens de me prononcer sur la question des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, mais je conserve ma comp\u00e9tence pour entendre une preuve \u00e0 ce sujet si les parties ne peuvent parvenir \u00e0 un consensus.\nSign\u00e9e par\nShirish P.
